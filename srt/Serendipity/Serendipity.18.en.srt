(Prince Yu Residence)

29
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,400
Prince Yu Residence?

30
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,230
Su Tangli, you're really something.

31
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,950
You managed to cling to Prince Yu!

32
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,000
I see it now.

33
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,790
It was you.

34
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,790
You stole my arrow,

35
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,920
tricked Zhang Song into finding it,

36
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,860
and got me caught in your trap.

37
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,870
It was a token of allegiance to Prince Yu.

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,400
Su Tangli, you vile, shameless woman!

39
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,430
Don't forget,

40
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,590
you're a mere commoner now.

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,960
Knowing that I serve Prince Yu,

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,710
you'd better show some respect

43
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,870
and never appear before me again.

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,630
Su Tangli, this isn't over!

45
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,590
By Prince Rui's order,

46
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,550
I can't leave the academy without permission.

47
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,080
Lady Su, mind your words.

48
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,870
Since His Highness arranged your leaving,

49
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,310
further questions

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,630
would be disrespectful.

51
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,400
Thank you for the reminder, Eunuch Lin.

52
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,940
(Liluo Pavilion)

53
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,470
Lady Su, you may enter.

54
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,920
My gratitude.

55
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,400
(Father,)

56
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,360
(I'll use Prince Yu's power to avenge you.)

57
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,750
(One day,)

58
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,040
(those who harmed you)

59
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,040
(will pay a hundredfold.)

60
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,520
Attendant,

61
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,920
escort Prince Yu to the changing room.

62
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,510
I'm a handyman from Songling Academy.

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,950
I've brought refreshments to Your Highness.

64
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,200
Let him in.

65
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,080
Proceed.

66
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,070
How could a teacup crack for no reason?

67
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,110
You

68
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,480
daringly schemed against me.

69
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,280
What punishment do you deserve?

70
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,560
I resorted to this reckless plan

71
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,070
because I heard whispers

72
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,830
of Your Highness's rivalry

73
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,390
with Prince Rui.

74
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,720
I'd like to pledge myself to your cause

75
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,680
and serve you.

76
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,270
I'm willing to recruit talents

77
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,130
regardless of convention.

78
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,070
But why should I

79
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,310
deem you worthy?

80
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,800
Moments ago, I...

81
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,040
I'll offer Your Highness

82
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,480
Marquis Yongqing's clan.

83
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,620
(Mingcheng Hall)

84
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,270
May I ask Eunuch Lin,

85
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,390
what taboos must I heed

86
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,040
regarding Prince Yu?

87
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,600
As one newly arrived,

88
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,680
I beg your guidance.

89
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,880
No need.

90
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,480
For your previous merits,

91
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,630
I'll give you a word of advice.

92
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,900
Do you know the auspicious sign

93
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,360
that marked His Highness's birth?

94
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,000
It's a well-known tale throughout the realm.

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,840
Remember,

96
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,360
it's a taboo.

97
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,560
I'll only say this.

98
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,480
You saw it?

99
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,720
Families have their laws

100
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,310
and households have their rules.

101
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,560
Transgressions demand punishment.

102
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,080
You're quite composed.

103
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,080
Leave us alone.

104
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,040
Yes.

105
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,240
Thank you for granting my wish,

106
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,200
Your Highness.

107
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,080
I remember you're

108
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,630
Su Changhua's daughter.

109
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,870
Raised on classics

110
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,480
and sages' teachings,

111
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,030
now you're offering yourself to my bed.

112
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,160
Correct?

113
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,550
Guess if I rejoice

114
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,270
or desire your destruction.

115
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,270
My admiration for Your Highness is true

116
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,630
and my request is equally so.

117
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,960
You may doubt my affection,

118
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,440
but why do you spurn my sincerity?

119
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,480
Less obsequious flattery than expected,

120
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,670
a prudent choice.

121
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,150
Yet there's one thing puzzling me.

122
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,870
Why do you align with me

123
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,000
over Prince Rui?

124
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,150
Can I grant

125
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,790
what he cannot?

126
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,390
The Xie Family is a supporter of Prince Rui,

127
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,960
yet when my father

128
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,080
was unjustly accused,

129
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,270
they stood idle.

130
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,870
Who knows if it wasn't Prince Rui's stance?

131
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,840
Now the family is in trouble,

132
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,320
but Prince Rui still does nothing.

133
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,440
Why would I pledge loyalty

134
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,550
to such a cold and ungrateful man?

135
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,790
Moreover, aligning with him

136
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,270
would force me

137
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,600
to endure Xie Xi's hypocrisy.

138
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,480
I'd rather remove this thorn

139
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,080
to pave the way for Your Highness.

140
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,270
So,

141
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,840
your allegiance

142
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,240
is a calculated ploy.

143
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,080
Your Highness.

144
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,480
Must you get to the bottom of it?

145
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
If I say

146
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,670
I place my faith in you

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,080
over Prince Rui,

148
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,870
will you ask more questions?

149
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,120
But I lack no women

150
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,870
who try to please me with their beauty.

151
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,600
To earn your place here,

152
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,270
you have to prove your worth.

153
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,680
I will not

154
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,080
disappoint you.

155
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,840
Mother.

156
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,870
With such big trouble,

157
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,670
why still cling to protocol to visit me?

158
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,240
You've worried me sick!

159
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,630
It's my fault

160
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,870
for making Mother worried.

161
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,630
But Prince Yu's spies infest the palace.

162
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,030
A single misstep

163
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,390
would draw censors' impeachment.

164
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,480
I'm afraid of implicating you, Mother.

165
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,630
Enough. Rise.

166
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,440
Why didn't you stand up for the Xie Family?

167
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,670
Losing the Minister of War

168
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,750
is a devastating blow.

169
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,230
Mother,

170
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
you must understand.

171
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,030
If I plead for them, it could

172
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,750
be seen as obstructing justice at best,

173
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,510
or forming a coterie

174
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,670
at worst.

175
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,600
Both are anathema to His Majesty

176
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,000
and exactly what Prince Yu wishes to see.

177
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,720
But will this not

178
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,030
chill their loyalty?

179
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,510
Mother,

180
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,590
don't worry.

181
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,510
My consort has taken charge

182
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,030
of reassuring them to prevent betrayal.

183
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,870
She is truly

184
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,200
a woman of scholarly lineage.

185
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,750
Her vision matches her grace.

186
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,630
It seems

187
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,550
I chose well

188
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,670
in your consort.

189
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,470
You've

190
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,390
been married for a while.

191
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,270
When will I hold my grandson?

192
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll try my best.

193
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,510
- Good.
- By the way,

194
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,600
the Spring Plowing Ceremony is coming.

195
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,480
I'll volunteer to make preparations

196
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,270
and make up for my recent failures.

197
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,150
I shall take my leave.

198
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:43,960
Sure.

199
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,920
Go ahead.

200
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,270
His Majesty has granted my request.

201
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,390
I'll leave town tomorrow.

202
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,240
Go back to make some preparations.

203
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,680
Yes.

204
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,480
How is

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,960
my consort lately?

206
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,750
Her Highness has been prudent in her duties.

207
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,630
All household affairs are in order.

208
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,480
At this hour,

209
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,270
if unoccupied,

210
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,790
she should be at Hualang Pavilion.

211
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,590
Lately,

212
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,270
she seems to leave early and return late,

213
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,270
rarely crossing paths

214
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,110
with me.

215
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,150
Is she avoiding me?

216
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,870
Is she?

217
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I was drunk.

218
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,870
How could you take advantage of me?

219
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,080
If you hadn't

220
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,550
clung to me all night,

221
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,600
I'd never have stayed.

222
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,670
Even so,

223
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,080
you were sober at the time,

224
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,960
yet you still broke our wedding vows.

225
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,240
It's hardly noble conduct.

226
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,560
Fine.

227
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,630
The blame falls on me now.

228
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,840
Never do this again.

229
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,440
Now leave at once, Your Highness.

230
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,710
I...

231
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,420
Drinking is harmful to the body.

232
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,750
You'd better drink less from now on.

233
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,750
Rest assured.

234
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,840
I'll never drink again.

235
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,120
Before departing the city,

236
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,790
I must personally

237
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,070
instruct my consort on household affairs.

238
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,680
I should meet her

239
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,350
before leaving.

240
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,590
Follow me to Hualang Pavilion.

241
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,630
Yes.

242
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,940
(Hualang Pavilion)

243
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,630
What's this?

244
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,950
Mr. Lu.

245
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,800
Cousin?

246
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,320
What are you hiding?

247
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,830
Don't think I don't know

248
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,270
it's the hairpin you had custom-made.

249
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,510
You've adored the lotus since childhood.

250
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,310
The lotus hairpin

251
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,030
is clearly for a sweetheart.

252
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,880
Tell me, which young lady is she?

253
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
The food is ready. Let's eat.

254
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,440
- Take your seats.
- Sit.

255
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,350
Today's feast is,

256
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,350
first of all, to celebrate Wen'an

257
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,550
joining Hualang Pavilion.

258
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,590
Secondly,

259
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,550
I'd like to thank Buddy and Qingzhao

260
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,480
for helping me in the academy.

261
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,880
Finally, by Consort Rui's

262
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,030
special request,

263
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,830
we must toast with tea instead of wine.

264
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,550
Let's raise our cups.

265
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
What a lively gathering!

266
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,160
Do you mind if I join your feast?

267
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,550
No need for formalities.

268
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,590
Today,

269
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,790
I attend merely as family.

270
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,880
Speak freely, all of you.

271
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,200
His Highness is occupied with state affairs.

272
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,480
He must have passed by.

273
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,160
He'll leave after greeting us.

274
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,440
Darling, you're wrong.

275
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,920
I came here specially

276
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,350
to see how my consort spends her days.

277
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,840
Shujun,

278
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,640
ask His Highness to take a seat.

279
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,320
Oh, right.

280
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,480
Please sit, Your Highness.

281
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,070
All of you, be seated.

282
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,870
Sit.

283
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,720
Shujun,

284
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,640
what food does His Highness favor?

285
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,880
I'll prepare more.

286
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,430
He...

287
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,270
He favors steamed perch,

288
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,270
pancake soup, cold mixed three delicacies,

289
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,510
and

290
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,950
bean curd stew.

291
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,880
That should be enough, right?

292
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,630
I didn't expect

293
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,160
my consort to care about me so much

294
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,720
that she knew

295
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,200
all my favorite foods.

296
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,350
How fortunate I am

297
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,830
to have such a wife.

298
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,550
We are not married yet.

299
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,350
Must you two flaunt affection before us?

300
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,790
Have mercy!

301
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,200
Then let's eat.

302
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,030
Let's eat.

303
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,160
- Eat. Eat.
- Eat.

304
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,280
Shujun.

305
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,190
That night,

306
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,270
it was my fault for thoughtlessness.

307
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,480
I apologize.

308
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,160
Let's just let it go

309
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
and never mention it again.

310
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,290
Please feel free, Your Highness.

311
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,750
I need to see Shujun.

312
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,760
Mingshu,

313
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,110
it's almost tidied up.

314
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,240
May I have a word with you in the courtyard?

315
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,280
The courtyard? Regarding what?

316
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,350
Mr. Song,

317
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,200
care for a game?

318
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,110
I need to help Mingshu tidy up.

319
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,240
Prince Rui seems unoccupied.

320
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,640
Why don't you ask him?

321
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,790
It doesn't matter. I'll help as well.

322
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,480
What's the rush to tidy?

323
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,880
I can manage it alone.

324
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,880
Lu Chang,

325
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,000
I hear you excel in martial arts.

326
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,720
May I ask you a question?

327
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,320
What is it?

328
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,920
The move, Parting Grass to Seek the Snake,

329
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,160
could you teach me?

330
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,160
Mingshu.

331
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,790
As for that move, we must involve Mr. Song.

332
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,310
He's unmatched in it.

333
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
Mr. Song, let's demonstrate for her.

334
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,560
Hurry.

335
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,040
Come on!

336
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,310
Come. Quickly.

337
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,200
County Princess Wen'an. Come.

338
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,240
We'll explain it properly.

339
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,960
Shopkeeper, this is my first visit.

340
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
I want to buy a hairpin.

341
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,200
What would you recommend?

342
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,320
I?

343
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,950
Shopkeeper,

344
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,430
she's asking you a question.

345
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,350
You...

346
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,960
What style

347
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,880
do you want?

348
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,920
Something beautiful.

349
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,000
Beautiful.

350
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,760
Something beautiful.

351
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,320
This is the one.

352
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,200
Why do you recommend this?

353
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,790
It's the same style as Consort Rui's.

354
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,400
Wearing it will make you outshine all others

355
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
and unforgettable to behold.

356
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,510
If Hualang Pavilion requires funds,

357
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,880
draw freely from my treasury,

358
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,270
no need to consult me.

359
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,480
Thank you for your generosity.

360
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,550
But Hualang Pavilion

361
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,110
was my venture before our marriage.

362
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,110
I'd rather keep it separate.

363
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,200
As you please.

364
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,040
Tomorrow,

365
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,920
I'll go oversee the Spring Plowing Ceremony.

366
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,430
The household

367
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,590
is in your care.

368
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,750
So abruptly?

369
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,350
Rest assured, Your Highness.

370
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,310
I'll uphold my duties.

371
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,550
Have some rest, Shujun.

372
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,910
Your Highness,

373
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,880
the spring chill still lingers.

374
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,400
Take extra garments

375
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,440
to ward off the cold.

376
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,560
Yes.

377
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,480
Thank you for your concern.

378
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,880
You've grown more attentive

379
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
to His Highness lately.

380
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,980
(Yinyan Pavilion)

381
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,350
Mrs. Li.

382
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,590
- My daughter-in-law...
- Careful.

383
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,790
You're finally back.

384
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,680
Your husband is home.

385
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,920
He's waiting for you.

386
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,240
Husband?

387
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,630
Look.

388
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,920
He's not leaving this time.

389
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,270
Come here.

390
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,240
Madam Zeng.

391
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,590
It's you?

392
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,870
Son,

393
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,310
you rarely return home.

394
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,030
Spend more time with your wife.

395
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,200
I'm looking forward to a grandson.

396
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,280
Madam Zeng,

397
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,960
Mrs. Li's mind wanders.

398
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,550
Don't mind her words.

399
00:26:59,030 --> 00:26:59,880
It's alright.

400
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,960
I understand her state.

401
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,400
Mrs. Li,

402
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,430
look,

403
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,510
you've mistaken me again.

404
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,830
I'm not your daughter-in-law.

405
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,510
But your son is filial

406
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,640
and mellow.

407
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,000
He'll fulfill your wish soon.

408
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,240
Good, good.

409
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,550
Mrs. Li's deceased son

410
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,480
was my comrade-in-arms.

411
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,480
I came to visit her

412
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,310
on his behalf.

413
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,200
I hired two caretakers

414
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,240
for her before,

415
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,480
but her illness

416
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,510
made her muddled

417
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,350
and she drove them away.

418
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,440
Madam Zeng,

419
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,110
why are you here?

420
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,480
We're neighbors.

421
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,200
Seeing her

422
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,030
live alone pitifully,

423
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,070
I check on her from time to time.

424
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,310
So you've been

425
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,350
caring for her

426
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,190
all this time.

427
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,590
You're so kind-hearted.

428
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,430
I shall

429
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
thank you again.

430
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,640
You flattered me. It's a trivial matter,

431
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,750
no need for gratitude.

432
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,920
I haven't properly thanked you yet

433
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,030
for driving the villain away last time.

434
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,110
It was nothing.

435
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,440
Let's speak no more of it.

436
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,080
Buddy,

437
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,240
lower your head.

438
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,670
What's this?

439
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,880
A prayer charm,

440
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,160
to secure your exam success.

441
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,210
Exam success hinges on charms?

442
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,550
I raced to Daxiangguo Temple in the morning

443
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,640
and snatched it

444
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,510
from a horde of housewives.

445
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,720
It took me a lot of effort.

446
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
(Heaven Rewards Diligence)

447
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,560
For luck.

448
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,520
Tuck it here.

449
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
Thanks a lot, my dear young lady.

450
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,000
Mr. Lu, is Mingshu here?

451
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,700
Qingzhao.

452
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,580
Mr. Song.

453
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,590
You came at the perfect time.

454
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,830
Look what I brought you.

455
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,270
Prayer charm from Daxiangguo Temple?

456
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,920
It's a rare treasure.

457
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,510
Thank you, Mingshu.

458
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,640
You're welcome. I'm glad you like it.

459
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,720
I...

460
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,270
Buddy, don't take it off!

461
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,920
Even for the sake of reassuring me,

462
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,760
you should wear it.

463
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,190
Keep it on.

464
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,310
This way, it will be unique.

465
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,480
Mr. Lu,

466
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,000
I need

467
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,200
a private word with Mingshu.

468
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,440
What's so secret that I can't hear?

469
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,440
Buddy, just guard the door.

470
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,880
There won't be misunderstandings.

471
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,200
Just go.

472
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,240
Don't look at anything improper.

473
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,030
I'm her elder brother.

474
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,070
In fact, I had this hairpin custom-made

475
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,480
as a gift to you.

476
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,350
This is too extravagant.

477
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,760
I remember

478
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,880
when your brother suggested

479
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,510
that you took me as your sworn brother,

480
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,280
you said

481
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,590
we'd better remain confidants.

482
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,880
If you truly hold me as one,

483
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,000
don't refuse it.

484
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,070
(Even if Qingzhao is Mr. Green Robe,)

485
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,750
(during our time together,)

486
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,480
(I've felt no stirrings of the heart.)

487
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,340
(With the Metropolitan Exam approaching,)

488
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,300
(I shouldn't unsettle him now.)

489
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
(I'll return the hairpin)

490
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,830
(when the time is right.)

491
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,110
I'll accept it, then.

492
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,680
Thank you, Qingzhao.

493
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,320
(I'll tell you my feelings)

494
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
(after taking the exam,)

495
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,400
(when everything)

496
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,440
(is settled.)

497
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,520
Young Master!

498
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,190
Mr. Lu,

499
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,720
have you seen my master?

500
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,270
Buddy, Qingzhao,

501
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,870
I still have business at Hualang Pavilion.

502
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,760
I shall take my leave.

503
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,150
Buddy!

504
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,800
Mr. Lu.

505
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,180
The spring exam is approaching,

506
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,440
and the academy will soon recess.

507
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,400
We can take our books and belongings home.

508
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,720
How about I give you a ride?

509
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,480
The academy has arranged my carriage.

510
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,440
I appreciate your offer, Mr. Song.

511
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,960
Mr. Lu claims me as a friend

512
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,750
and trusts my character,

513
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,590
but why does he always keep me

514
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,580
from getting close to Mingshu?

515
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,040
True.

516
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,240
Your future brother-in-law

517
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,350
gets his sister on a short leash.

518
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,640
Make way!

519
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,190
Make way!

520
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,060
My leg!

521
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,300
(Qian Si)

522
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,350
My leg!

523
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,720
My leg!

524
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,480
My leg is broken!

525
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,510
You tried to run me over and kill me!

526
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:15,000
Everyone, his injury isn't my doing.

527
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,880
- A physician will prove it.
- It was you!

528
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,400
There's a medical clinic up ahead.

529
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,660
Would someone kindly

530
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,920
fetch a physician?

531
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,760
I'll go!

532
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,240
Move aside. Move aside.

533
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,000
What's going on?

534
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,240
It's him!

535
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,120
He sped his carriage

536
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,920
like mad without looking
where he was going.

537
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,240
Then he ran over my leg and broke it.

538
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,160
Sir, please investigate thoroughly.

539
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,720
I've already sent for a physician.

540
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,510
Truth lies in the evidence.

541
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,350
Investigating cases is the yamen's duty.

542
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,830
You don't get to interfere!

543
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,310
You hurt a pedestrian

544
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,200
through reckless driving.

545
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,240
This is intentional assault.

546
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,530
- Guards, arrest him!
- Yes!

547
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,590
You neither examined the injury

548
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,470
nor investigated the case.

549
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,430
How can you convict me?

550
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,590
The scene remains untouched.

551
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,890
It's the perfect time for investigation.

552
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,840
Why don't you do it?

553
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:58,950
Take him away!

554
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,950
You!

555
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,750
(Prosperous People, Wealthy Nation)
Slow down.

556
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,960
Slow down.

557
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,910
Move.

558
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,630
Behave!

559
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,760
How can you jail someone

560
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,920
without inquiry?

561
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,070
Where is the victim?

562
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,840
Did you let a physician examine his injury?

563
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,230
The street teems with witnesses.

564
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,390
What more do we have to investigate?

565
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,000
It's preposterous for you

566
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,390
to do this in Liangzhou Prefecture.

567
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,440
I demand to see Governor Jia!

568
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,870
Enough!

569
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,510
It's spring plowing season.

570
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,230
The Court craves stability.

571
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,480
Escalate this, and you'll suffer.

572
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,720
Move!

573
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,280
(There's something fishy.)

574
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,320
(I'd better think about)

575
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,510
(how to save myself.)

576
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,180
(Frank and Righteous)

577
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,590
What's the use of brilliance?

578
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,840
If you offend the powerful,

579
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,440
your chances of success may crumble.

580
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,280
You've done a good job.

581
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,920
When I write back,

582
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,360
I'll put in a good word for you.

583
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,400
It's my duty

584
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,230
to serve Governor Jia.

585
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,980
(Please secure Lu Chang's conviction.)

586
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,600
What?

587
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
Is my brother in jail?

588
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,800
Charged with reckless driving and assaulting.

589
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,440
He's always meticulous

590
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,360
and well-versed in the law.

591
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,880
How could he make such a mistake?

592
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,030
Something's amiss.

593
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,710
Mr. Ying, you serve in the yamen.

594
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,960
Can you visit him and ask him in person?

595
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,550
I tried.

596
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,000
But Governor Jia has issued a strict order

597
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,070
forbidding all prison visits.

598
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,800
This is outrageous!

599
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,670
At Songling Academy,

600
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,440
Lu Chang earned the two princes' favor.

601
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,320
Probably, Governor Jia is jealous of him.

602
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,190
This is retaliation.

603
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,800
How could he?

604
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,990
The spring exam is around the corner.

605
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,070
He can't miss it.

606
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,710
A conviction would

607
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,840
strip his chances of success

608
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,400
and bar him from future attempts.

609
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,800
Mother mustn't learn of this.

610
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,840
Mingshu, don't worry.

611
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,150
You still have us, right?

612
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,920
I've asked my father to make inquiries.

613
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,000
We'll act once we learn more.

614
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,710
Others turn to Hualang Pavilion in crisis,

615
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,680
but why did you

616
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,230
forget to turn to your good friends?

617
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,230
I've decided.

618
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,630
Instead of waiting,

619
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,800
it's better to take the initiative.

620
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,290
Our priority

621
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,710
is to see my brother,

622
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,230
uncover the full story,

623
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,800
then take targeted actions.

624
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,840
I'll join you

625
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,760
even if we have to barge in.

626
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,110
They'll yield

627
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:44,950
to the Duke's prestige.

628
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,650
Officer,

629
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,360
we're here to visit Lu Chang.

630
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,390
No way.

631
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,190
Why are you here again?

632
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,030
Didn't I say visits are banned?

633
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,280
Bro,

634
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,360
we both serve in the yamen.

635
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,550
Show some flexibility.

636
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,800
Definitely not.

637
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,100
(Residence of Duke of the State)

638
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,240
Duke of the State?

639
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,230
If Governor Jia blames you,

640
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,880
we'll take the consequences.

641
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,550
Now, tell me again,

642
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,440
can we go in or not?

643
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,780
Yes,

644
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,640
but

645
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,190
only one.

646
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,990
I'll go.

647
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,510
Buddy.

648
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,030
Mingshu.

649
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,480
Buddy, how are you?

650
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,510
I'm fine. Don't worry.

651
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,800
With the prayer charm you gave me,

652
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,880
I'll turn danger into safety.

653
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,590
Mingshu, your time here is limited.

654
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,150
I'll tell you quickly.

655
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,070
First of all, I'm sure

656
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,590
I didn't hit anyone.

657
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,070
This is a frame-up.

658
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,550
Secondly,

659
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,510
the inspector arrived instantly,

660
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,400
but he refused to examine the injury.

661
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,800
Thirdly,

662
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,280
Governor Jia condemned me

663
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,320
without reviewing the evidence.

664
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,000
Are you saying someone framed you?

665
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,190
I'm not certain

666
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,190
who it is yet.

667
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,000
Could it be those from Jianglin?

668
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:04,950
Unlikely.

669
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,320
To expose their true purpose,

670
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,630
we must force Governor Jia to reopen the case.

671
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,550
Fraud always

672
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,480
leaves traces.

673
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,840
If we scour every detail, we'll...

674
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,000
This isn't difficult. Do as I say.

675
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,670
Find the man who claimed to be hit.

676
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,630
With so many witnesses,

677
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,760
it shouldn't be hard.

678
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,510
Once you find him, sue him immediately

679
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,400
and force Jia to examine his injury in court.

680
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,440
What if the man refuses?

681
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,640
It doesn't matter.

682
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,800
My innocence

683
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,920
will prevail in court.

684
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,510
Just follow my plan.

685
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,630
It's the fastest way to clear my name.

686
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,110
Don't worry, Buddy.

687
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,550
With even the slightest possibility,
I'll chase every thread.

688
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,200
Sorry for troubling you.

689
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,710
As long as you're safe,

690
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,760
none of this matters.

691
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,000
Deputy Censor Song, a moment.

692
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,190
Governor Jia?

693
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,240
Mr. Song,

694
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,800
today, I have a case

695
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,110
to discuss

696
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,000
with you.

697
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,190
I am but a humble official

698
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,190
in the Court's deputy role.

699
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,960
How could I presume to advise you?

700
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,440
Lu Chang, the Jianglin Prefectural Graduate,

701
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,030
is jailed for reckless driving.

702
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,590
Your son wielded your family's token

703
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,550
to escort his sister for a prison visit

704
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,590
and was very protective of them.

705
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Is Lu Chang

706
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,480
a guest of honor

707
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,920
to your family?

708
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,070
My unworthy son

709
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,030
just cherishes his classmates

710
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,400
and cares for a friend.

711
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,200
Governor Jia,

712
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,670
proceed with the case unhindered.

713
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,190
My family

714
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,800
has nothing to do with it.

715
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,800
I see.

716
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,000
Then I can rest assured.

717
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,720
Farewell.

718
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,190
The Lu siblings?

719
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,880
If we get Qian Si

720
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,070
and prove that his injury

721
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,280
wasn't my brother's doing,

722
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,920
we may clear his name.

723
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,880
We must find a physician

724
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,400
to examine his injury.

725
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,550
Don't worry too much.

726
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,440
As long as we don't abandon any lead,

727
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,920
we'll be able to clear Mr. Lu's name.

728
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,440
(He has no relation to us,)

729
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,070
(yet he cares about us so much)

730
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,190
(and rushes about helping us.)

731
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,960
(Look how dusty and weary he is.)

732
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,150
But trying to get Qian Si

733
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,630
without any preparation,

734
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,030
how can we succeed?

735
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,280
Mr. Ying,

736
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,670
how about you pretend to be a physician?

737
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,350
I?

738
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,640
- Madam Qian!
- Who is it?

739
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,680
Madam Qian!

740
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,800
Who is it?

741
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,510
Madam Qian,

742
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,070
we live in Left Alley

743
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,910
and are new to the capital.

744
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,400
Is Brother Qian injured?

745
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,550
My brother specializes in bone injuries.

746
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,960
Let him help.

747
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,670
Guaranteed cure at a fair price.

748
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,360
Who's your Brother Qian?

749
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,480
What kind of quacks are you?

750
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,840
No need. We've already seen a physician.

751
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,710
My brother is skilled.

752
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,880
Give him a chance to prove it!

753
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,230
Don't try to cotton up to me.

754
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,960
I know what you're up to.

755
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,590
Madam Qian! Madam...

756
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,590
They're dead set on not letting us in,

757
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,880
clearly trying to cover it up.

758
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,280
We can't risk tipping them off

759
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
or forcing our way in.

760
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,190
What should we do now?
