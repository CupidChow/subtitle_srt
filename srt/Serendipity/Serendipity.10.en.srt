Buddy.

Is that you?

00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,630
Buddy!

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,030
Is that you?

32
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,470
(What's going on?)

33
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,560
(Am I losing my mind?)

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,310
Aren't you ready yet?

35
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,080
Patience, my lord.

36
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,520
I'm ready now.

37
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,630
You seem to be in a good mood today.

38
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,750
The Shuisheng Powder is tasteless,

39
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,870
inducing truth-telling in twilight sleep,

40
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,630
yet memories fade upon waking.

41
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,680
Where is my brother now?

42
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,720
You've been cooped up here for days.

43
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,270
I brought you food from Longfeng Restaurant.

44
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,600
(Yaji Hall)
Ring cake, osmanthus cake,

45
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,680
and chestnut crisp,

46
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,920
all my favorites.

47
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,270
Mr. Song, you're so kind.

48
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,030
Slow down.

49
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,190
If you keep coming in like this

50
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,390
and get seen by others,

51
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
aren't you afraid

52
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,630
that it will damage your noble reputation?

53
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,390
Even if word gets out,

54
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,720
as told in love tales,

55
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,630
I'm risking everything for love.

56
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,120
In my opinion,

57
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,510
it's an honor, not a shame.

58
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,630
It's something I've been longing for.

59
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,720
You truly are a man

60
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
of loyalty and responsibility.

61
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
Lady Mingshu,

62
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,600
not everything I said that day

63
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,270
was an act.

64
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,630
If I love someone,

65
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,120
I'll marry her regardless of her status

66
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,920
or background.

67
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,680
I'll cherish her, protect her,

68
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,510
and never waver under others' judgment.

69
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,460
(Yaji Hall)

70
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,630
I wonder which young lady

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,070
will be so lucky to have you.

72
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,640
- Actually, that young lady...
- You are here.

73
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,160
Hello, Mr. Song.

74
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,390
Mr. Song brought snacks!

75
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,230
Come on.

76
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,560
Sit down.

77
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,790
Try this.

78
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,390
Thank you, Mr. Song.

79
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,510
But this place is too public.

80
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,600
You should visit less frequently.

81
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,310
It's no big deal just to bring some food.

82
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,600
We're here under borrowed identities.

83
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,750
Your noble status

84
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,600
draws attention.

85
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,560
Don't you agree?

86
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,510
You're right.

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,040
I wasn't considerate.

88
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,440
I've made up my mind.

89
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,870
I'll join your plan.

90
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,750
Lu Wencai did deceive me.

91
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,240
He got the jade pendant from somewhere

92
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,630
and set a trap for me.

93
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,240
I was such a fool

94
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,600
to believe him.

95
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,600
Have you found any leads

96
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,510
about your brother?

97
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,160
He couldn't make it clear either,

98
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,240
and then he couldn't say anything more.

99
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,520
Since you've agreed

100
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,390
to testify against Lu Wencai at the Banquet,

101
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,070
we'll stop

102
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,680
hiding the truth from you.

103
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,120
So the story of childhood sweethearts

104
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,830
and drifting performers

105
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,190
are all lies?

106
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,470
Yes.

107
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,190
We assumed false identities to come here

108
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
to gather information on your father.

109
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Based on my speculation,

110
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,920
his false accusation of Mr. Su's embezzlement

111
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,720
was very likely coerced.

112
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,630
What do you plan to do?

113
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,190
Mr. Su's conviction was directly tied

114
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,390
to your father's testimony.

115
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,920
If your father was coerced

116
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,040
into exile and death,

117
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,870
don't you want to know the truth?

118
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,070
Of course I do.

119
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,680
But scraping by is hard enough.

120
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,950
How can I find out the truth?

121
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,240
Don't worry.

122
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll definitely find it out.

123
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,870
If we can prove

124
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,150
that your father was forced,

125
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,030
your sentences may be reduced.

126
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,130
You may get rid of the slave status.

127
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,870
Then,

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,480
you could leave the Imperial Music Office,

129
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,720
and your brother needn't hide anymore.

130
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,320
I believe that you're all good people.

131
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,790
Since you're trying to help me,

132
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,320
I should give you something in return

133
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,870
and tell you everything I know.

134
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,030
Thank you, Lady Yuanying.

135
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,200
My brother and I lived in our hometown

136
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,030
until a year ago

137
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,910
when we were suddenly abducted.

138
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,440
I don't know who they were,

139
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,390
but I overheard them

140
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,200
threatening my father with our lives

141
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,240
to do something.

142
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,840
I'm not sure

143
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,150
what it was.

144
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,910
Did your father comply?

145
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Now I realize

146
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,320
it must've been about framing Mr. Su.

147
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,390
The kidnappers released us,

148
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,270
but before we could escape far,

149
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,870
the government officers showed up.

150
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,080
I drew them off so my brother could flee.

151
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,960
But I was caught

152
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,750
and condemned to be a government slave.

153
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,840
Then I learned my father had been convicted

154
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,150
and my brother vanished without a trace.

155
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,750
Rest assured,

156
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,440
my brother will investigate this thoroughly.

157
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,390
There is still a long way to go.

158
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,630
We must plan for the long term.

159
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,510
First, break away from Lu Wencai's control.

160
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,510
What do you need me to do?

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,480
Come on. Please.

162
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,600
- Mr. Song.
- Mr. Song.

163
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,440
Mr. Song.

164
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,870
This way, please.

165
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,790
- Mr. Song.
- Mr. Song.

166
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,750
Mr. Song.

167
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,670
Dear Qingzhao,

168
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,750
your presence honors my humble house.

169
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,030
You flatter me, Minister Lu.

170
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,120
I don't deserve such praise.

171
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,720
(Mengying Pavilion)

172
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,270
Only Minister Lu

173
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,600
could summon the Duke's legitimate grandson.

174
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,720
Come on, let's raise our cups.

175
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,750
Everyone,

176
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,840
since my son begins his official career,

177
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,870
he is a colleague of yours now.

178
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,720
(Lu Zegang)
May you guide him well.

179
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,600
With pleasure, Minister Lu.

180
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,440
Come on.

181
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,280
- Please sit.
- Please.

182
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,290
- Sit.
- Please.

183
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,160
Minister Lu,

184
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,200
I heard that tonight,

185
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,840
Liu Yuanying, the famous dancer,

186
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,480
will perform the Flying Dance.

187
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,480
We are eagerly looking forward to it.

188
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,840
Patience, gentlemen.

189
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,160
Behold!

190
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,260
(Mengying Pavilion)

191
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,390
(Mengying Pavilion)
Brilliant!

192
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,860
Not bad.

193
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,480
There she is.

194
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,630
Look.

195
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,060
(Mengying Pavilion)

196
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,360
Lady Yuanying lives up to her reputation.

197
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,910
Her crimson sleeves

198
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,120
weep tales of grievance.

199
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,240
The Flying Dance is really a rare sight.

200
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,270
- Wonderful.
- A true marvel of the capital!

201
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,600
Seeing is believing.

202
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,440
Indeed.

203
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,670
She endures

204
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,480
life's cruelties alone.

205
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,390
What heartache

206
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,150
lies beneath her smile?

207
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,030
It doesn't sound right.

208
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,240
It seems like complaints about grievances.

209
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,960
Great!

210
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,970
Come on, a toast.

211
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,600
Her silk dress

212
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,150
is soaked in tears.

213
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,600
Goodness.

214
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,750
Why is Lady Yuanying

215
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,080
covered in bruises?

216
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,830
There really are injuries!

217
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,750
You've stayed in the mansion these days.

218
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,080
How did you get hurt?

219
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,040
Madam!

220
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,080
What's wrong?

221
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,510
There's trouble at the Banquet!

222
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,860
(Mengying Pavilion)

223
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,600
Since Lady Yuanying is injured,

224
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,750
escort her to rest and recover.

225
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,870
Steward Wang,

226
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,910
fetch a physician to examine her thoroughly.

227
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,030
Yes, Master.

228
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,120
Minister Lu,

229
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,160
it's inappropriate.

230
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,480
(Mengying Pavilion)

231
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,320
Liu Yuanying is a government slave.

232
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,700
Any incident involving her

233
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,550
requires investigation and documentation.

234
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,600
Since this occurred at the Lu Residence,

235
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,240
failure to clarify it

236
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,550
would imply negligence on your part.

237
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
Lady Yuanying,

238
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,120
if you fail to make it clear

239
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,700
and stain the reputation of the Lu Family,

240
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,080
can you bear the consequences?

241
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,750
Lady Yuanying,

242
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,360
every dignitary here

243
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,510
serves as a pillar of the state.

244
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,600
Who of them can't uphold justice for you?

245
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,120
The Investigating Censor is here too.

246
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,550
Mr. Chen,

247
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,630
what does the law dictate?

248
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,910
If a slave is harmed during service,

249
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,510
the authorities must pursue accountability.

250
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Is it related to you?

251
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,750
Absolutely not.

252
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,320
Well, in that case,

253
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,910
Lady Yuanying, you should speak plainly.

254
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,200
We'll definitely

255
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,960
give you an explanation.

256
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,440
It's the young master of Lu.

257
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,240
Unbelievable!

258
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,340
Indeed. Unbelievable.

259
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,270
During our stay at the mansion for rehearsal,

260
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,390
he sneaked into my room, raped me,

261
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,960
and abused me.

262
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,720
(Mengying Pavilion)

263
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,510
I never touched you!

264
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,960
How could I rape you?

265
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,120
Father, this is slander!

266
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,440
Stop telling lies!

267
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,360
With so many dignitaries here,

268
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,840
how dear I lie?

269
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,240
It's the young master of the Lu.

270
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,480
During our stay for rehearsal,

271
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,320
he sneaked into my room,

272
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,440
raped me, and abused me.

273
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,270
You're spouting false accusations!

274
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,000
You and Mr. Lu have conflicting accounts.

275
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,400
Lack of proof

276
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,590
will condemn you for false accusations.

277
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,400
But how can I prove it?

278
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,960
I know the location of Mr. Lu's birthmark.

279
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,790
There is a black birthmark

280
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,400
below his buttocks.

281
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,520
Stop being panicking.

282
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,110
She is lying!

283
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,350
Everyone,

284
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,350
I don't have such a birthmark.

285
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,760
You're just in time.

286
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,040
Everyone,

287
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,310
this is my wife, Lady Wang.

288
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,440
Darling, tell everyone

289
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,000
this lowly servant is slandering me.

290
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,320
After all this,

291
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,830
are you still going to twist truths

292
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and mislead the crowd?

293
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,520
Hear that?

294
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,070
You're twisting truths

295
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,240
and misleading the crowd!

296
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,680
I'm talking about you, Lu Wencai.

297
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,030
Every word Lady Yuanying spoke is true.

298
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,200
Disgraceful wretch!

299
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,550
Raping a government slave

300
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,160
is nothing to Mr. Lu.

301
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,750
Two years ago,

302
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,750
Xiangyun, Madam's maid,

303
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,830
was raped by him and became pregnant.

304
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,200
Even during her pregnancy, Mr. Lu

305
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,110
abused her until she miscarried and died.

306
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,160
Two lives were lost!

307
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,910
Here.

308
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,880
This is Xiangyun's coroner's report,

309
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,310
bearing Liangzhou Prefecture' seal.

310
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,480
When I heard that you raped Lady Yuanying,

311
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,440
I felt indignant

312
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,240
and investigated discreetly at the mansion.

313
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,440
With this evidence,

314
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,880
what do you have to say?

315
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,390
Everyone,

316
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,240
Xiangyun was my maid,

317
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,960
and I can also testify to this.

318
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,320
Lu Wencai,

319
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,480
over the years,

320
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,270
how many women have you defiled?

321
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,830
You dare to do it but not admit it.

322
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,750
You're worse than a beast!

323
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,640
You lowly woman,

324
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,030
how dare you betray me!

325
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,440
Lu Wencai, I'm going to divorce you!

326
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,590
You!

327
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,240
Minister Lu,

328
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,030
your son's acts

329
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,400
violate multiple statutes of our dynasty.

330
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,240
How do you answer?

331
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,350
Qingzhao, you're exaggerating.

332
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,920
There may be misunderstandings.

333
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,960
According to Da'an Codex,

334
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,720
officials committing minor indiscretions
during banquets or social engagements

335
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,400
require ten years

336
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,750
of unblemished conduct
before reconsideration for service.

337
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,060
Your son's crime of soliciting prostitutes
making him disqualified for service.

338
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,540
Anyone who commits adultery shall be
sentenced to 18 months of imprisonment.

339
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,110
Ravishing Xiangyun
is his second crime of rape.

340
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,590
Causing Xiangyun and her fetus's death

341
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,960
is his third crime.

342
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,750
Minister Lu, are you trying

343
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,070
to bend the law for personal gain?

344
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,720
You overstepped!

345
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,240
You're just a humble Qin player.

346
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,030
You don't get the right to speak here!

347
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,520
True.

348
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,880
As a humble Qin player, even I know

349
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,720
the law's authority is not to be defied.

350
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,880
Minister Lu, as a third-rank official,

351
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,960
how could you not know this?

352
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,200
This proves

353
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,680
you knowingly broke the law,

354
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,000
covering up for your son.

355
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,790
Does this not compound your crime?

356
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,840
You!

357
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,680
Nonsense!

358
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,030
Slander!

359
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,870
All lies!

360
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,160
Mr. Wensheng is right!

361
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,480
Minister Lu,

362
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,480
your son borrowed Lady Yuanying

363
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,790
from the Imperial Music Office in your name.

364
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
His crime is your crime.

365
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,750
Do handle this with caution.

366
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,110
As for Lady Yuanying,

367
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,960
please escort her

368
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,400
back to the Office unharmed.

369
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,200
Investigating Censor, am I right?

370
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,350
Both of you have a firm grasp of the law.

371
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,480
Every word rings true.

372
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,720
Mr. Lu's official position

373
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,960
may not happen now.

374
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,680
Indeed.

375
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,550
Forget office,

376
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,240
he might end up in prison.

377
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,350
Who could deny it?

378
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,000
Lady Muqing,

379
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,790
I hear you've been

380
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,720
prying into my husband's character lately.

381
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,030
Is that true?

382
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,350
A misunderstanding, Madam.

383
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,400
I just asked casually.

384
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,040
I have something for you.

385
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,750
It may explain his true nature.

386
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,300
(Genital lacerations.
Semen traces confirm violent assault.)

387
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,000
Lady Yuanying,

388
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,880
did you never expect

389
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,480
that the one who hurt you would help you?

390
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,200
Thank you, Madam.

391
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,200
Had you not given me the document

392
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,200
and helped us expose Lu Wencai,

393
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,830
this matter

394
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,880
would have dragged on endlessly.

395
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,790
You said that day,

396
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,310
"As women bound by shared suffering,

397
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,160
why should we torment each other?"

398
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,750
I pondered those words for days

399
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,960
before stepping in to help you.

400
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,430
I really

401
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,840
appreciate it, Madam.

402
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,640
It was my own fault.

403
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,030
My husband is lecherous and shameless.

404
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,590
What's the use of blaming you?

405
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,240
After all,

406
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,270
we're all poor prisoners trapped here.

407
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,790
Today I help you escape,

408
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,310
and I hope that one day,

409
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,790
I can also get rid of this.

410
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,240
Well,

411
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,750
Lady Yuanying can return

412
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,830
to the Office now.

413
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,610
- Take care, Madam.
- Take care, Madam.

414
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,710
Father.

415
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,670
Father.

416
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,630
Father.

417
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,070
I lost my hereditary privilege,

418
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,000
but you can't abandon my official career!

419
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,110
You!

420
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,240
That lowly woman is to blame!

421
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,440
She's kicking me when I'm down, Father!

422
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,070
How dare she demand divorce?

423
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,480
I'll cast her out tomorrow!

424
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,520
Unfilial wretch!

425
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,240
Her father will be the Minister of Personnel.

426
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,920
With your hereditary privilege lost,

427
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,070
the imperial exam is your only chance.

428
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,070
If you divorce her,

429
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,200
you'll forfeit her father's backing.

430
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,110
Pray he won't put obstacles in your way.

431
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,750
If you can't even keep your wife,

432
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,440
you're no son of our family!

433
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,200
Go rot in our ancestral house

434
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,270
in the village until you die!

435
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,160
Darling,

436
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,510
I was wrong.

437
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,830
It's all my fault.

438
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,310
Please don't divorce me, ok?

439
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,110
Or

440
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,020
yell at me.

441
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,030
Or hit me.

442
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,480
Hit, hit me hard!

443
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,920
Didn't you think I'm aging and charmless?

444
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,880
My tongue is venom!

445
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,480
Darling, your beauty defies time itself!

446
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,000
As long as you stay,

447
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,790
this household

448
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,440
is yours to command, agreed?

449
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,560
Fine.

450
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,400
But I want you to transfer

451
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,240
all your properties to me.

452
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,070
Also, I want you

453
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,240
to write a full confession

454
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
of your sins,

455
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,550
signed and sealed.

456
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,400
You may mess around outside,

457
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,070
but within these walls,

458
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,790
you will not disturb my peace.

459
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,160
Break this, and I'll divorce you instantly.

460
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,160
Of course, of course!

461
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,960
Only proper, only proper!

462
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,510
Shall we go to bed now?

463
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,520
Get out.

464
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,880
Yes, yes.

465
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,110
I'll get out.

466
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,630
I'll get out.

467
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,240
Darling,

468
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
rest well.

469
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,110
Madam,

470
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,590
are you not going to divorce him?

471
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,400
In fact,

472
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,590
my father saw through today's farce.

473
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,110
Even so,

474
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,720
he still sent me a letter

475
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,070
to admonish me to abide by my duty,

476
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,000
(To Yunxiu)
to protect his family's honor,

477
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,310
not to act willfully,

478
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,750
and absolutely not to get a divorce.

479
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,270
Why not?

480
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,270
My father's promotion is imminent.

481
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,790
He is afraid that any scandal now

482
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,920
will affect his future prospects.

483
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,960
If I insist on getting a divorce,

484
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,880
I'm afraid my own family

485
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,920
will discard me like weeds.

486
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,000
Though I can't get a divorce,

487
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,310
I'll swallow

488
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,350
no more bitterness.

489
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,640
I'm going to make plans for myself.

490
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,270
I'll clench this estate

491
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,270
in my fist.

492
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,630
Xiangxue,

493
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,310
pack his things

494
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,680
and move them to the wing-room later.

495
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,960
This chamber is mine now.

496
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,590
Yes.

497
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,300
(Liu Yuanying)

498
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,920
Judging from Liu Yuanying's statement,

499
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,880
someone threatened Liu Xiankun

500
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,920
with his children's lives

501
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,790
to make him frame Mr. Su.

502
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,070
To save his children,

503
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,210
he had no choice but to comply.

504
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,150
Based on this,

505
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,880
there are indeed doubts about the case.

506
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,960
I give you my word

507
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,720
that once I assume my post

508
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,240
and the time is right,

509
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,790
I'll petition His Majesty at once

510
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,750
to reopen Su Changhua's case.

511
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,220
My gratitude, Your Highness.

512
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,300
(Baiyu Shop)

513
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,200
Place this by the entrance.

514
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,190
Thank you.

515
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,350
This goes behind the screen.

516
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,590
Put this table on the second floor.

517
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,960
- One, two, three, four.
- Be careful.

518
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,590
Lady Muqing.

519
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,200
Madam.

520
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,770
Madam,

521
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,240
I didn't expect to meet you again so soon.

522
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,260
Me neither.

523
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,440
I'm really glad to see you.

524
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,520
Actually,

525
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,110
my name is Mingshu.

526
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,270
I had reasons

527
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,350
for posing as a dancer.

528
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
I hope you won't hold it against me.

529
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,110
You're straightforward.

530
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,640
I don't want to ask too many questions.

531
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,350
By the way,

532
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,670
this shop...

533
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,830
I just leased it

534
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,270
to open a jewelry shop.

535
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,000
Do drop by when you have time.

536
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,390
To be honest,

537
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,920
I really envy you

538
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,680
for being able to choose the life you want.

539
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,190
You could too.

540
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,110
Me?

541
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,540
Watch your step.﻿

542
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,680
Trapped in those walls?

543
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,400
Surrounded by mediocrity?

544
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,640
So what?

545
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,830
If you only focus on present things,

546
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,240
you won't be happy.

547
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,070
But we don't live just to endure hardships.

548
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,880
We should try to find pleasures.

549
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,800
Pleasures?

550
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,550
Things like doing business,

551
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,880
eating, and sleeping

552
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,160
are all enjoyable to me.

553
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,640
Sometimes I also envy

554
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,960
noble ladies like you who are proficient

555
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,720
in music, chess, calligraphy, painting,

556
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,480
and tea and incense ceremonies.

557
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,920
Each of them is an exquisite escape.

558
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,550
Your words

559
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,480
seem to make some sense.

560
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,350
I've loved the pipa since young,

561
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,440
but I haven't touched it

562
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,830
since I married into the Lu Family.

563
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,670
From now on,

564
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,200
I'll no longer focus on unpleasant things.

565
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,680
I'll also think

566
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,720
about what I really like.

567
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,000
Thank you.

568
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,840
Mother,

569
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,310
mending for Grandma Li in the Right Alley?

570
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,590
Yes.

571
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,200
She is old

572
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,720
and not in her right mind.

573
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,790
We should help her as much as we can.

574
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,560
Don't just stand there.

575
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,560
Sit.

576
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,240
Your needlework is artistry,

577
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,680
but you've settled for scraps of work

578
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,880
at home these years.

579
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,240
It's such a waste.

580
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,590
It's not easy for a woman to work outside.

581
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,070
Bringing you and your brother up

582
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,510
is satisfying enough for me.

583
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,790
But things are different now.

584
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,070
I'm the owner of Hualang Pavilion,

585
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,350
and your craft

586
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,070
needn't be confined at home.

587
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,640
Would you like to help me

588
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,480
appraise embroidery?

589
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,520
Well...

590
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,550
I've been staying at home for years.

591
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,200
I'm afraid I'm not up to the task.

592
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,160
Don't worry, Mother.

593
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,590
This isn't nepotism,

594
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,830
but justice for your craft.

595
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,160
In this city,

596
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,000
there are many

597
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,340
brilliant women confined to their homes,

598
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,510
their talents buried.

599
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,830
I hope you can discover more of them,

600
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,510
so that they won't be confined at home,

601
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,270
and their skills won't be buried in obscurity

602
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,830
but will be appreciated and remembered.

603
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,840
Ok.

604
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,550
With your assurance,

605
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,830
I fear nothing.

606
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,320
Mother.

607
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,550
So you'll do it?

608
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,190
Buddy!

609
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,480
The disadvantages of hereditary privilege?

610
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,400
After what happened at the Lu Mansion,

611
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,030
I'll channel my indignation into an essay.

612
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,160
What do you need?

613
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,920
I don't like

614
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,270
these plaque inscription drafts.

615
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,550
You should inscribe Hualang Pavilion.

616
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,300
(Hualang Pavilion)
I'll do it for you.

617
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,790
But as the owner,

618
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,790
don't you want to write it yourself?

619
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,400
I'm no calligrapher.

638
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
Speaking of

639
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,670
Lady Yuanying,

640
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,150
it's lucky that she met you.

641
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,840
Otherwise, who knows how long

642
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,940
she'd have been fooled by Lu Wencai.

643
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,550
She had no choice.

644
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,030
With her lowly status,

645
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,280
she couldn't get any help

646
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,720
to look for her brother.

647
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,960
She was easy prey for scoundrels.

648
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,760
Like me,

649
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,070
she was lucky to meet you

650
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,320
when in a difficult situation.

651
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,360
If you put it that way,

652
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,800
I'm like a living Bodhisattva saving souls.

653
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,480
You're just so glib.

654
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,150
However,

655
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,030
this thing

656
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,710
inspires me.

657
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,480
Since ancient times,

658
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,630
men have been superior to women,

659
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,880
and the feudal ethics have been strict.

660
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,190
Many women in distress have nowhere to turn.

661
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,110
If Hualang Pavilion

662
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,550
could take on manageable commissions

663
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,230
to resolve their troubles,

664
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,800
wouldn't that free more from their plights?

665
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,280
Good idea.

666
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,400
Let's make Hualang Pavilion

667
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,950
Women's Club,

668
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,030
all members bound as sisters.

669
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,670
We can share joys

670
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,920
in good times.

671
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,800
When we have difficulties,

672
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,440
we can collaborate on plans

673
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,190
and devise solutions together.

674
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,630
That would be excellent.

675
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,620
We strike an instant chord.

676
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,190
Right, I have something else to ask you.

677
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,990
What is it?

678
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,320
I...

679
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,960
Master Cui Li's handcrafted feng shui stone

680
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,590
was supposed to be obtained in six months.

681
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,320
Yet he graciously surrendered it to me.

682
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,000

686
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,150
Master is here.

687
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,340
Give it to me.

688
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,210
- Master.
- Father.

689
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,800
Father,

690
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,840
I've gained new insights from history lately.

691
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,880
I'm looking forward to your guidance.

692
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,070
Come to my study at dusk.

693
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,680
Yes.

694
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,710
Sir, Master has departed.

695
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,480
I think you're overthinking this.

696
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,440
You were injured and lost your memory,

697
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,480
forgetting all your past.

698
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,960
As a result,

699
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,880
a lot of your sibling affection dissipated,

700
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,110
so to you, your brother

701
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,760
is no different from other men.

702
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,440
Later,

703
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,230
you pretended to be a couple

704
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,250
and got too close, which made you

705
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,670
develop strange feelings for him.

706
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,680
Is that really the case?

707
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,360
I don't think

708
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,440
it's a big deal.

709
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,370
Relax.

710
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,420
Stop overthinking.

711
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
But honestly,

712
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,230
you two don't look alike.

713
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,670
What if you're not biological siblings?

714
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,230

This is a poem by Master Linchuan.

717
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,400
When did I ever recite his poem?

718
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,360
If you like green bamboo,

719
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,230
I'll have it planted in your courtyard.

720
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,600
No,

721
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,640
no need.

722
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,030
It's merely a fleeting thought.

723
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,230
Careful.

724
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,550
It's heavy.

725
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,960
Lady Mingshu.

726
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,590
Lady Yuanying,

727
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,400
what brings you here?

728
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,190
Something just came to my mind.

729
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,760
I'm not sure if it will be helpful

730
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,710
for Mr. Su's case.

731
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,640
Go on.

732
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,710
I've been thinking about it recently,

733
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,510
and I recalled our maid mentioning

734
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,230
that after Mr. Su was taken,

735
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:12,030
Jian Jinhai, the owner of Jian's Gold Shop,

736
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,110
came to see my father

737
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,510
and gave him a good scolding.

738
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,030
It seemed that he was defending Mr. Su.

739
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,190
I'm not sure if he holds any clues.

740
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,360
Looks like Jian Jinhai was close to Mr. Su.

741
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,150
I'll tell my brother.

742
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,070
And,

743
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,920
at the banquet,

744
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:34,400
you hurt yourself to expose Lu Wencai.

745
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,710
Thank you very much.

746
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,920
I was trying to save myself.

747
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,440
I owe it to you for this matter.

748
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,320
To conceive the great idea of Women's Club,

749
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,320
you're truly ingenious, kind-hearted,

750
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,190
and admirable.

751
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,880
Though bound to the Office,

752
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,840
I'd like to contribute however I can.

753
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,630
I wonder what you...

754
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,830
