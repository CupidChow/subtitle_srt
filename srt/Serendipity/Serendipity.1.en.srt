who is this man

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,240
in this portrait?

46
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,560
- Lu Chang.
- Lu Chang.

47
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,270
Correct.

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,640

among the wealthiest in Jianglin,

we

53
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,430

55

must enter officialdom.

56
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,310
Shouldn't we

57
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,910
stake everything

58
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,240
for the Jian Family?

- Yes!
- Yes!

60
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,840

we've switched all gift boxes to red

83
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,510

just tell my brother
that you want to marry me.

94
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,310
Why bring me here?

95
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,630
I brought you here

96
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,720
to choose betrothal gifts for you.

97
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,190
Come on.

Lady, these sets

101
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,630
would suit you perfectly.

102
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,720
Thank you, madam.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,280
Mr. Gao, your jade is flawless.

104
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,200
A rare treasure indeed.

105
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,800
You have a sharp eye.

106
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,680
This is an ancient piece.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Quite valuable.

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,910

109
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,390
what do you think of this?

110
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,920

Once you've decided,

112
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,630
I'll take you to Tingzhu Retreat for dinner.

114
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,000
Lady, you seem torn.

115
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,000
Are these

116
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,240
unworthy of your taste?

117
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,680
The previous designs were ornate

118
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,560
but lacked substance.

119
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,480
Hardly fit for betrothal gifts.

120
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,680
Look,

121
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,160
this headpiece

122
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,360
is the pride of this shop.

inlaid with jade.

A symbol of prosperity

126
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,680
and boundless fortune.

127
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,750
Does it please you?

128
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,310
Exquisite craftsmanship,

129
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,430
and such a good meaning.

130
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,960
I love it.

131
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,800
You have great taste.

132
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,000
Mr. Gao, what do you think?

133
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,240
Blandishments.

134
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,510
Trying to swindle me?

135
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,440
Enough.

136
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,590
We're leaving.

137
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,120
Let's go to Tingzhu Retreat.

138
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,680
That's a perfect spot.

139
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,360
Secluded, serene.

140
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,070
And far enough that returning tonight

141
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,560
would be difficult.

142
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,430
Luckily, they have excellent lodgings.

143
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,000
Do you know that, lady?

144
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,720
You call that a good place?

145
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,950
It is in the middle of nowhere!

146
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,790
So you

147
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,360
didn't want me back tonight at all!

148
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,330
My Lady!

149
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,160
Is this how you see me?

150
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Sir, was that gold trim on your jade pendant

151
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,240
a gift from Xiangyun Brothel's new courtesan?

152
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,950
Only her most intimate patrons
receive such tokens.

153
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,240
Mr. Gao, you're truly charming.

154
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,480
You scoundrel!

155
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,830
Love at first sight?

156
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,120
Only me?

157
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,920
All lies!

158
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,470
My Lady.

159
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,670
My Lady.

160
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,150
Mr. Gao,

161
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,310
you're not welcome here.

162
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,560
See yourself out.

163
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,400
You wretch.

164
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,390
You'll regret crossing me!

167
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,830
My cousin is the current Prefect Gao.

168
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,800
Challenge me.

169
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,070
You'll die.

170
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,800
If I'm not mistaken,

171
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,000
this jade pendant in your hand

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,270
belonged to former prefect Su Changhua.

173
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,070
How did you get items
from the former prefect's family,

174
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,390
punished and confiscated?

175
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,600
Just you wait!

Chang,

178
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,910
it's been so long.

179
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,750
Are you alright?

180
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,960
Lady Jian.

181
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,440
Mr. Lu.

182
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,960
(Wu Sheng)
My sister escaped calamity today

183
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,720
thanks to Lady Jian.

184
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,510
It was nothing.

185
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,320
For years,

186
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,000
Master Jian has supported our academy,

187
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,790
allowing impoverished scholars

188
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,910
to pursue learning.

189
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,440
Having no means to repay,

190
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,000
I can only pledge my humble service
to you, Lady Jian.

191
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,480
Your academic success

192
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,600
is repayment enough.

193
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,510
May you achieve great success tomorrow.

194
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,750
I have things to do.

195
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,160
I'll take my leave.

196
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,560
Chang.

197
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,320
Excuse me.

198
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,390
Chang!

199
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,360
Chang,

200
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,390
since your return from your study tour,

201
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,600
we've not had a proper conversation.

202
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,960
Times change.

203
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,750
We both have responsibilities.

204
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,750
And,

205
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,240
as your senior,

206
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,870
I should keep my distance.

207
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,440
Why is that necessary?

208
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,030
Don't create distance between us.

209
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,960
Earlier I saw you

210
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,800
risk your life

211
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,200
to protect silver and gold.

212
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,200
Though valuable,

213
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,680
they're but worldly possessions.

214
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,120
Your safety matters more.

215
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,750
You're right, Chang.

216
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,750
Also,

217
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,040
Gao Wan

218
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,230
is not a good person.

219
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,670
Try to avoid him

220
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,240
and steer clear of trouble.

221
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,480
I just can't stand by watching him

222
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,680
deceive girls

223
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,150
and ruin their reputations.

224
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,870
Chang, you do care for me.

225
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,270
Every time I'm in danger,

226
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,630
you're always there.

227
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,080
That's only natural.

228
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,110
Since all is well,

229
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,510
I'll take my leave.

230
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,180
(Two years ago)

231
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,600

Why are you here?

236
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,680
Heard you're going on a study tour.

237
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,000
When will you return?

238
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,680
By the next autumn provincial examination.

239
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,670

You should head back.

But once you leave,

244
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,390
who knows when we'll meet again?

245
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,750

268
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,510
It feels like ever since Mr. Lu returned,

269
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,910
he's grown distant from you.

270
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,440
In these two years,
I've even become a shopkeeper.

271
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,440
How could he remain completely unchanged?

272
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,480
(Xiao Qingting)
Though we've grown apart,

273
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,790
the bond we shared still remains.

274
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,030
I'll break the awkwardness.

275
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,200
But the world expects women to be reserved

276
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,080
and never take the initiative
in relationships.

277
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,720
When a man pursues love,

278
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,240
it becomes a celebrated tale.

279
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,280
When a woman does the same,
she's scorned.

280
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,960
But if you truly want something,

281
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,000
you should fight for it.

282
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,150
If he truly doesn't want it,

283
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,440
I can't force him.

284
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,720
Humans make the plans.

285
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,960
I'll do my best.

286
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,390
What?

287
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,840
(Ying Xun)
Mr. Su's jade pendant

288
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,960
is with Gao Wan?

289
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,510
I saw it.

290
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,630
Mr. Su was convicted of embezzling
disaster relief funds.

291
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,150
His belongings should have been submitted

292
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,200
to the Supreme Court as evidence.

293
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,870
Yet now it's with Gao Wan.

294
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,350
Had...

295
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,080
Had Prefect Gao colluded

296
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,200
with the investigating officials?

297
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,600
My master always taught me

298
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,520
a scholar's duty is to serve the world

299
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,800
and gentlemen must choose

300
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,990
between what's right and wrong.

301
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,760
He was always incorruptible.

302
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,120
He would never embezzle funds.

303
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,840
How can I let his soul remain wronged

304
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,680
and unrested?

305
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,280
I'll soon be transferred to the capital.

306
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,560
Perhaps then I can assist you.

307
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,910
This won't be easily resolved.

308
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,240
Only through official rank

309
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,790
might there be hope.

310
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,750
Lu Chang,

311
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,870
you will surely top

312
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,060
the autumn provincial examination.

313
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,550
Right.

314
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,680
Many rich merchants are planning
the groom-snatching.

315
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,630
With the Jian Family's support,

316
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,910
it'd be beneficial for you.

317
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,910
Besides, you and Mingshu

318
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,870
grew up together.

319
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,550
Her feelings for you...

320
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,360
The path I walk is thorny.

321
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I won't drag others down.

322
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,680
I won't consider

323
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,990
marriage.

324
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,160
Master,

325
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,600
Lady Mingshu has always
opposed groom-snatching.

326
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,240
She said that dealing with Lu Chang

327
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,550
requires a gentle and patient approach.

328
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,390
But circumstances won't wait.

329
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,790
Lu Chang will undoubtedly top.

330
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,440
I must arrange the groom-snatching now.

331
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,510
Once he's my son-in-law,

332
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,280
we

333
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,360
can protect him.

334
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,200
If Lady Mingshu learns of your plans,

335
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,840
she won't take it lightly.

336
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,630
Aren't you afraid...

337
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,200
I'm doing it for their good.

338
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,200
They'll understand someday.

339
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,910
Mingshu has her own mind.

340
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,440
Keep this from her for now.

341
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,120
But if Lu Chang refuses,

342
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,440
we'll need a strategy.

343
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,390
Understood.

344
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,510
My Lay, it's bad!

345
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,680
What now?

346
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,270
Mr. Lu is the most desired candidate
for son-in-law.

347
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,030
As expected.

348
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,910
From what I know of him,

349
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,120
even if he's caught,

350
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,960
he won't agree to wed
unless it's to his liking.

351
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,480
What else?

352
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,150
They also say

353
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,320
that the Zhao and Jiang families intend to...

354
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,200
They plan to catch Mr. Lu and...

355
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,440
No way.

356
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,100
(Radiance and Blessings)
Remember this.

357
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,150
The groom-snatching

358
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,120
is between you and me.

359
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,360
Don't let Mingshu find out.

360
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,000
(Steward Jian)
Master, rest assured.

361
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,910
It's all set.

362
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,270
When the time comes...

363
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,400
No need to hide it from me.

364
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,930
Father, go ahead.

365
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,600
Well...

366
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,560
Why...

367
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,360
Why did you suddenly agree?

368
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,840
If I don't,

369
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,630
others might use underhanded tactics

370
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,750
to Chang into submission.

371
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,080
I can't allow that to happen.

372
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,110
I doubt they'd dare.

373
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,120
No matter what,

374
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,630
I'll catch Lu Chang for you.

375
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,480
Go ahead.

376
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,240
We'll send our strongest team

377
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
and devise strategies to handle any chaos.

378
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,270
We need to station people
at the results posting site, teahouses,

379
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,000
and around the Lu Residence.

380
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,200
Right, we absolutely can't let him escape.

381
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,800
Also,

382
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,480
I know you have other options.

383
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,200
So let me make this clear.

384
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,510
I will only marry Chang.

385
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,590
Father, don't complicate matters.

386
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,550
Do you promise?

387
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Look at you.

388
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,270
You... You've said it yourself.

389
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,750
How could I not agree?

390
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,110
Good.

391
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,270
If we catch him,

392
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,550
will Chang...

393
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,350
Will he willingly marry me?

394
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,350
We've helped him with his studies.

395
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,640
We've done him a great favor.

396
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,860
Besides,

397
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,880
you're clever and beautiful.

398
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,400
There's no reason for him to refuse.

399
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,030
Father, you're guilt-tripping him.

400
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,400
He's been independent,

401
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,030
just using our academy to study.

402
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,160
When has he ever
accepted our financial support?

403
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,880
Fine, I'll invite Madam Zeng over tomorrow

404
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,580
and tell her my feelings for Chang.

405
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,480
Good idea.

406
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,000
Catching him and winning his heart.

407
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,720
Let's show him our utmost sincerity.

408
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,790
That young man

409
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,420
won't be able to resist.

410
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,920
Where are you going?

411
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,240
I'm going to the ancestral hall
to pay my respects to your mother

412
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,750
and ask her to bless you

413
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,680
in finding a good husband.

414
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,480
I'll go with you.

415
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,920
Let's go.

416
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,240
Father, I want to bring some longans
for Mother.

417
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,640
(Harmony Brings Prosperity)
Sure.

418
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,790
We just met during the day.

419
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,440
Why did you specifically ask me to come here?

420
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,480
Today, while chatting

421
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,350
with a jailer who used to guard Mr. Su,

422
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,880
I learned something.

423
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,440
So I asked you to come here.

424
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,870
He's one of us.

425
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,880
Before Mr. Su took his own life,

426
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,350
Master Jian went to the jail

427
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,630
to insult him.

428
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,310
Where is that scoundrel Prefect Su?

429
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,820
(Su Changhua)

430
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,350
Su Changhua,

431
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,480
you've fallen into jail,

432
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,750
yet still maintain that haughty air?

433
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,280
Who are you putting on a show for?

434
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,440
Master Jian,

435
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,270
we've never had any acquaintance.

436
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,030
How do I deserve your visit?

437
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,270
You really have a bad memory.

438
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,030
Last year, when I needed money
for circulation,

439
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,510
I offered my entire mansion to you
as collateral for a loan.

440
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,560
And you?

441
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,440
You just refused.

442
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,590
So it turns out you had your eyes

443
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,350
on the disaster relief funds.

444
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,270
Fortunately, the heavens

445
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,350
have taken you hypocritical scoundrel away.

446
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,510
Master Jian has always been known
for his charity,

447
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,960
so I've always respected him greatly.

448
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,640
But he humiliated my master

449
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,880
and bowed down to Gao Shicai.

450
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,400
It's truly lamentable.

451
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,680
After all these years of history between you,

452
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,920
what will you do

453
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,280
at tomorrow's groom-snatching?

454
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,520
(Su Residence)
There is

455
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,240
irrefutable evidence that Su Changhua
embezzled disaster relief funds.

456
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,960
(Seal)
According to the laws,

457
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,510
he is sentenced to death

458
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,830
and shall be executed

459
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,920
to uphold the law of the land.

460
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,300
(To Farm and to Study, Our Heritage)

461
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,920
(Master,)

462
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,550
(I will not fail your teachings.)

463
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,400
(My only ambition)

464
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,510
(is to clear your name.)

465
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,220
(Peace and Prosperity)

466
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:30,700
(Jian)

467
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,100
(Zhao)

468
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,140
(Jiang)

469
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,250
(Chen)

470
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,160
Look!

471
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
The four major families are here
to snatch grooms.

472
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,980
(Chen, Jian, Zhao, Jiang)

473
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,160
(Fresh Breeze, Bright Moon)

474
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,440
Once the list is announced,

475
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,920
we must occupy multiple positions

476
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,200
to search for Lu Chang comprehensively.

477
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,710
Once we find him,

478
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,590
(Jian)
act steadily, accurately, and ruthlessly.

479
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,910
Understood?

480
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,870
Understood!

481
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,380
(Jian)

482
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,680
Every time you come to the Lu Residence,

483
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,440
you have the carriage stop at the entrance.

484
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,270
But we brought many gifts.

485
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,160
Why didn't you bring some servants along?

486
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,880
Madam Zeng prefers quietness.

487
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,110
Too many people would be overbearing

488
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,960
and arrogant.

489
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,000
You're so caring.

490
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,200
You do so much for him.

491
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,920
I truly hope Mr. Lu knows.

492
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,400
We will invite Madam Zeng to our residence.

493
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,640
With Chang's filial piety,

494
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,110
even if we don't catch him,

495
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,960
he will come over.

496
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,030
The Prefect is here!

497
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,820
(Top the Exams)
(Peace and Prosperity)

498
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,590
(Gao Shicai)
The examination results are announced!

499
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,860

(Top the Exams)
(Peace and Prosperity)

502
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,070
Have you seen my name?

503
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,670
Is my name on it?

504
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,760
It's out!

505
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,600
(Fourth to Fifteenth Place)
Who's this person?

506
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,590
I passed!

507
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,910
Look!

508
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,000
The Prefectural Graduate is Lu Chang.

509
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,040
Mr. Lu!

510
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,300
(Lu Chang)

511
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,510
Catch Lu Chang!

512
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,070
- Catch Lu Chang!
- Now!

513
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,400
If we can't catch Lu Chang,
catch someone else.

514
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,480
(Oh no.)

515
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,310
- Run!
- Move aside!

516
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,310
- Run!
- Everyone, move!

517
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,110
Don't catch me. I'm married.

518
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,160
This is rude.

519
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,310
- Be careful.
- Let's go.

520
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,830
Go over there and find Lu Chang!

521
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,320
We've got him.

522
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,320
The Jian Family?

523
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,470
Not him. Let's go!

524
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,880
Don't you really consider me?

525
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,640
I'm not Lu Chang.

526
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,110
Let me go!

527
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,160
Sir, let's talk calmly. You...

528
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,480
This isn't Lu Chang.

529
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,350
Where is Lu Chang?

530
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,750
He's over there!

531
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,960
Catch him!

532
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,480
Lu Chang. Money's here!

533
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,030
Catch him!

534
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,960
Catch Lu Chang!

535
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,040
Over there.

536
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,190
Hurry up.

537
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,560
Follow.

538
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,790
Over there. Chase him!

539
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,820
He belongs to us.

540
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,160
- He's over there.
- Move aside.

541
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,510
Catch the one wearing the bamboo hat!

542
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,720
Hurry!

543
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,500
(Zhao)

544
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,080
Don't run!

545
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,240
This way! You guys follow.

546
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,920
Now pull up the bridge.

547
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,000
Don't let them pass.

548
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,430
Hurry.

549
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,590
Lower the bridge now.

550
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,840
People from the Chen Family
are terrible.

551
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,800
Lower it!

552
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,670
Madam Zeng,

553
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,960
please have some tea.

554
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,380
(Zeng Yuqing)

555
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,030
You're too kind-hearted.

556
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,960
Why did you

557
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,830
invite me today?

558
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,350
Madam Zeng,

559
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,270
please don't laugh at me.

560
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,750
I won't.

561
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,720
I want to marry Chang.

562
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,510
I know this can't be rushed.

563
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,920
But he's too sought after.

564
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,640
Since we're already catching him,

565
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,350
there's no need

566
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,000
to hide my feelings anymore.

567
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,310
You grew up under my watch.

568
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,720
If you become my daughter-in-law,

569
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,350
I would naturally be delighted.

570
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,110
However, Chang

571
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,680
has a deep mind
and is not good with words.

572
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,790
Even if he has thousands of thoughts
in his heart,

573
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,640
when it comes to expressing them,

574
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,160
he can only manage a few classical phrases.

575
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,360
So I want to make it clear to him.

576
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,070
I'm not forcing him,

577
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,510
but I don't want to miss out.

578
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,920
- Is this it?
- Groom-snatching?

579
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,030
This is it.

580
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,160
It's Mr. Lu.

581
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,510
It really is Mr. Lu.

582
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,160
(Jian)
We'll just wait right here.

583
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
I'm sure he'll come back.

584
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,800
- Right.
- Exactly.

585
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,740
(Jian)

586
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,720
Mingshu invited me to the Jian Residence.

587
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,030
Remember to pick me up.

588
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,280
(Mingshu invited me to the Jian Residence.
Remember to pick me up.)

589
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,240
(The Jian Family is persistent.)

590
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,920
(I'd better make things clear in person)

591
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,440
(to avoid further trouble.)

592
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,390
- Have you seen him?
- No.

593
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,040
- How about you?
- Neither have we.

594
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,030
That's odd.

595
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,160
He clearly went this way.

596
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,440
How come we can't see him?

597
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,490
Mr. Lu,

598
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,790
Lady Jian has instructed us

599
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,640
to bring you back.

600
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,670
Pardon us.

601
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,110
Go ahead.

602
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,870
Don't bother.

603
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,910
I'll go.

604
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,400
He's going.

605
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,110
Mr. Lu.

606
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,160
All right.

607
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
Please.

608
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,720
Master Jian, no need for this.

609
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,190
Mr. Lu,

610
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,110
we'll be family from now on.

611
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,920
Your mother is here too.

612
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,720
Let's finalize

613
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,790
the wedding arrangements today.

614
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,480
You've misunderstood.

615
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,200
I came here

616
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,790
to fetch my mother,

617
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,920
and to tell you

618
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,790
that I don't want to get married.

619
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,430
If you...

620
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,510
If you truly regard me as an elder,

621
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,800
then sit down

622
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,510
and have some tea with me.

623
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,760
And then

624
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,720
let me explain our intentions

625
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,000
to you.

626
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,840
Please.

627
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,390
All right.

628
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,640
Please.

629
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,720
Mr. Lu,

630
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,640
Mingshu is truly

631
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,640
devoted to you.

632
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,350
She is

633
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,510
my only daughter.

634
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,030
If you two get married,

635
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,790
then my entire fortune

636
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,000
will be yours.

637
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,440
I'm honored by your favor,

638
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,000
but I have no interest in this.

639
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,960
Sorry to disappoint you.

640
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
Well, does that mean

641
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,880
there's no room for negotiation at all?

642
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,920
Master Jian, you need a son-in-law
to take over your business,

643
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,390
while I

644
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,680
have my own aspirations

645
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,680
and important things to do.

646
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,960
Let's go our separate ways.

647
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,200
I've shown you nothing but sincerity,

648
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,350
yet you keep refusing me.

649
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,350
Is my family

650
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,030
so unappealing to you?

651
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,110
It's just that our paths differ.

652
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,880
If you still don't understand,

653
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,070
do you remember

654
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,590
what you did to my master, Su Changhua?

655
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,160
Let's not talk about that.

656
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,750
If you marry my daughter,

657
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,510
I'll give you

658
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,070
even more than this.

659
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,480
There must be something you care about.

660
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:57,540
(Jian Residence)

661
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,800
Master Jian is discussing the date
with Madam Zeng.

662
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,160
You'll soon be a bride.

663
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,550
I haven't won his heart yet.

664
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,720
Has Chang really agreed?

665
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,790
Master Jian said he had
a pleasant conversation with Mr. Lu.

666
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,240
He was even drunk.

667
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,440
You know his character.

668
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,640
He'll never be forced.

669
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,680
He must have understood your intentions

670
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,590
and is willing to stay.

671
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,320
Otherwise,

672
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,110
not even the county magistrate

673
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,640
could persuade him.

674
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,440
That's indeed

675
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,510
his nature.

676
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,030
It seems he still remembers

677
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,160
our past.

678
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,150
Mother.

679
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,800
Stop crying.

680
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,160
Have some longans.

681
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,270
I don't want them.

682
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,880
I just want Mother.

683
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,000
You look so ugly when you cry.

684
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,000
If your mother saw you like this,

685
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,600
she wouldn't feel at ease.

686
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,790
Can Mother still see me?

687
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,550
Then I won't cry.

688
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,110
Do you want some?

689
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,200
I didn't mean to.

690
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,750
Look at the shape.

691
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,270
Doesn't it look like a bamboo?

692
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,200
Do you like bamboo?

693
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,790
Once shared rain and dew with weeds,

694
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,000
yet stood with pines
through frost and freeze.

695
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,030
Mr. Su taught me to be like bamboo,

696
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,680
unafraid of wind and rain,

697
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,270
unyielding to frost and snow.

698
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,030
Then I'll embroider bamboo patterns

699
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,350
on all your clothes.

700
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,390
Okay.

701
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,470
My Lady,

702
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,200
Master Jian and Madam Zeng have inquired.

703
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,440
Today is an auspicious day.

704
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,200
You may consummate the marriage

705
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,400
and hold the ceremony later.

706
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,480
Did they really say that?

707
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:17,160
Was such a practice recorded
in historical groom-snatching marriages?

708
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,200
Master said everything
follows customary rituals

709
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,120
and there's no problem.

710
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,080
I see.

711
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,240
(It still feels strange.)

712
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:40,500
(Joy)

713
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,800
My Lady, go.

714
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,400
Chang.

715
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,800
What's wrong?

716
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,440
You guys are really scheming.

717
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,400
Even resorting to drugging me.

718
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,710
If I hadn't woken up in time,

719
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,670
would I have been forced to get married?

720
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,640
Drugged?

721
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,480
I never asked them to do such a thing.

722
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,360
Chang,

723
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,360
my intention in catching you

724
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,190
is to show my sincerity,

725
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,190
not to coerce.

726
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,880
If I say I know nothing about the drugs,

727
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,920
do you believe me?

728
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,320
Since I'm unwilling to get married,

729
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,280
does it matter whether I believe you or not?

730
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,920
We've known each other since childhood.

731
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,150
And we're so close back then.

732
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,880
You said you liked bamboo,

733
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,710
so I embroidered it on your clothes.

734
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,630
Was that really just

735
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,590
my wishful thinking?

736
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
When my mother and I
were left adrift in Jianglin,

737
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,710
it was your father who came to our aid,

738
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,840
allowing us to establish ourselves there.

739
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,480
I will never forget

740
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,880
this kindness.

741
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,550
I will surely repay it.

742
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,150
Just not in this way.

743
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,280
I'm not guilt-tripping you.

744
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,030
But haven't you noticed

745
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,190
my feelings for you at all?

746
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,550
Thank you for your deep affection.

747
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,630
But you come from a noble family,

748
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,440
while I grew up untamed.

749
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,800
I know my place.

750
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,280
I'm not worthy of you.

751
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,630
Besides, I'm just a scholar.

752
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,360
I don't know what the future holds.

753
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,600
I don't want to drag others down.

754
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,800
I'm afraid

755
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,400
I'll have to disappoint your good intentions.

756
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,920
These material things don't matter.

757
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,360
I just want to know
if you have me in your heart.

758
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,630
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

759
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,800
Besides, your father

760
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,280
has supported many scholars

761
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,240
in the academy.

762
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,670
It shouldn't be difficult for you

763
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,360
to find a few talented young men.

764
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,030
You shouldn't obsess over me?

765
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,710
Are you saying I'm keeping options open,

766
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,320
guilt-tripping others,

767
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,880
putting price tags on those scholars?

768
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,590
Is that how you see me?

769
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,760
I just don't want you

770
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,030
to waste your time on me.

771
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,760
With your talent,

772
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,920
you deserve someone better.

773
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,670
Besides, your father

774
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,320
dishonored my master.

775
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,920
How can I ignore my master's kindness

776
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,840
and become your family member?

777
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,960
I thought you

778
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,190
would definitely remember our childhood bond.

779
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,760
It turns out

780
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,440
that was my wishful thinking.

781
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,000
For today's matter,

782
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,590
we indeed made mistakes and acted rudely.

783
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,920
I have nothing to say in defense.

784
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,710
I apologize to you.

785
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,070
I also admit that my father
had ulterior motives

786
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,240
and he's trying to climb the social ladder.

787
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,150
It's only natural

788
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,670
that you look down on him.

789
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,760
Since returning from the study tour,

790
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,190
you've been avoiding me.

791
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,510
How could I not know?

792
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,110
I thought

793
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,960
you just didn't understand me.

794
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,800
Over time,

795
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,920
you would surely see my sincerity.

796
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,550
But we've known each other for years.

797
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,190
If you had any feelings for me,

798
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,960
you wouldn't have misunderstood me like this.

799
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,350
It seems

800
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,150
you really have no feelings for me.

801
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,550
You are a noble heiress by birth

802
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,880
and also a wealthy merchant.

803
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,880
Whether in the past or now,

804
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,320
I'm not worthy of you.

805
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,920
I don't want to cling to you.

806
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,470
I see.

807
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,550
If that's the case,

808
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,670
then let's say no more.

809
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,550
This cross-cupped wine

810
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,360
originally symbolizes the unity

811
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,510
of husband and wife,

812
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,440
never to be separated.

813
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:26,950
Now,

814
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,030
let's break

815
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,070
with this tradition

816
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,150
and use it as a symbol of farewell.

817
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,070
You have lofty aspirations,

818
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,400
and I will not detain you.

819
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,990
From this parting,

820
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,030
even if we meet again,

821
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,070
we will be strangers.

822
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,030
May your years ahead

823
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,440
flourish like bamboo,

824
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,390
rising steadily with each new chapter.

825
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,630
May you

826
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,320
soon find your perfect match

827
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,840
