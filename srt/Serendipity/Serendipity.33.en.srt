28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,600
Su Tangli,

29
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,640
I know you usually

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,310
handle things carefully.

31
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,920
Why are you so careless this time?

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,600
Your Highness,

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,070
are you doubting me?

34
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,190
It's okay.

35
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,560
You saved my life.

36
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,200
As long as you wish,

37
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,430
I'll risk

38
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,680
my life

39
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,560
to earn your trust.

40
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,120
Stay still.

41
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,980
Don't move.

42
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,620
If you don't want scars...

43
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,980
Reward merit,

44
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,140
punish error.

45
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,020
That's my rule.

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,340
This discipline

47
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,660
is for your own good.

48
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,060
I...

49
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,420
I understand.

50
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Only you

51
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,680
deserve such meticulous care

52
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,900
from me.

53
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,300
Your Highness,
thanks for your patience.

54
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,100
I'm flattered.

55
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,140
In my current state,

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,940
I would only offend your sight.

57
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,340
I beg leave to retire.

58
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,980
Where can you go in this state?

59
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,420
I command you

60
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,660
not to go anywhere

61
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,340
but stay here.

62
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,580
I'll take care of you personally.

63
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,890
(Wei Mansion)
Report any developments

64
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,020
in the capital to me in time.

65
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,860
Yes.

66
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,140
Uncle Wei,

67
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,140
this is

68
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,730
the preserved ginger
my mother asked to deliver.

69
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,860
Thank your mother for me.

70
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,340
I'm on my way to see Reviewer Lu.

71
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,140
You must be his sister?

72
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,100
This is?

73
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,340
This is Cao Hai, Deputy Commander

74
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,740
of the Jianglin Prefecture Garrison.

75
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,580
Greetings, General Cao.

76
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,300
(Wei Mansion)
Is Reviewer Lu at home?

77
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,660
May I request an audience?

78
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,620
He remains at the Supreme Court

79
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,450
and hasn't gone home yet.

80
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,740
In that case,

81
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,740
I'll return another time.

82
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,940
(Xuanyi Hall)

83
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,140
Are you working late?

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,700
Have some chrysanthemum tea.

85
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,660
Okay.

86
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,380
I met Deputy Commander Cao today.

87
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,620
He would like to meet you.

88
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,460
We already met at the Supreme Court.

89
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,940
No need for formalities.

90
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,940
Maybe he seeks a connection

91
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,380
through our shared Jianglin ties.

92
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,020
We'll discuss it later.

93
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,680
If there's nothing,

94
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,740
I'll say goodbye, Buddy.

95
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,260
Wait.

96
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,380
You may go,

97
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,380
but address me properly.

98
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,780
Address what?

99
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,380
What do you think?

100
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,340
Lu Chang?

101
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,580
Remember this.

102
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,380
Go.

103
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,140
Cao Hai, Deputy Commander Cao.

104
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,700
(Top Scholar Residence)

105
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,260
General Cao.

106
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,580
The last time I visited,

107
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,700
Reviewer Lu was absent.

108
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,140
May I have the honor today?

109
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,060
Unlucky timing.

110
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,380
He is still busy at the Supreme Court.

111
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,480
Perhaps you could

112
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,780
visit him there directly?

113
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,900
I came here

114
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,140
for a chat.

115
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,180
My visit is not official.

116
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,220
As a newcomer,

117
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,760
I wonder

118
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,940
how the customs of the capital

119
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,140
compare to those of Jianglin.

120
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,460
The capital offers endless pleasures,

121
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,380
such as tea alleys

122
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,940
and night markets.

123
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,340
Please feel free

124
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,660
to wander around and enjoy.

125
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,060
However, I suffered from amnesia

126
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,890
and remember nothing of Jianglin.

127
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,810
So I can't compare.

128
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,100
My apologies.

129
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,180
I didn't know that.

130
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,100
I overstepped.

131
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,420
However,

132
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,060
this is the first time I've ever heard

133
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,460
of amnesia.

134
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,580
Is it really that severe?

135
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,140
Could there be

136
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,980
no memories at all?

137
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,420
If you ever

138
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,460
return to Jianglin with Reviewer Lu,

139
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,380
revisit the sights.

140
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,980
Memories

141
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,300
may resurface.

142
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,460
Remember to find me.

143
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,580
I'll treat you to some wine.

144
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,340
Thank you, General Cao.

145
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,020
Farewell.

146
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,340
Your servant Lu Wenhan

147
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,060
greets Your Majesty.

148
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,180
Director Lu, you're here.

149
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,260
Today's summons

150
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,780
is informal.

151
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,140
No need for rigid etiquette.

152
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,220
Thank you, Your Majesty.

153
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,820
I intended

154
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,100
to present you

155
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,060
with the rare manuscript

156
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,780
of Wenyuan Yinghua,

157
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
but Prince Yu

158
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,300
claimed it first.

159
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Prince Yu's scholarly zeal

160
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,540
pleases

161
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,780
me a lot.

162
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,980
Your Majesty,

163
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,500
what

164
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,660
a coincidence.

165
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,020
A few days ago,

166
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,420
Prince Yu offered me the book,

167
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,300
but I refused

168
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,460
because a gentleman

169
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,020
doesn't take other people's treasures.

170
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,340
Fine.

171
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,100
I'll find

172
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,660
other rare books

173
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,300
in the palace

174
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,220
for you.

175
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,210
Thank you, Your Majesty.

176
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,700
Director Lu,

177
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,780
according to you,

178
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,330
between Prince Yu

179
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,860
and Prince Rui,

180
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,380
who is better suited

181
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,970
to the throne?

182
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,260
Your Majesty,

183
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,700
the succession

184
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
concerns the fate of the nation.

185
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,980
I dare not

186
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,580
presume.

187
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,780
Director Lu,

188
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,780
I just said,

189
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,860
today

190
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,300
we seek casual conversation

191
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,820
instead of

192
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,980
national affairs.

193
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,300
Get up and speak freely.

194
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,340
Your Majesty...

195
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,060
Get up.

196
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,340
Speak.

197
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,700
Your Majesty,

198
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,580
I'll be frank

199
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,180
about this.

200
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,980
From my point of view,

201
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,020
both princes

202
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,420
are unique

203
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,460
and each has their own traits.

204
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,580
Prince Yu

205
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,340
is decisive

206
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,900
and commands royal authority.

207
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,260
Prince Rui

208
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,310
is gentle and elegant.

209
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,960
He embodies benevolence.

210
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,500
Both reflect

211
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Your Majesty's

212
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,700
wise tutelage.

213
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,900
It's a boon to Da'an.

214
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,700
Your Majesty,

215
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,660
whoever

216
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,380
inherits the throne,

217
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,660
I'll do my duty

218
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,060
and advise them faithfully.

219
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,260
Director Lu...

220
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,700
You are always

221
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,300
the meticulous diplomat.

222
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,510
As the princes of Da'an,

223
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,860
being diligent for the people

224
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,500
and taking care of everything

225
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,620
is their duty.

226
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,500
But Prince Yu...

227
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,260
Your Highness, have you gauged

228
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,940
His Majesty's intention
in summoning you?

229
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,260
Everything is

230
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,980
divine grace.

231
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,060
I'll know when I arrive.

232
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,540
Su Tangli

233
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,620
has been here for some time, right?

234
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,580
You mean...

235
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,460
With her intelligence,

236
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,220
won't she try to cultivate her own aide?

237
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,700
I'll go

238
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,660
and replace all the people around her,

239
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,740
so that

240
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,020
she can't act rashly.

241
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,300
Everyone,

242
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,220
since I took the throne,

243
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,980
peace

244
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,460
and prosperity

245
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,460
have flourished

246
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,860
through your diligence.

247
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,700
Today,

248
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,860
let me toast to you all.

249
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,940
Thank you, Your Majesty!

250
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,980
Sit down.

251
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,300
Stand down!

252
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,340
This banquet has just begun.

253
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,860
And you made a drunken disorder.

254
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,060
I heard you ask for rare books
with lots of money daily.

255
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,060
Is this the propriety learned

256
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,140
from your precious books?

257
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,180
Do you want to set Daqing Hall on fire?

258
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,740
Your Majesty,

259
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,260
I beg for punishment

260
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,540
for my impropriety.

261
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,380
You know that

262
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,460
today is the Spring Banquet
of all the nobles.

263
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,220
Yet you're so frivolous
and disrespectful.

264
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,540
I really don't understand

265
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,380
whether you are being disrespectful

266
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,420
or if you have lost respect for me.

267
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,780
There are still a few days left
before the Blessing Ceremony.

268
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,820
Since you are my eldest son,

269
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,220
I originally wanted you to take my place

270
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,460
to bless the people.

271
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,020
And yet you're being so reckless today.

272
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,020
How can you respect the heavens?

273
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,500
Forget it.

274
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,580
Leave this matter

275
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,460
to Prince Rui.

276
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,700
I'll humbly

277
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,940
obey.

278
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,980
I accept your orders

279
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,260
and will never

280
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,460
fail you.

281
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,560
It's so unpredictable.

282
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,460
The wind

283
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,220
is cold after leaving the hall.

284
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,740
Success or failure,

285
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,580
it's better to wait for clearer signs

286
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,770
before adjusting clothing.

287
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,820
You're wise.

288
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,260
Speculators.

289
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,140
I act for my own purposes.

290
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,860
Let the gossips gossip.

291
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,780
(Mingcheng Hall)

292
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,980
Your Highness,

293
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,740
(Complete Impartiality)
There is progress.

294
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,380
How is Su Tangli these days?

295
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,060
According to servants,

296
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,380
she remains confined and is recovering

297
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,220
without

298
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,660
any suspicious activity.

299
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,660
I'll see her.

300
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,140
(I can't get back to the room
before he does.)

301
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,860
(If he discovers my absence,)

302
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,460
(suspicion will be aroused.)

303
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,220
(Liluo Pavilion)

304
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,580
It's contrary to your report.

305
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,060
Your Highness,

306
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,460
there is

307
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,660
no record of Lady Su leaving today.

308
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,660
Search here immediately.

309
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,780
I need to know

310
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,980
where she is right now.

311
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,900
Your Highness,

312
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,460
we found Lady Su bathing.

313
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,580
Dismissed.

314
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,580
Your Highness,

315
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,060
has something happened?

316
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,220
In the bathroom,

317
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,060
I heard the guards looking for someone.

318
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,420
Unexpectedly,

319
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,260
they were looking for me.

320
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,740
Were you bathing?

321
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,740
Yes.

322
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,580
I was worried
about the scarring on my body.

323
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,780
I was seeking

324
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,620
the scar-healing properties
of the hot spring.

325
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,180
So I went to have a try.

326
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,380
Have I

327
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,460
broken your protocol?

328
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,660
Did you need to take a bath

329
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,660
at this hour?

330
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,620
Don't move.

331
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,340
You are Qilan, Madam's maid

332
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,530
in the Residence of Marquis Rongxin?

333
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,460
Yes.

334
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,700
This is the payment I promised earlier.

335
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,500
Just answer honestly.

336
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,380
I'm not here

337
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,700
for payment.

338
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,780
Madam's health is at stake.

339
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,180
Although I'm suspicious,

340
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,780
I was afraid to speak openly.

341
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,820
Since you want to investigate it,

342
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,500
I'll confess everything.

343
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,860
Lady, thank you.

344
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,220
As you said,

345
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,750
you also thought

346
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,700
Madam didn't get a sudden illness
at the banquet.

347
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,580
That's right.

348
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,130
She had always been healthy

349
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,260
and never had an old illness.

350
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,740
But on that day at the banquet,

351
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,780
she met Fourth Lady of Lu

352
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,900
and then suddenly fell ill.

353
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,420
I happened to see

354
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,260
that she touched

355
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,900
Madam's teacup.

356
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,500
So you think

357
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Madam was poisoned

358
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,300
by Fourth Lady of Lu?

359
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,580
Yes.

360
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,400
(Prudent in Thought, Diligent in Action)

361
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,020
The facts have now been revealed.

362
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,300
The real Fourth Lady of Lu

363
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,780
died last year.

364
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,020
The current Lu Wan'er

365
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,500
is an impostor.

366
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,260
She infiltrated the Lu Residence

367
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,380
under false pretences,

368
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,700
poisoned Madam

369
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,820
at the banquet

370
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,700
to gain the favor of Consort Chen

371
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,300
and His Majesty,

372
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,330
and sought to gain
the trust of Lu Zegang.

373
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,340
Since entering the Lu Residence,

374
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,660
Liu Wan'er has demonstrated

375
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,260
adaptable

376
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,700
and suitable

377
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,900
speech, behavior,

378
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,900
and tactics

379
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,180
beyond those

380
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,500
of an inexperienced

381
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,460
physician's daughter.

382
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,250
Her background must be extraordinary,

383
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,580
and her plans far-reaching.

384
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,940
That's right.

385
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,980
Liu Wan'er serves Prince Yu.

386
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,820
(Prudent in Thought, Diligent in Action)

387
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,340
Tangli?

388
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,180
Mr. Lu,

389
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,500
Mingshu.

390
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,340
Sit down.

391
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,220
Prince Yu

392
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,320
secretly tracked down the traffickers
from that year,

393
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,620
obtained old handkerchiefs,

394
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,130
and killed the real Lu Wan'er

395
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,220
after finding her.

396
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,260
And then

397
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,700
he replaced her with an impostor.

398
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,420
He conspired with that physician

399
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,820
to authenticate her identity.

400
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,820
I discovered this

401
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,860
at Prince Yu Residence.

402
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,860
Your Highness,

403
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,260
everything is going smoothly.

404
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,580
As predicted,

405
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,380
Lu Zegang now trusts Liu Wan'er.

406
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,460
Did Prince Yu

407
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,660
(Prudent in Thought, Diligent in Action)
send the impostor

408
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,980
to destroy evidence of Mr Su's case

409
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,660
in Lu Zegang's possession,

410
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,300
and even to eliminate Lu Zegang?

411
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,780
Correct.

412
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,380
If this evidence disappears,

413
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,100
our chance to overthrow Prince Yu

414
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,660
will also disappear.

415
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,660
But I suspect Prince Yu's ambitions

416
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,060
run deeper.

417
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,500
You're suggesting

418
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,620
that this plot

419
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,900
is not just against Lu Zegang?

420
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,660
Lu Zegang is the Minister of Works.

421
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,080
Recently,

422
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,280
the Ministry of Works has been preparing
for the Blessing Ceremony.

423
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,220
With the impostor

424
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,500
free to hold charity events

425
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,700
at the venue

426
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,300
and Prince Rui scheduled...

427
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,260
He was scheduled to ascend the altar.

428
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,380
Prince Yu plans to kill Prince Rui

429
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,330
during the ceremony.

430
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,550
No wonder His Majesty's assignment

431
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,380
of this honor

432
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,580
to Prince Rui

433
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,580
has met with no opposition.

434
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,900
At that time,

435
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,820
should Prince Rui perish,

436
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,540
Lu Zegang would face

437
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,100
execution and clan extinction.

438
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,500
A masterful two-birds-one-stone trick.

439
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,100
(Top Scholar Residence)

440
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,940
Tangli,

441
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,020
I know you're staying

442
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,420
with Prince Yu

443
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,580
for revenge,

444
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,460
but he's too cunning.

445
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,900
You must be careful.

446
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,620
Rest assured, Mr. Lu.

447
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,900
I have my own measurements.

448
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,380
But

449
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,340
even if we have proof

450
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,300
that Prince Yu harmed my father,

451
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,860
can we really overthrow him?

452
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,620
Trust Da'an's laws

453
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,860
to punish evil,

454
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,980
and justice

455
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,380
to prevail

456
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,860
in the hearts of people.

457
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,780
I hope so.

458
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:04,460
(Top Scholar Residence)

459
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,540
What?

460
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,860
Wan'er serves Prince Yu?

461
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,380
That's right.

462
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,540
Minister Lu, you wanted

463
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,900
to use your daughter

464
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,260
as political capital,

465
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,460
but instead,

466
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,700
you became

467
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,300
someone else's pawn.

468
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,260
Reviewer Lu,

469
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,820
you didn't just come

470
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,780
to mock me, right?

471
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,100
Now you're trapped

472
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,820
in Prince Yu's web,

473
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,500
facing execution

474
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,460
or clan annihilation

475
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,380
as the Minister of Works

476
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,380
if Prince Rui dies

477
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,580
during

478
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,460
the ceremony.

479
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,420
Your only recourse

480
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,300
is to

481
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,020
join us

482
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,260
and overthrow Prince Yu.

483
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,620
Maybe you'll survive.

484
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,060
Overthrow him?

485
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,220
But how?

486
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,900
Why should I trust you?

487
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,340
Trust me

488
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,300
means survival.

489
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,180
Refusal means...

490
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,860
That's all.

491
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,180
Reviewer Lu,

492
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,580
I'll do as you say.

493
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,020
After the Blessing Ceremony,

494
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,940
I'll provide proof
that Prince Yu framed Su Changhua.

495
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,020
But

496
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,300
you have to make sure

497
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,420
that in return,

498
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,260
Prince Rui must keep his promise

499
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,700
and guarantee my clan's safety.

500
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,540
Deal.

501
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,220
So Prince Yu

502
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,700
would sacrifice brotherly ties

503
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,300
for this plan.

504
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,020
Now that his dagger

505
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,180
is out of its sheath,

506
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,580
we can expose

507
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,730
his crimes

508
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,100
with a counter-strike.

509
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,440
But risks remain,

510
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,500
and our plans

511
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,100
may be flawed.

512
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,700
(Yongjing Terrace)

513
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,740
Stop!

514
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,100
(Minister of Works)

515
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,020
For the Blessing Ceremony,

516
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,940
three main streets around the altar

517
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,020
are sealed off.

518
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,020
Only authorized personnel

519
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,860
can enter,

520
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,060
with heavy guards

521
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,140
at each entrance.

522
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,660
The altar is heavily guarded.

523
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,340
Marshal personally oversees security.

524
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,900
Officials undergo

525
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,420
multiple checks.

526
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,460
Commoners can only

527
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,700
worship on the periphery

528
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,100
on that day.

529
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,580
They'll be unable to access.

530
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,260
Security

531
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,100
seems assured.

532
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,340
(Yongjing Terrace, Observation Deck,
Altar, Mountain Gate)

533
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,100
(Altar)

534
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,900
(Observation Deck)

535
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,780
(Observation Deck)

536
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,500
The observation deck.

537
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,300
That's right.

538
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,620
Prince Yu is probably

539
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,300
planning an ambush here.

540
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,780
Tightened defences

541
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,020
should prevent this.

542
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,820
(Altar)

543
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,620
(Altar)

544
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,300
(Altar)

545
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,340
What's wrong?

546
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,660
Now that

547
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,540
you know Prince Yu's intentions,

548
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,380
you must have plans.

549
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,500
I've been waiting for you to tell me.

550
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,340
If you've made your decision,

551
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,700
then act on it.

552
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,980
I won't stop you.

553
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,380
I'll make
all the necessary preparations,

554
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,380
but I'll need

555
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,100
your help.

556
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,740
Will you stand by me?

557
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,140
(Lu Chang,)

558
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,980
(just do it.)

559
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,420
(But be sure to come back safely.)

560
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,180
Rituals require ceremonial cleansing

561
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,940
and proper attire.

562
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,020
Let me quickly iron
this ceremonial robe for you.

563
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,860
Mingshu,

564
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,300
enough.

565
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,740
Let me look at you.

566
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,540
What is there to see?
You see me every day.

567
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,340
This is different.

568
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,340
Today is different.

569
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,380
I know what you're going to say.

570
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,260
Remember what I said.

571
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:20,900

How is your health?

594
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,340
I'm just infected with a cold.

595
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,260
It's okay.

596
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,950
Why do you forbid my presence
at the Blessing Ceremony?

597
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,820
Normally,

598
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,940
I'd wish you to join me,

599
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,820
but your illness

600
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,300
could lead

601
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,140
to false accusations

602
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,420
of impiety.

603
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,140
Rest well.

604
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,300
I prioritize duty,

605
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,460
but regret

606
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,020
missing

607
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,620
your glorious moment.

608
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,820
Lady, the latest styles here.

609
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,740
I'll take this one.

610
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,700
Here.

611
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,020
Take care.

612
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,220
Lady, come and take a look.

613
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,860
(Lu)
How about this one?

614
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,460
Since Lu Zegang

615
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,590
has evidence against Prince Yu...

616
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,500
Thank you.

617
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,540
Prince Yu may

618
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,980
use Lu Wan'er.

619
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,940
Watch them closely.

620
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,700
I'll let Tangli

621
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,630
keep an eye on Lu Residence.

622
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,860
(Lu Wan'er)

623
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,620
(never left here.)

624
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,940
(Could our assumptions)

625
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,940
(be wrong?)

626
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,140

(An)

630
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,020
Prince Rui,

631
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,300
the Imperial Astronomer
says the ceremony

632
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,740
must be delayed an hour.

633
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,340
Please wait inside

634
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,300
and take a break.

635
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,860
Okay.

636
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,500
Lu Chang,

637
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,400

638
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,580
these days.

639
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,700
After I ascend the altar,

640
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,180
I'll leave

641
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,580
the rest with you.

642
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,500
You embody the fortune of the empire.
