Prince Yu is wreaking havoc.

Cao Hai has slaughtered

31
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,480
the Jian Family for him.

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,840
If you care about me,

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,120
don't give in!

34
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,720
Otherwise, I'll never forgive you.

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,320
Do you hear me?

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,440
Is that so?

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,160
Really?

38
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,750
In that case,

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,240
I'll kill her

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,320
right before your eyes.

41
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,310
Wait!

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,440
Mr. Lu.

43
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,310
You finally came.

44
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,190
Save Mingshu.

45
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,790
Su Tangli,

46
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,210
long time no see.

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,360
Are you here to kill me?

48
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,940
Don't you want the tiger tally?

49
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,540
Take it!

50
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,700
I don't trust you!

51
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,140
Lu Chang, are you insane? The tally

52
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,580
is worth more than my life!

53
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,020
You can take the tally.

54
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,780
But release Mingshu.

55
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,180
No.

56
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,180
No.

57
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,020
I can release her.

58
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,100
But you must

59
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,500
hand it over yourself.

60
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,900
Mingshu.

61
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,460
Let her go.

62
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,900
You fooled me?

63
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,060
What do you think?

64
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,780
I know you better

65
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,100
than you think, Your Highness.

66
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,860
You don't

67
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,740
trust anyone except

68
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,700
your mother.

69
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,180
So I guessed

70
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,740
you hid the tally

71
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,140
in her former chambers.

72
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,420
And I was right.

73
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,340
This longevity lock

74
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,500
symbolizes your auspicious birth,

75
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,580
yet today marks your doom.

76
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,020
Isn't that ironic?

77
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,340
You stole my half of tiger tally.

78
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,060
Where is it now?

79
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,300
If I'm not mistaken,

80
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,620
Prince Rui's troops are storming the palace.

81
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,140
(Mingde Gate)
(An)

82
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,900
Mother.

83
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,420
Director Lu,

84
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,060
it's your turn.

85
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,900
Yes.

86
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,020
Prince Rui,

87
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,140
this is urgent.

88
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,260
I can't

89
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,340
go into details with you.

90
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,940
Your Highness,

91
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,100
you must rescue His Majesty

92
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,580
and Lu Chang.

93
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,020
The half of the tally hidden in the palace,

94
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,660
I surrender it to you!

95
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,940
How dare you!

96
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,300
- Your Highness.
- Mr. Lu.

97
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,500
You must save His Majesty.

98
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,340
You must save

99
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,500
Chang.

100
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,980
Guard!

101
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,700
The tiger tally is here!

102
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,220
Rally to protect the throne!

103
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,540
Capture the traitors!

104
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,940
Open the palace gate!

105
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,580
Tangli,

106
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,500
do you truly hate me so much?

107
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,580
I once

108
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,500
told you

109
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,780
that you only had to behave.

110
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,700
Those words weren't lies.

111
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,140
I'm afraid I must disappoint you.

112
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,060
My heart

113
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,980
holds only vengeance for you.

114
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,060
Never love!

115
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,340
Su Tangli!

116
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,020
Seize the traitors!

117
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,180
Brother,

118
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,460
cease this delusion.

119
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,340
Don't you know

120
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,660
that Father hates to see

121
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,180
siblings harm each other?

122
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,220
Yet

123
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,500
you've committed treason.

124
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,900
Spare me your sanctimony, Prince Rui.

125
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,260
You colluded with the consort,

126
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,260
harmed His Majesty,

127
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,060
stole the tiger tally,

128
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,020
and incited two military offices to rebel!

129
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,300
As the righteous army,

130
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,300
why should I fear the treacherous?

131
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,420
Soldiers!

132
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,380
Whoever beheads Prince Rui,

133
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,460
I will confer upon him

134
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,620
the title of first-rank duke!

135
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,740
Who dares?

136
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,980
Is your so-called righteous army

137
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,220
the army bribed the Palace Guard

138
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
to stage a coup in my absence,

139
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,060
trying to usurp the throne?

140
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,340
Marshal,

141
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,580
Prince Yu raised a private army.

142
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,900
What I've done is a tactical necessity!

143
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,260
All the Palace Guard,

144
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,420
have you seen this?

145
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,980
This is the fate of a traitor!

146
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,500
Will you still

147
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,900
serve this usurper?

148
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,780
You're Prince Yu's private troops.

149
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,540
You know better than us

150
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,420
his tyranny against the people

151
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,900
over the years.

152
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,940
If you were not forced,

153
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,700
would you die

154
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,140
for this tyrant?

155
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,420
Treason dooms your entire lineage.

156
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,780
Your parents and children

157
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,300
will be punished with you.

158
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,460
If you halt before the cliff's edge

159
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,500
and switch to the righteousness,

160
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,820
you may be spared.

161
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,540
Think twice before you act

162
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,340
and don't make a grave mistake!

163
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,060
He's right!

164
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,900
Why should we risk our entire lineages

165
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,140
for Prince Yu's treason?

166
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,220
We switch to the righteousness.

167
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,620
Spare us, Your Highness!

168
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,700
Spare us, Your Highness!

169
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,860
Prince Yu,

170
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,300
the tide has turned.

171
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,420
Why don't you surrender your arms?

172
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,420
I will never surrender.

173
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,740
Heaven is unjust!

174
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,500
You granted me auspicious signs and promise,

175
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,100
yet why did you

176
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,500
let Prince Rui strip it all away?

177
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,060
No one stripped anything.

178
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,780
You defied the natural order.

179
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,420
Heaven itself rejects you.

180
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,620
This is

181
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,460
your own doing.

182
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,660
I've always lived without regrets.

183
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,780
Even if I die,

184
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,820
I'll never

185
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,420
become your captive.

186
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,980
Everyone stay back.

187
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,620
Su Tangli,

188
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,540
are you going to mock me?

189
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,100
I'm glad

190
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,100
you lived to see this day.

191
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,620
Thank you

192
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,780
for letting me

193
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,460
fulfill my wish.

194
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,420
Well?

195

Chang,

228
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,380
I've been waiting for you.

229
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,260
This is yours.

230
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,420
I've kept it safe for you.

231
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,820
So you still refuse

232
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,420
to acknowledge me as your father?

233
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,060
What must I do

234
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,420
to earn your recognition?

235
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,380
Father.

236
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,740
You finally call me Father.

237
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,980
This soothes

238
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,460
my heart.

239
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,460
Son,

240
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,660
my dear son.

241
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,620
In my heart,

242
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,060
I support the reforms too.

243
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,500
If I were to

244
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,780
publicly defend Su Changhua now,

245
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,100
it would only reignite conflict

246
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,340
and turmoil.

247
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,660
(Father, )

248
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,180
(I misjudged you.)

249
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,060
(It's too late for me to know that.)

250
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,500
(An)

251
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,260
Your brother

252
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,420
deserved his death,

253
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,340
but

254
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,220
he was still my son.

255
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,180
When I'm gone,

256
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,700
have his bones

257
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,300
quietly laid

258
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,300
in the imperial mausoleum.

259
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,300
Let it honor the bond

260
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,020
we shared as father and son.

261
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,700
Your son

262
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,900
obeys Your Majesty's decree.

263
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,740
Jingran,

264
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,460
the succession edict,

265
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,980
I've

266
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,260
had it written already.

267
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,060
I believe

268
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,340
that you will

269
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,020
rule well

270
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,540
with great compassion.

271
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,500
I know

272
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,220
you crave

273
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,300
sweeping reforms.

274
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,780
However,

275
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,300
to govern a major country

276
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,540
is to steer a ship through stormy seas.

277
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,540
You should hold the rudder steady

278
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,260
and adapt to the tides

279
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,740
to reach...

280
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,180
to reach...

281
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,900
safe shores.

282
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,660
Your Majesty's teaching

283
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,740
is concise but profound.

284
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,540
I'll

285
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,220
keep it in mind.

286
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,140
Will you

287
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,460
call me

288
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,180
Father again?

289
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,900
Father.

290
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,140
(An)

291
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,140
(Daqing Hall)

292
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,460
(An)

293
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,460
(An)

294
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,900
Third Prince Zhao Jingran

295
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,100
is intelligent, prudent,

296
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,020
merciful, and benevolent,

297
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,450
is capable

298
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,940
of spreading profound virtue

299
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,540
to pacify and guide various regions.

300
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,760
Therefore,

301
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,100
you shall ascend the throne

302
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,420
as Emperor.

303
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,780
Your mother is made the Empress Dowager

304
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,140
and your consort is the Empress.

305
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,980
You shall follow the way of Heaven

306
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,780
and ensure the prosperity of the realm.

307
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,860
So decreed.

308
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,820
Long live the Emperor!

309
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,660
Lu Chang,

310
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,220
now that I've ascended the throne,

311
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,020
I'll entrust you with leading the reforms.

312
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,300
Why do you insist

313
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,700
on governing Jianglin as a prefect?

314
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,540
Your Majesty,

315
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,620
through studying my late mentor's works,

316
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,980
I understand that reforms

317
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,380
cannot be rushed,

318
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,140
instead, they must advance gradually.

319
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,740
Thus, I decide

320
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,220
to test the reforms locally.

321
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,180
Once proven effective,

322
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,100
I shall return to assist Your Majesty

323
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,420
in enacting sweeping reforms.

324
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,380
These words

325
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,380
echo my late father's

326
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,420
final counsel.

327
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,380
All right.

328
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,820
I'll await the good news

329
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,180
of your pioneering efforts.

330
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,020
I have

331
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,140
one more request.

332
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,260
Speak freely.

333
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,180
The late Emperor

334
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,500
decreed Mingshu's marriage to Qingzhao.

335
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,250
I implore Your Majesty to revoke this edict

336
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,260
and permit Mingshu and I to wed.

337
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,020
Impossible.

338
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,060
The imperial marriage edict

339
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,660
states Lu Mingshu.

340
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,140
But now,

341
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,060
there is only Jian Mingshu.

342
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,700
Where is the so-called Lu Mingshu?

343
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

344
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,700
(Hualang Pavilion)

345
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,340
Here, be careful.

346
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,980
Careful.

347
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,020
Lu Chang is going back to Jianglin

348
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,100
and you're leaving too.

349
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,980
We hate to part with you.

350
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,900
I'm returning to Jianglin,

351
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,500
but not with him.

352
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,260
Then what's your plan?

353
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,340
Two years remain in my mourning period.

354
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,380
We've vowed

355
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,540
to focus solely

356
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,780
on our duties until then.

357
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,700
He pursues his reforms.

358
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,860
I'll return to my old residence

359
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,380
and rebuild my family's legacy.

360
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,780
So,

361
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,180
only after my mourning ends,

362
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,420
will we marry.

363
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,820
Rest assured.

364
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,710
In these two years,

365
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,380
we'll manage Hualang Pavilion well,

366
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,900
expanding its reach

367
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,020
across the country

368
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,460
as envisioned

369
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,820
to shelter women all over the realm.

370
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,100
With Manager Yuanying and I at the helm,

371
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,300
Your Majesty

372
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,180
only needs to focus

373
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,980
on the baby you carry.

374
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
I'd like

375
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,220
to propose a toast to you all.

376
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,260
You kindly appointed me

377
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,900
as the manager of Hualang Pavilion.

378
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,860
I'll live up to your trust,

379
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,420
honor the mission of Hualang Pavilion,

380
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,140
and uplift women in need.

381
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,980
To our manager!

382
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,540
Qingzhao,

383
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,940
what are your plans now?

384
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,620
With Prince Yu's death,

385
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,100
the anti-reform faction

386
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,060
lies crippled.

387
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,300
I'll stay in the capital

388
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,540
to drive the reforms forward,

389
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,860
waiting for you to return.

390
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,580
Here.

391
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,620
A toast, everyone!

392
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,420
Today's farewell

393
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,060
is but a prelude to reunion.

394
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,580
To our future reunion,

395
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,740
long live.

396
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,220
Long live.

397
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,300
(Tablet of My Late Father Lu Wenhan)

398
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,860
Father,

399
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,380
throughout your life,

400
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,500
you adhered to the doctrine of the mean

401
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,420
and preserved yourself with prudence.

402
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,660
But when the court faced peril,

403
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,340
you defended righteousness

404
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,900
with your own body.

405
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,420
(Tablet of My Late Father Lu Wenhan)
By aiding Prince Rui,

406
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,020
you spared the palace from bloodshed.

407
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,180
You deserve the respect of your son

408
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,700
and even all the people of Da'an.

409
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,380
You always prized family honor

410
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,540
and pursued power.

411
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,460
Unexpectedly, you sacrificed yourself

412
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,780
for your son and Da'an ultimately.

413
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,820
I admire you deeply.

414
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,660
I'm also grateful to you.

415
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,020
Though we have no chance

416
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,580
to be husband and wife in this life,

417
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,340
you'll forever remain Chang's father.

418
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,780
Rest assured.

421
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,560
keeps your place.

(Tablet of My Late Father Lu Wenhan)

423
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,540
May you

424
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,900
find peace in the lower world.

425
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,700
May your soul

426
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,060
rest in eternal peace.

429
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,180
Lady Mingshu,

430
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,700
boating with my colleagues recently

431
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,820
reminded me of our time sailing together.

432
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,300
I wonder

433
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,940
how you are doing these days?

434
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,700
Young Master,

435
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,820
you often write letters to Lady Mingshu,

436
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,980
but why do you never send any?

437
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,980
(To Mingshu)

438
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,020
These are not for her,

439
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,820
but for myself.

440
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,100
Lady Mingshu

441
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,620
and Mr. Lu's marriage is settled.

442
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,260
Young Master,

443
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,900
do you still refuse to let go?

444
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,260
Why must I let go?

445
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,820
Isn't it good

446
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,300
to entrust everything to time?

447
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,620
(Nan'an Studio)

448
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,180
(Mingshu)

449
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,420
(Two years later)
Come and have a look!

450
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,940
- Fresh fruits and vegetables!
- I'll browse a bit more.

451
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,300
Come, come! Take a look!

452
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,820
Dear folks,

453
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,100
(National Peace and People's Prosperity)
Jianglin's complex terrain

454
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,860
brings frequent disasters.

455
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,500
When disasters strike,

456
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,300
your harvest will be affected unavoidably.

457
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,980
Though no one starves from poor harvests,

458
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,860
such losses shouldn't

459
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,900
fall on you alone.

460
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,780
So, starting today,

461
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,300
we'll implement a new policy,

462
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,820
the Loan Act.

463
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,900
Each February and May,

464
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,740
during food shortage between two harvests,

465
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,900
the government will loan silver

466
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,940
and grain

467
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,700
at 1% interest over six months,

468
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,380
repayable with summer and autumn taxes.

469
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,580
This will help you

470
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,100
get through natural disasters smoothly.

471
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,180
In that case,

472
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,140
we won't have to

473
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,860
worry about floods

474
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,060
and droughts anymore!

475
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,980
Prefect Lu

476
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,380
is truly a father

477
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,500
to the people!

Our thanks!

479
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,580
This is my bound duty.

You're welcome.

Please line up

482
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,780
to register loan amounts.

483
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,220
One at a time.

484
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,580
Thank you, sir.

485
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,620

- Great!
- Bravo!

Today marks the second anniversary

498
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,220
of Jian's Gold Shop's reopening.

499
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,140
I'd like

500
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,340
to thank the folks who offered

501
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,020
unwavering support to us

502
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,980
and patronized our business.

503
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,140
On behalf

504
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,780
of my father and the Jian Family,

505
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,700
I sincerely thank you all.

506
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,140
I'll keep this kindness in my heart.

507
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,540
- Great!
- Good!

508
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,200
Now you can find Hualang Pavilion

not just in the capital and Jianglin,

but in all the prefectures and counties.

511
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,580
If any of you need help,

512
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,460
feel free to ask!

513
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,780
- Great!
- Wonderful!

(Jianglin Prefecture)

515
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,180
Last year, though Jianglin suffered drought,

516
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,820
our prefecture still held surplus silver.

517
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,420
Now Zhangyang is devastated.

518
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,660
We cannot

519
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,860
stand idly by.

520
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,700
But Prefect Lu,

521
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,500
grain prices are soaring due to the disaster.

522
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,700
Our reserves

523
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,180
may not stretch far enough.

524
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,860
If Zhangyang

525
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,300
fails to overcome this crisis,

526
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,740
hunger and cold could spark unrest.

527
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,660
The consequences would be unimaginable.

528
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,020
Indeed.

a lady outside

claims to be

532
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,980
your sister.

533
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,620
Bring her in at once.

534

Sir,

535
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,980
you'd better see for yourself.

536
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,180
She's brought carts of goods,

537
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,500
all parked outside the gates.

Why did you come?

00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,980
I missed you.

546
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,620
And this is...

Jian's grain.

549
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,980

(Jianglin Prefecture)

551
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,660
On behalf of Jianglin's people,

552
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,620
I thank you.

554
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,500
don't paint me as some saint.

I came

556
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,820
because of you.

557
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,500
Then I

558
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,900
thank you, honey.

559
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,740
Save the formalities, Prefect Lu.

560
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,620
Let's go.

(Jianglin Prefecture)

562
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,140
(These are exploitative acts
by previous officials who must be dismissed.)

563
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,100
The Loan Act

564
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,940
relieves the people of extra taxes

565
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,380
yet fills state coffers.

566
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,820
The Trade Act suppresses prices

567
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,260
and curbs profiteers' exploitation.

568
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,620
The Price Stabilization Act

569
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,220
cuts labor costs and eases farmers' burdens.

Jianglin's revenues

572
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,940
have doubled.

574
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,380
your reforms

575
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,860
have achieved remarkable results.

576
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,860
Only by Your Majesty's mandate

577
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,660
granting my autonomy

578
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,740
in governance,

579
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,180
could such modest gains be achieved.

580
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,580
May Your Majesty, endowed with sagacity,

581
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,880
discern human affairs

582
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,980
and never slack off until the end.

583
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,260
The time for great deeds

584
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,420
is today.

585
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,020
Indeed, Your Majesty.

586
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,220
To transform customs

587
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,100
and establish new laws

588
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,980
is the urgent task of today.

589
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,860
Your Majesty,

590
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,460
should you heed this counsel,

591
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,940
Prefect Lu's words

592
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,700
may bring boundless blessings to the realm.

593
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,020
We await

594
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,140
your wise judgment!

595
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,380
We await your wise judgment!

596
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,660
Dear ministers,

597
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,540
rise.

598
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,180
Even during my days as the prince,

599
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,540
I desired to purge old ills.

600
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,260
But my late father's final admonition

601
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,780
was governing without drastic measures.

602
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,300
So I've

603
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,300
been slow in promoting reforms.

604
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,860
Now witnessing Mr. Lu's

605
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,220
proven success,

606
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,380
my doubts are dispelled.

607
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,220
By my decree,

608
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,140
Lu Chang

609
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,540
is appointed State Counsellor.

610
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,150
Establish the Bureau of Reforms

611
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,340
under his charge.

612
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,740
His Jianglin policies,

613
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,820
reclamation, canal dredging, relief,

614
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,540
price stabilization, and tax allocation,

615
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,700
shall be implemented

616
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,180
as the New Laws

617
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,180
and be promulgated throughout the realm.

618
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,740
Your Majesty is wise.

619
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,300
Who is Top Scholar Wu?

620
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,260
Our Lady Wanshu demands

621
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,860
only the Top Scholar!

622
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,740
Presumptuous!

623
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,060
What rank does your master hold

624
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,700
to dare snatch a groom from the Wang Family?

625
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,700
Groom-snatching is first-come-first-served!

626
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,060
Who cares about that?

627
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,380
Exactly.

628
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Exactly.

629
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,180
- Congrats, Mr. Wu.
- Congrats, Mr. Wu.

630
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,420
- Thanks.
- Congratulations.

631
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,820
Over there. Catch him!

632
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,260
- Catch him.
- Go catch him!

633
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,140
Hurry!

634
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,340
Over there!

635
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,520
Catch him!

636
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,440
Hurry up!

00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,790

639
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,700

Hurry up and catch him!

642
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,900
You're mistaken.

643
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,860
I'm State Counsellor Lu Chang,

644
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,620
not a scholar who passed the exam.

645
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,060
No mistake.

646
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,020
You're exactly the target.

647
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,380
Our lady ordered us

648
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,700
to snatch you

649
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,020
through heaven and earth.

650
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,420
Who is your lady?

651
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,100
