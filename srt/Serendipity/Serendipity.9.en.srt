Don't you recognize me?

(Charming Demeanor)

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,480
A newcomer?

32
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,740
(Young Master)

33
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,710
Hello, Young Master.

34
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,710
Wait a minute.

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,120
What's in the box?

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,200
It's nothing. You...

37
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,680
Good.

38
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,710
How dare you steal the dangling hairpin
bestowed by Her Highness!

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,650
This was meant for Liu Yuanying

40
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,040
to present
during the auspicious ceremony.

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,950
It arrived broken.

42
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,500
I repaired it
and need to deliver it urgently.

43
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,000
You dare make excuses for theft?

44
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,990
Come with me.

45
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,990
Let go...

46
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
- Come with me!
- Release me!

47
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,430
Lady Yuanying!

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,190
- Lady Yuanying, how is it?
- Yeah.

49
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,200
Let's wait a bit longer.

50
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,220
(Mengying Pavilion)

51
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,800
What's going on?

52
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,960
Wasn't everything arranged?

53
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,590
I don't know.

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,000
But surely, nothing's amiss.

55
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,560
Mother-in-law, don't worry.

56
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,800
Have some snacks.

57
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,750
Stay calm.

58
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,310
It's your turn.

59
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,400
Why the delay?

60
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,630
I'm anxious too,

61
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,540
but...

62
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,560
the ceremonial hairpin hasn't arrived.

63
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
Such an important matter.

64
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,310
Why wasn't it prepared earlier?

65
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,870
It must be coming soon.

66
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,800
Soon? What do we do now?

67
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,360
You all, go wait backstage.

68
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,080
Move faster!

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,310
Hurry up!

70
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,310
Let go!

71
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,590
Master!

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,360
How dare you trick me?

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,830
With so many guests today,

74
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,140
if the hairpin isn't delivered promptly,

75
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,420
the Lu Family's reputation will suffer.

76
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,390
If Master

77
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,310
blames you later...

78
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,150
Stop!

79
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,790
You can leave

80
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,920
if you tell me your name.

81
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,910
And where do you work?

82
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,590
Young Master Lu!

83
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,910
Mr. Song.

84
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,390
We've been searching.

85
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,920
So you're lingering here.

86
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,680
Everyone's waiting for you.

87
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,040
I apologize for the poor hospitality.

88
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,750
Then... after you.

89
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,630
Young Master Lu, you first.

90
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,640
Mr. Song, please.

91
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,560
Lady Yuanying.

92
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,440
It's fixed.

93
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,870
Thank you, Lady Muqing.

94
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,160
Go quickly. Don't worry.

95
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
the dance just now inspired me

96
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
to improvise.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,800
I hope I didn't disrupt your enjoyment.

98
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,750
No need to apologize, Mr. Wensheng.

99
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,120
The music

100
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,510
enhanced the banquet.

101
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
There are more wonders await.

102
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,360
Let's take a look.

103
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,920
Nice dancing.

104
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,470
Looks good.

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,240
Wearing Her Highness'
gifted dangling hairpin

106
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
truly elevates one's grace.

107
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,190
Shameless!

108
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,530
- What are you doing?
- How can you hit her?

109
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,160
The lead dancer should've been me.

110
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,950
You stole everything

111
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,160
by seducing Young Master!

112
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,240
Go fight for it yourself.

113
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,190
What's wrong with hitting me?

114
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,070
What's happening?

115
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,680
I clearly gave her the broken hairpin.

116
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,000
Did someone help her?

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,120
Fellow women, fellow sufferers.

118
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,440
Why torment each other?

119
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,360
You know Young Master's nature.

120
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,840
Yuanying has no choice.

121
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,600
If you can't defy him,

122
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,150
why bully the helpless?

123
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,480
Even if you ruin Yuanying,

124
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,000
what changes?

125
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,440
Why did Lady Mingshu come
to the Lu Residence?

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,870
Perfect.

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,890
You skipped the banquet

128
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,600
to wait for her.

129
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,000
She acts with purpose.

130
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,150
There must be a reason.

131
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,910
It's truly intriguing.

132
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,990
Mingshu.

133
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,110
Mr. Lu,

134
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,440
you're here too?

135
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,280
What are you...?

136
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,210
Shh.

137
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,440
Quiet.

138
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,720
We posed

139
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,080
as a performing couple

140
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,030
to stay here.

141
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,790
Buddy, thank goodness
for Mr. Song earlier.

142
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,440
I almost got caught by Lu Wencai.

143
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,680
A couple?

144
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,870
I see.

145
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,480
You're investigating Liu Xiankun, right?

146
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,320
That's right.

147
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
Please keep this a secret, Mr. Song.

148
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,440
Mr. Lu, rest assured.

149
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,200
Mr. Song, are you here for the banquet?

150
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,630
Indeed.

151
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,030
I expected boredom,

152
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,600
but found you instead.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,910
How I envy

154
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,080
your freedom.

155
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,680
Unlike me,

156
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,270
who needs parental approval
to leave home.

157
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,790
Envy us?

158
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,200
Many people in the world would envy you.

159
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,360
Everything has two sides.

160
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,910
Your filial devotion to family

161
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,960
is admirable.

162
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,390
You flatter me.

163
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,360
Working with you at the Yin Residence

164
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
remains vivid.

165
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,030
How can I assist this time?

166
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,550
I'll do my utmost.

167
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,480
Mr. Song, you're so kind.

168
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,320
Feel free to seek us if needed

169
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,390
at the Lu Residence.

170
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,200
You're too polite, Lady Mingshu.

171
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,960
No need for formalities.

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,720
That attire suits you well.

173
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,510
You have good taste.

174
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,790
(Mr. Wensheng seems angry.)

175
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,910
(Lady Muqing remains oblivious.)

176
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,030
Lady Muqing.

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,080
Lady Yuanying.

178
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,280
Lady Muqing,

179
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,280
thank you.

180
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:44,790
It's nothing.

181
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,870
Life's hard.

182
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,240
We should help each other.

183
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,870
Besides, you've aided me before.

184
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,030
As a fellow dancer,

185
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,960
why don't you scorn me like others?

186
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,840
You're aloof

187
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,320
but kind-hearted.

188
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,480
Why should I scorn you?

189
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,600
But I'm still curious.

190
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,150
Why serve

191
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,670
the crude Lu Wencai

192
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,440
despite your renown?

193
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,150
Were you forced by him?

194
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,510
I'm not asking for fame,

195
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,440
only peace.

196
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,440
But as a courtesan,

197
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,390
how could I?

198
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Wensheng and I came from poverty,

199
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,000
working everywhere

200
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,440
tirelessly.

201
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,630
So that one day

202
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,080
we can save enough silver

203
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,360
to settle down.

204
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,840
We're fellow sufferers.

205
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,440
You're right.

206
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,200
I was really forced by Lu Wencai.

207
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,440
He threatened my brother's life.

208
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,630
If I refuse,

209
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,240
he'll kill my brother.

210
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,510
So,

211
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,840
even if people look down on me,

212
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,030
I have to endure disgrace.

213
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,000
Where's your brother now?

214
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,240
Have you seen him?

215
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,630
I don't know.

216
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,550
But he has

217
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,630
my brother's childhood jade pendant.

218
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,720
I believed him.

219
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,390
What if he never lets you meet him?

220
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,030
You'll remain his puppet?

221
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,080
But what can I do?

222
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,790
Any other family?

223
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,870
Let's not talk about this.

224
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,420
Let me ask you something.

225
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,320
Earlier, I saw you with Mr. Wensheng

226
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,150
and another nobleman.

227
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,080
You two

228
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,030
seemed very intimate.

229
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,870
Who was he?

230
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,550
He's one of my old friends.

231
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,390
Then I'll kindly remind you.

232
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,480
Don't get too close to the man.

233
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,240
You'll make Mr. Wensheng jealous.

234
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,510
Jealous?

235
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,270
He... he wouldn't.

236
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,680
He...

237
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,710
He wouldn't.

238
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,720
That Third Lady of Lu

239
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,270
kept pestering our Qingzhao.

240
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,840
Madam Lu

241
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,600
also hinted repeatedly

242
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,790
about marriage

243
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,630
with us,

244
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,390
abandoning all decorum.

245
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,390
With this style,

246
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,790
I'll never attend

247
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,840
their banquets again.

248
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,440
Darling, that's very true.

249
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,510
How can you stay calm

250
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,960
as a father?

251
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,000
What if

252
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,150
our son truly fancies

253
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,720
Third Lady of Lu?

254
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,670
Then what should we do?

255
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,120
I'll never allow

256
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,200
such a shallow girl

257
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,840
into our Song Family.

258
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,000
What can I say?

259
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,080
You're overreacting.

260
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,030
I raised our son.

261
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,790
What about my judgement?

262
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,150
Look in the mirror

263
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,240
and you'll know my taste.

264
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,990
Has he ever

265
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,960
cared for

266
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,670
noblewomen before?

267
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,080
Don't worry.

268
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,270
Third Lady of Lu won't tempt him.

269
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,840
Yeah.

270
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,790
Our Qingzhao has discerning tastes.

271
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,480
No ordinary girl

272
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,750
can impress him.

273
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,000
His vision is high.

274
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,550
Father, Mother.

275
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,080
I've returned
from Minister Lu's banquet.

276
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,000
So I came to greet you.

277
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,000
You've been tired.

278
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,960
Rest early.

279
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,030
You've neglected

280
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,840
studies for some chores lately.

281
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,150
From today,

282
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,390
submit daily essays

283
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,870
for my review.

284
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,200
I'm grateful

285
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,440
for your guidance.

286
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,920
Just in time,

287
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,440
I've got some new thoughts

288
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,480
on law and governance

289
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,360
to discuss with you.

290
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,630
Good...

291
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,240
Go back to rest now.

292
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,120
The banquet made you tired.

293
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,630
Please rest earlier.

294
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,910
I'll come to greet you tomorrow.

295
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,270
When did he become so dutiful?

296
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,000
But that's just it.

297
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,150
Still below

298
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,000
my expectations.

299
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,750
You're too harsh.

300
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,300
(That's for His Majesty to decide.)

301
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,630
Keep polishing.

302
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,920
Okay.

303
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,840
Master, do you have
to write an essay every day?

304
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,110
At least.

305
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,240
I need to write five essays today.

306
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,860
Five...?

307
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,550
Master, you've changed.

308
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,030
Prepare extras

309
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,150
to earn parental trust

310
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,150
for leaving home.

311
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,840
So it's for the Lu siblings.

312
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,990
No...

313
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,270
This must be for Lady Lu.

314
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,230
Now I understand

315
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,240
the sentence from Lao Zi,

316
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,270
"The softest

317
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,200
conquers the hardest."

318
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,550
Gentle methods work best

319
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,720
on stubborn parents.

320
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,200
The rest is useless.

321
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,590
It seems effective.

322
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,840
By the way,

323
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,440
fetch me governance books

324
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,640
from the study tomorrow.

325
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,830
And some political books
for the day after tomorrow.

326
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,680
Remember, ensure Father notices.

327
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,630
Okay.

328
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,350
Fellow women, fellow sufferers.

329
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,880
Why torment each other?

330
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,590
Today, we failed to punish Liu Yuanying.

331
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,030
I'll find another chance.

332
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,550
I'm not dwelling on that.

333
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,030
I'm pondering

334
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,030
Lady Muqing's words.

335
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,660
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

336
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,790
Young Master, why this anger?

337
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,960
I know you envy Liu Yuanying,

338
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,070
but consider the Lu Family's face!

339
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,590
Luckily, no disaster struck.

340
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,550
Otherwise, I'll never forgive you.

341
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,030
She tattled?

342
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,720
Young Master, I acted rashly.

343
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,350
Fortunately, no lasting harm was done.

344
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,280
Young Master.

345
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,240
Young Master, I'm sorry.

346
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,830
Never repeat this folly.

347
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,510
Otherwise, I'll punish you.

348
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,550
Lady, are you alright?

349
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,480
I'm fine.

350
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,310
I've endured this marriage

351
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,830
long enough.

352
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,310
He's a talentless,
lecherous piece of trash.

353
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,830
Just scum.

354
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,240
But my family forced this match.

355
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,590
What else can I do?

356
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
Blame that Liu Yuanying.

357
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,240
She's seducing him.

358
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,350
If you can't bear it,

359
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,110
I'll have her dealt with tomorrow.

360
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,560
Fellow women,

361
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,920
fellow sufferers.
Why torment each other?

362
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,750
You know Young Master's nature.

363
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,240
Yuanying has no choice.

364
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,270
If you can't defy him,

365
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,440
why bully the helpless?

366
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,160
Even if you ruin Yuanying,

367
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,510
what changes?

368
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,040
Never mind.

369
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,830
What's the point of ruining her?

370
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,200
Destroy her

371
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,510
and another will take her place.

372
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
What's the point?

373
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,590
Lady.

374
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,000
Where are you going so late?

375
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,110
My husband awaits me.

376
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,050
I was in a hurry to find him.

377
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,950
Wait a moment.

378
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,440
Your husband?

379
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,670
What's his identity?

380
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,720
Who cares?

381
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,640
Serve me well

382
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,160
and you'll want for nothing...

383
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,830
Wench! You hit me?

384
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,350
Darling!

385
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,830
Step away from my wife.

386
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,400
Or I'll make the Lu Family heirless.

387
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,960
How dare you two strike me?

388
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,960
This is the Lu Residence, my home!

389
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,550
I'll crush you

390
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,840
like two ants, you know?

391
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,120
The inheritance banquet approaches.

392
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,920
Everybody knows that the two of us

393
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,550
were invited by you.

394
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,030
If we have any missteps,

395
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,590
you'll be affected

396
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,160
and disgrace your family.

397
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,270
After the banquet,

398
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,680
you'll be dead.

399
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,590
Just wait.

400
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,030
Wait for me!

401
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,880
Is the cricket okay?

402
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,430
It's okay.

403
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,160
Buddy, it's good for you to beat him.

404
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,830
He can't even stand up straight.

405
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,440
Your hand is injured?

406
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,590
Something

407
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,720
in his clothes

408
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,280
scratched me.

409
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,860
It's nothing.

410
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,730
How could it be?

411
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,030
It's an internal injury.

412
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,400
Can you see it?

413
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,350
Of course, I can.

414
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,440
Let me check, Buddy.

415
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,540
(Lu Residence)

416
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,430
Mingshu,

417
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,000
how about me sleeping
on the floor instead?

418
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,750
No, the ground is too damp.

419
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,420
You'll definitely get sick
sleeping there.

420
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,720
This isn't proper either.

421
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,200
We're siblings. There are two quilts

422
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,540
with such wide space between them.

423
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,270
Besides, I sleep very still.

424
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,370
I'll press against the wall.

425
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,680
I won't move at all. Rest assured.

426
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,080
Let's sleep.

427
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,680
(Lu Chang, what on earth
are you thinking?)

428
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,400
Why idle

429
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,720
instead of practicing?

430
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,030
Perfect timing.

431
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,350
I need some advice.

432
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,590
What is it?

433
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,550
I...

434
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,160
I don't know what to say.

435
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,310
Mysterious.

436
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,680
I've seen a lot.

437
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,240
Typical lovelorn behavior.

438
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Stop it.

439
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,000
Do you fancy someone?

440
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,960
Impossible!

441
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,000
How is that impossible?

442
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,750
That nobleman

443
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,640
is obviously well-born.

444
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,920
He's your childhood sweetheart, right?

445
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,280
That nobleman?

446
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,190
You forgot?

447
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,550
I saw him the other day.

448
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,640
I warned you

449
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,920
to keep your distance

450
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,310
to avoid Wensheng's jealousy.

451
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,720
Now hearing your troubles,

452
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,110
I kind of get it.

453
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,880
It's like the old tales.

454
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,110
A fallen lady

455
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,960
parts with her love,

456
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,960
marries another

457
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,440
for her livelihood,

458
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,440
and then reunites with her ex.

459
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,960
But status divides them.

460
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,070
And public opinion matters.

461
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,240
They have to be parted.

462
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,980
(Grand Ambitions)

463
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,750
Smooth brushstrokes without stagnation.

464
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,110
Mr. Song, your painting excels.

465
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,420
(Yamo Pavilion)

466
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,200
Can we see Nongying Courtyard from here?

467
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,790
That's the garden.

468
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,590
You must be mistaken, Mr. Song.

469
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,720
Come here.

470
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Mr. Song, I recently painted

471
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,510
a flower-bird painting.

472
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,880
If you have time,

473
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,750
could you advise me?

474
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,510
I know little
about flower-bird painting.

475
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,920
I'm afraid I couldn't.

476
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,240
My apologies.

477
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,350
It was a bit stuffy in here.

478
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,920
I'll stroll the garden for air.

479
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,840
No...

480
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,840
Mr. Song!

481
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,500
(Yamo Pavilion)

482
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,590
Stuffy?

483
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,400
(Think how I acted with Buddy before.)

484
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,070
(I need to adjust quickly.)

485
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,240
I've been exhausted from practice.

486
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,110
I'm starving.

487
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,280
Eat more.

488
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,350
Your hands hurt again?

489
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,680
Lady Muqing is perfect

490
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,160
but oblivious.

491
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,000
Your husband's hand is injured.

492
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,550
He can't feed himself.

493
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,200
That's right.

494
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,000
Quick, feed him.

495
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,400
No need.

496
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,440
I can manage.

497
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,870
Enough.

498
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,830
You're too idle.

499
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,110
Lady Muqing trains hard every day.

500
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,950
Let's eat.

501
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,860
This is tasty.

502
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,070
Darling...

503
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,910
Open your mouth.

504
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,260
Look.

505
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,220
See?

506
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,000
That's so sweet.

507
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,460
What a couple.

508
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,240
Haven't you seen couples?

509
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,080
Stop it.

510
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,220
What are you laughing at?

511
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,550
Lady Muqing saw her husband's injury.

512
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,830
She's feeding him.

513
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,640
How romantic!

514
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,920
So enviable!

515
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,640
- I envy them too.
- All right, focus.

516
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,640
Yerong fell ill last night.

517
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,830
She can't dance anymore.

518
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,480
Muqing, you'll replace her.

519
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,590
Understood.

520
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,750
Hurry up and practice.

521
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,270
The rehearsal is in three days.

522
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,400
Three days?

523
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,350
So soon.

524
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,480
Though they're acting,

525
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,030
watching her
call another man Darling

526
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,240
stings.

527
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
If that's your worry,

528
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,240
you're overthinking.

529
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,030
They're siblings.

530
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,160
What could be wrong?

531
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,910
Right.

532
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,440
My foolish jealousy.

533
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,720
Mr. Song?

534
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,000
There are a few days
until the inheritance banquet.

535
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,200
Why did you come back today?

536
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,350
I'm concerned about the investigation.

537
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,880
Until the case is resolved,

538
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,440
I can't rest.

539
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,240
I get along quite well
with Lady Yuanying.

540
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,750
But she avoids mentioning Liu Xiankun.

541
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,960
Whenever I mentioned her father,

542
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,110
she would change the subject.

543
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,070
So I think the emotional approach

544
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,480
is failing.

545
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,270
To make her talk,

546
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,960
there are two conditions.

547
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,000
First,

548
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,350
ensure her brother's safety.

549
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,720
Buddy, you're right.

550
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,030
That's her priority.

551
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,240
If we could

552
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,590
free you from Lu Wencai,

553
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,240
would you go?

554
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,270
My brother's still captive.

555
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,550
I can't give up on him.

556
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,160
It's been so long.

557
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,680
And you still cling to a token

558
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,920
without meeting him?

559
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,640
He's controlling you.

560
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,490
What if

561
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,400
he's lying?

562
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,880
Second, she must realize

563
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,350
that her peril is

564
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,790
beyond humiliation.

565
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,400
It's more dangerous.

566
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,350
And we can save her.

567
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,720
The Imperial Music Office is official.

568
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,480
Although officials privately engage
in courtesans,

569
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,920
such acts inherently violate the law.

570
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,550
If you don't make plans early,

571
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,320
once the matter is exposed
and threatens him,

572
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,680
he might do anything

573
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,750
to protect himself.

574
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,160
Do you think he'd spare your life then?

575
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,790
He holds power.

576
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,070
How can I escape
while being a courtesan?

577
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
I appreciate your concern,

578
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,830
but you can't help either.

579
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,120
By using the inheritance banquet.

580
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,200
If she can expose Lu Wencai

581
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,400
during the banquet,

582
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,310
I can guarantee to help her escape.

583
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,830
Mr. Lu, are you planning
to kill two birds

584
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,750
with one stone?

585
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,590
To rescue Lady Yuanying

586
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,640
while preventing Lu Wencai
from entering the officialdom.

587
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,430
Exactly.

588
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,920
Hereditary appointments

589
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,550
only consider family background,

590
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,830
not talent or character.

591
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,590
How is this different
from selling official posts?

592
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,400
If scum like Lu Wencai

593
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,350
become officials,

594
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,750
how can the people live in peace?

595
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,000
I've witnessed these privileges
since childhood,

596
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,350
yet never realized

597
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,110
such common practices

598
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,400
had such flaws.

599
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,560
If the nation were filled
with Lu Wencai's ilk,

600
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,440
how could it endure?

601
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,960
This is one reason
why I support the new policy.

602
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,720
So you mean

603
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,750
we should ally with Lady Yuanying

604
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,830
and publicly expose

605
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,640
Lu Wencai's crimes at the banquet?

606
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,160
With Liu Yuanying's assistance,

607
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,960
exposing Lu Wencai
would carry more weight.

608
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,160
This is mutual aid.

609
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,150
Do you understand?

610
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,960
But she might distrust us

611
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,440
due to our lack of authority.

612
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
To be frank,

613
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,680
that nobleman is the legitimate grandson
of the Duke of the State.

614
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,920
With his help,

615
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
we will succeed.

616
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,160
Such a prominent background.

617
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,790
However, he's your childhood friend,

618
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,680
but unrelated to me.

619
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,550
Why would he help?

620
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,000
Let me handle this.

621
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,640
You're already married.

622
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,750
Expecting him

623
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,110
to risk offending the Lu Family
through past affection alone

624
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,750
is impossible.

625
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,510
Please don't give me false hope.

626
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,070
Let me personally

627
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,110
convince her.

628
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,510
If seen,

629
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,110
this might cause
unnecessary misunderstandings.

630
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,070
I have an idea.

631
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,000
Lady Yuanying seems

632
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,680
influenced by romantic tales,

633
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,200
currently misunderstanding

634
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,400
that Mr. Song is my long-lost
childhood sweetheart.

635
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,680
If we can make her believe

636
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,270
Mr. Song would sacrifice for me,

637
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,310
the problem might be resolved.

638
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,000
I know this sounds absurd.

639
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,070
If inappropriate,

640
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,550
forget I mentioned it.

641
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,110
If it helps solve difficulties,

642
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,270
I'll gladly assist.

643
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,590
No problem.

644
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,350
I'll cooperate.

645
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,320
Muqing!

646
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,880
Muqing, are you okay?

647
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,070
What are you doing?

648
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,480
Complete the act.

649
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,560
Here, watch out.

650
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,060
- Isn't this Mr. Song?
- Let me see.

651
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,760
Truly injured.

652
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,510
I know you practice hard.

653
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,030
Injuries are inevitable.

654
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,320
This ointment was
specially prepared for you.

655
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,720
Here, endure it.

656
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,960
How considerate.

657
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,590
No need.

658
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,720
Don't move.

659
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,840
It'll be quick.

660
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,320
Does it hurt?

661
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,280
How perfect they look.

662
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,320
Let's stop looking.

663
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,280
Mr. Wensheng!

664
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,720
Lady Yuanying,

665
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,720
what's the matter?

666
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,760
I...

667
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:51,630
I've heard
that your Qin melodies are exquisite.

668
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,480
Could you

669
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,550
copy the score for me?

670
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,070
Okay.

671
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,440
I'll bring it later.

672
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,190
But I need it now!

673
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,840
Mr. Wensheng!

674
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:13,920
What are you doing?

675
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,440
Don't misunderstand, Mr. Wensheng.

676
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,920
It's not what you think.

677
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,680
Darling,

678
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,880
we met by chance.

679
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,400
There's really nothing between us.

680
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,800
By chance?

681
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,630
You think I'll believe it?

682
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,880
Now that you're married to me,

683
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,070
you'll never see him again.

684
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,120
Come here!

685
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,720
Let her go!

686
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,190
Haven't you hurt her enough?

687
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,150
Muqing only loves me.

688
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,960
Only I can make her happy.

689
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,800
You have a fleeting fancy for her.

690
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,590
Stop pretending to be devoted.

691
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,840
With your family status,

692
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,590
can you decide your marriage?

693
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,190
With her background,

694
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,630
could she enter your noble house?

695
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,850
How can you make her happy?

696
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,150
I really mean it to her.

697
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,150
My feelings are genuine.

698
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,840
If you relent,

699
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,440
I'll do anything for her.

700
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,110
Regardless of the cost,

701
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,280
I'll marry her

702
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,290
and give her a happy life.

703
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,160
You're dreaming!

704
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,840
She's been mine all her life.

705
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,190
Give up!

706
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,450
He's hitting someone.

707
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,840
Darling!

708
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,820
- Your blood...
- What to do?

709
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,700
Is he okay?

710
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,030
Mr. Lu,

711
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,400
my apologies.

712
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,150
I got too immersed.

713
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,510
My fault.

714
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,190
Blame my foolish idea.

715
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,510
I didn't expect

716
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,510
such fine acting.

717
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,470
No matter.

718
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,590
Mr. Song was trying to help us.

719
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,360
How could I mind?

720
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
Thank you, Mr. Song.

721
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,510
Actually, acting

722
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,400
isn't entirely false.

723
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,280
In this story,

724
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,630
even if Muqing leaves Wensheng

725
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,880
for the nobleman,

726
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,110
difficulties remain.

727
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,230
Deepest affections would fade,

728
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,800
ending in parting

729
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,110
and lifelong regret.

730
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,350
Alright.

731
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,670
Now that Liu Yuanying believes

732
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,230
Mr. Song would sacrifice for Muqing,

733
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,280
we need step two.

734
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,880
Give her this Shuisheng Powder.

735
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,720
Whether she can
extract her brother's whereabouts

736
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,150
from Lu Wencai

737
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,400
depends on her.

738
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:50,820
(Yaji Hall)

739
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,630
Childhood sweethearts,

740
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,360
undying devotion.

741
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,840
If only this were real.

742
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,800
Why are you actually injured?

743
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,760
It's normal to practice dancing.

744
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,550
Let me see.

745
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,390
No need.

746
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,350
It's okay.

747
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,670
Let me take you out.

748
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,440
I'll handle the rest.

749
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,840
At this critical moment,

750
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,030
how can I quit?

751
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,190
I know you want to help,

752
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,550
but your safety matters most.

753
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,440
I can't bear you getting hurt.

754
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,880
I know you prioritize me, Buddy.

755
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,510
But you're

756
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,670
equally important to me.

757
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,920
Leaving now

758
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,320
would raise suspicion.

759
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,920
You're doing so much for your mentor.

760
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,480
My minor injury means nothing.

761
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,760
Thank you,

762
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,470
truly.

763
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,960
I'll deliver it first.

764
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,800
I'm leaving.

765
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,140
♪May heaven and earth show mercy♪
