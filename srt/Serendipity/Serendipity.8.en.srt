28
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,510
The marriage alliance is finally settled.

29
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,640
I owe it to you two.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Merely easing your burdens,

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,480
it's nothing.

32
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,640
May I ask when is the wedding?

33
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,560
His Majesty has given a verbal decree

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,310
that it's set for next month.

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,000
Are you implying something

36
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,510
by asking this?

37
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,350
Indeed.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,000
After leaving the Yin Residence,

39
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,590
I had a friend investigate discreetly

40
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,150
and found out that someone pulled the strings

41
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,480
behind Yin Xianjun's scramble

42
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,760
for the betrothal.

43
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,880
Who is it?

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,040
Yin Xianjun's aunt,

45
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,790
from the Tian Family of Yongxing.

46
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,750
She is the elder sister of Tian Chongju,

47
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,280
the Investigating Censor.

48
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,280
Luckily, Yin Xianjun seems unaware of this,

49
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,520
thinking that
Mr. and Mrs. Tian truly care about her.

50
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,590
Your Highness,

51
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,030
isn't Tian Chongju a confidant of Prince Yu?

52
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,400
The Tian Clan mostly serves him, too.

53
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,710
(Harmonious Breeze)

54
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,550
If that's the case,

55
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,910
although Mr. Tian maintained neutral before,

56
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,430
he seems to have

57
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,080
aligned himself with Prince Yu now.

58
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,840
Prince Yu has been

59
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
stoking the reform debates in court.

60
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,280
And now he's meddling in your marriage.

61
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,800
Surely, you can see

62
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,520
his ambition and methods clearly.

63
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,520
I comprehend

64
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,030
your implication.

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,030
With your mastery of court dynamics,

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,870
you'll make great achievements.

67
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Tell me, what reward do you want?

68
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,000
I require nothing for serving Your Highness.

69
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,590
Yet there is one matter

70
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,080
only you can help me with.

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,640
I'm listening.

72
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,000
I heard that His Majesty intends to

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,120
let you take charge of the Supreme Court.

74
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,190
I humbly request you reopen an old case.

75
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,190
The embezzlement of Su Changhua,

76
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,080
former Jianglin Prefect?

77
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,280
Since I plan to employ you,

78
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,590
how could I not study your past?

79
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,520
My late mentor was a man of integrity.

80
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,270
His conviction stemmed

81
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,750
from malicious framing.

82
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,360
Please help me to seek him justice.

83
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,560
I have reviewed the case files.

84
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,840
The evidence appears irrefutable.

85
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,000
Among the witnesses

86
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,630
who testified against Su Changhua,

87
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,080
a man surnamed Liu who was his confidant.

88
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,470
If he was truly innocent,

89
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,150
why would his confidant turn against him?

90
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,600
I've tracked down the whereabouts

91
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,280
of Liu Xiankun's adopted daughter.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,280
Perhaps we can get some clues from her.

93
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,800
Should I reopen the case,

94
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,710
legitimate grounds are required.

95
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,750
Its success

96
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,630
hinges on your capability.

97
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,950
Master, why do you look so preoccupied?

98
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,120
I was thinking about Mr. Lu.

99
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,230
Him?

100
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,390
When he was talking about the court affairs,

101
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
though his tone was measured,

102
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,720
I sensed an unquenchable fire within,

103
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,750
the kind that stirs me

104
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,160
only when I appreciate poems and paintings

105
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,160
or having fine wines and delicacies.

106
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,680
Mr. Lu is eager to clear his mentor's name.

107
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,790
It's inevitable...

108
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,760
No.

109
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,440
I mean,

110
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,390
I found myself engaged in those

111
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,430
political discussions without feeling bored.

112
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,680
Are you suggesting

113
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,720
you don't repel an official career?

114
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,960
How

115
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,470
is this possible?

116
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,830
Perhaps it's the profound impact
of my involvement in the Yin Family case.

117
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,350
Buddy,

118
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,040
you seem to be troubled.

119
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,310
Your brows are all furrowed.

120
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,430
Do you know what a mentor is like?

121
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,440
Hook.

122
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,720
Horizontal.

123
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,160
Vertical.

124
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,110
Good.

125
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,270
Lu Chang,

126
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,240
what defines a gentleman?

127
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,270
A gentleman

128
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,920
knows when to act and when to refrain,

129
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,030
guided by principles

130
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,880
and unwavering resolve.

131
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,750
These are the pillars of one's character.

132
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,640
Do you understand?

133
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes, sir.

134
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,700
(Gentlemen)

135
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,780
(Su Residence)

136
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:08,420
(Legacy of Plow and Pen)

137
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,000
Sir,

138
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,000
I've spent three days

139
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,870
polishing every phrase of this essay.

140
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,630
Ornate emptiness.

141
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,720
If it fails to mirror the public sentiment

142
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
and address societal ills,

143
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,360
what's the use

144
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,310
of gilded rhetoric?

145
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,040
To me, Mr. Su

146
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,950
was a mentor

147
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,920
as well as a father.

148
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,720
Mentor and father,

149
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,600
a dual debt of gratitude.

150
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,820
When my wronged mentor lies under the earth,

151
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,390
how can I live

152
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,070
in willful ignorance?

153
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
You're right.

154
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,070
We must honor debts of benevolence.

155
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,390
I stand with you.

156
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,680
Don't worry about this.

157
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,190
Just take good care of yourself and Mom.

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,390
Lu Chang, open the door.

159
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,720
It isn't locked.

160
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,790
Mr. Ying.

161
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,750
Mingshu.

162
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,200
Sit.

163
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,720
Any news about the Lu Family?

164
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,630
I did get some news.

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,190
To secure the hereditary privilege

166
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,150
for his only son, Minister Lu plans to

167
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,510
host a banquet for the Ministry of Rites.

168
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,390
The arrangements are elaborate.

169
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,390
He's hired the imperial musicians

170
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,720
as well as a couple who travels around

171
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,600
to make a living by performing.

172
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
A couple?

173
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,750
Yes.

174
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,360
A Qin player and a dancer,

175
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,080
famous for some Guanju Dance.

176
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,360
They should arrive at the Lu Residence soon.

177
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,150
What do you think of my Qin-playing skills?

178
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,030
Are you going to pose as the couple?

179
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,030
If I can prevent them from going,

180
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,480
I can take their place.

181
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,360
Even so,

182
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,510
do you expect his wife to play along?

183
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,600
Or will you perform double roles alone?

184
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,720
So I have to trouble you

185
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,600
to find a young lady

186
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,030
of similar age.

187
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,390
In such a short time,

188
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,840
where am I supposed to find a lady

189
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
trustworthy, discreet,

190
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,440
and skilled in dancing?

191
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,100
Your brother always gives me difficult tasks.

192
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,120
Don't you have a candidate right here?

193
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,080
The Guanju Dance isn't mastered overnight.

194
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,670
Your current skills...

195
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,840
If I can't dance, I'll learn.

196
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,350
If I can't dance well, I'll practice harder.

197
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,670
I don't believe I can't master it.

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,870
Exactly. With Mingshu here,

199
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,320
why bother

200
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,790
looking for some other lady?

201
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,160
No.

202
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,960
She's occupied with opening the shop.

203
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,790
It needs redecorating anyway.

204
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,000
I've arranged everything.

205
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,230
It won't be a problem.

206
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,230
No.

207
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,440
How could I pose as her husband?

208
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,200
End of discussion.

209
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,870
Why not?

210
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,710
Go to bed.

211
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,390
Miss,

212
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,320
do you think Prince Rui will come?

213
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,000
Since he's seeking an alliance with us,

214
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,150
he'll extend us this courtesy.

215
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

216
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
We haven't got married yet.

217
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
I wonder why

218
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,120
you invited me

219
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,470
over here.

220
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,670
I want

221
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,000
to thank you, Your Highness.

222
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,960
What are you thanking me for?

223
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,840
No worries. Take a seat.

224
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,320
I was previously troubled by rumors.

225
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,120
Regardless, you insisted on marrying me.

226
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,870
I deeply appreciate that.

227
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,390
Do you think I don't mind?

228
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,270
I value your status of legitimate daughter.

229
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,510
It's true.

230
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,220
But allowing slanderous tongues

231
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,630
to taint our marriage alliance

232
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,790
would be public humiliation.

233
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,510
What perplexes me is why you permitted

234
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,000
the rumors to spread for so long.

235
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,600
Are you suggesting

236
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,240
our marriage is merely

237
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,080
to uphold the alliance?

238
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,320
What else?

239
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Affection?

240
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,670
May I ask if you

241
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,320
harbor genuine affection for me?

242
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,550
Since Your Highness puts it thus,

243
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,000
I feel rather relieved.

244
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,670
Rest assured.

245
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,750
As your consort,

246
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,960
I'll fulfill my duties diligently,

247
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,200
leaving no room for censure.

248
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,360
It suits my wishes very well.

249
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,280
If there's nothing else,

250
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,630
I'll take my leave now.

251
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,120
There is one more thing

252
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,000
I'd like to tell you now.

253
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,390
What is it?

254
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,000
After we get married,

255
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,840
I don't want to idle my days away

256
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,080
and annoy Your Highness.

257
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,360
I want to run a jewelry shop with my friends.

258
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,390
Would Your Highness grant this?

259
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,030
As long as you fulfill your duties

260
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,200
and safeguard my reputation,

261
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,750
I will turn a blind eye

262
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,270
to such things.

263
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,510
Thank you, Your Highness.

264
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,000
She left first, huh?

265
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,710
Your Highness,

266
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,150
isn't it against the proprieties

267
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,030
to allow the consort to do business?

268
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,200
Proprieties?

269
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,000
Shouldn't our dynasty's proprieties,

270
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,120
rites, or social conventions

271
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,360
change a bit?

272
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,600
Greetings, Mr. Lu.

273
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,120
Rest assured,

274
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,440
Taohua is absolutely tight-lipped.

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,080
I hear we're to pose as a married couple.

276
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,080
I'm experienced

277
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,510
in this kind of thing.

278
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Please have some tea.

279
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,390
Darling.

280
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,320
Buddy.

281
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,200
Mingshu, we've decided.

282
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,160
You're the one.

283
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,320
Told you. No one's more suitable than me.

284
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,390
Thanks.

285
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,750
Darling, you're welcome.

286
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
What did you just call me?

287
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,230
Darling.

288
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,870
How could you be so careless?

289
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,080
Your gown's a mess, like a child's.

290
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,840
Lu Mingshu,

291
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,510
enough.

292
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,000
Seriously? You can't even handle this.

293
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,270
Don't hold me back

294
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,390
when we are at the Lu's.

295
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,770
Well done, girl!

296
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,120
That's the act.

297
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,000
Right? Isn't it convincing?

298
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,870
How to make it more convincing?

299
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,510
More convincing?

300
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,000
Let me show you a trick.

301
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,390
We've got the actress,

302
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,560
but your dance...

303
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,730
- Then what to do?
- Then what to do?

304
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,860
(Lu Residence)

305
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,960
Come on in.

306
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,120
Lady Muqing, Mr. Wensheng,

307
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,120
this is the Nongying Courtyard

308
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,840
where the dancers rehearse.

309
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,720
Their poise and looks are extraordinary,

310
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,670
clearly not drifting performers.

311
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,550
I've heard Lady Muqing's Guanju Dance

312
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,270
paired with Mr. Wensheng's Tasha Melody

313
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,510
transcends mortal craft.

314
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,350
But her movements

315
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,110
lack a dancer's discipline.

316
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,000
I've also heard

317
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,790
that your performance

318
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,270
shakes the Nine-Layered Heavens.

319
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,160
But seeing is believing.

320
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,350
Would you honor us

321
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,200
with a preview

322
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,110
so I can report back to my master?

323
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,880
Mr. Wensheng's music is indeed astonishing,

324
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,110
but how could this dance

325
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,070
shake the Nine-Layered Heavens?

326
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,110
Are they impostors?

327
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,040
Bravo!

328
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,640
Such peerless music and dance,

329
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,790
your talents are truly remarkable.

330
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
Now I may

331
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,880
report to my master confidently.

332
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,200
Fortunately, you've modified the dance.

333
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,310
You're not good at doing back bends,

334
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,070
but are excellent at spinning.

335
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,030
How about changing some of the moves?

336
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,750
If others ask,

337
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,920
you can say that you adjust the dance

338
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,960
to match your moods.

339
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,960
Watching you fumble at first

340
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,270
really worried me.

341
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,200
If I'm doing this,

342
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
I'll master it.

343
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,350
I almost threw up from practicing.

344
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,110
You've endured much

345
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,990
to achieve this in such a short time.

346
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,920
We're family. Don't stand on ceremony.

347
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,000
Darling, how was my dance?

348
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,950
Steward Wang is here.

349
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,700
(Lu Residence)

350
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,640
Are you going to sleep on the floor?

351
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,270
No, no, it's cold.

352
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,400
You've got the imperial exam to take.

353
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,590
What if you catch a cold?

354
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,480
I'll take the floor.

355
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,480
I'm not that frail.

356
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,250
How can I let my sister sleep on the floor?

357
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,140
Leave me.

358
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,200
I like sleeping on the floor.

359
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,040
Mr. Wensheng.

360
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,030
Mr. Wensheng.

361
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,590
Holy...

362
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,070
Mr. Wang, what brings you here so late?

363
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,200
These are the scores for the banquet.

364
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,480
Please practice diligently.

365
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,000
Just leave them there.

366
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,960
There are only a few days left.

367
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,200
Hurry up and practice, darling.

368
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,920
Don't call me that.

369
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,000
I'll do whatever you say,

370
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,270
Wensheng.

371
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,390
Who...

372
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,640
Who taught you that?

373
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,200
Mr. Ying.

374
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,950
Go to bed.

375
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,240
- I...
- Behave.

376
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,070
Thank you for your help, Mr. Wensheng.

377
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,480
You're welcome.

378
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,240
Lady Yuanying, you look familiar.

379
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,680
I may have seen you somewhere.

380
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,680
I wonder where you're from?

381
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,960
Why is this query?

382
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,510
Your grace

383
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,550
and extraordinary remarks

384
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,920
suggest a literati family's background.

385
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,640
Am I right?

386
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,480
What a lecher!

387
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,790
How dare you harass me?

388
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,480
Please calm down.

389
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,880
I meant no harm.

390
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,510
You've got some nerve!

391
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,310
I'll report this to the steward

392
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,530
and have you thrown out of the mansion!

393
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,110
The moment I take my eyes off you,

394
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,680
you start causing trouble, don't you?

395
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,520
Hurry up and practice.

396
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,680
Lady Yuanying,

397
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,880
don't mind him.

398
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,720
He's always been a flirt

399
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,880
with pretty ladies.

400
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,240
But trust me,

401
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,750
he's all bark and no bite.

402
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,790
He won't dare to do anything.

403
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,750
I'll teach him a good lesson today.

404
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,680
We're just drifting performers scraping by.

405
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,110
Would you cut us some slack

406
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,750
and forgive him?

407
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,400
Then you must keep him in line

408
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,580
and don't let him cause trouble again.

409
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,040
Rest assured.

410
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,550
Keep this up

411
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,110
and I'm done covering for you!

412
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,680
What did you even say

413
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,920
to scare her off with just a few words?

414
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,160
I didn't say anything outrageous.

415
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,880
She's just overly defensive.

416
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,560
But it suggests

417
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,830
she's definitely hiding something.

418
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,830
She's already on guard against you.

419
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,880
I'll get close to her from here on.

420
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,550
Women trust women more easily.

421
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,880
He knows he was wrong.

422
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,200
Hurry up and go practice.

423
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,400
I'll teach you a good lesson later.

424
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
Mr. Wensheng.

425
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,830
Do you have your eye on Liu Yuanying?

426
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,310
What advice do you offer, Lady Yerong?

427
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,400
To be honest with you,

428
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,270
if you're determined, you'll succeed.

429
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,750
Is that true?

430
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,070
They say Liu Yuanying is untouchable,

431
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
courted by nobles and high officials

432
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,830
yet unmoved.

433
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,960
In truth, she's secretly involved

434
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,640
with the young master of Lu.

435
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,510
You mean Lu Wencai?

436
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,550
Who else?

437
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,070
Thank you for telling me this.

438
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,540
(Shiya Residence)

439
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,440
Yuanying is at the height of her popularity.

440
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,960
Why would she easily give herself

441
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,550
to that good-for-nothing Lu Wencai?

442
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,510
But I don't think Yerong was joking.

443
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,760
Here.

444
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,670
Your reward.

445
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,840
Thank you, sir.

446
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,070
Serve me well,

447
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,440
and you'll never lack

448
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,880
gold nor jewels.

449
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,660
(Shiya Residence)

450
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,750
Lady Yuanying, you should rest.

451
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,830
I'll take my leave now.

452
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,110
Wait.

453
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,000
Take this bracelet.

454
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,400
This is too precious.

455
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,480
Just keep it.

456
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,070
Thank you, Lady Yuanying.

457
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,540
(Shiya Residence)

458
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,350
Surprisingly, it's true.

459
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,920
But she seemed reluctant,

460
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,200
giving away the bracelet she just received.

461
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,680
If it were from someone she loves,

462
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,790
how could she not cherish it?

463
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,720
In terms of family background,

464
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,720
Lu Wencai has no prize.

465
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,350
Yuanying shouldn't have to stoop to this.

466
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,830
It's puzzling.

467
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,310
Is she coerced?

468
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,550
Then why didn't she report it to the steward?

469
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,480
After all, as an official performer,

470
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,070
she's legally protected.

471
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,270
If this is brought to light,

472
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,480
Lu Wencai won't gain anything.

473
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
What if

474
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,270
the threat is unspeakable?

475
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,310
I have to talk to her tomorrow.

476
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,830
She's very defensive.

477
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,790
Don't spook her.

478
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,310
Also, we need to

479
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,750
distract that maid.

480
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,200
Ziyun, the maid,

481
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,350
keeps eyeing you.

482
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,240
She's done it several times.

483
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,720
What's on your mind?

484
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,920
Darling, have you heard

485
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,640
of the honey trap?

486
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,830
Lu Mingshu!

487
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,110
Mr. Wensheng is playing the Qin.

488
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,380
(Shiya Residence)

489
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,500
(Mengying Pavilion)

490
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,950
Ziyun!

491
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,830
Ziyun isn't here.

492
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,350
Do you like reading storybooks?

493
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,880
What brings you here, Lady Muqing?

494
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Oh, I want to remind you

495
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,440
to watch your back around Yerong.

496
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,550
My husband told me today

497
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,590
that she slandered you behind your back,

498
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,030
so I came to warn you.

499
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,830
I already knew her petty jealousy

500
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,310
over my popularity

501
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,200
in the Imperial Music Office.

502
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,550
If you are aware,

503
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,110
I have nothing else to say.

504
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,480
Is that figurine you were playing with

505
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,200
from your childhood?

506
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,480
Who are you?

507
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,920
Why scheme to get close to me?

508
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,270
What do you mean, Lady Yuanying?

509
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,960
You're not Muqing.

510
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,590
A performer from the Office who knows her

511
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,440
said her right wrist had a red mole,

512
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,920
but you don't have it.

513
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,480
Lady Yuanying.

514
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,480
You haven't answered my question.

515
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,200
Tell me. Why are you approaching me?

516
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,440
Lady Yuanying,

517
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,440
if I say

518
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,790
Muqing is a name

519
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,640
rather than a single person,

520
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,310
would you understand?

521
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,960
As a fellow dancer,

522
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,510
have you ever

523
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,240
pushed through illness to perform?

524
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,680
We've been drifting to make a living.

525
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,720
But we're human too.

526
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,030
We can fall sick

527
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,870
and get unwell.

528
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,790
But what choice do we have?

529
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,920
Thus I am Muqing,

530
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,110
yet not Muqing.

531
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,070
Now that

532
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,640
you know our secret,

533
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,030
my husband and my lives

534
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,720
are in your hands.

535
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,640
Please show mercy

536
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,400
and don't tell anyone, will you?

537
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,160
I'll keep your secret,

538
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,720
but henceforth,

539
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,200
you must handle this properly.

540
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,510
Thank you for warning me.

541
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,160
We never meant to approach you.

542
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,550
We just feared that you'd be slandered.

543
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,430
I understand.

544
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,400
Thank you for your warning too.

545
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,590
But

546
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,310
I dislike closeness.

547
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,910
Please leave.

548
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,880
Luckily, we came up with a plan in advance,

549
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,240
or she'd have cornered me.

550
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,480
But it's a good thing to tell her our secret.

551
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,920
It might lower her guard.

552
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,920
She's reclusive

553
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,830
and hard to approach.

554
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,110
When I was going to touch that figurine,

555
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,160
she panicked.

556
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,150
Is it related

557
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,920
to her missing brother?

558
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
Or perhaps

559
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,790
Lu Wencai is using it to blackmail her?

560
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,270
We must earn her trust.

561
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,830
She needs to confide in us willingly.

562
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,000
Eat.

563
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,880
Sweet. Where did you get them?

564
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,240
I know you like them,

565
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,030
so I bought them before we came here.

566
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,670
Let me do it.

567
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,640
The longan shells cling to the flesh.

568
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,070
You need to pick out the debris bit by bit.

569
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,320
Do you have the patience?

570
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,480
You spoil me so much.

571
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,110
Are you going to do it for me forever?

572
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,750
Why not?

573
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,000
Stop peeling them for me.

574
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,110
Try some. They're sweet.

575
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,780
(Wang Xiuyun)

576
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,990
- Leave us.
- Yes.

577
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,990
Darling,

578
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,230
anything different about me today?

579
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,760
Nothing different.

580
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,150
Today, when I paid respects to Mother,

581
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,230
she got me a new head ornament

582
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,280
to try.

583
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Everyone said it looked lovely

584
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,510
and urged me to wear it at the banquet.

585
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,640
Take a look again.

586
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,280
What a waste of a fine ornament.

587
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,440
Have your wrinkles increased lately?

588
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,110
Buy some better face powder to apply.

589
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,150
You can't even dress up properly,

590
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,400
worse than your maids.

591
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,460
(Lu Residence)

592
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Bestowed by Her Highness,

593
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,360
this dangling hairpin matches your grace,

594
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,110
both opulent and refined.

595
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,800
What lousy mirror is this?

596
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,840
It shows clearly every wrinkle

597
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,920
on my face!

598
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,320
You know how my husband hates this!

599
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,320
Madam,

600
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,400
don't be angry.

601
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,280
Forgive my boldness,

602
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,400
Young Master's recent coldness

603
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,510
isn't about your looks.

604
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,510
Someone's scheming

605
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,920
to steal his heart.

606
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:07,960
Dancer?

607
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,030
Liu Yuanying?

608
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,280
Goodness!

609
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,480
No wonder he lingers

610
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,190
at Nongying Courtyard every day.

611
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,800
Turns out he makes out

612
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,630
with a lowly dancer there!

613
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,670
Exactly!

614
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,550
I...

615
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,480
I'm his lawfully wedded wife!

616
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,000
How could I share him

617
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,030
with a dancer?

618
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,840
Just thinking about it makes me furious.

619
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,230
It's not your fault, Madam.

620
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,520
We should teach that dancer a good lesson

621
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,480
and let her know her place as a servant.

622
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,190
You're right.

623
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,230
This hairpin is from the Noble Consort.

624
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,110
It's a grave offense to damage it.

625
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,190
Shall we repair it discreetly?

626
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,550
How do I look today?

627
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,710
I've already confirmed it,

628
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,880
Mother, today,

629
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,840
you're the capital's most beautiful lady.

630
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,550
Spare the mirror.

631
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,190
Madam Lu's Spring Banquet

632
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,920
will host all prominent figures,

633
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,440
especially those young lords

634
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,280
and ladies of eligible marriage age.

635
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,000
With so many handsome men and women,

636
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,000
I won't even know which one to notice.

637
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,590
They've got plenty of rare flowers.

638
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,480
If you don't know which one to notice,

639
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,760
just admire the flowers.

640
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,440
Stop it.

641
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,710
You know what I mean.

642
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,880
If your eye

643
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,800
catches any maiden at the banquet,

644
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,230
do remember to tell me.

645
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,920
I'll help you assess her thoroughly.

646
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,710
But on one condition,

647
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,030
you must choose the best one.

648
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,340
(Lu Residence)
Welcome.

649
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,320
- Please.
- Ok.

650
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Don't trouble yourself with others.

651
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,020
(Madam Lu, Lu Ruishan)

652
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,960
I know

653
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,320
you've long been fond of Mr. Song.

654
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,590
Your father agrees to our alliance with them.

655
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,480
At this banquet,

656
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,150
we only need to gauge Madam Song's stance.

657
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,870
Understood?

658
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,000
I understand, Mother.

659
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,800
They are here.

660
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,760
(Lu Residence)

661
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,630
Third Lady.

662
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,840
This is Madam Song.

663
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,000
Greetings, Madam Song,

664
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,000
Mr. Song.

665
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,440
Is this the Third Lady?

666
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,320
Such grace and poise.

667
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm sure many talented young men

668
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,030
want to propose to your family.

669
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,110
You flattered us.

670
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,110
For over ten years,

671
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,880
I've been tending her like a delicate flower.

672
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,320
I just hope to seek a worthy young man

673
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,070
to cherish her.

674
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,550
Then, as her mother,

675
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,550
I'll be content.

676
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,360
Mr. Song,

677
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,190
I hear you're an accomplished painter.

678
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,230
I also paint occasionally.

679
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,800
Perhaps you might give me some advice.

680
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,840
I'm lack of talents in brushwork.

681
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,320
I wouldn't dare to offer advice.

682
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,760
Let's not stand here. Let's get in.

683
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,220
(Lu Residence)

684
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,110
Which one is Liu Yuanying?

685
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,920
This case holds the hairpin

686
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,550
bestowed by the Noble Consort.

687
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,760
Having heard of your exceptional skill,

688
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,110
Madam wants you to perform the Fairy Dance.

689
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,280
In the manner of presenting auspicious omens,

690
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,670
you will put this hairpin on her head

691
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,230
and show it to the guests.

692
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,800
Yes.

693
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,920
Madam will reward you if you do it well.

694
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,150
Liu Yuanying, what an honor

695
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,550
to be chosen

696
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,110
to present the auspicious omen.

697
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,760
I must inform Madam

698
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
this hairpin is damaged.

699
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,840
Haven't you realized it?

700
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,280
It was broken to begin with.

701
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,190
She gave you this

702
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,510
just to frame you.

703
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,320
If you confront her now,

704
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,440
I'm afraid she'll

705
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,550
put all the blame on you

706
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,880
and deal with you.

707
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,150
Why would she do this?

708
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,400
I've never met her before.

709
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,440
When did I offend her?

710
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,190
The whole Nongying Courtyard

711
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,070
is gossiping about you and Mr. Lu.

712
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,510
How could she not know about it?

713
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,800
Maybe she hates you the most.

714
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,160
Don't be afraid.

715
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,150
I can fix the hairpin

716
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,230
and get you through this.

717
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,070
Do you trust me?

718
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,440
Stay silent and buy me some time.

719
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,400
I'll return it before you

720
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,480
present the auspicious omen.

721
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,060
(Mengying Pavilion)

722
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,660
(Mengying Pavilion)

723
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,710
How do you like the dance?

724
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,600
Not bad.

725
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,960
- Great.
- Wonderful!

726
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,490
Help me check this.

727
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,610
Time is running out.

728
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,920
Graceful and sturdy.

729
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,550
Lu Mingshu,

730
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,320
you can dance as well as repair jewelry.

731
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,960
What a talented lady.

732
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,920
It's getting late.

733
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:31,800
Stop.

734
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,800
Don't you recognize me?

735
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,960
(Charming Demeanor)

736
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,800
Are you new here?

737
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,060
(Gentleman)

738
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:43,990
Gentleman.

739
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,990
Wait.

740
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,590
What's in the case?

741
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,480
Nothing. You...

742
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,710
Goodness!

743
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,000
