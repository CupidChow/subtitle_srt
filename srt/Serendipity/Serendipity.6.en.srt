Replace her with another Yin's daughter?

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,600
But...

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,480
If Prince Rui and Shujun's betrothal

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,510
is called off,

32
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,040
who would dare to marry her again?

33
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,950
The entire imperial court

34
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,840
is keeping a close eye on this betrothal.

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,200
Should it fail,

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,680
the Yin Family

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,950
will be in trouble.

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,870
Compared to this,

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,400
which girl is to be married off

40
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,430
doesn't really matter.

41
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,280
But if we're going to choose another girl,

42
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,630
how to ensure fairness?

43
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,000
Between Xianjun and Liangjun,

44
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,870
how to choose?

45
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,750
In my opinion,

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,310
Liangjun should be the choice.

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,960
Liangjun is gentle and dignified.

48
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,680
Had Her Highness not demanded

49
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,760
the eldest legitimate daughter

50
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,680
for this betrothal,

51
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,250
she'd have been the natural candidate

52
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,030
to marry into the royal family.

53
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,520
That's true.

54
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,910
This resolves many conflicts.

55
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,310
If Liangjun is the one,

56
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,710
Shujun, as her elder sister,

57
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,560
should be married off as soon as possible.

58
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,150
You should

59
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,680
secure a match for her quickly,

60
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,710
preferably far from the capital

61
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,120
to avoid gossip

62
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,240
and ensure a quiet life.

63
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,780
(Yin Residence)

64
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,280
Madam.

65
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,960
Madam,

66
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,630
what's this?

67
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,560
We initially invited you over

68
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,150
to keep an eye on Shujun

69
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,690
to prevent any changes to the betrothal.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,910
Yet now,

71
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,430
Her Highness has resolved

72
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,280
to replace her with Liangjun.

73
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,150
Lady Liangjun?

74
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,630
This is the monthly salary we promised you,

75
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,080
increased by 50 taels.

76
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,400
These days,

77
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,190
you've been working hard.

78
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,840
We should pay you more accordingly.

79
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,030
But I still doubt

80
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,870
Lady Shujun plotted

81
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,360
to make me fall into the water.

82
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,400
A thorough investigation must continue.

83
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,280
Wouldn't replacing her with Lady Liangjun

84
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,800
only end up pinning the blame on her?

85
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,430
The situation is beyond our control.

86
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
Neither Master nor I

87
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,190
can alter it now.

88
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,750
Gossip melts metal

89
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,270
and crumbles bones.

90
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,110
Madam,

91
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,680
I cannot simply walk away.

92
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,390
If someone is trying to frame Lady Shujun,

93
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,270
I'll find no peace even if I leave.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,630
After what she's done to you,

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
you still choose to trust her?

96
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,510
Not full trust,

97
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,360
but I refuse to leave with doubts unresolved.

98
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,920
The drowning incident concerns me.

99
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,750
I must uncover the truth

100
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,120
to dispel the doubts in my heart.

101
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,320
I saw

102
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,950
all that silver

103
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,240
in front of me,

104
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,910
yet I had to reject it!

105
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,720
My heart aches!

106
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,190
My flesh burns!

107
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,120
You just turned down the payment

108
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,950
and insist on staying to investigate?

109
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,350
Regrets already?

110
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,630
After all, it was so much silver.

111
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,680
My silver!

112
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,000
Then what are you

113
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,030
going to do next?

114
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,600
I think there's definitely

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,840
something fishy.

116
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
But from my observation,

117
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,190
though Shujun acts willful,

118
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,950
she'd never dare harm cats or dogs.

119
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,430
Her adherence to morning-evening rituals

120
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,920
and avoidance of her father's literary name

121
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,120
(Unaware of aging)
show ingrained discipline.

122
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,750
When there were kittens in the courtyard,

123
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,510
she feigned disdain

124
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,510
but never harmed them.

125
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
If Lady Shujun knew

126
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,360
there was someone in this mansion

127
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,560
who thought of her this way,

128
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,390
what would she feel?

129
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,600
Moreover, I've talked to the servants.

130
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
The rumor spreads without evidence

131
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,430
and no one witnessed it firsthand.

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,830
When Shujun was punished earlier,

133
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,800
Shuangyan clearly had something to say,

134
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,160
but Shujun stopped her.

135
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,600
There must be a reason.

136
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,190
Now, with the drowning incident,

137
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,920
everyone condemns Shujun.

138
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,800
If I leave, who will speak for her?

139
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,360
Are you sure you want to get involved?

140
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,120
Women endure enough hardship.

141
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,560
We should help each other.

142
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,630
If there's a chance she's framed

143
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,600
and I ignore it...

144
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,240
I must help her.

145
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
Lady Lu,

146
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,270
your blend of justice

147
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,600
and gallantry is rare.

148
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,480
I'd like to salute you with tea

149
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,830
in place of wine.

150
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,270
I loathe his deception toward women,

151
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,830
ruining their reputation.

152
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,390
I can't turn a blind eye to it.

153
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,030
(Before, she had to)

154
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,830
(support her family after her mother died.)

155
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,630
(No one knew her struggles.)

156
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,720
(Miss Yin, though outwardly domineering,)

157
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,510
(is truly isolated and unaided.)

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,070
(She shares the same plight)

159
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,680
(as she did back then.)

160
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,160
(All I can do)

161
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,600
(is to stand by her side)

162
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,630
(until clouds disperse and the mist clears.)

163
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,830
If you insist on investigating it,

164
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,870
I'll stand with you to the end.

165
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,910
Thank you, Buddy.

166
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,190
Your mention of Shuangyan

167
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,430
seeming to have something to say

168
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,390
reminded me of a clue.

169
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,470
Mr. Song,

170
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,630
do you recall that sachet you found?

171
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,460
(Beyond Thought)

172
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,540
(Proposal)

173
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,860
(Proposal)

174
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,500
(Perfect match, harmonious union)

175
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,630
Jiangzhou?

176
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,070
Isn't it a bit too far?

177
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,780
(I propose a noble union)

178
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,190
A widower over 40

179
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,310
seeking a second wife?

180
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,120
Unacceptable! Absolutely not!

181
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,630
Madam, I know

182
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,950
this is unfair to Lady Shujun,

183
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,920
but the time is pressing.

184
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,600
Though this man is not young,

185
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,190
he has no legitimate sons

186
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,120
other than two concubine-born daughters.

187
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,920
Moreover, he holds a fourth-rank post.

188
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,040
He is currently the best option available.

189
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,390
I've doted on my daughter for over a decade.

190
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,240
How dare you propose such a match for her?

191
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,510
Madam,

192
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,630
currently,

193
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,840
given Lady Shujun's reputation,

194
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,200
I'm afraid...

195
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,080
No matter what, she remains

196
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,670
the legitimate eldest daughter of the family.

197
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,000
How dare you judge her freely?

198
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,750
Get out of here,

199
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,710
now!

200
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,390
If you bring another wretched old fool

201
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,630
to me again,

202
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,320
don't blame me for being harsh!

203
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,080
You...

204
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,320
Why is Madam raging?

205
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,870
Truth be told, if she rejects this one,

206
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,960
she may not find another man in his 40s.

207
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,960
Lady Shujun,

208
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,630
Lady Liangjun is going to replace you.

209
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,870
The news has spread widely.

210
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,960
They should have done this earlier,

211
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,360
saving all the trouble.

212
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,150
Now, everyone

213
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,360
except the reading lady

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,790
gloats behind your back,

215
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,840
saying you brought this upon yourself.

216
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,600
Lady Mingshu

217
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,630
should have left by now, right?

218
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,080
I heard Madam offered her a hefty reward,

219
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,150
but for some reason, she didn't accept it.

220
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,200
Why didn't she?

221
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,280
I don't know.

222
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,960
Is she crazy?

223
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,080
Are you disappointed to know

224
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,550
that I'm still here?

225
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,790
You should leave with the money.

226
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,960
What are you staying for?

227
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,320
Is the money not enough?

228
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,440
Let me handle this.

229
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,320
You can leave now.

230
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,870
Here.

231
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,440
I just went to see Shuangyan

232
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,080
and she confessed everything.

233
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,320
She got saltpeter in the Third Master's

234
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,720
to forge the marriage proposal for you

235
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,440
to break your engagement with Prince Rui.

236
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,320
Saltpeter powder will combust when heated.

237
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,750
By mixing it into the ink,

238
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,510
the proposal would combust during

239
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,080
the Imperial Astronomer's incense ritual.

240
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,750
It would be deemed an ill omen,

241
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,030
nullifying your betrothal.

242
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,510
If this is discovered,

243
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,480
what retribution might follow?

244
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,270
I only added a little saltpeter powder.

245
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,600
Third Uncle will unlikely notice.

246
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,030
Once the proposal has turned to ashes,

247
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,600
what retribution could possibly follow?

248
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,440
What are you going to do?

249
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,910
Why don't I tell Master and Madam?

250
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,230
You...

251
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,840
Don't worry. I didn't tell them anything.

252
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,240
If I had, I wouldn't have come to you.

253
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,670
Why don't you

254
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,510
tell me the whole story?

255
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Only then can I tell if I'm able to help.

256
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,550
I don't need your help.

257
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,360
This is the best outcome as it stands.

258
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,630
Do you already have someone in mind?

259
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,790
Your refusal to the betrothal

260
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,840
is because of Jiang Wenrui,

261
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,920
right?

262
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,720
The one you met in secret at the tea party

263
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,520
(Rui)
was Mr. Jiang.

264
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,720
Flower and vine embroidery?

265
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,600
This belongs to Shujun.

266
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,510
And who is Rui?

267
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,510
The sachet was dropped

268
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,670
by Jiang Wenrui during the tea party.

269
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,940
(Water)

270
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,630
You said Lady Shujun excels the embroidery.

271
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,080
This suggests

272
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,510
an extraordinary bond

273
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,200
between them.

274
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,240
I agree.

275
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,510
Shujun couldn't

276
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,800
embroider her full name indiscreetly,

277
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,050
so she substituted the Shu character

278
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,200
(Water)
with its water radical.

279
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,660
(Rui)

280
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,060
(Rui)

281
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,030
Since you already know,

282
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,360
I have nothing more to say.

283
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,320
You think you've escaped the betrothal,

284
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,840
but you have to get married

285
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,840
before Liangjun marries Prince Rui.

286
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,150
Madam is arranging your match.

287
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,870
I heard that you're going to marry

288
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,390
a 40-year-old widower in Jiangzhou.

289
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,440
What did you say?

290
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,720
Only I can help you now.

291
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,840
Are you going to tell me or not?

292
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,750
Third Auntie.

293
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,460
(Crystalline Integrity)

294
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,630
Congratulations on the betrothal.

295
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,230
Thank you, Third Auntie.

296
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,870
Madam told me Shujun and Prince Rui's

297
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,120
eight characters were incompatible.

298
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,480
We all know it's a mere excuse.

299
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,300
(Third Madam of Yin)
In truth,

300
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,910
it boils down to her reputation.

301
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,910
I wonder if Her Highness's choice of me

302
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,120
stirs resentment in your hearts?

303
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,270
With your Third Uncle's reputation,

304
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,270
how could Her Highness choose Xianjun?

305
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,550
Raised under the First Branch's name,

306
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,630
you're the natural choice.

307
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,120
As parents,

308
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,750
we failed your sister.

309
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,240
Mother, don't say that.

310
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,600
Having you and Father by my side

311
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,670
is blessing enough.

312
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,360
Liangjun's cheerful nature and generosity

313
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,000
make her more suitable for the betrothal.

314
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,270
I've always known you're dutiful,

315
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,360
and Third Auntie dotes on me dearly.

316
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,960
I'm glad you understand.

317
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,270
I met Wenrui at a banquet.

318
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,030
We fell for each other.

319
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,030
I intended to have him

320
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,240
tell his family to propose formally,

321
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,360
not expecting that this betrothal

322
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,390
would require the legitimate daughter.

323
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,320
But my heart belongs to another.

324
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,270
I don't want to marry into the royal family.

325
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,840
Why don't you tell your parents about it?

326
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,670
It concerns my family's honor.

327
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,440
Women

328
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,120
are pawns to sustain their clans' interests.

329
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,240
Was it you who spread those rumors?

330
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,080
To sabotage

331
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,750
the betrothal?

332
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,390
Even at my lowest,

333
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,320
I'd never frame myself.

334
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,510
Harming little animals or servants?

335
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,590
How vile!

336
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,790
But you let the rumors fester

337
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,080
without defending yourself.

338
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,600
I know I've been caught up in rumors

339
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,960
and I've regretted it.

340
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,750
But I

341
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,720
clung to our promise.

342
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,790
If I broke the betrothal,

343
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,000
he'd propose formally.

344
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,360
I thought vindication could wait until then.

345
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,360
To pursue love isn't wrong,

346
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,870
but it must be done rightly.

347
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,750
Letting rumors thrive

348
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,000
is harming yourself.

349
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,120
Now you're slandered,

350
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,870
while the true mastermind is gloating.

351
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
In this world,

352
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,240
a woman's

353
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,150
pristine reputation

354
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,390
only eases her transfer

355
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,600
from one household's cage to another.

356
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,200
Even a flawless reputation brings

357
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,000
no happiness without the one you love.

358
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,360
This truth drove me

359
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,270
to take the risk of harming myself.

360
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,720
If you want to help,

361
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,160
would you

362
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,750
tell Wenrui,

363
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,270
"The betrothal is off. Come propose at once?"

364
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,440
Take the medicine first.

365
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,550
Are you really going to help me?

366
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,590
Yes.

367
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,900
(Yin Residence)

368
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,080
Prince Rui asked me to uncover the truth

369
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,960
to clear Lady Shujun's name.

370
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,750
Since she's

371
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,150
pledged herself to another,

372
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,910
further investigation is pointless.

373
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,870
I'll simply report the truth to Prince Rui.

374
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,720
What Shujun did is wrong.

375
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,150
But if you report it, enrage the royals,

376
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,480
and let everyone know about it,

377
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
will she survive the scandal?

378
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,270
But when she acted like this,

379
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,870
did she think about the consequences?

380
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Though Shujun's actions were reckless,

381
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,510
I see them

382
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,360
as an act of unyielding resolve

383
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,630
to pursue love

384
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,440
and seize control of her own fate,

385
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,150
a desperate gamble born of necessity.

386
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,270
The methods may be flawed,

387
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,790
but what choice did she have?

388
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,280
As a woman myself,

389
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,390
I can empathize with her situation.

390
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,750
Were I in her place,

391
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,000
I too would fight desperately for love

392
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,150
until hope turned to ashes.

393
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Chang,

394
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,870
my intent in groom-snatching was

395
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,250
to declare true devotion, not coercion.

396
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,670
(When she resorted to groom-snatching,)

397
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,830
(was it also a desperate gamble?)

398
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,640
You have lofty aspirations.

399
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,960
I won't hold you back.

400
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,550
After this separation,

401
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,350
should our paths cross again,

402
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,520
we meet as strangers.

403
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,550
May your years

404
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,510
rise like bamboo,

405
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,100
each joint surpassing the last.

406
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,830
(How disappointed she must've been)

407
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,070
(to have said those words.)

408
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,510
All prior rumors,

409
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,160
including my drowning,

410
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
were orchestrated by hidden hands

411
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,110
to frame her.

412
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,640
Shujun shouldn't have tolerated the rumors.

413
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,000
Still, she is a victim.

414
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,590
Victims should be helped

415
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,550
to clear their names,

416
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,880
not further harmed,

417
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,950
right?

418
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,790
If Mingshu is right

419
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,480
and Lady Shujun is the real victim,

420
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,830
since it concerns the betrothal,

421
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,000
we cannot spare the mastermind.

422
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,920
Although it's complicated,

423
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,830
three minds will outwit one.

424
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Together,

425
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,110
we can trace this to its root.

426
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,400
I know this burdens you,

427
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,920
but please

428
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,000
grant us this mercy.

429
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Mr. Song, please.

430
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,480
I can delay reporting to Prince Rui,

431
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,280
but Her Highness has

432
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,200
sanctioned Liangjun as the replacement.

433
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,480
We're running out of time.

434
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,310
Still, it's better than doing nothing.

435
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,560
Thanks, Mr. Song.

436
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,350
Thanks, Buddy.

437
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,110
Mr. Song,

438
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,750
why did you ask to meet me?

439
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,790
You'll know in a while.

440
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,680
This must be

441
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,200
Shujun's reading lady.

442
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,240
And you are...

443
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,950
Lu Chang from Jianglin.

444
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,800
Nice to meet you.

445
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,480
Now, Lady Shujun

446
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,310
has severed her betrothal to Prince Rui.

447
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,480
Nothing stands between you two anymore.

448
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,240
I hope you won't forget your promise

449
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,720
and propose to her soon.

450
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,380
(Shujun)

451
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
What are your intentions?
Please speak plainly.

452
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,510
Marriage requires parental approval.

453
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,000
And now, with Shujun's reputation tarnished,

454
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,790
I need time to persuade my parents.

455
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,000
Even if they propose,

456
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,240
it won't be very soon.

457
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,270
How long will it take?

458
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,160
Half a month at best, a month

459
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,670
or more at worst.

460
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,590
By then, Shujun

461
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,830
will be hastily wed in Jiangzhou.

462
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,480
Mr. Jiang,

463
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,070
you won't even need to propose.

464
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,790
What a stalling tactic.

465
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,680
This way,

466
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,440
you avoid marrying Lady Shujun

467
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,440
and ruining your career,

468
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,270
while also dodging the blame

469
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,750
for breaking your vow.

470
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,160
Do you think I'm such a scoundrel?

471
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,280
Are you not?

472
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,070
I've heard that your father proposed to

473
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,680
Supervising Secretary He's daughter for you,

474
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,200
and even performed the betrothal gift ritual.

475
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,880
How do you explain it?

476
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,720
You spied on me?

477
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,760
Exactly.

478
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,960
I've no intention of proposing.

479
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,830
I'm the sole heir of my line.

480
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,590
My parents have high hopes for me.

481
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
If I marry her and my career suffers,

482
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,750
how could I face my parents?

483
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,320
If you like her,

484
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,070
marry her yourself.

485
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,640
Why make me do it?

486
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,030
You honorless, oath-breaking coward!

487
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,480
Shujun risked her name

488
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,350
to shield you with gossip,

489
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,270
yet you cast her aside like trash!

490
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,400
No point wasting words.

491
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,670
Goodbye.

492
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,000
Shujun?

493
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,920
I was so blind

494
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,550
to believe a serpent like you!

495
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,280
Shujun.

496
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,800
Shujun!

497
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,920
Shameless wretch. Beast in human clothing.

498
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,350
Mr. Jiang.

499
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,380
(Yin Residence)

500
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,080
What are you doing?

501
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,240
Stop! You're not yet at the brink.

502
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,080
Give it back!

503
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,680
- Let go!
- Give it back!

504
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,790
My reputation is ruined.

505
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
I'm at the end of my rope.

506
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,960
There's always a way out.

507
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,110
Instead of wallowing in despair,

508
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,960
focus on finding a way out of this crisis.

509
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,680
Find a way out?

510
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,430
How?

511
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,720
By wedding?

512
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,070
From Jiang Wenrui

513
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,110
to Prince Rui,

514
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,790
and then to some stranger,

515
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,310
I'd rather become a nun

516
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,160
than marry myself off hastily!

517
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,350
Once we silence the rumors,

518
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,590
everything can be set right.

519
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,640
Lady Shujun,

520
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,790
someone is trying to make you notorious

521
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,200
and ruin your reputation.

522
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,750
Will you let them have it?

523
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,920
Who would believe me now?

524
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,830
Even my parents are ashamed of me.

525
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,510
Have you forgotten?

526
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,680
I've believed you from the start.

527
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,750
Even now, your parents

528
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,550
may not grasp the full truth,

529
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,440
but their love for you is obvious

530
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,750
even to an outsider like me.

531
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,160
Will you cut your flesh to feed the wolves?

532
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
No leads?

533
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,750
Then we hunt.

534
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,960
We'll drag the mastermind from shadows

535
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,480
and return every wound

536
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,830
they carved into you.

537
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,790
I wonder how Mingshu's conversation

538
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,750
with Lady Shujun is going.

539
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,350
You're injured?

540
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,680
How? Is it grave?

541
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,270
A mere scratch, nothing to worry about.

542
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,160
I've persuaded Shujun

543
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,270
to pursue the mastermind.

544
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,880
Shall we sort it out?

545
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:27,910
Could Lady Liangjun

546
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,510
be the mastermind?

547
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,440
When Lady Mingshu fell into the water,

548
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,030
before Eunuch Chen,

549
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,310
she shifted the blame onto Shujun.

550
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,030
She must try to snatch the betrothal.

551
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,960
Liangjun is favored by Master and Madam.

552
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,110
If Shujun fails,

553
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,270
she can take her place.

554
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,550
But we need concrete proof.

555
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,310
I'll trace every thread.

556
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,240
I don't approve of letting rumors fester,

557
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,080
but

558
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,480
Shujun's suffering for love

559
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,030
was only repaid

560
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,830
with Mr. Jiang's casual betrayal.

561
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,640
Somehow,

562
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,550
I can truly feel her pain.

563
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,960
In this world,

564
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,640
true hearts

565
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,800
are rare treasures.

566
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,590
Jiang Wenrui once held Lady Shujun's.

567
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,310
It was a fortune spanning lifetimes,

568
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,310
yet he squandered it.

569
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,840
One day,

570
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,960
he will be gnawed by regret.

571
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,940
Who can decipher

572
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,550
the mystery

573
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,160
shrouding a man and woman's bond?

574
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Your anguish may make people

575
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,960
mistake you for the betrayed.

576
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,750
Were I to meet

577
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,480
such a faithless scum,

578
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,310
I'd cut off all ties with him for good.

579
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,640
Should we meet again, we'll be strangers.

580
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,280
All right.

581
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,030
It took you long. You must be hungry.

582
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,160
Let's dine first.

583
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,320
Let's eat.

584
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,080
Lu, please.

585
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,110
Be careful with your hand.

586
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,000
This White Jade Soup is flavored.

587
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,920
Mr. Song, you may not know,

588
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,160
though the soup is fine,

589
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,920
it contains shrimp.

590
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,440
Mingshu's injury

591
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,510
forbids stimulating food.

592
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,270
Thus, this pork-stuffed tofu

593
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,720
is better for you.

594
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,400
My mistake.

595
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,720
No worries. Deliciousness suffices.

596
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,200
Thank you for the meal.

597
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,510
So good! Thanks, Buddy.

598
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,110
Lady Mingshu, leave it. We'll handle it.

599
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,790
No need. I'll manage.

600
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,070
Tung oil stains are stubborn to scrub.

601
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,560
(Tung oil?)

602
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,480
Nanny, whose shoes are these?

603
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,550
Lady Liangjun's.

604
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,080
See,

605
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,440
they got stained and were just brought here.

606
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,480
Did she bring them herself?

607
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,320
No,

608
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,790
it was one of her cleaning maids

609
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,110
called...

610
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,750
I've forgotten her name.

611
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,070
Lady Liangjun?

612
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,480
(Baopu House)

613
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,350
I made this. Take a look.

614
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,400
It's nice. Thanks, Lady Mingshu.

615
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,880
If you like it, I'll make you more.

616
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,920
But there's something I want to ask you.

617
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,000
On the day I fell into the water,

618
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,640
apart from Shuangyan,

619
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,110
who else visited you?

620
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,270
We rarely have visitors.

621
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,750
Didn't Lady Liangjun come that day?

622
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,350
You can leave now.

623
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,910
Xianjun.

624
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,110
Did Lady Liangjun really come?

625
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,960
Lady Xianjun,

626
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,880
this concerns Shujun's reputation.

627
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,960
If you know anything, please tell me.

628
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,440
Actually, it's nothing significant.

629
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,510
Liangjun didn't feel well that day.

630
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,400
She came to borrow a bed warmer.

631
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,440
It's a matter of privacy,

632
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,830
so I didn't say anything.

633
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,480
(So it says Liangjun.)

634
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,920
On the day you fell into the water,

635
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,550
Liangjun left early due to illness,

636
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,240
but she didn't call for a doctor.

637
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
However, no one knows

638
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,680
about her movements afterward.

639
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,720
While you met the Noble Eunuch,

640
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,030
she could have distracted your maids

641
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,400
and placed the oil barrel in your place.

642
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,830
Since she's stolen your betrothal,

643
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,720
she's undeniably the prime beneficiary.

644
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,350
Did she do this

645
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,550
just to seize the marriage alliance

646
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,000
I never desired?

647
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,800
In a few days,

648
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,480
the palace will finalize the marriage.

649
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,300
Once Liangjun is confirmed as the bride,

650
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,920
toppling her will be impossible.

651
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,910
That's true.

652
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,960
If Liangjun becomes Prince Rui's consort,

653
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,880
we won't be able to clear Shujun's name.

654
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,000
Seems we must lure the serpent out

655
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,680
to strike.

656
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,590
Have you got a plan?

657
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,270
But to act, we must

658
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,550
persuade Prince Rui to halt his marriage.

659
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,030
Rui values the alliance itself.

660
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,590
Since it isn't affected,

661
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,960
I'm afraid it's hard to persuade him.

662
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,720
I'm willing to give it a try.

663
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,720
Would you please arrange a meeting?

664
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,280
Your Highness,

665
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,240
this is Lu Chang from Jianglin.

666
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,720
Greetings,

667
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,390
Your Highness.

668
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,220
(Harmonious Breeze)

669
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,480
In my humble view,

670
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
throughout this game,

671
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,240
the white pieces are restricted.

672
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,000
Balance would be better

673
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,480
than aggression.

674
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,350
Then,

675
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,160
what's your suggested move?

676
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,550
Here, you can join forces

677
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,160
and fortify your position step by step.

678
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,680
Lu Chang from Jianglin.

679
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,350
You expect me

680
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,070
to delay the marriage alliance

681
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,590
for your truth-seeking?

682
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,840
Yes.

683
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,830
Then do you know

684
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,830
the marriage is about joining forces?

685
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,960
Why would I care which lady it is?

686
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,030
I know it well. But Your Highness,

687
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,200
your just nature enables you

688
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,480
to empathize with others' sufferings,

689
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,750
so you're trying to carry out the reforms.

690
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,680
But at present,

691
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,030
you're facing

692
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,400
similar condemnation

693
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,830
as Lady Shujun endures.

694
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,550
How could you stand idly by?

695
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,830
I firmly believe that the reforms hold merit,

696
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,720
and I also believe this is

697
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,000
closely related to Lady Shujun.

698
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,350
Then enlighten me.

699
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,880
The court's entrenched rot

700
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,590
and local collusion make reform

701
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,440
like pulling teeth from a tiger's jaws.

702
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,830
Altering ancestral laws

703
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,960
will defy convention

704
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,250
and incur endless censure.

705
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,920
One wrong move, total collapse.

706
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,280
Exactly.

707
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,920
The reform path is treacherous and endless.

708
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,240
Dawn remains unseen,

709
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,960
yet many

710
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,480
have fallen along the way.

711
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
In my humble view,

712
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,790
to enact reforms,

713
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,400
one must first unite hearts.

714
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,830
Sincerity forges the righteous path

715
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,750
and the path, once forged, unites hearts.

716
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,720
Only through utmost sincerity can one

717
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,480
master the country's grand principles

718
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,270
and anchor its foundations.

719
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,630
I firmly believe

720
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,670
Your Highness is reviving the country

721
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,110
with utmost sincerity.

722
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,230
I hold great admiration for you,

723
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,710
thus I dare speak boldly.

724
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,240
Profound words

725
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,230
of reviving the country

726
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,030
through absolute integrity.

727
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,280
Who'd have thought

728
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,440
among all my courtiers,

729
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,070
you, a mere scholar,

730
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,440
would truly understand me?

731
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,110
Moreover,

732
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,150
this marriage is related to court dynamics.

733
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,000
Grand Tutor Yin's sudden sick leave,

734
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,880
the chaos plaguing his household,

735
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,550
and Shujun being framed,

736
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,960
you don't think of those

737
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,550
as mere coincidences, right?

738
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,160
Indeed.

739
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,440
I also wonder

740
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
who would take so much trouble

741
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,110
to meddle in my marriage.

742
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,840
Ok,

743
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,550
for your words today,

744
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,480
I grant your request.

745
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

746
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,680
Thank you.

747
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,030
The imperial examination is approaching.

748
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,240
Lu Chang,

749
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,880
don't let me down.

750
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,710
I will be waiting for you.

751
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,990
Buddy,

752
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,070
thanks for fighting for Shujun.

753
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,440
I thought you were too aloof

754
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,920
to care beyond family and friends,

755
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,680
not expecting

756
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,960
that you have a heart of gold.

757
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,440
I didn't do this

758
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,000
solely for Shujun.

759
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,530
- More so to...
- I know.

760
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,280
You tried to meet Prince Rui

761
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,840
and build force to clear Mr. Su's name.

762
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,550
That's part of the reason.

763
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,960
If you see through my motives,

764
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,960
why the gratitude?

765
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,590
Because you always

766
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,920
step forward in crucial moments

767
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,350
to steady the situation.

768
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,920
Cold exterior but warm core,

769
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
you're truly my buddy.

770
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,000
When you recall the past,

771
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,280
you'd think otherwise.

772
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,070
How could I?

773
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,000
My buddy is peerless.

774
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,630
If I'm going to find a husband,

775
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,840
I'll take you

776
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,110
as a role model.

777
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:44,740
(Poetry, Books, Rites, and Music)

778
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,030
Madam has made such lavish preparations.

779
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,360
I think the palace will soon you soon.

780
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,680
All these years,

781
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,070
I've dwelt in my sister's shadow.

782
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,240
Now,

783
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,190
I can finally stand out.

784
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,150
My lady, you must try this on.

785
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,760
Liangjun.

786
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,320
Third Auntie, Xianjun.

787
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,680
Liangjun,

788
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,880
I've heard Noble Consort Hua

789
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,510
recalled the eunuch sent here.

790
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,840
Are you sure?

791
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,840
Rumors say Her Highness still favors Shujun

792
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,440
and intends to negotiate the wedding date.

793
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,480
Auntie was busy preparing,

794
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,510
but she has now halted all plans.

795
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,150
Shujun's reputation lies in ruins.

796
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,760
Why does Her Highness still value her?

797
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,630
Rumors, however rampant, remain unproven.

798
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,230
They hinge on Her Highness's judgement.

799
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,510
If she dismisses them,

800
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,360
what weight do they hold?

801
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,280
Liangjun, don't torment yourself.

802
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,550
Xianjun,

803
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,280
Third Auntie,

804
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,400
please leave.

805
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,440
I need some time alone.

806
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,190
Is there still no news about the man

807
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,280
who met Shujun in private?

808
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,190
Lady Shujun has been grounded by Master

809
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,880
and never leaves.

810
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,030
Only her reading lady

811
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,590
and Mr. Lu ever enter her room.

812
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,440
The reading lady's visits are fine,

813
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,840
but why would Mr. Lu frequent her room?

814
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,820
Perhaps to assign lessons for her.

815
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,630
He is the reading lady's brother.

816
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,920
Aiding her duties seems natural.

817
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,230
A man freely enters a lady's chambers,

818
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,630
yet you call this natural?

819
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,510
Perhaps,

820
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,920
the reading lady has deceived us all.

821
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,880
What do you mean?

822
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,920
She provoked Shujun deliberately,

823
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,190
even fought her,

824
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,360
to mislead us about their relationship

825
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,760
and cover her brother's affair.

826
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,510
If true,

827
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,360
her defense for Shujun

828
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,960
regarding the tung oil

829
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,710
makes sense.

830
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,200
Mr. Lu,

831
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,670
I made these pastries myself.

832
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,800
Please have a try.

833
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,760
Thank you.

834
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,070
Buddy,

835
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,440
look what Lady Shujun

836
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,800
asked me to bring for you.

837
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,320
This Emerald Bean Cake

838
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,320
is her favorite snack.

839
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,550
You're really lucky.

840
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,430
Have another.

841
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,600
Enough.

842
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,360
Buddy, you're such a lady-killer.

843
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,820
(Flourishing Flowers and Wealth)

844
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,680
Shujun,

845
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,670
why are you tending to these plants?

846
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,230
I heard that Noble Consort Hua likes plants,

847
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,440
so I acquired some rare orchids.

848
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,760
I'll keep them in the greenhouse

849
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,480
and send them to her in a few days.

850
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,800
Lady Mingshu,

851
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,360
are you happy about Shujun

852
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,480
and Prince Rui's marriage?

853
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,070
Originally...

854
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,000
I'm not in a position to make the decision.

855
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,280
I'm happy for Lady Shujun, of course.

856
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,710
Mingshu, let's get inside.

857
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,440
At tomorrow's betrothal gift ritual,

858
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,760
I'll expose their affair

859
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
before all.

860
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,840
Fine varieties, indeed.

861
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,320
They smell so good.

862
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,280
Mr. Lu, bad news!

863
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,670
Lady Mingshu was injured

864
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,830
tending plants in the greenhouse!

865
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,430
Mingshu!

Mingshu!

Mingshu!

869
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,030
Mingshu!

870
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,670
Lady Shujun?

871
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,550
Who?

872
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:23,550
