Lu Chang!

You're awake.

Mingshu...

32
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,390
You're awake.

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,190
You're awake!

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,550
Does your body still hurt?

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,240
It's okay.

36
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,470
Thanks for your hard work these days.

37
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,630
Mother!

38
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,070
Chang...

39
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,160
- Mother.
- You're awake.

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,440
I'm fine.

41
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,280
(Xuanyi Hall)

42
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,990
Lu Zegang has been stripped
of his title and exiled.

43
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,480
Prince Yu's assassination attempt

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,180
on Prince Rui lacked
conclusive evidence,

45
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,560
so he was only exiled

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,850
from the capital.

47
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,330
He schemed to retain his noble status

48
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,400
and planned a future resurrection.

49
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,630
Fortunately, His Majesty has proclaimed

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,840
nationwide justice for Mr. Su.

51
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,790
Su Tangli's commoner status
has been restored.

52
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,600
Mr. Su can now rest peacefully

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,160
in the afterlife.

54
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,470
Prince Yu committed

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,120
embezzlement, dereliction of duty,

56
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,560
and slaughter of innocents.

57
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,150
Every single crime

58
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,470
warrants his death.

59
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,310
Yet,

60
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,560
as a prince,

61
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,280
he tramples on laws

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,070
like dust.

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,510
How can

64
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,280
the wronged dead rest?

65
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,240
How can their loved ones

66
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,600
find peace?

67
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,160
Mingshu...

68
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,190
My concern is for Su Tangli.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,920
(He'an Residence)
Lu Chang, listen to the imperial decree!

70
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,840
The emperor rebukes:

71
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,710
Lu Chang has impersonated a prince,

72
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,430
usurped sacrificial rites,

73
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,960
betrayed the throne,

74
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,470
and blasphemed the gods.

75
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,880
He was unforgivable.

76
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,720
He'll be sentenced to be removed
from his post at the Supreme Court

77
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,400
and confined to his home for reflection.

78
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,000
Let this be a warning.

79
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,070
Imperial decree ends.

80
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,230
I accept the decree.

81
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,600
Rise to receive it.

82
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,750
Your actions clearly
protected Prince Rui.

83
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,350
Why did His Majesty punish you?

84
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,230
That is fortunate.

85
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,240
The matter

86
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,840
balanced merit and fault.

87
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,230
Lu Chang was punished

88
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,960
for advocating Prince Rui's appointment

89
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,470
as heir apparent.

90
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,640
What about Prince Rui's fate?

91
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,190
Don't worry.

92
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,110
His Majesty only

93
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,600
fined Prince Rui

94
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,760
one year's salary

95
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,040
as a reprimand.

96
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,640
Political tides ebb and flow.

97
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,110
Tread carefully

98
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,840
from now on.

99
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,040
Keep your distance

100
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,790
from Prince Rui.

101
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,390
Of course,

102
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,280
I'll try

103
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,960
to restore your position.

104
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,520
I have my own plans.

105
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,870
Director Lu,

106
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,670
you needn't bother.

107
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,190
You...

108
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,440
Lu Chang,

109
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,760
Su Changhua's name

110
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,400
has already been cleared.

111
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,720
Must you cling

112
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,230
to this grudge?

113
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,310
Even if I was wrong,

114
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,670
can't you forgive me for once?

115
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,760
If you had intervened then,

116
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,110
my mentor wouldn't have died unjustly.

117
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,840
Countless innocent people

118
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,200
wouldn't have suffered.

119
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,920
Fine!

120
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,310
You can disown me as your father!

121
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,520
But 10 years of hard work
shouldn't be wasted!

122
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,870
One misstep

123
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,160
can ruin everything.

124
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,720
This is about your future.

125
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,670
Don't be reckless!

126
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,680
Go and convince him!

127
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,560
I...

128
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,800
Mingshu,

129
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,720
persuade your brother.

130
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,390
This...

131
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,470
Is it fun?

132
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,710
Let's go!

133
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,710
Go!

134
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,800
Father,

135
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,470
I once believed

136
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,860
in karmic justice

137
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,310
and impartial law.

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,880
Now,

139
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,400
so-called

140
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,280
fairness

141
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,280
crumbles

142
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,310
before the villains.

143
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,470
How can I forget

144
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,520
the massacre of our clan?

145
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,600
If there is no justice in the world,

146
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,640
I'll carve it myself,

147
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,200
even if

148
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,670
I'm reduced

149
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
to bones.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,400
I knew you'd come.

151
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,400
So I've been waiting.

152
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,310
I adore your...

153
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,910
justice

154
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,280
and ruthlessness.

155
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,200
When I was in power,

156
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,360
you dared not strike.

157
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,150
What?

158
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,590
Now that I've fallen,

159
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,910
do you dare to kill me?

160
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,070
I'll haunt you

161
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,520
forever.

162
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,670
I'll haunt you forever!

163
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,360
My fatal mistake

164
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,040
was to spare you

165
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,710
and make you my weakness

166
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,520
and my downfall.

167
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,240
Today

168
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,670
I'll rectify that mistake.

169
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,120
Don't worry.

170
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,750
I'll plant flowers

171
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,910
on your corpse.

172
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,070
When I see

173
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,120
their gorgeous

174
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,120
and beautiful buds,

175
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,190
I'll take them
as my eternal companion from you!

176
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,790
Stop!

177
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,510
Prince Yu,

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,910
what are you doing?

179
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,910
Su Tangli is under His Majesty's

180
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,670
express protection.

181
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,790
What nonsense, Prince Rui?

182
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,840
I know

183
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,520
her status.

184
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,670
She has just attempted an assassination,

185
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,910
I will magnanimously

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,400
overlook it.

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,670
Prince Yu,
you narrowly escaped disaster,

188
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,520
but heaven's net spares no one.

189
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,520
Brother,

190
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,880
be careful.

191
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,710
The game remains.

192
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,710
The winner

193
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,880
is undecided.

194
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,880
I'll wait.

195
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,000
We'll see.

196
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,070
Prince Rui, thank you for helping us.

197
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,080
No need.

198
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,720
We have all

199
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,710
tried earnestly,

200
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,190
though the results

201
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,480
are disappointing.

202
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,710
Lady Su's displeasure

203
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,790
is understandable.

204
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,910
But Prince Yu shows no mercy.

205
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,510
Lady Su,

206
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,630
please be very careful

207
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,120
from now on.

208
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,520
Thank you, Prince Rui.

(Tablet of My Late Father Su Changhua)

210
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,240
Father,

211
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,000
your stain of corruption

212
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,360
is cleansed.

213
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,710
I've vindicated your name.

214
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,120
You can rest in peace now.

215
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,160
I understand

216
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,300
the ideals you cherished.

(Tablet of My Late Father Su Changhua)

218
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,280
I will inherit your legacy

219
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,480
to support

220
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,520
Prince Rui's reforms.

221
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,880
Mr. Lu,

222
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,150
thank you

223
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,390
for taking care of me these days

224
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,670
and clearing my father's name.

225
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,310
It was my duty

226
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,280
to exonerate my mentor.

227
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,310
Prince Yu will

228
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,670
pay his debt one day.

229
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,600
Please just

230
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,000
stop risking yourself.

231
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,280
Rest assured, Mr. Lu.

232
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
I understand the stakes now.

233
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,590
No more rash actions.

234
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,360
With my mentor's vindication,

235
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,790
what's next?

236
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,400
I want to go back to Jianglin.

237
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,880
Jianglin...

238
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,550
Good.

239
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,120
Let me offer incense to Mr. Su.

240
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,360
Lady Su,

241
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,000
you've suffered a lot

242
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,190
these days.

243
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,150
If you ever

244
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,480
need help,

245
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,760
come to me.

246
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,360
Director, no need for your concern.

Please take a look.

250
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,270
It is said that

251
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,120
Prince Yu killed Su Changhua,

252
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,550
and now he is in exile.

253

over the horses.

254
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,750

255
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,790
and out of the capital,

256
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,650
he may

257
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,950
yet rise again.

258
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,910
That's not true.

259
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,080
Today,

260
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,550
accused of corruption

261
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,950
and framing,

262
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
officials shun Prince Yu,

263
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,520
not to mention the maintenance.

264
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,910
In the future,

265
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,270
it'll be difficult for Prince Yu

266
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,310
to come back.

Chang,

273
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,590
if you hadn't saved me,

274
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,390
I would have died under that cliff.

275
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,280
Not to mention

276
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,590
your life-risking help

277
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,790
with the Jian Family's case

278
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,870
these days.

279
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,030
I, Jian Mingshu,

280
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,110
can never repay you.

281
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,310
Please accept my bow.

282
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,990
You...

283
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,070
Have you regained your memories?

284
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,550
I remembered everything.

285
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,950
All of it.

286
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,550
I remembered

287
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,620
I'm Jian Mingshu,

288
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,550
the manager of Jian's Gold Shop

289
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,550
in Jianglin.

290
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,000
I also remembered

291
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,720
my father, Jian Jinhai, who cherished me

292
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,310
as a treasure.

293
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,710
And

294
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,200
my close sisterly friend

295
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,550
Xiao Qingting, who died for me.

296
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,150
And I remembered

297
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,480
our pact.

298
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,390
No reunion,

299
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,550
lifelong strangers.

300
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,880
Mr. Lu,

301
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,110
I'd like to see

302
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,000
the files on the Jian Family massacre.

303
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,480
You already know

304
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
all the pertinent details.

305
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,480
But amnesia

306
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,920
blurred the details.

307
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,280
Now

308
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,310
I remember.

309
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,070
Every memory burns clear.

310
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,110
They were my everything,

311
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,760
now we've been severed

312
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,550
by death.

313
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,550
I must know

314
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,590
their last moments.

315
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,920
You just recovered your memories.

316
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,160
Maybe later...

317
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,750
I am the Jian Family's only survivor.

318
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,480
I have that right!

319
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,280

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,680
I'm fine.

329
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,750
I've checked

330
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,350
these records repeatedly.

331
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,110
The only anomaly

332
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,310
is Xiao Qingting.

333
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,350
She shadowed you constantly,

334
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,920
yet her body...

335
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,480
yet her body appeared
at the Jian Family.

337
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,790
we went to Xinghua Courtyard together.

338
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,870
But we witnessed

339
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,310
Concubine Zhou's

340
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,920
adultery.

341
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,960
Later, we were chased by assassins.

342
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,480
She died protecting me.

(Prudent in Thought, Diligent in Action)
Finding him

346
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,870
might help us

347
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,870
against Prince Yu.

348
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,520
It's Gao Shicai.

349
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,790
Gao Shicai?

350
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,350
Are you sure?

351
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,000
I saw him.

352
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,720
It's Gao Shicai.

353
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,720

is served.

356
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,760
Then...

357
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,770
did your father entrust you

358
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,680
with Mr. Su's evidence?

359
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
I have nothing to hide.

360
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,510
But Father

361
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,590
gave me nothing.

362
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,310
Are these memories

363
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,440
useless

364
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,830
to you?

365
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,070
Are you disappointed?

366
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,150
No matter.

367
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,310
The case is far-reaching.

368
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,790
I will pursue other leads.

369
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,630
Mingshu,

370
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,760
I know these memories

371
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,000
are tormenting you.

372
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,520
From now on,

373
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,920
whatever comes,

374
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,390
I'll be there for you

375
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,310
and stand by you.

376
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,230
(Lu Chang,)

377
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,960
(I don't want to involve you.)

378
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,630
(I can't reveal the truth.)

379
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,310
You've done enough for me.

380
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,550
Falling from the altar,

381
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,590
and you called it minor injuries.

382
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,680
I'll never forget

383
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,480
that debt.

384
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,150
But life

385
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,480
is so long.

386
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,520
Let other matters

387
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,110
be buried.

388
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,720
I have wronged you before.

389
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,110
But during these days,

390
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,480
is there only gratitude between us?

391
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,870
Our feelings...

392
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,800
Lu Chang,

393
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,870
I loved you for years.

394
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,550
It was you who cast me aside.

395
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,110
Now you speak of feelings?

396
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,790
Have you forgotten your past words?

397
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,640
- Then...
- It was you

398
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,280
who personally refused to marry me.

399
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,070
My feelings for you

400
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,590
were completely severed at that time.

401
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,920
Had it not been for that accident,

402
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,550
we would have remained unrelated,

403
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,760
living worlds apart.

404
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,920
Now I, Jian Mingshu,

405
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,760
feel nothing but gratitude towards you.

406
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,680
Mr. Lu,

407
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,820
I beg you to let go of this attachment.

408
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,800
Mingshu!

409
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,640
(Xuanyi Hall)

410
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,520
Mingshu!

411
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,670
Mingshu...

412
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,140
(He'an Residence)

413
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,110
My past refusal to marry

414
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,550
was my fault.

415
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,350
I was too foolish.

416
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,390
Please give me another chance.

417
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,920
Mr. Lu,

418
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,720
please don't force what can't be.

419
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,560
Mingshu!

420
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,750
Mingshu,

421
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,630
I know

422
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,390
I have wronged you before.

423
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
I let you down.

424
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,630
But during these months in the capital,

425
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,000
how could

426
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,390
our mutual affection

427
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,590
and deep bond be wrong?

428
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,870
I can't believe that
you forgot everything

429
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,830
after regaining your memory.

430
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,400
Precisely because
I have regained my memory,

431
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,630
I can't pretend that
nothing has happened.

432
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,680
I can't go on with this relationship.

433
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,590
I'm sorry.

are you tired?

Your Majesty!

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,880
Your Majesty...

00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Your Majesty!

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,150
Your Majesty...

465
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,790
Summon the imperial physician!

466
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,760
Your Majesty,

467
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,440
are you feeling better now?

468
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,280
Why is Prince Rui here?

469
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,390
Your Majesty, you may not know.

470
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,790
Last night, Prince Rui

471
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,520
heard of your unconsciousness

472
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,870
and feared that
you were not being properly cared for.

473
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,960
He tended to you

474
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,000
by your side

475
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,520
all night

476
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,200
without sleep.

477
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,110
Now

478
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,650
he's probably exhausted.

479
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,040
Such a child.

480
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,000
Cover him with a blanket.

481
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,040
Yes.

482
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,670
Father,

483
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,390
you're awake.

484
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,280
Do you have any discomfort?

485
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,300
Let me call the physician

486
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,510
to take a good look at you.

487
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,440
Unnecessary.

488
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,110
I know

489
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,590
my condition.

490
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,630
Taking a few days off

491
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,000
will do.

492
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,840
Father,

493
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,630
I was wrong.

494
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,040
My impulsive actions

495
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,630
and lack of consideration

496
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,440
have hurt you.

497
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,310
I only wish you

498
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,310
good health.

499
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,630
That's right.

500
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,240
How old are you?

501
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,870
Why are you still acting like a child?

502
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,240
Whenever you err,

503
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,440
you call me Father

504
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,240
to ask for mercy.

505
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,920
Jingran,

506
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,080
sit down.

507
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,670
Jingran,

508
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,520
I have known your stubbornness
since childhood.

509
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,240
You pursue your goals

510
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,680
relentlessly.

511
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,790
I understand what you want.

512
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,870
Besides,

513
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,920
this matter

514
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,760
is not entirely your fault.

515
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,470
Father...

516
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,200
How do you feel

517
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,080
about the proposal

518
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,390
of ministers

519
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,790
to appoint you

520
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,350
Crown Prince?

521
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,040
Father,

522
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,230
I'll

523
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,380
speak frankly.

524
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,950
Speak.

525
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,070
Since childhood,

526
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,630
you have taught me

527
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,550
that the people

528
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,830
are the foundation of the nation.

529
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,440
I have no rivalry

530
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,760
with Prince Yu,

531
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,960
nor do I desire the position
of Crown Prince.

532
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,680
As a prince,

533
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,550
it is my duty

534
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,070
to serve the court,

535
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,680
the country,

536
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,150
and the people.

537
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,830
Some days ago,

538
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,040
when I investigated Su Changhua's case,

539
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,870
I acted on this principle,

540
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,390
but I damaged

541
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,000
fraternal ties

542
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,040
and caused you pain.

543
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,110
This is my fault.

544
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,990
However...

545
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,350
Go on.

546
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:33,950
Father,

547
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,440
I remember the note

548
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,070
that princes who break the law

549
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,830
share the fate of the commoners.

550
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,580
Even if history were to repeat itself,

551
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,590
I'd still

552
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,000
enforce the law impartially

553
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,270
and do my duty.

554
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,240
Only in this way

555
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,240
can I honor your teachings

556
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,550
and the public trust.

557
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,230
Enough.

558
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,960
You've served all night.

559
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,520
Retire to rest.

560
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,670
Father...

561
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,590
Father, take good care of yourself.

562
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,630
I'll

563
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,840
take my leave.

564
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,790
Decree this:

565
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,930
Summon the Director
of the Imperial Secretariat

566
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,480
to the palace immediately.

567
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,670
Yes.

568
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,460
(Top Scholar Residence)

569
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,440
Uncle Wei,

570
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,330
Mother will

571
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,520
finish cooking soon.

572
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,640
No rush.

573
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,720
Have some tea first.

574
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,880
Okay.

575
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,320
Uncle Wei,

576
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,550
how well

577
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,960
do you know Deputy Commander Cao

578
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,040
from our last meeting?

579
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,840
Cao Hai?

580
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,440
He served under me briefly

581
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,670
years ago.

582
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,960
Not closely.

583
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,710
His recent official visit

584
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,440
took me

585
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,000
by surprise.

586
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,050
I heard that he is now

587
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,980
the deputy commander
of the Jianglin Prefecture Garrison.

588
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,590
Is he from Jianglin?

589
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,400
I don't think so.

590
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,650
I remember

591
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,920
he's probably from Ning'an.

592
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,960
So that's how it is.

593
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,390
Mingshu, what's wrong?

594
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,800
Why do you ask about him?

595
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,630
I thought we were from the same place.

596
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,040
I misunderstood his origin.

597
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,360
Uncle Wei, please rest here.

598
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,290
I'll check the kitchen.

599
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,130
Okay.

600
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,280
Mingshu.

601
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,070
Qingzhao,

602
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,470
you're here.

603
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,560
I heard everything.

604
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,230
Are you okay?

605
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,630
Look at me.

606
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,820
The same as ever.

607
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,110
A few days ago,

608
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,730
I learned more about my family's past.

609
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,630
I have

610
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,520
a deeper understanding now.

611
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,150
I can bear it.

612
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,390
Mingshu,

613
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,920
if you want to leave Lu Chang,

614
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,520
I won't judge your decision

615
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,630
or defend him

616
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,630
without knowing your past.

617
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,670
But as your friend,

618
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,110
I hope you

619
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,950
follow your true heart.

620
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,920
Right now, it's my choice.

621
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,040
We've known

622
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,320
each other

623
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,150
for over 10 years.

624
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,320
To be honest,

625
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,400
in Jianglin,

626
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,040
I wanted to marry him so badly.

627
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,840
I was so desperate

628
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,960
and made every effort.

629
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,880
But

630
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,030
he never

631
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,630
reciprocated.

632
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,550
I was alone.

633
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,800
After the results were announced,

634
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,840
I confessed.

635
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,920
He refused.

636
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,710
From that day on,

637
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,590
we should have become strangers.

638
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,800
Since then,

639
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,000
we should have been

640
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,040
irrelevant.

641
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,640
How can we

642
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,220
reunite now without reservations?

643
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,590
He always mentioned gratitude.

644
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,880
He wanted

645
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,480
to return

646
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,670
my family's favor

647
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,230
in the future.

648
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,150
I once thought he was pedantic,

649
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,670
making a big deal

650
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,590
out of

651
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,960
trivial favors.

652
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,630
Later, I understood.

653
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,270
The burden is heavy.

654
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,960
He has repaid

655
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,230
our family's

656
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,920
little kindness.

657
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,630
He owes me nothing.

658
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,150
Instead,

659
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,110
I owe him a debt

660
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,440
beyond this life.

661
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,550
Mingshu,

662
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,040
I know you feel indebted to Lu Chang.

663
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,230
But I hope you understand

664
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,630
that Lu Chang's actions

665
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,550
weren't just repayment.

666
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,590
I know that.

667
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,280
But I still

668
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,360
can't accept it.

669
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,110
It's okay, Qingzhao.

670
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,230
If you want to help,

671
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
retrieve Jianglin's

672
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,710
registries for me.

673
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,440
Please.

674
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,920
Why do you need that?

675
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,590
It's nothing.

676
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,000
Just

677
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,880
a memento.

678
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,210
Auntie Xu.

679
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,110
Consort Rui.

680
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,590
I saw our carriage here.

681
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,000
So I come here to have a look.

682
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,590
Is Qingzhao here?

683
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,040
Qingzhao and Mingshu are upstairs.

684
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,670
No disturbance.

685
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,190
Your Highness, you take care

686
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,360
of His Majesty every day.

687
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,280
Please take care

688
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,750
of yourself.

689
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,800
Until His Majesty recovers,

690
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,040
I can only rest.

691
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,520
Instead of sitting here restlessly,

692
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,160
I prefer

693
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,230
to find peace by his side.

694
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,010
Your Highness,

695
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,960
Madam Song from the Residence
of Duke of the State is here.

696
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,000
Let her in immediately.

697
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,880
Yes.

698
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,630
Greetings, Your Highness.

699
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,880
Sister,

700
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,440
no formalities.

701
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,400
Even between sisters,

702
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,670
etiquette is

703
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,880
necessary.

704
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,130
How is

705
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,440
His Majesty?

706
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,440
Did he get better?

707
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,320
Troubled by the conflict

708
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,230
between the two princes,

709
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,030
his old illness

710
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,670
has flared up.

711
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,680
I think

712
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,440
rest

713
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,000
should bring recovery.

714
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,000
His Majesty enjoys heaven's favor.

715
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,800
Your Highness,

716
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,440
don't be overly concerned.

717
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,880
Sister,

718
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:08,730
hurry up.

719
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,510
Come here.

720
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,800
Sister,

721
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,230
do you have a special purpose

722
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,590
for your visit today?

723
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,060
It's no big deal.

724
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,280
Mainly

725
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,980
to see you.

726
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,720
Look at that.

727
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,550
Sister, you're beaming.

728
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,960
Any good news?

729
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,520
Let's talk about it.

730
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,760
Well...

731
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,910
Qingzhao

732
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,000
is approaching his capping ceremony.

733
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,800
I think

734
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,110
he's becoming

735
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,110
inseparable

736
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,590
from Lady Lu.

737
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,400
It's time to go further.

738
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,070
After the capping ceremony,

739
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,450
I plan

740
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,920
to propose marriage to the Lu Family.

741
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,030
It can be seen

742
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,480
as double happiness.

743
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,520
How do you like that?

744
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,440
I have

745
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,550
long awaited Qingzhao's marriage.

746
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,440
When the time comes,

747
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,840
I'll add some engagement gifts.

748
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,400
I'll inform His Majesty later

749
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,280
at Funing Hall.

750
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,920
I can tell him

751
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,800
about this.

752
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,480
Should we

753
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,440
disturb His Majesty?

754
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,000
I've known

755
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,800
Lu Chang's punishment

756
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,190
after replacing

757
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,960
Prince Rui

758
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,550
at the Blessing Ceremony.

759
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,750
If His Majesty knows about this,

760
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,070
would he

761
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,550
object?

762
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,520
You misunderstand.

763
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,710
His Majesty personally

764
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,190
selected Lu Chang as the top scholar.

765
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,520
Lu Chang is

766
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,440
extraordinary.

767
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,550
The punishment

768
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,400
for the Blessing Ceremony

769
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,800
was merely

770
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,230
a check on his breach

771
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,550
of royal protocol.

772
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,270
His Majesty

773
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,760
still admires

774
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,070
his wisdom and courage.

775
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,270
Speaking of which,

776
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,150
His Majesty

777
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,550
would bless

778
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,800
Qingzhao's marriage

779
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,150
to Lu Chang's sister.

780
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,040
In that case,

781
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,840
it's really great.

782
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,190
And an imperial decree

783
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,630
of this family

784
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,550
would honor

785
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,440
these two kids.

786
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:23,440
And it would hasten the marriage.

787
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,070
I understand

788
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,710
your heart.

789
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,670
Rest assured.

790
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,440
Qingzhao is my nephew.

791
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,150
The decree

792
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,630
falls to me.

793
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,150
His Majesty needs

794
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,440
joyful news

795
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,230
in the midst

796
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,470
of troubles

797
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,360
these days.

798
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,590
I'm so grateful for your efforts.

799
00:42:54,690 --> 00:43:00,220
- Good!
