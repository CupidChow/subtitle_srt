the time of death?

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000

along with a hidden arrow,

36
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,040
likely the murder weapon.

as to want to kill you?

Lu Wencai

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,240
was indeed despicable,

but

50
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,000

I beg Your Highnesses

57
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,630
to uphold justice for him.

please compose yourself.

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,870

77
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,390

with no stiffened muscles

79
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,720
or coagulated blood.

80
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,430
According to the coroner,

81
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,560
death occurred

82
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,600
within the span of an incense burning.

83
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,600
Preliminary judgment suggests a homicide.

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,360
This is the murder weapon

85
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,800
we found outside the window.

86
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,480
We believe the murderer

87
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,480
discharged the hidden arrow stealthily,

88
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
then fled in haste,

89
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,870
leaving it behind.

90
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,430
Please have a look, Your Highnesses.

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,750

with Your Highnesses' arrival,

94
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,270
the academy has been sealed,

95
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,270
no one in or out.

96
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,750
If Lu Wencai was killed within a short time,

97
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,120
the murderer

98
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,160
must be

99
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,480
among us.

100
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,120
Prince Rui, look,

101
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,270
this arrow bears markings.

102
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,500

103
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,030
This is...

104
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,430
The character Xie.

105
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,120
(Xie)

106
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,160
Xie?

107
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,020
But we have no one here

108
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,310
by that surname.

109
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,710
Headmaster Xu,

110
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,720
in this academy,

111
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,800
is there anyone surnamed Xie?

112
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,480
We have

113
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,800
only one student surnamed Xie,

114
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,640
and he is

115
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,560
Marquis Yongqing's son,

116
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,230
Xie Xi.

117
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,710
Well...

118
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
Xie Xi?

119
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,190
Xie Xi?

120
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,680
Where is he?

121
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,800
Your Highness,

122
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,510
he was confined to a separate chamber

123
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,070
after yesterday's brawl with the victim.

124
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,190
He's absent.

125
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,240
Bring him forth.

126
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,310
Marquis Yongqing's clan

127
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,800
has sworn allegiance to you.

128
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,920
How will you proceed, Prince Rui?

129
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,870
This case remains unresolved.

130
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,680
Your presumption

131
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,110
is premature.

132
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,620
(Xie)

133
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,710
Xie Xi,

134
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,270
is this

135
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,120
hidden arrow yours?

136
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,600
Your Highness,

137
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,000
it was

138
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,950
indeed mine,

139
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,270
but it was lost two days ago.

140
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,120
I don't know

141
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,430
how it came here.

142
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,830
Moreover, two days ago,

143
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,270
when I fought with Lu Wencai,

144
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,630
he sneak-attacked my arm.

145
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,680
The wound hasn't healed yet.

146
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,630
Even with this arrow,

147
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,190
how was I supposed to hurt him?

148
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,240
Where were you

149
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,310
before Lu Wencai's death?

150
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,950
I was confined to my room alone

151
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,070
and didn't go out.

152
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,510
My servant can vouch for me.

153
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,890
Your servant

154
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,750
will naturally follow your lead.

155
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,720
How can his testimony

156
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,070
be trusted?

157
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,870
Your Highness,

158
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,600
I have another witness.

159
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,110
Who?

160
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,230
Prior to this,

161
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,680
Tang Sheng, a handyman from the academy,

162
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,390
came to visit me.

163
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,510
Why would a handyman

164
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,240
visit you?

165
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,630
Your Highness,

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,670
I fought with Lu Wencai yesterday

167
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,720
because he was bullying Tang Sheng,

168
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,360
and I tried to stand up for him.

169
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,720
So, this morning,

170
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,240
Tang Sheng

171
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,320
came to thank me.

172
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,120
Bring forth Tang Sheng!

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
I'm Tang Sheng.

174
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,720
Did you visit Xie Xi

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,320
before the span of an incense burning?

176
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,870
Yesterday, indeed,

177
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
I owed Xie Xi gratitude for his defense,

178
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,960
but

179
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,240
I didn't visit him today.

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,840
Tang Sheng,

181
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,510
you...

182
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,470
Mr. Xie,

183
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,550
you are merely suspected now.

184
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,150
If you didn't do it,

185
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,670
Prince Yu and Prince Rui

186
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,200
will surely clear your name.

187
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,080
I'm really grateful

188
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,150
for your protection.

189
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,270
But human life is of great value.

190
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,510
Forgive me for not giving false testimony.

191
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,040
Xie Xi,

192
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,550
fabricating false testimony

193
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,480
is a grave crime.

194
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,080
Tang Sheng,

195
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,790
why would you do this?

196
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,270
I see now.

197
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,870
You killed Lu Wencai, didn't you?

198
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,840
Afraid that he would harass you again,

199
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,320
you used my fight with him

200
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,200
to frame me.

201
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,630
You killed him, didn't you?

202
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,280
Xie Xi!

203
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,350
Don't act rashly.

204
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,600
The truth

205
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,600
will surface

206
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,240
during interrogation.

207
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,750
Why

208
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,360
disgrace yourself

209
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,030
before the princes?

210
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,510
Your Highnesses,

211
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,790
I mean no disrespect,

212
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,320
but Tang Sheng

213
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,510
has ill intentions.

214
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,110
Headmaster Xu,

215
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,200
what's going on here?

216
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,790
Isn't Tang Sheng

217
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,750
a handyman in your academy?

218
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,200
Why is she disguising herself as a man

219
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,480
and hiding her true identity?

220
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,270
Who is she exactly?

221
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,790
I have no idea.

222
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,550
Over a year ago,

223
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,390
Xie Xi brought her here

224
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,670
to settle down.

225
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,750
She's been well-behaved

226
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,390
and never caused any trouble.

227
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,840
Xie Xi,

228
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,150
what exactly is going on?

229
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,510
Your Highnesses,

230
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,440
Tang Sheng

231
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,320
is actually Su Changhua's only daughter,

232
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,160
Su Tangli.

233
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,150
I rescued her from a mass burial ground,

234
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,270
and out of past acquaintance,

235
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,390
hid her in this academy.

236
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,080
Later,

237
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,910
Lu Wencai discovered her identity

238
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,150
and harassed her relentlessly.

239
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,790
I tried to help her

240
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,120
out of kindness,

241
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,200
not expecting her

242
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,600
to harbor malicious intentions

243
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,120
and plot to kill Lu for permanent relief.

244
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,480
Repaying kindness with betrayal,

245
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,870
she stole my hidden arrow

246
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,800
to implicate me.

247
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,510
Xie Xi,

248
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,270
how could I implicate you?

249
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,150
Do not impulsively bite back.

250
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,750
This benefits

251
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,080
neither of us.

252
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,720
The arrow is your personal weapon.

253
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,510
How could she steal it?

254
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,910
What's your relationship?

255
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,870
She...

256
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,200
She repeatedly approached to seduce me,

257
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,120
exploiting my pity

258
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,080
to seize opportunity.

259
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,720
Xie Xi,

260
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,440
how can you...

261
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,270
How can you distort the truth like this?

262
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,110
Your Highnesses,

263
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,200
I hit Lu Wencai yesterday

264
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,600
only because of Su Tangli's enticement.

265
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,000
I will be an heir apparent soon.

266
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,150
Why would I risk my future

267
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,240
to kill him?

268
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,150
As a fugitive government slave,

269
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,030
she clearly murdered Lu

270
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,240
to protect herself.

271
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,870
Xie Xi,

272
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,960
you once swore

273
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,150
that you would protect me

274
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,590
and love me.

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,440
You vowed to break with the County Princess

276
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,630
rather than abandon me.

277
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,080
But now,

278
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,240
to save your own life,

279
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,910
you'd push me to the teeth of the storm.

280
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,360
Lu Wencai did know my identity.

281
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,670
He once tried to harass me

282
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,870
and even

283
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,030
insulted you with vile words,

284
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,080
making you hate him to the bone.

285
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,600
You even vowed

286
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,200
never to spare him.

287
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,360
How can you

288
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,630
claim no motive to kill him?

289
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,110
Also,

290
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,870
I'm only a weak woman

291
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,480
with powerless hands,

292
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,750
how could I kill a man like him?

293
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,360
Precisely because you're weak,

294
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,120
he lowered his guard.

295
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,550
Had you struck when he drew close,

296
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,870
how could he have escaped?

297
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,150
Back then, to help me,

298
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,030
you even used your father's authority

299
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,960
to forge my identity papers.

300
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,480
I thought you truly cared about me.

301
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,480
Now I see

302
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,840
I blinded my own eyes.

303
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
Forge papers?

304
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,560
Enough.

305
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,550
Abusing authority

306
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,750
to forge papers.

307
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,630
That's a grave crime.

308
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,150
I find this situation troubling for you.

309
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,910
Now, not just Xie Xi,

310
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,240
but Marquis Yongqing is implicated.

311
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,110
Prince Rui,

312
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,670
have you prepared

313
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,440
to shield the entire Yongqing clan?

314
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,670
Nobles bleed

315
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,360
like commoners under the law.

316
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,270
Rest assured, Prince Yu.

317
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,870
I will

318
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,750
handle this case impartially.

319
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,710
Governor Jia,

320
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,550
detain Xie Xi

321
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,630
and Su Tangli

322
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,200
in the academy for now.

323
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,390
We'll

324
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,100
investigate this case thoroughly.

325
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,800
Yes.

326
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,110
Guards!

327
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,150
Did Mingshu's assassin

328
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,990
confess anything?

329
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,360
He said he only followed his boss's orders

330
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,240
and knew nothing.

331
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,510
He's probably an underling.

332
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,150
The other assassin remains at large.

333
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,480
We mustn't let our guard down.

334
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,590
Understood.

335
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,960
Mr. Lu

336
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,990
is acting on Prince Rui's orders.

337
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,670
He has a few questions for Su Tangli.

338
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,590
Tangli,

339
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,320
we're alone now.

340
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,600
Tell me the truth.

341
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,150
Did you kill Lu Wencai?

342
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,750
I did not kill him.

343
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,870
I swear by my late father's name,

344
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,840
if I lie,

345
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,960
may his spirit never rest

346
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,830
in the afterlife.

347
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,320
Good.

348
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,160
As long as your hands are clean,

349
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,200
there's room for maneuver.

350
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,390
Mr. Lu,

351
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,760
Mr. Ying,

352
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,110
I'm sorry for troubling you.

353
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,750
Check thoroughly

354
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,590
for any wounds or bloodstains.

355
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,720
Raise your hands.

356
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,880
Come on, raise them for inspection.

357
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,100
(Refinement of Confucian Tradition)

358
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,160
No student bore wounds or bloodstains.

359
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,640
As we've stayed

360
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,110
by the two princes' sides,

361
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,440
I've requested my cousin's permission

362
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,720
for us to assist the Liangzhou Governor

363
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,680
in the investigation.

364
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,640
Prince Yu and the Director

365
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,800
of the Imperial Secretariat agreed.

366
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,750
With your help,

367
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,000
we'll uncover the truth soon

368
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,000
and secure justice for Su Tangli.

369
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,440
However, the murder weapon

370
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,820
(Huantao Study)
belongs to Xie Xi,

371
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,030
while Su Tangli's identity

372
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,110
is highly sensitive,

373
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,790
and her motive appears more plausible.

374
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,110
(Huantao Study)
Both have clear suspicion,

375
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,750
yet the true murderer

376
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,110
remains difficult to determine now.

377
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,880
If Xie Xi and Lady Su

378
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,240
really wanted to kill Lu Wencai,

379
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,070
there were clearly better opportunities.

380
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,310
Why wait until the two princes

381
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,030
were inspecting the academy
to make a move?

382
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,790
And they even left the hidden dart
out the window?

383
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,070
No matter how reckless Xie Xi and Tangli
may be,

384
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,920
they wouldn't make
such an amateur mistake.

385
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,310
Unless that dart was

386
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,240
deliberately planted at the scene
by the real killer

387
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,200
to frame the two of them.

388
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,390
Only then,

389
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,350
do all these suspicious points
make sense.

390
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,880
That's what I think too, Qingzhao.

391
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,160
Seems after Yin family rumors

392
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,550
and the Liu Yuanying incident,

393
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,200
we're even more in sync now.

394
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,750
It's only because you're so perceptive

395
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,240
that I could gain such insight.

396
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,640
Since Lu Wencai

397
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,310
snuck into Huantao Study early on,

398
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,350
it shows this crime

399
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,590
wasn't a spur-of-the-moment act.

400
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,560
Then

401
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,670
that means...

402
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,750
It means the killer
targeted Huantao Study

403
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,640
with deeper meaning.

404
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,950
You see?

405
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,960
You and Mingshu are quite in sync too.

406
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,590
Let's

407
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,880
check the crime scene first.

408
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,070
Did I say something wrong again?

409
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,070
By the way,

410
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,350
Madam Lin urgently needs you.

411
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,040
I almost forgot.

412
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,400
I'll join you later.

413
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,060
(Huantao Study)

414
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,500
(Steeped in Learning
Lofty Peak of Virtue)

415
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,480
The coroner said

416
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,030
the wound on Lu Wencai's body

417
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,200
is wider than the arrow's tip diameter,

418
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,350
indicating that the killer

419
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,480
stabbed multiple times.

420
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,830
Correct.

421
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,750
When we found the body during the day,

422
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,830
he hadn't been dead long.

423
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,270
The blood hadn't fully clotted,

424
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,830
and the wound was soaked in blood,

425
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,680
masking its details.

426
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,350
Now that the blood's dried,

427
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,750
the comparison becomes clearer.

428
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,550
How do you know about such things?

429
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,160
You'd be surprised, Mr. Song.

430
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,960
My father is the head constable of Jianglin.

431
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,750
We've been tagging along

432
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,480
to crime scenes since childhood,

433
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,110
seeing countless corpses.

434
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,310
Mr. Lu's forensic expertise

435
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,480
is more than enough

436
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
to qualify him as a coroner.

437
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,680
Mr. Lu is truly remarkable.

438
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,750
Ying Xun exaggerates as always.

439
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,750
Pay him no mind, Mr. Song.

440
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,760
Wait,

441
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,920
isn't the arrow a single-shot weapon?

442
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,750
Even if it weren't,

443
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,000
the possibility of multiple strikes

444
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,200
hitting the same wound would be slim.

445
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,070
Mr. Song, are you suggesting

446
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,510
Lu Wencai wasn't killed

447
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,070
by the arrow shot from the window?

448
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,030
Hidden arrows are close-quarter weapons

449
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,160
for sneak attacks during close combat.

450
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,200
Their effective range is about ten paces.

451
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,400
The closer they get to the range's end,

452
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,550
the more force they lose.

453
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,550
Moreover, Lu Wencai's wound

454
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,590
was on the right side of his neck,

455
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,830
indicating the killer

456
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,920
couldn't have struck

457
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,880
from the window.

458
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,200
In that case,

459
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,270
he wasn't killed by a projectile.

460
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,920
The killer likely sneaked into the room,

461
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,400
ambushed him from behind,

462
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,310
gripped the arrow to stab his neck,

463
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,880
then fled,

464
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,000
leaving the arrow behind.

465
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,200
This also explains

466
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,070
the mess at the scene.

467
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,160
Lu Wencai's face was contorted in agony,

468
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,750
yet he made no sound,

469
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,800
indicating the killer

470
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,550
muffled his mouth and nose from behind

471
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,400
to silence him.

472
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,480
If he was killed in this way,

473
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,350
Su Tangli couldn't have made it.

474
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,680
As for Xie Xi....

475
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,960
Xie Xi's wrist was injured by Lu Wencai.

476
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,680
He couldn't have done it either.

477
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,640
Since neither could have done it,

478
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,640
this confirms our earlier theory,

479
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,070
the real killer is someone else.

480
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,790
Then how did he escape

481
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,550
after the murder?

482
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,000
That circles back to Mr. Lu's question,

483
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,270
why choose

484
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,990
(Steeped in Learning)
Huantao Study as the crime scene?

485
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,910
Mr. Song,

486
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,310
is there a hidden passage

487
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,850
between Huantao Study and Qianshu Tower?

488
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,760
Right. I'll go check.

489
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,960
If as we guessed,

490
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,880
Lu Wencai was stabbed multiple times,

491
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,920
blood would spurt out.

492
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,750
The killer's clothes

493
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,590
must be stained with blood.

494
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,390
But where's the bloodstained clothing?

495
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,340
(New Dawn)

496
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,350
Lu Chang, Lu Chang!

497
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,240
Look.

498
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,350
What have I found?

499
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,460
(Student Lu Wencai)
Look.

500
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,110
Lu Wencai's poetry manuscript?

501
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,590
With this,

502
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,000
the pieces fall into place.

503
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,640
Lu Wencai likely knew

504
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,750
the two princes

505
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,680
would visit Huantao Study.

506
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,440
He snuck in

507
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,550
with this pre-written poem,

508
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,550
aiming to

509
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,400
impress them,

510
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,590
never expecting

511
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,200
the killer to be lying in wait here.

512
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,640
After killing him, the killer

513
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,200
used the manuscript to wipe his hands.

514
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,880
Without the chance to destroy it,

515
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,240
he discarded it at a concealed spot

516
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,720
along his escape route.

517
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,030
Now our priority

518
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,400
is locating the clothing

519
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,960
stained with Lu Wencai's blood.

520
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,720
But we've searched the vicinity

521
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,750
and nothing's turned up.

522
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,720
Would the killer even have time

523
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,640
to change clothes in such a rush?

524
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,920
What if he didn't?

525
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,390
Thanks, Mr. Lu.

526
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,110
Thanks.

527
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,350
Thanks.

528
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,350
- It's still hot.
- Thanks.

529
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,430
You're welcome.

530
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,640
Mr. Zhang,

531
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,070
why aren't you eating?

532
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,400
I've never liked

533
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,790
Hot and Spicy Soup since childhood.

534
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,560
Thanks.

535
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,150
My apologies!

536
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,720
Your robe is stained.

537
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,680
I'll ask a guard

538
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
to escort you to get changed,

539
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,630
lest you catch a cold.

540
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,240
It doesn't matter, Lady Mingshu.

541
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,240
No worries.

542
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,310
I'm truly sorry about this.

543
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,550
The case has progressed.

544
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,190
Everyone,

545
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,960
you may depart now.

546
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,800
Mr. Zhang,

547
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,550
what are you looking for?

548
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,550
Do you need help?

549
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,590
Nothing.

550
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,910
Zhang Song!

551
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,480
Where are you going?

552
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,990
You...

553
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,070
Is this

554
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,920
what you're looking for?

555
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,940
(Order of Breeze, Student, Lu Wencai)

556
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,750
I don't know what you're talking about.

557
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,830
I was taking a shortcut back to my room.

558
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,720
Kindly step aside.

559
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,390
Is that so?

560
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,670
(Mingli Hall)
Your Highnesses, Minister Lu,

561
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,350
Zhang Song has confessed.

562
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,750
Tell the truth right away.

563
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,350
It was me.

564
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,720
I lured Lu Wencai

565
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
to Huantao Study

566
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,960
and killed him.

567
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,870
You...

568
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,830
Where did you get the arrow?

569
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,110
I just found it.

570
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,110
I recognized the character Xie on it

571
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,750
and knew it belonged to Xie Xi.

572
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,350
Did you throw it by the window

573
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,110
to frame

574
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,550
Xie Xi?

575
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,560
Yes.

576
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,350
Xie Xi was under house arrest

577
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,590
and had the chance to act.

578
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
Moreover, his prior feud with Lu Wencai

579
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,400
made him the prime suspect.

580
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,550
And after that?

581
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,560
After that...

582
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,780
(Order of Breeze)

583
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,860
(Order of Breeze, Student, Lu Wencai)

584
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,880
Blame Heaven's blindness.

585
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,680
Had he died under the fallen plaque,

586
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,440
none of this would've happened.

587
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,640
You caused the plaque of Mingli Hall

588
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,680
to fall

589
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,350
to kill Lu Wencai?

590
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,270
Why did you kill him?

591
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,750
I endured decades of grueling study.

592
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,920
My parents sacrificed everything

593
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,400
to send me to Songling Academy.

594
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,440
I aimed to repay them with achievements,

595
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,880
only to encounter a vile creature,

596
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,110
who bullied me every day.

597
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,510
My festered resentment grows unbearable.

598
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,310
In the end, I lost my rationality

599
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,720
and made a mistake.

600
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,480
All lies!

601
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,750
My son was virtuous.

602
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,240
How could he bully others?

603
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,390
It's you.

604
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,030
You killed him!

605
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,550
And now you're slandering the dead

606
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,640
to absolve yourself!

607
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,720
Everyone knows Lu Wencai's gambling,

608
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,510
whoring, and bullying of the innocent!

609
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,960
My sister was...

610
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,030
If it weren't for you, the Minister,

611
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,270
covering up his crimes,

612
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,790
he'd have been arrested

613
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,070
and exiled to the frontier long ago!

614
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,630
Minister Lu,

615
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,590
why feign ignorance here?

616
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,270
Since you raised a vermin,

617
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,310
you're nothing

618
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,070
but a gray-bearded scoundrel!

619
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,790
You're doomed to die with no heir.

620
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,630
I...

621
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,460
I'm going to tear you into pieces!

622
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,670
Enough!

623
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,510
Even if you were severely mistreated,

624
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,590
it justifies neither murder nor framing.

625
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,630
Early tomorrow morning,

626
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,240
escort the criminal to Liangzhou Prefecture.

627
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,350
Summon Xie Xi

628
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
and Su Tangli.

629
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,790
I acknowledge my wrongdoing.

630
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,310
Your Highnesses, I beg your forgiveness!

631
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,720
Xie Xi,

632
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,160
as the legitimate heir

633
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,350
to Marquis Yongqing,

634
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,790
you were supposed to inherit his title

635
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,920
and serve the country,

636
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,430
yet now,

637
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,510
you dare forge official papers,

638
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,920
harbor a criminal slave,

639
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,640
and engage in illicit relations with her.

640
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:42,960
Your actions

641
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,070
have corrupted morals,

642
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,550
defied laws,

643
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
and drawn public contempt.

644
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,150
I shall

645
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,640
report this to His Majesty

646
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,930
and prosecute you according to the law.

647
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,040
Your Highness,

648
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,270
how should we deal with Su Tangli?

649
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,310
Hand her over to the Imperial Music Office?

650
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,200
Your Highnesses,

651
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,510
Su Tangli

652
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,680
does bear convict status,

653
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,190
but

654
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,790
the Office failed to verify her death

655
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,920
before sending her to the mass burial ground.

656
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,000
It's grave negligence.

657
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,110
Moreover,

658
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
they've already

659
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,350
reported her death from illness.

660
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,400
Returning someone officially declared died

661
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,030
would place the Office

662
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,720
in a difficult position.

663
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,880
Thus, in my humble opinion,

664
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,750
we may as well retain her

665
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,510
at the academy

666
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,760
under

667
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,960
Headmaster Xu's

668
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,480
temporary custody.

669
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,790
Prince Yu, what's your opinion?

670
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,590
Minister Lu speaks wisely.

671
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,880
I concur entirely.

672
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,670
In that case,

673
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,590
Su Tangli remains detained
at the academy

674
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,200
under rigorous guard

675
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,640
for further investigation.

676
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,910
Yes.

677
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,240
As you command.

678
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,320
Well,

679
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,580
with this case resolved,

680
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,200
I shall return to my residence.

681
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,280
Governor Jia.

682
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,670
Yes.

683
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,960
You owe thanks

684
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,880
to Prefectural Graduate Lu.

685
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,830
His efforts contributed

686
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,790
to the achievements of Liangzhou.

687
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,560
I'm flattered.

688
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,720
The truth came to light

689
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,400
through Governor Jia's leadership.

690
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,960
My role was merely auxiliary.

691
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,190
I dare not take the credit.

692
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,150
Lu Chang.

693
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:08,950
Not bad.

694
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,320
Thank you, Mr. Lu,

695
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,510
for securing Su Tangli

696
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,590
a chance of survival.

697
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,590
You're welcome, Your Highness.

698
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,060
Though it was your request,

699
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,240
it aligned

700
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,790
with both law and reason.

701
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,070
I should

702
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,270
speak out for justice.

703
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,390
Recently,

704
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,830
I reviewed the files of the Supreme Court

705
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,000
and found Su Changhua's case

706
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,440
is riddled with inconsistencies.

707
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,910
Su Tangli,

708
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,590
as his sole descendant

709
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,880
and a key witness,

710
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,590
must be

711
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,630
safeguarded.

712
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,950
I'm tired.

713
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,080
Huai An.

714
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,220
(Mingli Hall)

715
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,320
Your Highness, don't trouble yourself

716
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,510
over the academy case.

717
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,590
I've cooked tremella soup for you.

718
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,840
Marquis Yongqing

719
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,480
has long

720
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,550
supported me in Court.

721
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,230
Now his legitimate heir

722
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,480
has been detained awaiting trial.

723
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,680
What do you

724
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,110
suggest I do?

725
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,550
Since Your Highness seeks my counsel,

726
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,840
I shall speak candidly.

727
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,320
Marquis Yongqing supports Your Highness.

728
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,110
Failing to plead mercy for him

729
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,550
may chill loyal hearts.

730
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,960
Yet intervening

731
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,150
despite irrefutable evidence

732
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,070
will undermine the law.

733
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,190
My grandfather used to say

734
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,670
that law is the cornerstone of the state,

735
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,880
the measure of the times.

736
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,110
Sacrificing this measure for a man's sake,

737
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,320
though you gain him,

738
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,320
you risk losing the realm.

739
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,800
Do you mean I should

740
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,000
abandon Marquis Yongqing's clan?

741
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,110
What Xie Xi has done

742
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,630
will inevitably implicate them,

743
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,710
even jeopardizing the Marquis's position.

744
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,320
I'm not suggesting you to abandon them.

745
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,000
You can vigorously reassure the Marquis

746
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,190
while cultivating other talents in his family

747
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,110
to prevent him from allying

748
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,070
with Prince Yu in resentment.

749
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,720
This approach

750
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,150
upholds the law

751
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,960
while placating the Xie Family.

752
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,840
Shujun,

753
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,230
you're truly a capable assistant to me.

754
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,280
I'm flattered, Your Highness.

755
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,710
I shall

756
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,440
maintain close ties with the Xie Family

757
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,840
so that they'll know

758
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,920
you still hold them in your thoughts.

759
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,480
Thank you

760
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,880
for your discretion.

761
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,110
That's what I should do.

762
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,840
I shall take my leave now.

763
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,110
Remember eating the soup.

764
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,950
Why don't you...

765
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,070
Anything else?

766
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,630
Get some rest early.

767
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,920
It seems

768
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,880
she cares about me after all.

769
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,350
Mingshu.

770
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,600
Qingzhao.

771
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,000
The case is solved,

772
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,630
yet you still brood.

773
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,030
Is something troubling you?

774
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
You noticed it?

775
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,880
You and your brother grew up together,

776
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,320
sharing every moment for over a decade.

777
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,280
Now someone suddenly

778
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,480
claims his care.

779
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,440
It's only natural to feel unsettled.

780
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,710
With Lady Su's tragic past,

781
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,150
my jealousy

782
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,670
seems petty and ridiculous.

783
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,150
Would you mock me?

784
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,070
You're so reasonable.

785
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,630
I can't admire you enough.

786
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,320
How could I mock you?

787
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,640
Qingzhao,

788
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,480
I always thought of you

789
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,670
as attentive

790
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,920
and approachable,

791
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,670
a friend worth keeping.

792
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,430
Now,

793
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,030
I realize

794
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,480
you're also a rare confidant.

795
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,800
Whenever I have worries,

796
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,320
merely sharing them with you

797
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,320
lifts the weight instantly.

798
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,440
Then from now on,

799
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,880
whether you have worries

800
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,960
or joys,

801
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,400
you can tell me about them.

802
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,710
I'd like to

803
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,070
share your worries

804
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,640
and rejoice

805
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,510
in your joys.

806
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,640
Officers!

807
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,510
I have something to ask Zhang Song.

808
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,510
Would you grant me a moment?

809
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,640
Make it quick.

810
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,030
Zhang Song,

811
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,500
with the imperial exam approaching,

812
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,880
you'd be buried in studies.

813
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,550
How'd you find time for trivial matters?

814
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,800
How did you know

815
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,840
the plaque of Mingli Hall was damaged?

816
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,550
I overheard it by chance.

817
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:06,990
From who?

818
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,390
I forgot.

819
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,670
If Lu Wencai tormented you so,

820
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,590
why didn't you tell the headmaster?

821
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,070
At the worst, you could leave the academy.

822
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,800
Why did you

823
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
resort to such extremes?

824
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,760
Are we leaving or not?

825
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,000
Are you so eager to rot in jail?

826
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,990
Move.

827
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,630
Do you suspect something?

828
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,800
Zhang Song hasn't been here long,

829
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,920
and I'm not familiar with him.

830
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,510
But I heard Yang Zishu bullied him too.

831
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,920
While he bore no such hatred

832
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,150
for Yang Zishu,

833
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,070
he even

834
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,280
risked his own future

835
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,400
to destroy Lu Wencai.

836
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Why?

837
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,800
Guard, guard!

838
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,110
Something's wrong! Come over here!

839
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,960
No, the prisoner's poisoned himself!

840
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,320
If you are aware,

841
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,360
I have

842
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,710
nothing else to say.

843
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,920
Is that figurine

844
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,190
you were playing with

845
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,590
from your childhood?

846
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,000
Everyone knows Lu Wencai's gambling,

847
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,710
whoring, and bullying of the innocent!

848
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,920
My sister was...

849
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,840
Mingshu.

850
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,550
Zhang Song poisoned himself in prison.

851
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,590
He might be the brother

852
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,720
Lady Yuanying has been looking for.

853
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,840
I'll find her.

854
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,320
You go and find Lu Wencai's servant boy.

855
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,330
There's something I must verify.

856
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,070
The poison has reached his vital organs.

857
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,320
I'm barely

858
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,630
keeping him alive.

859
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,510
Speak quickly if you must.

860
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,360
Wenyuan.

861
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,920
Wenyuan.

862
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,200
My sister.

863
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,800
