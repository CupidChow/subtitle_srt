(Huaixiu Pavilion)
Noble Eunuch, since you rarely

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,400
leave the palace, perhaps you'd
enjoy strolling through our garden.

30
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,310
After my daughter marries
into the royal household,

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,400
I hope you'll continue
to show her favor.

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,510
I've come under Her Highness's orders

33
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,120
to discuss the betrothal gifts.

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,230
Since matters are settled,

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,480
I shall return to report.

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,590
Third Madam,

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,950
where are you all heading?

38
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,950
Noble Eunuch.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,150
Mr. Yin, Madam Yin.

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,590
Liangjun purchased some western flowers
from foreign merchants.

41
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,280
If you're interested,

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,030
join us for viewing.

43
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,240
Western flowers?

44
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,710
Even after years in the palace,

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,150
I've seldom seen such wonders.

46
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,080
Then let's go together.

47
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,430
They're inside.

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,920
After you.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,680
This... This is...

50
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,710
Shujun.

51
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,680
This is Shujun and...

52
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,710
Mr. Lu.

53
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,120
Censor Yin,

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,150
how do you explain this?

55
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,190
Noble Eunuch, there must be

56
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,910
some misunderstanding.

57
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,910
Wake them up immediately!

58
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,630
Father, Mother.

59
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,240
Why this commotion?

60
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,150
Shujun?

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,190
So who's on that couch?

62
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,590
I'm Lu Mingshu. Greetings, everyone.

63
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,680
Lady Mingshu?

64
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
How is it you?

65
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,680
You...

66
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,000
Why are you wearing Shujun's clothes?

67
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,030
It's...

68
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,870
I shall explain in detail.

69
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,150
Today's events

70
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,630
were my plan

71
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,750
to clear Lady Shujun's name.

72
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,800
Get up. They've left.

73
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,640
Hurry up!

74
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,310
Who dares

75
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,430
to frame our Yin Family's
eldest legitimate daughter?

76
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,000
The very person

77
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,870
who lured everyone into the greenhouse.

78
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,080
Liangjun,

79
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,310
was it truly you?

80
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,230
I'm innocent!

81
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,190
I invited everyone to view flowers,

82
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,240
but I never plotted against Shujun!

83
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,820
When Lady Mingshu fell
into the water last time,

84
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,630
you all condemned me.

85
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,940
Yet Liangjun visited
Third Uncle's courtyard

86
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,480
the previous day.

87
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,920
Lady Liangjun must have stolen

88
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,870
the tung oil on impulse,

89
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,830
spilled it

90
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,390
before I got on the bridge,

91
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,560
and then hidden the barrel

92
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,240
in Lady Shujun's chamber.

93
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,120
While spilling the oil,

94
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,750
you stained your shoes.

95
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,870
But cleverly,

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,560
she waited until the marriage alliance
seemed secure

97
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,390
before sending them to the laundry.

98
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,830
Nonsense!

99
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,160
I buried those shoes that day.

100
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,070
Why are they in the laundry?

101
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,480
So you admit it.

102
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,680
Liangjun,

103
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,630
how could you cause Shujun
such suffering?

104
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,920
Why did you do this to her?

105
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,720
Since the death of my parents,

106
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,720
you've raised me with great care.

107
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,950
For that, I'm grateful.

108
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,800
But I'm no less capable than her,

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,870
and merely disadvantaged
by lacking parental advocates.

110
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,750
So you framed me

111
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,240
and made everyone

112
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,830
believe that Mr. Lu and I were involved?

113
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,510
Isn't that the truth?

114
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,560
Don't you deny it!

115
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,430
This was merely a bait

116
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,070
to flush you out.

117
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,520
Censor Yin,

118
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,200
Noble Eunuch.

119
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,160
I was indeed lured into the greenhouse

120
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,390
and drugged.

121
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,480
Fortunately, we were prepared.

122
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,160
If doubtful,

123
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,510
you can summon a physician
to examine the scene.

124
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,030
Summon!

125
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,640
Master,

126
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,310
the greenhouse indeed contains
substances causing dizziness.

127
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,230
Liangjun,

128
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,630
what else do you have to say?

129
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,560
I know nothing

130
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,190
of what the physician describes.

131
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,360
I didn't do this!

132
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,600
It's all come to this.

133
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,950
Still denying at this stage?

134
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,110
I...

135
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,070
Master, Madam.

136
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,120
By Lady Mingshu's instruction,

137
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,680
we found this brocade box
in Lady Xianjun's chamber.

138
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,720
Its contents

139
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,040
require medical verification.

140
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,070
The box's contents match perfectly.

141
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,190
Xianjun,

142
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,070
it's you?

143
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,910
This is planting.

144
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,920
Someone must have placed it in my room.

145
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,800
Perhaps

146
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,360
someone is redirecting suspicion.

147
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,560
You!

148
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,880
Liangjun,

149
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,510
how vicious.

150
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,480
- Third Madam, calm down.
- I...

151
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,760
These items

152
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,920
were indeed placed by Xianjun.

153
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,680
The brocade box was her fatal oversight.

154
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,070
When you found me at that time,

155
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,040
you were wanting an ally, right?

156
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,600
But speaking of which,

157
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,680
there is one task.

158
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,390
I just don't know

159
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,920
if it suits your taste.

160
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,240
But your cleverness
proved your downfall.

161
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,240
You intentionally let me

162
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,630
see Liangjun's shoes at the laundry.

163
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,360
They belong to Lady Liangjun.

164
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,750
They got stained recently.

165
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,040
Just brought them for washing.

166
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,870
She delivered them herself?

167
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,150
No,

168
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,750
a cleaning maid from her courtyard.

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,770
Had Liangjun stained her shoes
with tung oil,

170
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,480
she'd have destroyed them immediately.

171
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,000
Yet you'd long bribed her maid.

172
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,790
Unfortunately, Lady Liangjun

173
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,440
focused solely on overthrowing Shujun.

174
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,750
She didn't notice you at all.

175
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,000
She secretly took the tung oil.

176
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,030
I think Shujun has a good mental state.

177
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,840
She stayed in the greenhouse all day,

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,480
even moving her daybed there.

179
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,320
Who accompanied her?

180
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,120
Naturally, the Lu siblings.

181
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,750
Well done, Yin Xianjun.

182
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,080
You were the master schemer!

183
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,200
These are merely

184
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,750
Lady Mingshu's conjectures.

185
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,630
I've done nothing.

186
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,790
I refuse this condemnation.

187
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,350
Censor Yin.

188
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,960
Qiutong?

189
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,390
Third Madam,

190
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,750
this maid comes
from your natal family, right?

191
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,280
That's right.

192
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,200
She's my sister-in-law's maid, Qiutong.

193
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,390
But how does this

194
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,630
relate to my family?

195
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,030
This traces to rumors

196
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,600
about Lady Shujun.

197
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,840
How did household secrets

198
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,670
become capital gossip?

199
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,870
That was her.

200
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,960
She paid storytellers handsomely.

201
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,510
You know

202
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,270
the subsequent events.

203
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,080
Qiutong,

204
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,390
why did you do this?

205
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,140
Master acted for you
and your daughter's benefit.

206
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,200
But why would Brother bypass me?

207
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,440
I acted alone.

208
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,870
My simple-minded mother knew nothing.

209
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,550
Please spare her!

210
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,710
Xianjun...

211
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,240
So the rumors

212
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,600
of Shujun torturing animals

213
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,320
were also yours?

214
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
I merely exploited

215
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,080
that long-dead kitten,

216
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,480
letting people blame her.

217
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,720
Yet she never defended herself.

218
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,080
And you all,

219
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,270
concerned with face,

220
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,840
suppressed truth.

221
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,120
If you call me

222
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,870
the chief conspirator,

223
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,630
then you're all accomplices!

224
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,630
I'm deeply disappointed

225
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,840
in you.

226
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,350
Disappointed?

227
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,440
Did you ever have expectations?

228
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,110
She...

229
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,120
She was born as the Yin Family's
eldest legitimate daughter

230
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,240
and coddled with glory since infancy.

231
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,150
Though orphaned early,

232
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,440
she postures as a family benefactor

233
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,480
under your care,

234
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,120
enjoying every privilege.

235
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,240
And me?

236
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,840
I merely sought better prospects

237
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,150
to let Mother hold her head high
in front of others.

238
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,550
Was that wrong?

239
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,040
Xianjun,

240
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,320
stop it.

241
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,620
(Grand Tutor Yin)

242
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,320
Let me speak.

243
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,350
Father.

244
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,120
Father, weren't you
convalescing elsewhere?

245
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,270
Had I not come,

246
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,080
our century-old family honor

247
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,140
would have been ruined

248
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,120
by unworthy descendants.

249
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,360
Noble Eunuch,

250
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,200
apologies for the mess.

251
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
With the truth revealed,

252
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,000
subsequent matters are family affairs.

253
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,480
I shall return to report.

254
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,510
Rest assured,

255
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,120
today's events

256
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,270
will remain sealed.

257
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,240
Then thank you, Noble Eunuch.

258
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,440
Thank you, Noble Eunuch.

259
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,150
Now truth prevails,

260
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,960
we shall take our leave.

261
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,820
(Yin Residence)

262
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,000
For years,

263
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,000
I've received Uncle and Auntie's care,

264
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,360
yet nursed orphan's resentment,

265
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,720
envying Shujun.

266
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,270
I acknowledge wrongdoing.

267
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,720
Punish me, Grandpa.

268
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,750
Liangjun,

269
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,670
repentance comes easily.

270
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,480
I hope for genuine reform.

271
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,600
I think our strict upbringing

272
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,630
should have nurtured kind hearts.

273
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,320
Yet marriage prospects

274
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,840
bred discord,

275
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,670
leading to fratricidal schemes.

276
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,840
Now things have been exposed.

277
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,320
Do you truly repent?

278
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,870
Xianjun.

279
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,870
Grandpa,

280
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,510
since then,

281
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,510
let me speak plainly.

282
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,750
You still resist remorse?

283
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,840
Let her.

284
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,230
Over the years,

285
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,000
I've lived in obscurity.

286
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,080
I wanted to be seen,

287
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,320
cherished,

288
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,600
and adored by you.

289
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,240
One step more,

290
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,030
I'd have been
the sole marriage candidate,

291
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,720
making you all

292
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,600
acknowledge me.

293
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,080
Where's the error?

294
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,120
Ambition isn't wrong.

295
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,390
But you erred in framing siblings,

296
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,320
conflating status with worth,

297
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,080
and confusing ambition

298
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,150
with responsibility.

299
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,750
The consort position brings glory

300
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,670
but turbulent politics.

301
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,360
Your father lacks rank.

302
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,200
Even as a royal bride,

303
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,030
you'd face both imperial harem troubles

304
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,910
and court intrigues.

305
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,910
Even the eldest legitimate daughter

306
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,030
faces unavoidable difficulties.

307
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,150
But she might withstand open attacks.

308
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,440
The marriage alliance

309
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,000
serves court reform.

310
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,920
Xianjun,

311
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,360
perhaps you resent me.

312
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,670
But your Auntie

313
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,240
and I

314
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,960
always praised your grace

315
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,550
and talent externally.

316
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,670
We tried

317
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,240
to seek

318
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,000
worthy matches

319
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,270
for you all.

320
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,750
We never intended casual marriages.

321
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,630
And for Liangjun too.

322
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,120
Family shares

323
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,720
glory and shame.

324
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,240
You should strengthen

325
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,200
and help each other,

326
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,240
not wound.

327
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,670
We were wrong.

328
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,080
Please punish us
by family rules, Grandpa.

329
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,960
Father, Mr. Yin, Madam Yin.

330
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,480
The mother's fault in failed teaching.

331
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,320
I'll bear Xianjun's punishment.

332
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,160
Xianjun,

333
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,160
what do you think?

334
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,600
I'll take responsibility.

335
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,240
How can Mother suffer for me?

336
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,440
The state has laws,
and the family has rules.

337
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,150
For framing Shujun

338
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,670
and violating precepts,

339
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,270
you should enter the ancestral hall

340
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,240
by rules...

341
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,510
Grandpa, please show mercy.

342
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,000
I also failed

343
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,030
to perceive the situation
or consider sisters' feelings

344
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,480
about the marriage alliance.

345
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,670
With mistakes in handling,

346
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,910
I beg leniency for them.

347
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,480
Shujun.

348
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,470
Shujun...

349
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,750
Since Shujun intercedes,

350
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,550
we'll mitigate.

351
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,630
Xianjun, Liangjun.

352
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,320
Reflect in the ancestral hall
for one year.

353
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
As for you,

354
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,080
you failed to educate

355
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,240
as a mother.

356
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,670
Kneel there daily

357
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,270
for two hours.

358
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,750
Submit or not?

359
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,630
Thank you for mercy, Father.

360
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,670
Thank you for mercy, Grandpa.

361
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,200
Thank you, Grandpa.

362
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,000
Grand Tutor, will you stay
or return to retreat?

363
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,880
Naturally, the retreat.

364
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,680
Don't forget. My "illness" continues.

365
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,000
Grand Tutor Yin,

366
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,310
my respects.

367
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,310
Lady Mingshu,

368
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,240
thanks to you this time.

369
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,200
We owe
our daughter's vindication to you.

370
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,830
You flatter, Madam.

371
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,270
Lady Shujun's

372
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,110
inherent goodness

373
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,880
made success possible.

374
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,550
Did you think to deceive heaven?

375
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,000
Fortunately, Prince Rui mediated

376
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,270
and prevented the palace inquiry.

377
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,000
Mother,

378
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,110
I...

379
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,110
You risked altering marriage proposals

380
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,750
to reject the marriage alliance.

381
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,440
Have you found a lover?

382
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,000
I erred in trusting before,

383
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,400
but that's past.

384
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,920
My delayed clarification

385
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,720
caused turmoil,

386
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,440
worried Grandpa and shamed the family.

387
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,790
I repent.

388
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,190
Father,

389
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,720
I'm sorry.

390
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,880
The fault isn't yours alone.

391
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,830
I prioritized

392
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,320
family face

393
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,400
over your happiness

394
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
and never asked for your wishes.

395
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,430
Afterwards,

396
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,240
I made you suffer so much.

397
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,070
I failed too.

398
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,240
Father...

399
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,150
Husband,

400
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,440
our willfulness

401
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,550
and lack of respect

402
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,440
nearly caused disaster.

403
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,000
After all this,

404
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,310
if alternatives exist,

405
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
please

406
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,680
reconsider

407
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,200
the marriage alliance.

408
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,040
Wife,

409
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,400
our alliance with Prince Rui

410
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,110
was decided by Father and I

411
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,720
to support reform.

412
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,000
But building on children's misery

413
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,400
can only create

414
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,960
unstable foundations.

415
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,480
Shujun,

416
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,920
if you're unwilling,

417
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,960
I'll renegotiate with Father.

418
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,170
I accept the marriage alliance
with Prince Rui.

419
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Lady Shujun,

420
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,440
what changed your mind?

421
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,200
Today's events

422
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,720
awakened me.

423
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,480
My privileged life

424
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,270
with unlimited food and clothing
since childhood

425
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,310
didn't emerge from the air,

426
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,240
but our family's court struggles.

427
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,270
As a child of the Yin Family,

428
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,240
how can I be selfish?

429
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,030
But without affection for Prince Rui...

430
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,960
I knew nothing of him before,

431
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,400
not to mention care.

432
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,920
But this time,

433
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,160
he maintained the marriage alliance

434
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,350
despite scandals.

435
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,790
Such resolve

436
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,200
dissolves slander.

437
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,440
Thus I accept it

438
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,310
not just out of gratitude,

439
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,200
but believing he is broad-minded

440
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,880
and responsible.

441
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,070
If so,

442
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,070
the Yin Family's fate

443
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,440
will be bound to Prince Rui's.

444
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,590
You...

445
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,960
Can you face this?

446
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,720
Our century-old house

447
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,030
relies on our ancestors'

448
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,000
political wisdom.

449
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,720
I trust Father

450
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,550
and Grandpa's choice.

451
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,800
Well said.

452
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,720
Such daughters

453
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,110
bring family honor.

454
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,000
Then

455
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,520
the marriage alliance

456
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,510
stands.

457
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,880
You want to overturn Su Changhua's case?

458
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,000
My mentor studied under you.

459
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,920
Could you please

460
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,990
give me any clues about his case?

461
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,440
Do you know

462
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,920
the cost of reversal?

463
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,480
I'm resolved

464
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,000
and fearless of death.

465
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,270
It's like you

466
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,590
binding the Yin Family

467
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,440
to Prince Rui

468
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,440
despite risks.

469
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,440
I admire this.

470
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,750
The court opposes reform.

471
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,110
I'm not without self-interest

472
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,350
for my family.

473
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,240
But with youth like you,

474
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,400
governance has successors.

475
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,240
Regarding Su Changhua's case,

476
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,720
I know little.

477
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,000
Before suicide, he wrote a confession,

478
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,640
and it was corroborated

479
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,000
by his aide Liu Xiankun.

480
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,720
No doubts remained.

481
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,480
But this must be framed.

482
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,030
Later, Liu Xiankun was executed.

483
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,440
There are no witnesses.

484
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,550
Any leads on Liu's backers?

485
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,720
How could it be so easy?

486
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,510
If you want,

487
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,200
start with his associates.

488
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,550
Thanks for your guidance, Grand Tutor.

489
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,720
It seems

490
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,310
my convalescence ends.

491
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,350
Storms approach

492
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,070
regardless.

493
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,830
(I've witnessed)

494
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,590
(impoverished girls' struggles,)

495
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,880
(merchant daughters')

496
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,200
(ruined fortunes overnight,)

497
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,070
(and even)

498
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,720
(noblewomen's)

499
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,640
(silent sufferings.)

500
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,240
(How can women)

501
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,830
(escape courtyard walls,)

502
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,510
(shed societal chains,)

503
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,590
(and seek true selves?)

504
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,400
How's it going? Any news?

505
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,310
Grand Tutor suggested

506
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,240
investigating people around
my mentor's aide,

507
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,550
Liu Xiankun.

508
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,030
Liu Xiankun?

509
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,240
No problem. I'll handle it.

510
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,920
Besides, help me check

511
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,270
Yin Xianjun's maternal uncle.

512
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,510
Home at last!

513
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,350
No place compares to our home.

514
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,750
Zaozao, is that right?

515
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,510
You've grown so.

516
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,640
Miss me?

517
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,110
Eating my share?

518
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,280
Buddy,

519
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,480
Mother said you tidied my room.

520
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,800
It's nothing,

521
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,110
just idle hands.

522
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,270
See this calligraphy?

523
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,110
(Unpolished Jade, Pure Gold)
The vigorous strokes

524
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,070
enhance the ambiance here.

525
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,540
(Unpolished Jade, Pure Gold.
By Lu Chang.)

526
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,080
Is there a problem?

527
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,040
No,

528
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,110
I like it.

529
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,680
Then why that expression?

530
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,920
Since losing my memory,

531
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,110
despite your care by my side,

532
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,920
I feel unsteady in my heart.

533
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,680
I'm always thinking

534
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,750
about what I used to look like.

535
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,960
Making jewelry,

536
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,070
playing the Qin...

537
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,030
What else could it be?

538
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,240
Did I forget

539
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,830
important people or matters?

540
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,160
Every time I think about it,

541
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,350
I'll feel uneasy.

542
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,350
I'm sorry, Mingshu.

543
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,590
I was being careless

544
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,700
and overlooked your feelings.

545
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,550
No.

546
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,590
The love you and Mother gave me

547
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,640
anchors my heart

548
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,160
again and again.

549
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,240
Look at that Yin Family,
they have wealth.

550
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,510
But each lady suffers.

551
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,350
I have a loving Mother

552
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,880
and a supportive Buddy.

553
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,160
What if

554
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,160
I forgot the past?

555
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,240
I'm the happiest person in the world.

556
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,240
Past or present,

557
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,480
I'm who I am.

558
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,070
I'm Lu Mingshu,

559
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,480
Mother's daughter

560
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,720
and Buddy's sister.

561
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,680
My name and my family

562
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,880
are my greatest confidence

563
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,480
and pride in this lifetime.

564
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,110
Mingshu,

565
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,720
no matter what you want
to do in the future,

566
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,400
or what kind of person
you want to become,

567
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,720
I'll always support you.

568
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,680
I'll do everything possible

569
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,680
to keep you safe and happy
throughout your life.

570
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Then let me tell you too.

571
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,350
Regardless of whether you are
rising meteorically or facing adversity,

572
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,830
I'll always be with you

573
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,920
and give you strength.

574
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,590
Are you saying

575
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,550
I'm playing the field,
fishing for benefits,

576
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,400
and trying to profit
from those scholars' gratitude?

577
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,070
You actually think of me this way?

578
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
It seems

579
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,160
I had poor judgment before.

580
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,510
Poor judgment?

581
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,480
Then you need nourishment.

582
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,240
Master, this should be the place.

583
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,270
Can you see the path?

584
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,310
And you say that's it.

585
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,880
It's right here.

586
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
How do I look today?

587
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,680
Anyone unaware

588
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,040
might think the Lu Family's son-in-law
has come to visit.

589
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,560
Stop talking nonsense.

590
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:45,870
Knock on the door.

591
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,920
Is Mr. Lu at home?

592
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,190
Mr. Lu!

593
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,750
It's Mr. Song.

594
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,760
Mr. Lu!

595
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,680
(Zaozao is still maintaining composure.)

596
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,200
Greetings, Madam. I'm Song Qingzhao.

597
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,110
Since you're Chang's good friend,

598
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,400
feel free to visit more often
in the future.

599
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,910
These gifts...

600
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,270
Mr. Song, you've been too generous.

601
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,830
These are proper courtesies
from a junior.

602
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,150
Moreover,

603
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,510
Mr. Lu and Lady Mingshu

604
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,680
helped me uncover the truth
behind the Yin Family rumors,

605
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,680
which allowed me
to fulfill my duty to Prince Rui.

606
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,640
I should show gratitude.

607
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,960
You're too modest, Song.

608
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,830
Without your assistance,

609
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,270
things wouldn't be going so well.

610
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,270
Since it's mealtime now,

611
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,240
if you don't mind,

612
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,750
please stay for dinner.

613
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,680
Mother's cooking is excellent.

614
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,000
Then I'll gratefully
accept the invitation.

615
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,280
Mr. Song,

616
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,880
here. Try this sweet and sour fish.

617
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,350
And this.

618
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,020
It's my mother's speciality,
goji berry porridge.

619
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,820
It's fragrant and sweet.

620
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,750
Buddy and I love it the most.

621
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,750
Mr. Song, please try the flavor.

622
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,720
Thank you, Lady Mingshu.

623
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,110
How's it going?

624
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,520
It's indeed sweet.

625
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,760
Mother.

626
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,270
Mr. Song,

627
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,240
you must rarely eat

628
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,640
such simple meals ordinarily.

629
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,440
Today counts as descending
to experience mortal life.

630
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,280
How could that be?

631
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,240
Mingshu, you're being so formal
with Mr. Song.

632
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,130
Aren't you afraid
of making him uncomfortable?

633
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,270
Mr. Song, we're close friends.

634
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,550
Feel completely at home here.
Don't stand on ceremony.

635
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,070
When was I being formal?

636
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,480
I just wanted him to experience

637
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,720
Mother's excellent cooking.

638
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,790
Besides, in the Yin Family,

639
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,350
Mr. Song taught me how to play the Qin.

640
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,720
Proper hospitality is only right.

641
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,910
Yes.

642
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,240
This bowl with extra goji berries

643
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,320
is more nutritious.

644
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,200
Lady Mingshu,

645
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,790
besides these dishes, what else

646
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,110
do you usually enjoy eating?

647
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,630
I...

648
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,630
She?

649
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,070
She'll eat anything that flies,

650
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,310
runs, or swims.

651
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,510
How can you say I'm so gluttonous? I...

652
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,680
Chang,

653
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,270
how can you describe
your sister like that?

654
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,480
Exactly.

655
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,680
Mr. Song,

656
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,070
these two siblings are used
to roughhousing.

657
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,510
Please forgive them.

658
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,160
Not at all. As an only child,

659
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,240
I deeply admire
such sibling camaraderie.

660
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,630
Is that so?

661
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,110
In that case,

662
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:42,960
why not let Mingshu

663
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,000
adopt you as her sworn brother?

664
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,400
She could gain
another protective brother in the future.

665
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,000
I dare not presume

666
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,590
to equal your position.

667
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,770
I can't usurp the elder brother's role.

668
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,750
I wouldn't mind.

669
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,590
I fear I'm unworthy of such honor.

670
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,000
It's just a joke.

671
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,830
Why so serious?

672
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,510
In my opinion, one side is my brother.

673
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,200
The other is my confidant.

674
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,790
Isn't this the best of both worlds?

675
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,680
Mingshu speaks wisely.

676
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,720
Chang,

677
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,880
don't think
of shifting sisterly responsibilities

678
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,160
to Mr. Song.

679
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,550
Exactly.

680
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,040
Yes.

681
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
With me here,

682
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,380
how could others take over caretaking?

683
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,670
Stop staring.

684
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,800
Mother.

685
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,560
Here.

686
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,310
Have some pork liver soup.

687
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,680
Pork liver soup?

688
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,640
Mingshu said your eyesight's poor

689
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,290
and you needed nourishment.

690
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,100
So she specially asked me
to brew this for you

691
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,910
and claimed it nourishes the liver
and improves vision.

692
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,480
How thoughtful of her.

693
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,680
Mother, do you have something to say?

694
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,400
That Mr. Song fancies Mingshu.

695
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,160
Have you noticed?

696
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,240
They've only met a few times.

697
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,110
Not to that extent yet.

698
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,510
Don't overthink, Mother.

699
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,590
I have been young myself.

700
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,510
How could I not recognize it?

701
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,110
The way Mr. Song looks at Mingshu

702
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,030
clearly shows affection.

703
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,830
I just want to know

704
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,110
your perspective.

705
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,240
With the Song Family's status,

706
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,240
marrying Mingshu

707
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,200
won't be easy.

708
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,160
Are you worried
about Mingshu overreaching?

709
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,670
How come?

710
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,230
Mingshu matches any family.

711
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,670
No overreaching exists.

712
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,110
I only fear such households

713
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,880
might bring future hardships.

714
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,880
After I attain an official position,

715
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,190
Mingshu's marriage

716
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,660
will have stronger backing.

717
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,760
Is this your own thought?

718
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,800
Do you know her mind?

719
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,320
Never mind.

720
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,800
Drink the soup while it's hot.

721
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,190
Rest early.

722
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,320
Lady Shujun,

723
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,590
you honor my humble courtyard

724
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,280
with your presence.

725
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,590
Just casual wandering

726
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,840
to pass the time.

727
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,840
Casual wandering?

728
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,630
Bringing so many gifts?

729
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Then wander here more often.

730
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,150
Actually, I'm merely fulfilling

731
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:17,990
my entrusted duty.

732
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,440
And Madam has rewarded me with silver.

733
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,030
No need for special thanks.

734
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,880
Who said I'm here to thank you?

735
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,960
But earlier,

736
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,800
you kept rehearsing speeches
the whole way.

737
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,160
Silence.

738
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,760
Fine.

739
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,960
Let me be honest.

740
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,760
I did come to thank you

741
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,190
for standing by me

742
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,280
unwaveringly

743
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,070
when everyone else doubted

744
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,550
and helping clear my name.

745
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,760
I beg your forgiveness

746
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,110
for my past rudeness.

747
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,510
From today onward,

748
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,760
I wish to befriend you.

749
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,440
Would you consent?

750
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,070
How utterly unexpected.

751
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,070
It's a breakthrough.

752
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,710
The noble Yin Family's

753
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,000
eldest legitimate daughter

754
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,760
befriending me,
a Jianglin down-and-out?

755
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,590
I can't believe my ears.

756
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,880
I finally

757
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,480
speak from the heart,

758
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,550
yet you mock me with past words.

759
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
Fine. Since you refuse grace,

760
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,480
let's go separate ways.

761
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,510
Let's go!

762
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,000
If we're friends,

763
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,760
can't I tease you?

764
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,960
You want to open a jewelry store?

765
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,760
Becoming your reading lady

766
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,550
was to obtain silver for it.

767
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,670
Now that I have the funds.

768
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,190
Time to act.

769
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,360
Interesting plan.

770
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,670
But women face hardships in business.

771
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,760
You can't

772
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,150
establish footing alone.

773
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,640
What?

774
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,550
Lady Shujun wants to join?

775
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,110
I'm the Yin Family's prized daughter.

776
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,880
How can I partner with you?

777
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,440
But contributing

778
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,160
isn't hard.

779
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,510
Then thank you, Lady Yin.

780
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,590
Your fashion sense shows promise.

781
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,000
But you needn't be limited

782
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,710
to hair ornaments.

783
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,000
That's a great idea.

784
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,840
Since you have a vision,

785
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,550
could you also handle

786
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,550
the decoration layout?

787
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,480
Already exploiting me,

788
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,760
Lady Lu?

789
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,030
I've discovered.

790
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,360
Since Liu Xiankun's son disappeared,

791
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,320
no trace was found.

792
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,640
But his adopted daughter, Liu Yuanying,
failed to escape.

793
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,290
Later, she entered
the Imperial Music Office.

794
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,030
Now she is their star dancer.

795
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,880
As a top dancer,

796
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,550
she should be summoned
by nobility often.

797
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,880
I was about to tell you.

798
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,280
She's been invited
to Minister of Works Lu's home

799
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,070
for an inheritance banquet.

800
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,440
Lu Family.

801
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,260
(Lu Residence)

802
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,420
(Liu Yuanying)

803
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,960
Who could imagine

804
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,240
(Lu Wencai)
Liu Yuanying with so many wooers

805
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,150
in the capital

806
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,230
becoming mine?

807
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,000
Remember your promise.

808
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,710
Rest assured, as long as you serve well,

809
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,840
you'll get anything.

810
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,920
Return quickly.

811
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,510
Your wife awaits.

812
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,840
Why mention that shrew?

813
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,630
Not just her,

814
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,110
even my other concubines

815
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,360
can't compare to your slippers.

816
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,200
Enough.

817
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,960
Dawn approaches.

818
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,590
You must leave before others wake.

819
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,760
Caution required.

820
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,340
(Shiya Residence)

821
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
(Yerong)
(So that's the trick.)

822
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,670
Jiangnan...

823
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,630
WangJiangnan.

824
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,110
This sounds like a restaurant.

825
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,000
Baihuachun.

826
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,360
That sounds even stranger.

827
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,880
What's it called...?

828
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,320
What's it called?

829
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,760
Still awake?

830
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,480
Buddy, I was thinking
about the name of the store.

831
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,150
It must avoid vulgarity,

832
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,590
yet not too aloof. So difficult.

833
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,710
A good name

834
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,920
brings fortune.

835
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,760
Let me help.

836
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,400
Buddy, you're always the kindest.

837
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,710
You're a girl after all.

838
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,480
Remember men and women
shouldn't mingle after seven.

839
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,000
In the future,

840
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,440
maintain propriety

841
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,590
with all males, even me.

842
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:27,480
Siblings should relax naturally.

843
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,590
You're always so rigid.

844
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,110
For elegant yet clear names,

845
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,550
consider

846
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,630
"I've heard of white ganoderma,
which resembles jade flowers."

847
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,840
It shows elegance and grace.

848
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,440
Langhua, the white ganoderma,
has the meaning of jade flowers,

849
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,000
implying jewelry craft.

850
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,590
Let's name it...

851
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,960
- Hualang Pavilion!
- Hualang Pavilion!

852
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,510
How is it?

853
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,470
Sounds good.

854
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,760
That's it.

855
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
