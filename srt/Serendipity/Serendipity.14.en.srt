00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,040
Tang Sheng.

29
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,480
I'm Mingshu, I'm new here.

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,430
Let's get acquainted.

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,120
See?

32
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,310
I told you.

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,230
That's just how he is.

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,560
He never mingles with anyone.

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,350
He always wears that face covering,

36
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,790
never shows his real face?

37
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,920
Word is, the poor lad's

38
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,000
had a rough life.

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,590
The Headmaster once said,

40
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,640
his home caught fire when he was young.

41
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,230
He was badly burned,

42
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,070
so he covers his face now.

43
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,310
That's probably why he avoids people.

44
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,710
Can't blame him.

45
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,120
When did he start working here?

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,680
When did he come to the academy?

47
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,800
Let me think...

48
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,710
It was a bit over a year ago.

49
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,590
I can't quite recall the exact day.

50
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,750
You suspect that Tang Sheng?

51
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,870
The County Princess began

52
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,560
suspecting Xie Xi about a year ago.

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,400
And that's when Tang Sheng
came to the academy.

54
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,960
That could be a coincidence.

55
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,030
But Tang Sheng is quite slender.

56
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,030
It's also not impossible

57
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,150
that he's actually a girl.

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,310
Though he works in the rear courtyard,

59
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,310
he rarely shows up elsewhere
in the academy.

60
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,560
I've been here a while,

61
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,800
and I've never seen him.

62
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,710
Then I'll go investigate his background.

63
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,630
I'll stay in the rear courtyard,

64
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,280
try to get closer

65
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,590
and learn more.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,560
If he really is with Xie Xi, he probably

67
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,400
already knows your intentions.

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,680
You'd best be cautious.

69
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,620
(Diligent in Learning Ancient Classics)

70
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,870
Lady Mingshu,

71
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,470
are you alright?

72
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,920
I'm fine.

73
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,880
I just

74
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,990
twisted my ankle.

75
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,590
I got a little scratch.

76
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,910
Do you have any wound medicine?

77
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,280
(It doesn't seem suspicious.)

78
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,750
Thanks a lot.

79
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,710
You're welcome.

80
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,270
Oh right,

81
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,000
Madam said you're fond of reading
and calligraphy.

82
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,280
You're sixteen now,

83
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,710
you must've taken
the boy's exam already?

84
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,390
Didn't the Headmaster

85
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,750
let you try last year's autumn exam?

86
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,830
I'm of low birth,

87
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,720
dare not dream of
leaping the dragon gate.

88
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,070
The Headmaster and Madam just want me

89
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,800
to learn a bit of worldly wisdom.

90
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,600
So that one day

91
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,560
I might get a clerical post
at the academy.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,160
Worldly wisdom, huh...

93
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,190
I heard from my brother

94
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,120
that Xie Xi conducts himself steadily, and is

95
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,360
highly regarded by the Headmaster.

96
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,480
Perhaps you could learn from him.

97
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm of humble status.

98
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,830
I can't trouble Mr. Xie.

99
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,360
You're Mr. Lu's sister.

100
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,160
Is your family originally from Jianglin?

101
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,510
Do you have any relatives there?

102
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,190
Why are you asking this?

103
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,600
Lately,

104
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,750
a friend of mine's looking to
commission some goldwork.

105
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,750
I've heard of the famous
Jian's Gold Shop from Jianglin,

106
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,560
just wondering

107
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,870
if you know anything.

108
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,190
I know of them,

109
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,830
but they got into trouble.

110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,120
I'm not too clear on the details.

111
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,440
Got it.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,870
I've got things to do.

113
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,960
I'll be off.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,120
Take care, Lady Mingshu.

115
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,510
I suddenly brought up Xie Xi

116
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,870
to test his reaction.

117
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,160
He hides emotions very well.

118
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,600
I could hardly see any sign of change.

119
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,950
Instead, he turned

120
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,160
the questions back on me.

121
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,240
What did he ask?

122
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,430
Just things like

123
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,750
my old home in Jianglin,

124
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,750
and the Jian's Gold Shop.

125
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,590
How could I know that?

126
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,190
Tang Sheng?

127
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,790
Anyone here?

128
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,560
My favorite flower

129
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,480
is the crabapple.

130
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,670
I think

131
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,270
it's like me.

132
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,720
When it blooms, it's lively and bright,

133
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,310
like a rosy morning sky.

134
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,140
(Su Tangli.)

135
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,670
Tangli,

136
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,510
we're like brother and sister

137
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,190
since childhood.

138
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,560
Do you really think
I wouldn't recognize you?

139
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,680
Mr. Lu.

140
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,510
Back in Jianglin,
I heard you'd died of illness.

141
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,680
I never believed it.

142
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,830
Once I arrived here,

143
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,000
I asked Ying Xun to investigate

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
the Imperial Music Office
for news of you.

145
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,680
But all I heard was
that you fell seriously ill

146
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,480
and were abandoned at a mass grave.

147
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,240
What a joy

148
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,720
to see you alive.

149
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,600
Master, from beyond the grave,

150
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,950
must surely be comforted.

151
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,390
I never imagined you still kept me
in your heart.

152
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,600
You're Master's only daughter.

153
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,190
How could I not care?

154
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,520
But you,

155
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,360
you recognized me long ago.

156
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,680
Why didn't you reveal yourself sooner?

157
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,480
Why hide from me?

158
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,180
(Mingli Hall)

159
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,740
(Mingli Hall)

160
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,670
Mr. Lu,

161
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,150
I'm someone who's supposed to be dead.

162
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,670
Only by hiding my face
and changing my name

163
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,320
can I barely cling to life.

164
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,840
Now that our fates are so far apart,

165
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,360
if I were to acknowledge you now,

166
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,240
I'd only drag you down with me.

167
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,360
It's enough that I alone

168
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,720
am stuck in the mire.

169
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,360
How could you think that way?

170
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,000
Master's kindness to me was so deep.

171
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,270
I've always seen you as my own sister.

172
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,960
Looking after you is the least I can do.

173
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,390
Mr. Lu,

174
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,670
just surviving in the capital
is no easy feat.

175
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
I can't let you take on more burdens.

176
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,550
Don't worry.

177
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,790
I've found someone I can rely on,

178
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,960
someone who can protect me
for the rest of my life.

179
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,790
You mean Xie Xi?

180
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,440
Back then,

181
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,270
I was tortured
at the Imperial Music Office,

182
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,320
barely alive.

183
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,390
But I wanted to live,

184
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,120
to avenge my father.

185
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,320
So I thought of Xie Xi.

186
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,360
You've known him for a long time?

187
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,150
His maternal grandfather
is also from Jianglin.

188
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,630
Five years ago, when he went there,

189
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,480
he saw me and fell for me.

190
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,200
But at the time,

191
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,390
I didn't give it much thought.

192
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,120
Three years ago,

193
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,150
he got engaged to the county princess.

194
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,390
I assumed he'd long forgotten me.

195
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,270
But I had no other choice,

196
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,080
so I begged him to save my life.

197
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,150
To my surprise, he agreed.

198
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,630
He said he would protect me,

199
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,960
and help me overturn the case.

200
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,720
That's enough for me.

201
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,120
When Master's case wasn't yet settled,

202
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,080
the Xie family kept their hands clean,

203
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,270
watching from the sidelines.

204
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,270
And now, you're the daughter
of a convicted criminal.

205
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,790
How could Xie Xi risk getting involved?

206
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,390
He's the son of Marquis Yongqing,

207
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,720
the future heir, after all.

208
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,750
But the county princess
is already investigating.

209
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,990
Mr. Lu,

210
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,550
I know what I'm doing.

211
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,390
Please don't reveal my identity

212
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,670
to Lady Jian.

213
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,320
I fought hard to escape that place.

214
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,390
Now that Lady Jian is investigating me,

215
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,750
I hope you can stop her.

216
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
Mingshu is only trying to help.

217
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,320
I can't obstruct her.

218
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,390
Besides, Xie Xi is already engaged
to someone else.

219
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,960
You should avoid any impropriety.

220
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,990
How about this—

221
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll help you leave this place,

222
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,510
lay low for a while.

223
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,550
I'll think about it.

224
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,870
Tell me,

225
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,960
did you take Jian Mingshu as your sister

226
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,960
because she holds evidence

227
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
in Father's case?

228
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,600
How did you know she has evidence?

229
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,200
Back when Father was imprisoned,

230
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,240
Jian Jinhai

231
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,150
managed to visit him in jail.

232
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,320
Father told him where the evidence
was hidden.

233
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,480
So we really did misjudge Mr. Jian
back then.

234
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,320
He risked being seen as siding
with Gao Shicai,

235
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,910
just to save Master.

236
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,040
No.

237
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,790
You give yourself too much credit.

238
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,630
In my eyes,

239
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,720
you're nothing more than a petty clown.

240
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,120
You... You...

241
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,680
Enough.

242
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,080
Get out, now.

243
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,360
Did Master leave any other clues?

244
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,590
No.

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,720
After I escaped
the Imperial Music Offices,

246
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,200
I went to the Jian household

247
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,270
to look for Jian Jinhai.

248
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,840
But I found out

249
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,150
his whole family was killed.

250
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:46,260
(Jian Residence)

251
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,620
(Harmony Brings Prosperity)

252
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,390
Why hasn't he left yet?

253
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,550
I know!

254
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,240
We've been steaming in here so long,

255
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,750
we'll suffocate if we hide any longer.

256
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,630
I can hide today,

257
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,240
but not forever.

258
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,200
Let's go.

259
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,000
Have you finished bathing?

260
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,320
I thought I'd have to wait
until midnight.

261
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,030
Didn't Your Highness say

262
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,910
our marriage has nothing to do
with love?

263
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,000
Then why are you in my chambers tonight?

264
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,150
Since we're married,

265
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,630
do you have to ask

266
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,000
why I am here?

267
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,000
Didn't your nurturing nanny

268
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,910
teach you

269
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,390
how to serve your husband?

270
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,360
I see our relationship

271
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,720
as a clean, professional alliance.

272
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,390
I value it greatly.

273
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,270
So there's no need

274
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,630
for ceremonial intimacy.

275
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,840
No need?

276
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,200
But I thought

277
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,440
you were quite eager for this.

278
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,750
You even got the whole estate

279
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,200
stirred up just to bring me here.

280
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,550
Is that true?

281
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,120
I did it to strengthen our partnership.

282
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,550
Please don't misinterpret my intent.

283
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,200
I wouldn't want misplaced affection

284
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,120
to cause unnecessary trouble.

285
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,390
Throwing yourself at me,

286
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,390
yet claiming it's not a ploy
to lure me in?

287
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,320
I... I wasn't!

288
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,750
It doesn't matter.

289
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,150
Since you went through
all the trouble for me,

290
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,960
I certainly won't disappoint you.

291
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,710
No.

292
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,960
I really didn't do it on purpose
just now.

293
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
What are you doing?

294
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,840
Don't come any closer!

295
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,030
I suddenly remembered there's

296
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,150
official business to attend to.

297
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,920
This time,

298
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,910
I'll let you go.

299
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,910
If you are truly interested next time,

300
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,000
why not just tell me directly?

301
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,440
No need for all the methods,

302
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,750
having the entire household drop hints.

303
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,270
I understand.

304
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,000
Thank you for your kindness.

305
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Alright, Madam Lin,

306
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,160
the numbers match

307
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,350
the records now.

308
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,040
Look.

309
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,400
This was all thanks to you.

310
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,750
Tomorrow, I'll deliver the plants
to the academy.

311
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,200
Then this task will be fully complete.

312
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,400
Will that Tang Sheng go as well?

313
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,270
He's responsible for the inventory,

314
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,550
of course he'll go.

315
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,320
Madam,

316
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,550
you've been running around these days.

317
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,440
You must be exhausted.

318
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,110
Let me handle this kind of errand.

319
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,350
Good girl.

320
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,400
You're so thoughtful, and pretty too.

321
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,160
I'll have some pages go with you.

322
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,000
How nice.

323
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,400
Madam He gave me a gem.

324
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,920
You taught me well.

325
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,830
The evidence must be
in Jian Jinhai's hands,

326
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
otherwise he wouldn't have been killed.

327
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,160
Now, Jian Mingshu

328
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,000
is the only survivor of the Jian family.

329
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,720
She must hold some clue

330
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,590
to the whereabouts of the evidence.

331
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,200
Once her memory returns,

332
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,960
I can retrieve it
and clear Father's name.

333
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,960
But she's suffering from amnesia.

334
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,720
She can't be agitated.

335
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,550
The doctor said it must be done slowly.

336
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,920
Besides, I didn't take her as my sister

337
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,350
solely because of the evidence.

338
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,960
I've made up my mind to protect her
for life.

339
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,880
Protect her for life?

340
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,960
How fortunate Lady Jian is.

341
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,760
Don't worry.

342
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,680
I will clear Master's name.

343
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,200
But you must also take care of yourself

344
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,880
and wait for the day justice is done.

345
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,800
Wait?

346
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,480
No.

347
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,110
I'll give everything I have.

348
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,440
From the moment I crawled out of
the mass grave,

349
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,510
I swore an oath—

350
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,720
my life is for this purpose.

351
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
But you can't approach it
through Mingshu.

352
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,590
Promise me.

353
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,880
Didn't expect you, Mr. Lu,

354
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,720
to care so much

355
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,000
for a merchant's daughter.

356
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,430
Don't worry.

357
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,110
I know what to do.

358
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,800
Excuse me, sir.

359
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,310
Madam Lin isn't well on her feet,

360
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,200
so I'm delivering the potted plants.

361
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,590
She's talking to you.

362
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,080
Much appreciated.

363
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,790
Tang Sheng is doing the tallying,

364
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,030
just confirm with him.

365
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,390
Thank you.

366
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,220
(Mingli Hall)

367
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,060
(Mingli Hall)

368
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,800
Watch out!

369
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,520
Brother!

370
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,720
- Sir.
- Are you alright?

371
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,470
- Mingshu?
- I'm fine.

372
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,370
Why are you here?

373
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,280
Brother.

374
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,670
You're not hurt, are you?

375
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,270
I'm not hurt.

376
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,570
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

377
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,480
This wretched academy is cursed for me.

378
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,400
I get unlucky everyday here.

379
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,830
You shouldn't have saved him just now.

380
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,510
"Brother?"

381
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,920
You two are siblings?

382
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,270
So you were both in on it

383
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,400
to trick me before, huh?

384
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,590
You better show some gratitude.

385
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,640
My brother just saved you!

386
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,720
Lu Wencai,

387
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,270
mind your manners in front of my sister.

388
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,310
If I can save you,
I can also destroy you.

389
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,590
You'll regret this!

390
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,000
Let's go.

391
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,350
Check if anyone else is injured.

392
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,590
Tang Sheng, how's your foot?

393
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,920
- Can you get up?
- No need.

394
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,040
Sorry.

395
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,720
Young Master, you're bleeding!

396
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Just a small wound, it's nothing.

397
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,000
Where is it?

398
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,720
You're bleeding,
and you say it's nothing?

399
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,670
Does it hurt?

400
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,720
A little.

401
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,000
You usually

402
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,510
never complain about

403
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,880
small cuts and bruises.

404
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,640
Didn't expect you to admit pain today.

405
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,310
You have finally improved.

406
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,110
Don't talk nonsense.

407
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,630
Speaking of which,

408
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,640
don't you feel

409
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,070
Lady Mingshu has been

410
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,680
much closer to you lately?

411
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,520
So you noticed too?

412
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,720
Qingzhao.

413
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,720
Mingshu.

414
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,760
Quick, come in.

415
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,070
How's your injury?

416
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,320
Does it still hurt?

417
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,430
It has stopped hurting.

418
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,720
Any later

419
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,880
and I might've fully healed.

420
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,110
Not like that, be gentle.

421
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,800
Ow.

422
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,600
Young Master.

423
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,560
Don't be mad.

424
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,830
I'm just a rough-handed man,

425
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,480
I can't do delicate work.

426
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,920
Weren't you good at taking care of others?

427
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,040
Let me do it.

428
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,390
No need.

429
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,110
I'll just have Shishu go easy.

430
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,270
If you leave it to Shishu,

431
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,960
it might get even worse.

432
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,480
- Brother.
- Since Mr. Song

433
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,000
was injured saving Mingshu,

434
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,750
as her brother,

435
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,880
I must thank you properly.

436
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Thank you, Mr. Song.

437
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,360
Mr. Lu, Mr. Lu!

438
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,590
Brother, be more gentle.

439
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,270
You're hurting Qingzhao.

440
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,440
Let me do it instead.

441
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,350
Did I hurt you?

442
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,430
No.

443
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,480
It doesn't hurt.

444
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,000
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

445
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,190
Qingzhao,

446
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,960
you must keep the wound away from water.

447
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,070
Someone as careless as Shishu

448
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,280
probably won't take proper care of you.

449
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,590
I'll come to check on you often lately.

450
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,200
Don't you have things to handle
in the back yard?

451
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,550
I'll take care of Mr. Song instead.

452
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,210
You just focus on your own tasks.

453
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,630
Alright.

454
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,550
Then take good care of him, Brother.

455
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,000
Of course.

456
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,020
(New Dawn)

457
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,830
Tang Sheng, how's your foot?

458
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,720
Can you get up?

459
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,980
No need. Sorry.

460
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,840
Brother.

461
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,880
Still worrying about Song Qingzhao?

462
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,550
You haven't known him long, yet

463
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,720
you already like him this much?

464
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,160
Like?

465
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,110
I'm not even sure what I like about him.

466
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,110
It just feels easy and relaxed
being around him.

467
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,920
I even dreamed about him.

468
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,590
You dreamed of him?

469
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,070
They say dreams come from the heart.

470
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,160
Do you think maybe I like him?

471
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,000
Dreams are vague and fleeting.

472
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,920
How can you be sure it was him?

473
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,000
In that dream, he

474
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,200
was wearing a blue robe,

475
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,790
his posture tall and straight,

476
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,640
and his back...

477
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,400
I'm certain it was him.

478
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,920
Just from a back view in a blue robe,

479
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,200
you're sure it was Song Qingzhao?

480
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,480
Well,

481
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,110
I often wear blue robes too.

482
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,470
Everyone in the academy
wears blue robes.

483
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,640
Yes, you are right,

484
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,200
but it could never be you.

485
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,510
There's no way
I'd have feelings for you.

486
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,790
Anyway, I dreamed of him.

487
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,630
I'm not mistaken.

488
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,070
You're so worked up...

489
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,440
When the plaque fell earlier,

490
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,400
it looked like you were hit.

491
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,800
Are you hurt?

492
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,160
I'm fine.

493
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,350
But

494
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,830
at the time, it was Jian Mingshu

495
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,880
who helped me up.

496
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,240
From the way she looked at me,

497
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,320
I fear

498
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,310
she may have realized I'm a woman.

499
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,160
It's Lu Mingshu.

500
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,880
This place isn't entirely safe.

501
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,750
You should leave as soon as possible.

502
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,400
The two princes

503
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,350
will soon be inspecting the academy.

504
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,000
If I leave now,

505
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,110
it'll only draw more attention.

506
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,720
Better to wait

507
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,790
until after the inspection.

508
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,320
Alright.

509
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,320
Brother!

510
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,800
Brother,

511
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,880
where have you been?

512
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,720
I was looking for you.

513
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,030
I was in the archives just now.

514
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,240
Did you need something?

515
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,720
No, it's nothing.

516
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,400
You were in the archives all this time?

517
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,790
I looked for books

518
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,750
for upcoming policy discussions.

519
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,350
(He was clearly in the back yard,)

520
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,640
(why is he lying to me?)

521
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,550
Go back first and do as I said.

522
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,840
Yes.

523
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,790
(It's a trap.)

524
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,070
(So he deliberately lured me here.)

525
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,800
Help!

526
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,590
Help!

527
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,110
(I definitely can't outrun him.)

528
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,200
(At this point...)

529
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,440
Where did Lu Mingshu go?

530
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,030
She seemed to sense something

531
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,400
and didn't approach the trap.

532
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,680
She keeps watching us so closely.

533
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,920
At this rate, she'll find out
your true identity.

534
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,480
I thought this trap would injure her

535
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,070
to force her out of the academy.

536
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,920
Looks like

537
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,640
we'll need another method.

538
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,670
Yes.

539
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,270
Don't run! Stop!

540
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,550
Help!

541
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,720
Help me!

542
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,110
She came back?

543
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,400
Looks like someone's trying to kill her.

544
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,550
We should help her

545
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,480
or she'll die for sure.

546
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,430
No.

547
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,510
If someone wants her dead,

548
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,200
it has nothing to do with us.

549
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,720
The less involved, the better.

550
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,280
But...

551
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,160
Come on, we need to get out of here.

552
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,960
- Stop.
- Help!

553
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,840
Don't run!

554
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,070
Who are you?

555
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,590
Why are you trying to kill me?

556
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,720
We searched the entire back yard.

557
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,480
Could she have left the academy?

558
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,590
Even if she did,

559
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,550
she likely didn't go far.

560
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,720
Mingshu is never reckless.

561
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,010
Sirs, sirs.

562
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,510
Are you looking for Miss Lu?

563
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,520
Have you seen her?

564
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,830
While I was cleaning the back courtyard,

565
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,070
I saw her heading toward
the back mountain.

566
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,110
The back mountain?

567
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,080
Yes.

568
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,080
Thank you.

569
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,110
- Mingshu!
- Mingshu!

570
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,720
Mingshu!

571
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,550
Mingshu!

572
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,480
Mingshu!

573
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,560
Quick!

574
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,320
This is...

575
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,720
It's Mingshu's shoe.

576
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,240
Watch over him.

577
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,240
I'll go look for Mingshu.

578
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,390
Alright.

579
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,320
Mingshu!

580
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,720
Mingshu!

581
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,840
Mingshu!

582
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,080
Mingshu!

583
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,080
Mingshu!

584
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,040
Wake up!

585
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,520
Mingshu!

586
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,480
Wake up!

Mingshu.

611
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,940
(Heaven Rewards Diligence)
I brought medicine.

612
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,800
Let me take a look.

613
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,920
This is already the deepest wound
I have.

614
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Qingzhao, don't worry,

615
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
I'm really fine. Brother

616
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,510
applied medicine for me yesterday.

617
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,400
Qingzhao, thank you for your concern.

618
00:34:59,070 --> 00:34:59,910
Young Master,

619
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,110
this really is a bit much.

620
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,360
Yesterday, after I handed the assassin
over to Ying Xun,

621
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,670
I came straight to look for you.

622
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,550
Mr. Lu said you had already gone to bed,

623
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,590
so I didn't want to disturb you.

624
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,710
But I was worried all night.

625
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,440
Luckily, you're safe.

626
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,350
It's nothing. Have a seat.

627
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,070
Sit down.

628
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,190
What exactly happened yesterday?

629
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,230
I saw Xie Xi heading alone
toward the back mountain,

630
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,400
so I tried to quietly follow him.

631
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,630
But it was a trap he set for me.

632
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,190
So it was Xie Xi who lured you there?

633
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,110
And even sent assassins?

634
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,000
I didn't expect him to be so ruthless.

635
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,630
I know it sounds like

636
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,840
Xie Xi was trying to harm me,

637
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:39,780
but

638
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,150
I don't think he and the assassin

639
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,320
were working together.

640
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,600
That's right.

641
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,630
If Xie Xi truly wanted to kill you,

642
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,630
he could've done it directly

643
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,670
after luring you to the mountain.

644
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,440
No need for such extra tricks

645
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,920
like a trap.

646
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,920
So you had already thought of that.

647
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,440
Even if Xie Xi didn't want to kill you,

648
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,650
the danger you faced

649
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,760
was still caused by him.

650
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,870
And he stood by, doing nothing to help,

651
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,920
no different from an accomplice.

652
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,430
Also,

653
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,230
if it wasn't Xie Xi
trying to harm Mingshu,

654
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,510
then who else would want to hurt her?

655
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,440
That assassin looked

656
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,960
just like the one

657
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,510
who tried to kill me in Jianglin.

658
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,990
Mr. Song, someone has been

659
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,840
trying to stop me from investigating
my mentor's case.

660
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,960
And Mingshu fell off a cliff before.

661
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,480
That's why I've been watching over her
so closely.

662
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
I see.

663
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,430
Then from now on,

664
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,480
I'll be even more careful too.

665
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,320
Thank you, Mr. Song.

666
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,840
Right now, the academy

667
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,000
isn't truly a safe place for Mingshu.

668
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,880
Pack your things,

669
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,150
I'll take you back.

670
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,880
I don't want to go back.

671
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,760
Leaving may not be the best solution.

672
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,030
At least in the academy,
those villains have some scruples.

673
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,480
If she leaves,

674
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,920
who knows what dangers might await.

675
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,800
Mr. Lu,

676
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,590
maybe it's better to let Mingshu
stay here

677
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,430
so she can be protected.

678
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,160
That's right, Brother.

679
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,280
Going back might not be the safest
after all.

680
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,190
It's better if I stay here.

681
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,320
I promise

682
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,000
I'll be extra cautious.

683
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,480
But we must be clear,

684
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,880
you must be careful

685
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,880
and never leave my sight.

686
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,400
There's one more thing
I forgot to tell you.

687
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,880
I'm certain Tang Sheng is a woman.

688
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,480
Why do you say that?

689
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,110
The other day, I touched her waist.

690
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,070
It's slim and soft,

691
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,630
that's clearly the feel
of a woman's body.

692
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,990
Lu Chang?

693
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,280
That punch was for framing Mingshu,

694
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,550
and for leaving her in danger.

695
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:00,760
You should feel lucky

696
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,440
that she only suffered
superficial injuries.

697
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,190
Or it wouldn't have ended with a punch.

698
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,190
Lu Chang, are you crazy?

699
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,400
You dare assault a fellow student?

700
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,480
Go ahead and report me
to the Headmaster.

701
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,400
There are things

702
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,440
we should make clear

703
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,550
in front of him anyway.

704
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,230
Let go of me!

705
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,840
Remember this!

706
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,480
If you ever harm Mingshu again,

707
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,390
I will pay you back double,

708
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,360
even if it costs me my life.

709
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,710
Alright, alright!

710
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,550
Just let go!

711
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,150
What do you plan

712
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,320
to do about Tangli?

713
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,630
So you already knew.

714
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,000
Answer me.

715
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,000
I'll handle it,

716
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,880
it's none of your concern.

717
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,070
You are trying to keep
a prestigious engagement

718
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,190
while refusing to let go
of Tangli's affections,

719
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,000
trying to take the best of both sides.

720
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,920
You're playing with fire.

721
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,000
Lu Chang, don't go too far.

722
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,960
And I'm telling you,

723
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,550
if you can't take responsibility,

724
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,670
you'd better speak clearly
with Tangli soon.

725
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,400
(I thought I was flawless.)

726
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,880
(Where exactly did I slip up)

727
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,800
(to make Wen'an so persistent?)

728
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,590
Mr. Lu,

729
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,670
I truly didn't know

730
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,150
that Xie Xi would set a trap for her.

731
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,150
By the time I realized,
it was too late to stop it.

732
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,320
But that assassin

733
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,800
really had nothing to do with us.

734
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,590
I wanted to save Mingshu too,

735
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,760
but at the time,

736
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,760
I was truly powerless.

737
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,070
I know.

738
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,360
That day, it was you who told me Mingshu

739
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,590
went to the back mountain.

740
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,920
I was really worried.

741
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,840
I never intended to hurt her.

742
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,030
Mr. Lu,

743
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,800
I know you care about her.

744
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,510
I don't want you to misunderstand me.

745
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
What are you two talking about?

746
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,280
Mingshu.

747
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,200
Tang Sheng,

748
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,550
I know it's you.

749
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,630
Don't hide behind my brother.

750
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,470
Come out.

751
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,990
Brother,

752
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,030
why are you meeting her behind my back?

753
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,000
What are you hiding from me?

754
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,190
Who is she really?

755
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,550
I'll explain everything to you later.

756
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,920
Who is she?

757
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,030
Mr. Lu, no need to keep hiding it
for me.

758
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,920
Seeing how things are now,

759
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,480
I'm afraid Mingshu
has long suspected it,

760
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,920
she followed you here on purpose today.

761
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,880
Yes, I knew Brother

762
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,230
came to the back yard behind my back.

763
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,070
I just didn't understand

764
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,280
why he had to hide it from me.

765
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:27,950
Mingshu,

766
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,840
some things weren't told to you

767
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,760
because I was trying to protect you.

768
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,840
Mingshu,

769
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,000
please don't blame him.

770
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,030
My real name is Su Tangli,

771
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,000
daughter of Su Changhua.

772
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,630
After surviving by sheer luck,

773
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,000
I had no choice but to fake an identity

774
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,880
and hide here in the academy.

775
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,480
If my true identity is exposed,

776
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,110
I'll face even harsher punishment

777
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,360
and be sent back to the Music Office.

778
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,800
Mr. Lu only kept it from you

779
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,230
to help me.

780
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
Please don't blame him.

781
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,240
Fine.

782
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,320
I won't talk about
you hiding it from me.

783
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,030
Since I was entrusted
by the County Princess,

784
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,070
there are some things

785
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,550
I must ask her clearly.

786
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,760
Alright.

787
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,230
Mingshu, ask anything.

788
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,360
I will answer honestly.

789
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,960
I know your circumstances are difficult.

790
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,000
But do you realize
your relationship with Xie Xi

791
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,920
has already hurt others?

792
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,550
All I've ever wanted
was a place to survive.

793
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,440
I never intended to hurt
the County Princess,

794
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,230
and I never meant to compete with her.

795
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,280
But to her,

796
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,400
your mere appearance

797
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
already destroyed her engagement.

798
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,670
How can you erase that

799
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,480
with just one "I never intended to"?

800
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,510
And Xie Xi

801
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,070
is not a good man.

802
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,030
If you're clear-headed,
end it with him immediately.

803
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,840
I just don't want to return
to the Music Office

804
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,360
to suffer torture and humiliation.

805
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,800
I only wanted to use
someone else's power

806
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,110
to cling to life.

807
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,280
Mingshu,

808
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,510
can't you pretend you never found out?

809
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,840
I understand your hardship.

810
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,360
But that doesn't justify hurting others.

811
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,110
In this world,

812
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,840
I have no one to rely on.

813
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,840
Xie Xi

814
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,730
isn't some irreplaceable

815
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,030
lover to me.

816
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,800
He's a lifeline,
can you understand that?

817
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,760
You have your brother protecting you,

818
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,230
but if my identity is exposed,

819
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,360
I have only one fate: death.

820
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,440
Wrong is still wrong.

821
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,760
Don't make excuses for yourself.

822
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,630
My brother decided to cover for you,

823
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,000
but I'm under no obligation
to protect you.

824
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,110
Don't use your pitiful story
as a weapon.

825
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,190
It doesn't work on me.
