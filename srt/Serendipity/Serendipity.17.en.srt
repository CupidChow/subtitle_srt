28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,000
Sister.

29
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,840
It's really you, Sister.

30
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,120
You're alive.

31
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,120
Where have you been

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,400
this past year?

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,880
I've searched everywhere for you.

34
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,870
After we parted,

35
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,510
I sneaked into the capital.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,040
Later, I was rescued

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,920
by a family named Zhang.

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,120
I took the jade pendant

39
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,740
to the Imperial Music Office
to find you,

40
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,200
but the steward told me

41
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,630
you were already in the Lu Residence.

42
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,550
Then came

43
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,470
that incident
at the Hereditary Privilege Banquet.

44
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,280
Speak! Why was Zhang Song's jade pendant

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,590
in Lu Wencai's possession

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,310
to threaten Lady Yuanying?

47
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,360
My master

48
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,720
took a liking to Lady Yuanying,

49
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,430
but she refused him outright.

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,680
This Liu Yuanying...

51
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,990
I offered her so much gold and jewels,

52
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,800
yet she remained stubborn.

53
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,910
She rejects courtesy
and invites punishment.

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,000
If bribery fails,

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,240
threats must suffice.

56
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,160
Earlier at the Imperial Music Office,

57
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,520
I overheard the steward mention

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,680
she had a younger brother

59
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,940
searching for her with a jade pendant.

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,710
Her brother?

61
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,710
He's the son of a disgraced official.

62
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,310
He must be in hiding.

63
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,630
This identity could be exploited.

64
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,470
For that beast Lu Wencai,

65
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,030
you'd ruin your future?

66
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,400
Wenyuan,

67
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,240
is it worth it?

68
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,840
He violated you.

69
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,030
If I don't kill him,

70
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,960
I swear I'll cease to be human.

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,310
I infiltrated the academy

72
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,630
solely to avenge you.

73
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,080
Sister,

74
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,030
don't cry.

75
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,150
Our reunion

76
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,910
should be joyous.

77
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,430
You're my only family left

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,870
in this world.

79
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,910
The sole reason

80
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,520
I keep living is you.

81
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,680
How could you bear to leave me alone?

82
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,750
Wenyuan...

83
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,550
Wenyuan...

84
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,270
Wenyuan!

85
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,640
Wenyuan!

86
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,430
Wenyuan!

87
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,400
Sister,

88
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,710
had I known this,

89
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,280
I wouldn't have sought you out.

90
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,550
Then

91
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,520
he wouldn't have

92
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,800
deceived you.

93
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,640
Wenyuan,

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,910
it's not your fault.

95
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,750
Not your fault.

96
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,510
You're my only kin now.

97
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,560
If you die,

98
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,190
I won't live either.

99
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,150
Sister,

100
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,910
promise me.

101
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Don't cry.

102
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,680
Alright?

103
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,270
No more tears.

104
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,910
Wenyuan!

105
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,040
Wenyuan,

106
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,680
wake up. Look at me.

107
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,560
Wenyuan,

108
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,510
wake up and look at me.

109
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,800
Wenyuan, look at me one last time!

110
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,070
Wenyuan, open your eyes!

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,920
Wenyuan!

112
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,120
Wenyuan...

113
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,790
Soon...

114
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll...

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,190
I'll join you soon.

116
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,430
Let me die!

117
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,510
What are you doing?

118
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,830
With Father and Wenyuan gone,

119
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,120
what meaning does my life hold?

120
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,020
Yuanying!

121
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,690
Your father was forced
to frame his friend

122
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,070
due to others' schemes.

123
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,270
He likely died filled with regret

124
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,310
for leaving your family in turmoil.

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,920
We must

126
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,430
uncover the full truth.

127
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,480
The reunion brings parting.

128
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,160
Though not blood siblings,

129
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,720
their genuine bond

130
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,920
moves hearts.

131
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,020
(Mingli Hall)

132
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,000
Tang...

133
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,510
Lady Su.

134
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,120
We're both from Jianglin.

135
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,070
Just call me Tangli henceforth.

136
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,110
However,

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,310
we weren't

138
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,800
particularly close before.

139
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,680
Why do you

140
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,120
seek me now?

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,950
Certain matters perplex me.

142
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,950
I come seeking answers.

143
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,720
What could I, a criminal slave,

144
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,750
help with?

145
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,390
Missed.

146
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,630
According to Zhang Song,

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,430
he committed two crimes.

148
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,480
The hidden arrow in Huantao Study

149
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,630
and the plaque in Mingli Hall.

150
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,680
He claims he accidentally
found the arrow

151
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,430
and overheard

152
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,950
about the plaque's damage.

153
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,870
How coincidental.

154
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,800
It's like

155
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,310
knives were handed to him

156
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,720
when he sought to harm.

157
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,240
Perhaps

158
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,600
heaven aided Zhang Song?

159
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,600
Heaven's aid or human design?

160
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,430
Xie Xi's hidden arrow
is extremely precious.

161
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,120
He'd guard it carefully

162
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,630
and never misplace it.

163
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,070
Yet it was lost

164
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,390
and found by someone.

165
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,270
Regarding the plaque,
I inquired with Madam Lin.

166
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,070
The repair request was filed long ago,

167
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,600
but no one came.

168
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,040
Someone must deliberately delayed it.

169
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,270
You were close to Xie Xi

170
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,600
and had access

171
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,310
to his personal items.

172
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,390
You transcribed the repair records,
didn't you?

173
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,510
What are you implying?

174
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,360
You gave Zhang Song the arrow

175
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,070
and leaked the plaque's condition.

176
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,120
You orchestrated everything.

177
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,720
Lu Mingshu!

178
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,830
I've no time for your nonsense.

179
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,390
I haven't finished yet.

180
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,310
Xie Xi treated you coldly.

181
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,630
Lu Wencai threatened you.

182
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,840
So you used

183
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,320
Zhang Song's vengeance

184
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,480
to kill two birds with one stone.

185
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,320
Your reasoning

186
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,200
seems logical

187
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,240
but remains mere conjecture.

188
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,910
You have no proof.

189
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,550
Heaven

190
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,840
witnesses all.

191
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,910
You know the truth

192
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,720
in your heart.

193
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,000
Mingshu,

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,790
you wrong me.

195
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,910
How could I act like this?

196
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,230
However,

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,870
I wonder,

198
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,840
if your family was destroyed

199
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,080
by villains,

200
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,270
would you care about revenge methods?

201
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,270
What do you mean?

202
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,840
Do you know...?

203
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,680
Su Tangli!

204
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,390
You go out first.

205
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,160
I'll speak with her

206
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,720
privately.

207
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,750
Mr. Lu,

208
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,320
Ying Xun said

209
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,720
you pleaded with Prince Rui

210
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,600
to spare me.

211
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,630
Thank you.

212
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,030
I promised to help you

213
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,870
escape the Imperial Music Office.

214
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,000
I kept my word.

215
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,360
But what about your promise to me?

216
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

217
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,390
Earlier, Mingshu accused me
of manipulating others.

218
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,270
I spoke rashly

219
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,000
from anguish.

220
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,200
Please don't blame me.

221
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,790
You're always composed.

222
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,320
Why lose composure

223
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,120
over mere words today?

224
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,720
After what I've endured,

225
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
I'm no longer

226
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,750
the Su Tangli

227
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,790
who existed beyond worldly affairs.

228
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,160
Tangli,

229
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,600
I know you seek
to clear the mentor's name.

230
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,510
But justice differs from vengeance.

231
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,720
If you stray from righteousness,

232
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,720
my mentor's spirit

233
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,790
won't rest.

234
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,510
Mr. Lu,

235
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,240
do you doubt me?

236
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,000
Belief matters less

237
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,510
than your own awareness

238
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,360
of actions.

239
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,100
(Education Without Bias)

240
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,080
Buddy,

241
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,030
are you still worried about Lady Su?

242
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,790
If your suspicions hold,

243
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,390
though her hands are clean,

244
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,790
her heart

245
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,320
must be stained.

246
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,120
She asked me

247
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,440
if my family was destroyed

248
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,510
by villains,

249
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,510
would I care about revenge methods.

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,510
I don't know why,

251
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,480
but this question haunts me.

252
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,320
So what do you think?

253
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,320
I'd never spare the culprit.

254
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,390
But I refuse to dwell
on such hypotheticals.

255
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,080
After all,

256
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,390
my loved ones are here with me.

257
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Buddy,

258
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,480
you and Mother

259
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
must stay well

260
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,350
and be with me

261
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,030
forever.

262
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,710
Okay.

263
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,710
Your Majesty,

264
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,690
according to testimony
from Liu Xiankun's daughter

265
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,000
regarding Su Changhua's case,

266
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,720
Liu Xiankun was coerced

267
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,670
into falsely accusing Su

268
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,910
of corruption.

269
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,960
I boldly

270
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,650
request Your Majesty
to reopen this case.

271
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,080
I second it.

272
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,140
(Emperor Da'an)

273
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Your Majesty,

274
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,720
the Su Changhua case
was thoroughly adjudicated.

275
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,150
Reopening it

276
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,720
may invite controversy

277
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,630
and undermine the imperial authority.

278
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,270
Mr. Yang, it's not true.

279
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,630
Doubtful cases demand reinvestigation.

280
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,790
Turning a blind eye

281
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,630
will damage credibility.

282
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,590
Your Majesty,

283
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,630
three judicial ministries
have jointly tried Su's case

284
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,670
after an exhaustive review.

285
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,510
Does Prince Rui

286
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,630
imply

287
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,080
all three erred?

288
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,240
If we reopen cases,

289
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,120
should former judges

290
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,030
recuse themselves?

291
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,910
I dare ask Prince Rui,

292
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
is this merely a pretext

293
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,080
to install your own candidates?

294
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,670
I'm afraid that's what you really want.

295
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,840
Mr. Han,

296
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,630
please cease

297
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,030
baseless accusations.

298
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,630
- Grand Tutor...
- Enough!

299
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,910
This matter needn't be rushed.

300
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,320
We'll revisit it later.

301
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,440
I'll obey.

302
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,990
- Brilliant, Your Majesty.
- Brilliant, Your Majesty.

303
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,560
Your Highness,

304
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,910
you haven't eaten all day.

305
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,080
Please take some food.

306
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,230
Your Highness,

307
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,720
your health will suffer

308
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,790
without food.

309
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,320
You...

310
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,110
I got this.

311
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,440
Yes, Consort.

312
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,060
(Memorial)

313
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,510
Why the anger, Your Highness?

314
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
These elderly ministers

315
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,600
ignore the truth,

316
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,880
claiming I seek personal gain

317
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,150
through retrials.

318
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,080
These memorials are all accusing me.

319
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,720
I'm afraid they know right from wrong,

320
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
but they oppose

321
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,320
your faction.

322
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,840
Though Prince Yu's faction is large,

323
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,150
they're mere opportunists.

324
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,270
I care not

325
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,630
for sycophants' barks,

326
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,960
but fear

327
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,120
officials lack discernment.

328
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,480
Public opinion

329
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,840
can overwhelm.

330
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,750
Your actions

331
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,440
align with the law

332
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,790
and benefit the people.

333
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,150
Why heed

334
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,270
worthless mockery?

335
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,280
It's not my reputation

336
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,750
I fear,

337
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,840
but the obstruction

338
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,960
of my intentions

339
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,870
by public opinion.

340
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,840
On the contrary,

341
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,790
their opposition

342
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,840
proves you've struck

343
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,240
vital points.

344
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,240
What to do is no longer important.

345
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,440
Just keep advancing.

346
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,680
That's right.

347
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,030
Their frenzy

348
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,550
shows I've hit

349
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,510
their weak spot.

350
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,840
I mustn't

351
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,680
be shackled

352
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
by their nonsense.

353
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,320
Your plans require time.

354
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,480
Please preserve your health.

355
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,720
Dine now.

356
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,630
Thank you.

357
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,680
This is my duty.

358
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,750
Why don't we share a meal?

359
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,590
I've already eaten.

360
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,070
Then I won't bother you.

361
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,200
Don't stop me!

362
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,880
I'll berate that scoundrel publicly.

363
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,830
County Princess, this is rash!

364
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,930
People will think you're a shrew!

365
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,070
- Don't stop me!
- Making scenes?

366
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,310
Mingshu, hurry up!

367
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,680
You kept calm

368
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,550
before Su Tangli.

369
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,830
Why lose control

370
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,680
with Xie Xi?

371
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,920
Different matters!

372
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,000
I'll annul the engagement

373
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,240
and let the world know

374
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,790
Xie Xi has wronged me!

375
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,080
Okay, you go.

376
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,240
Shout through the streets.

377
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,640
If people see you

378
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
as a harpy,

379
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,030
they'll

380
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,960
pity Xie Xi.

381
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,070
What to do?

382
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,630
So,

383
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,960
you need to calm down.

384
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,560
Mingshu,

385
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,000
I truly loved Xie Xi.

386
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,270
If you were in this situation,

387
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,550
what would you do?

388
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,480
Destroy the engagement

389
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,000
at all costs.

390
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,030
Let him fly free

391
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,070
while I reclaim liberty.

392
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,320
Not enough?

393
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,000
Let him fly free

394
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,400
while I reclaim liberty?

395
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,590
Good!

396
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,070
I like your attitude.

397
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,880
I'll annul it,

398
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
but I won't let him escape unscathed.

399
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,070
He'll repay the humiliation

400
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,880
tenfold!

401
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,480
Remember,

402
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,790
Prince Rui

403
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,850
and Prince Yu oversee this case.

404
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,310
It has been reported to the court.

405
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,680
His Majesty will punish
Marquis Yongqing's family.

406
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,110
Why dirty your hands?

407
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,070
How else vent my rage?

408
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,270
You really have a temper.

409
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,270
Sit down...

410
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,030
Wen'an is right.

411
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,200
Xie Xi's cunning.

412
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,750
We should stay vigilant

413
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,720
lest he shifts the blame

414
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,750
onto Wen'an.

415
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,070
Mingshu voices

416
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,310
my thoughts.

417
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,720
You dare speak?

418
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,140
Had you considered this earlier,

419
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,070
I wouldn't stop you.

420
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,350
Mingshu,

421
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,560
well,

422
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,400
what should I do?

423
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,520
Good!

424
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,920
Let's do it.

425
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,070
Since we three gather rarely today,

426
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,160
let's drink

427
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,590
till dawn, okay?

428
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,430
I'll join you.

429
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,830
As a married woman, I shouldn't.

430
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,880
But I'll watch.

431
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,840
What?

432
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,510
Prince Rui forbids

433
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,790
sisterly drinking?

434
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,030
I'll confront him!

435
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,150
No, no!

436
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,200
All right.

437
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,350
To your truth-seeking

438
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,350
and Mingshu's return
to Hualang Pavilion,

439
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,400
I'll have a nice drink with you.

440
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,590
You said it yourself.

441
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,050
Here.

442
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,590
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

443
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,590
Let's pour it again.

444
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,840
Truthfully,

445
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,790
your Hualang Pavilion, the Women's Club,

446
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,920
is remarkable.

447
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,310
Even I, a county princess,

448
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,750
can find support here.

449
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,480
Ordinary women must gain more.

450
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:38,950
Mingshu,

451
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,200
I have a small request...

452
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,110
Do you want to join Hualang Pavilion?

453
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,310
Frankly,

454
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,560
I witness

455
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,790
women's plights

456
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,030
daily.

457
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,880
Regardless of status,

458
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,750
they all suffer

459
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,270
under societal constraints.

460
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,680
There is no door for help.

461
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,750
Our Hualang Pavilion

462
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,270
offers a refuge

463
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,920
in crises.

464
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,270
I must join

465
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,920
such meaningful work.

466
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,520
Truthfully,

467
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,070
County Princess, you're a heroine.

468
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,440
Your presence would

469
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,720
strengthen Hualang Pavilion.

470
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
Let's expand Hualang Pavilion

471
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,350
- across Da'an.
- Across Da'an!

472
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,630
Here.

473
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,720
Shujun,

474
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,350
besides you,

475
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,480
I've met no sister

476
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,070
so aligned with my heart.

477
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,920
Let's swear sisterhood today.

478
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,870
How is it?

479
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,640
Sounds great!

480
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,700
(Fucui Pavilion)

481
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,790
Grateful for this bond.

482
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,510
May we sisters

483
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,830
cherish time

484
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,790
and prosper.

485
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,720
Good!

486
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,830
Even if love betrays us,

487
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,270
loneliness holds no fear

488
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,440
with sisters by my side.

489
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,550
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

490
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,720
Drink till dawn!

491
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,560
Good!

492
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,510
(Fucui Pavilion)

493
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,440
Pour for Shujun!

494
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,840
- Here's for you.
- Fill it up!

495
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,240
Shujun, drink more.

496
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,160
You too.

497
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,000
Consort Rui, you're so strict.

498
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,590
Cheers!

499
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,440
If Consort appears,

500
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,910
say we

501
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,260
passed by coincidentally.

502
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,080
Understood?

503
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,110
Understood...

504
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,270
You guys, be careful.

505
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,110
Slow down...

506
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,200
- Watch out.
- Careful, Consort!

507
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,070
I'm not drunk.

508
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,320
- Lady Mingshu!
- I'm fine.

509
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,400
Be careful.

510
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,720
Let's keep drinking.

511
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,480
You lost everything you drank.

512
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
Impossible!

513
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,000
I can't drink anymore.

514
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,750
Obviously, I'm the one who won.

515
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,680
What are you looking at?

516
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,630
Take her!

517
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,920
Your Highness, why are you here?

518
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,400
We... passed by.

519
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,560
Then...

520
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,350
What about Lady Mingshu?

521
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,620
I'll send Consort home first.

522
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,110
You use

523
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,270
Consort's carriage

524
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,880
to send this lady home.

525
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,240
Okay.

526
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,680
Let's go, Lady Mingshu

527
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,110
- I...
- Drink with me.

528
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,920
I'm not drunk.

529
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,480
Let's go. We're home.

530
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,310
Let's keep drinking!

531
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,680
Mingshu.

532
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,240
Mingshu,

533
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,680
keep drinking.

534
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,050
Mingshu,

535
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,240
I think you're right.

536
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,000
Life is not easy.

537
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,160
We should stay away from faithless men.

538
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,080
Prince Rui

539
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,320
isn't that type.

540
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,750
Don't worry.

541
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,750
Prince Rui?

542
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,110
He...

543
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,000
He...

544
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,310
What's wrong with him?

545
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,590
He understands nothing of women.

546
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,680
Always stern-faced.

547
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,790
I suspect no woman

548
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,960
ever favored him.

549
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,880
He...

550
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,070
He cares only for state affairs.

551
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,310
He has no hobbies,

552
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,640
no joy,

553
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,480
and

554
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,640
no confidants.

555
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,400
So pitiable.

556
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,480
So this is how you see me?

557
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,960
A pitiable man?

558
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,880
But Prince Rui respects me.

559
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,400
He's a righteous gentleman.

560
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,720
Compared to Xie Xi,

561
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,200
he's heaven to earth.

562
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,080
Anything else?

563
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,270
His virtues?

564
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,070
If we

565
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,550
keep our distance,

566
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,960
it's acceptable.

567
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,880
We won't.

568
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,550
Consort Rui, wait.

569
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,000
Mr. Lu!

570
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,470
Mr. Lu,

571
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,960
Prince Rui sent me
to escort Lady Mingshu.

572
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,550
Please take her home.

573
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,510
Why so drunk?

574
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,720
It's you.

575
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,960
Mr. Green Robe,

576
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,240
I'm dreaming of you again.

577
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,070
Why haunt my dreams?

578
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,590
Stop squirming, Lu Mingshu.

579
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,240
Blurred vision

580
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,270
and don't let me see clearly.

581
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,880
Show your true form!

582
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,720
Don't move.

583
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,350
How rude to Mr. Green Robe.

584
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,350
Then why did you

585
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,960
hide from me?

586
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,200
It makes me worry.

587
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,070
Why?

588
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,680
I'm worried that you're Buddy.

589
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,880
Why fear that?

590
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,200
How can it be Buddy?

591
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,480
I can't like him.

592
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,550
What do you think

593
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,640
of him?

594
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,270
Why silent?

595
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,030
You said
I was your most important person.

596
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,910
Forgot?

597
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,190
Qingzhao,

598
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,590
is that you?

599
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,760
This...

600
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,550
She's utterly drunk.

601
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,870
Mother,

602
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,480
prepare some hangover soup for her.

603
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,430
Get her inside.

604
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,920
Another cup.

605
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,070
It's all in the drink.

606
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,980
(Wei Zhuo)

607
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,240
I mean no harm.

608
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,720
Madam, don't be afraid.

609
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,030
As a martial artist,

610
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,160
I reacted instinctively

611
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,200
to your move.

612
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,000
My apologies.

613
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,550
I mistook you

614
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,110
for a stalker earlier.

615
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,270
And I overreacted.

616
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,880
Please forgive my rudeness.

617
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,790
My military training

618
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,070
makes me overreact.

619
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,910
Madam,

620
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,270
are you unharmed?

621
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,960
I'm fine.

622
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,480
Who's there?

623
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,320
It's settled.

624
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,830
Thanks for your aid.

625
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,750
I'm Zeng, thank you very much.

626
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,800
Are you awake?

627
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,160
Caught you,

628
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,510
Mr. Green Robe.

629
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,440
Look closely now,

630
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,350
who am I

631
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,480
on earth?

632
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,880
No...

633
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,510
You're not Song Qingzhao.

634
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,750
But you're like Buddy.

635
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,350
I was never Song Qingzhao.

636
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,200
I'm Lu Chang.

637
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,030
Lu Chang?

638
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,980
Lu...

639
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,550
Lu Chang is Buddy.

640
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,590
No!

641
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,760
Buddy...

642
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,350
Buddy can't.

643
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,320
No...

644
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,760
I know.

645
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,270
Those memories

646
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,630
are painful for you.

647
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,550
Sometimes I wish

648
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,160
you would never recall them.

649
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,400
But sometimes...

650
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,510
I was being selfish.

651
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,960
Any findings?

652
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,280
According to my investigation,

653
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,920
Zeng never remarried.

654
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,550
She previously resided in Jianglin.

655
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,440
Recently, she moved to the capital.

656
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,910
The household only has Zeng,

657
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,480
Lu Chang, and Lu Mingshu.

658
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,400
It does appear to be Yuqing.

659
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,850
(Zhang Shicheng)
It's all my fault.

660
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,740
I assumed

661
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,350
they perished in that year's flood.

662
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,160
Hence for all these years,

663
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,270
our family remained separated.

664
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,830
During my investigation,

665
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,270
a man noticed me.

666
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,240
What man?

667
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,630
I don't know.

668
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,390
All right.

669
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,910
Continue your search.

670
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,150
Yes, Master.

671
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,480
Congratulations on reuniting

672
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,680
with your family.

673
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,720
What celebration?

674
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,590
Frankly,

675
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,920
it's all my fault back then.

676
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,510
I was obsessed with official duties.

677
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,480
When they suffered,

678
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,680
I failed to return promptly.

679
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,000
Thus,

680
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,270
we've been separated for over a decade.

681
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,440
All these years,

682
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,270
she has raised two children alone.

683
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,750
She must have endured

684
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,030
countless hardships.

685
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,320
Master,

686
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
bring them home

687
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,270
and compensate them properly.

688
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,030
I know Yuqing's temperament.

689
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,310
She's strong-willed.

690
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,350
Forgiveness won't come easily.

691
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,350
Though you erred,

692
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,270
it was understandable.

693
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,270
With sincere efforts

694
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,590
over time,

695
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,830
Madam Zeng

696
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,070
is reasonable.

697
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,110
She'll surely accept you

698
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,070
and have a family reunion

699
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,400
with you.

700
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
May everything

701
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,880
go smoothly.

702
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,910
It will.

703
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,100
(Old Madam Li)

704
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,590
Auntie,

705
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,630
are you physically well?

706
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,920
Do you need to see a physician?

707
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,350
Auntie,

708
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,880
I'm Wei Zhuo.

709
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,550
Your son's comrade.

710
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,880
I'm here to visit you.

711
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,670
Son!

712
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,360
Son...

713
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,070
You finally came

714
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,190
to see me.

715
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Son,

716
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,190
you married a good daughter-in-law.

717
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,280
While you were away,

718
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,590
she cared for me.

719
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,280
She changed my clothes

720
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,880
and cooked for me.

721
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
(Something's wrong.)

722
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,400
(Didn't Li's wife)

723
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,000
(pass away long ago?)

724
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,760
Son.

725
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,720
Buddy,

726
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,030
did you bring me home last night?

727
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,320
I didn't embarrass myself, right?

728
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,550
You don't remember?

729
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,760
I drank a little...

730
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,360
I swear never again.

731
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,070
Buddy,

732
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,500
it's better if you don't recall.

733
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:02,140
(Prefectural Prince Residence)

734
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,840
On your knees!

735
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,480
(Prefectural Prince Residence)

736
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,480
What's this?

737
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,280
Prefectural Prince, County Princess,

738
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,760
I failed

739
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,230
in disciplining my son,

740
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,190
allowing this wretch
to commit such offenses.

741
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,320
Today,

742
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,420
(Marquis Yongqing)
I bring him before this public gathering

743
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,110
to atone for his crimes.

744
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,190
(Prefectural Prince Residence)
We implore you to show mercy.

745
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,030
Please forgive
this unworthy son of mine.

746
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,350
Endure it.

747
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,440
He's really striking him.

748
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,870
Father!

749
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,120
- Father!
- Will you remember this lesson?

750
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,320
Do you understand your wrongs?

751
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,110
Will you dare again?

752
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,940
(Prefectural Prince Residence)

753
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,470
I'll teach you.

754
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,320
Uncle!

755
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,070
Uncle, stop beating him.

756
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,510
Mr. Xie can't

757
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,800
endure this.

758
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,840
Apologize to County Princess at once!

759
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,910
Yes, it's my fault.

760
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:20,920
I apologize to you.

761
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,590
But I was completely blinded

762
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,480
by that criminal slave.

763
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,150
I've always had you in my heart!

764
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,990
Mr. Xie,

765
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,440
I know you have me in mind.

766
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,400
However, you were willing

767
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,150
to violate laws for that Lady Su.

768
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,600
Presumably,

769
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,230
she takes precedence over me.

770
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,240
Mr. Xie,

771
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,550
I don't wish to cause you distress.

772
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,620
I'm willing to terminate our engagement

773
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,280
to fulfill you and Lady Su.

00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,800
Wen'an!

776
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,840
Let me explain.

777
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,880
Please let me explain!

778
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,280
County Princess is frightened.

779
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,510
Don't let him startle her!

780
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,440
Wen'an, please listen to me.

781
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,710
Listen to my explanation!

782
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,360
Lecher! Faithless scoundrel!

783
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,880
County Princess Wen'an is so good,

784
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,510
yet you dare philander outside!

785
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,590
Truly heartless!

786
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,590
- My fault. I wronged you.
- Betrayer!

787
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,550
I'm not like him.

788
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,710
I didn't mean it.

789
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,960
- Wen'an...
- Enough!

790
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,440
Enough of this disgrace!

791
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,710
Beat this traitor to death!

792
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,550
Strike him dead!

793
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,600
Wen'an...

794
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,540
(Daqing Hall)

795
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,390
Your Majesty,

796
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,400
my foolish son
was kindhearted and nostalgic.

797
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,320
He was beguiled by that criminal slave.

798
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,800
His momentary negligence

799
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,030
caused grave errors.

800
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,070
I beseech Your Majesty,

801
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,360
considering my years of loyalty,

802
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,640
to show leniency

803
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,000
and pardon my son.

804
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,870
Your Majesty,

805
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,880
this can't be lightly forgiven.

806
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,480
Xie Xi's illicit relations

807
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,840
with criminal slaves

808
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,800
and abuse of Marquis Yongqing's authority
to forge documents

809
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,960
are illegal and morally corrupt.

810
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,110
My daughter's years

811
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,360
of devotion

812
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,190
only met with deception

813
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,030
and infidelity!

814
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,440
Marquis Yongqing failed parental duties

815
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,000
and abused power!

816
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,150
I implore Your Majesty
to annul the engagement

817
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,200
and severely punish

818
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,400
the entire Marquis household!

819
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,320
Your Majesty,

820
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,320
Marquis Yongqing

821
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,710
remains an important court pillar.

822
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,400
Moreover,
Prince Rui learned martial arts

823
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,840
from him since childhood.

824
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,150
I hope Your Majesty

825
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,800
will show mercy,

826
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,110
considering

827
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,280
his past connections.

828
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,840
Prince Rui,

829
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,840
Marquis Yongqing was

830
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,230
indeed your tutor.

831
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,920
What's your view on this matter?

832
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,600
Your Majesty,

833
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,680
those who betray

834
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,480
the imperial grace

835
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,070
and disrupt court order

836
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,190
must be punished by law

837
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,760
to satisfy public justice.

838
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,760
I second it.

839
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,030
I second it!

840
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,280
Henceforth, Xie Xi,
son of Marquis Yongqing,

841
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,550
is stripped of engagement
to County Princess Wen'an,

842
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,880
demoted to commoner status,

843
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,960
and permanently barred
from imperial examinations.

844
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,800
Marquis Yongqing is removed

845
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,920
as Minister of War

846
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,000
for negligence and poor parenting,

847
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,030
but retains his title

848
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,710
in recognition of past merits.

849
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,820
(Daqing Hall)

850
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,280
Using a wastrel

851
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,480
to deprive Prince Rui

852
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,480
of Marquis Yongqing's support.

853
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,110
What an effortless strategy!

854
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,710
You show brilliant insight.

855
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,600
Yet Prince Rui,

856
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,920
despite the heavy losses,

857
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,110
didn't plead for mercy.

858
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,920
It surprised me somewhat.

859
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,550
So what?

860
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,590
Prince Rui followed legal procedures.

861
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,320
Though avoiding censure
from the officials,

862
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,440
his abandonment of the Xie Family

863
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,800
reveals his cold-hearted nature

864
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,630
to others.

865
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,950
As a result,

866
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
those court observers

867
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,360
will surely

868
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,280
align with Your Highness.

869
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,500
(New Dawn)

870
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,110
How does it feel to be reduced

871
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,920
to a commoner and forever barred

872
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,960
from examinations?

873
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,360
Truly, never infuriate a woman.

874
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,590
I saved your life,

875
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,960
yet you brought me to this ruin.

876
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,320
Where's your conscience?

877
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,400
Conscience?

878
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,670
When you tried to kill me

879
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,880
near the cliff

880
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,920
to secure your position,

881
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,320
where was your conscience?

882
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,510
When you sacrificed me in court

883
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,400
to save yourself,

884
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,000
where was your conscience?

885
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,400
All your promises of protection,

886
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,760
love,

887
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,190
and reversing the case for me

888
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,840
were lies to bask

889
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,670
in female adoration.

890
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,480
When the crisis came,

891
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:53,920
I became disposable.

892
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,320
Xie Xi,

893
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,550
you have no right to blame me.

894
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
Between you and me,

895
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:04,070
it's fair enough.

896
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,440
You've always regarded me as heaven.

897
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,710
You always played

898
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,920
the fragile damsel before me.

899
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,480
I never imagined

900
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,360
you'd be such a viper!

901
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,400
Because I saw

902
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,190
through your filth

903
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,030
and played along.

904
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,230
To tell you the truth,

905
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,230
I've always used you.

906
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:26,880
I never loved you.

907
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,920
Every affectionate look was fake.

908
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,350
I only felt

909
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,400
contempt and disgust for you.

910
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,920
Don't blame my cruelty.

911
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,000
You brought this upon yourself.

912
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,880
You shrew!

913
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,360
I'll kill you!

914
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,140
