What are you doing?

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,520
You wretch!

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,740
They wanted to take you
to the capital for trial.

31
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,560
But I can't wait.

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,030
Tonight will be your end.

33
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,550
I...

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,240
I am His Majesty's own son.

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,710
How dare a mere witch like you
presume to judge me?

36
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,030
Guards!

37
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,710
Screaming won't help.

38
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,190
The jailers are all drugged.

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,150
You...

40
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,630
Prince Yu is ruthless and cunning,

41
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,630
not some petty scoundrel.

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,910
Who the hell are you?

43
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,910
I killed Cao Hai,

44
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,910
transferring the pain
of my family's massacre onto him.

45
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,000
I know I've broken the law.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,900
I deserve to be punished.

47
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,150
Prince Rui, please sentence me

48
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,120
according to the law.

49
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,280
Cao Hai ambushed you.

50
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,270
At that critical moment,

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,870
Mingshu acted impulsively to help.

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,400
This was a loyal act

53
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,560
that also protected you.

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,680
If blame must be assigned,

55
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,560
I will bear the punishment.

56
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,750
I beg Your Highness

57
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,400
to show mercy for Mingshu.

58
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,960
Mingshu's killing of Cao Hai

59
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,430
was a personal grudge,

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,680
but it was also an act

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,190
of protection.

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,640
In addition,

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,030
she infiltrated the Lin Family

64
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,080
and obtained evidence
of Prince Yu's private army.

65
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,120
Therefore, I decree

66
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,120
no punishment.

67
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,110
But this is a serious matter.

68
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,800
I will report all the details
to His Majesty

69
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,470
for final judgment.

70
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,870
What do you say?

71
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Thank you, Prince Rui.

72
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,960
Rise, all of you.

73
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,260
- Greetings, Prince Rui.
- How's it going?

74
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,510
Is Lady Su's testimony

75
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,380
true?

76
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,240
Was Prince Yu

77
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,310
really impersonated?

78
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,070
Prince Rui,

79
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,480
this man's face matches

80
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,630
Prince Yu's perfectly,

81
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,590
but he has an extra birthmark

82
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,560
on his back.

83
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,910
Under interrogation,

84
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,360
he confessed

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,520
to being a decoy.

86
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,430
Where is

87
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,350
the real Prince Yu now?

88
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,600
This lowly person

89
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,070
was only following orders

90
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,250
to impersonate Prince Yu in Ning'an.

91
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,800
He knows nothing else.

92
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,600
Prince Yu fought desperately

93
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,750
to keep his title,

94
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,120
hoping to claim

95
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,080
the throne.

96
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,390
Things are backfiring now.

97
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,680
His Majesty intends
to crown Prince Rui as heir.

98
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,600
Do you think

99
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,430
he'll accept defeat?

100
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,460
His request to visit Ning'an

101
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,380
on the occasion
of his wet nurse's birthday

102
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,750
was a mere

103
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,710
misdirection.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,240
With His Majesty seriously ill,

105
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,560
could he be

106
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,000
planning a desperate move?

107
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,590
He wants to storm the palace.

108
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,710
Now that

109
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,120
His Majesty's critical illness

110
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,270
is the result of Noble Consort Hua

111
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,310
poisoning him

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,480
to install Prince Rui as heir,

113
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,070
thereby endangering the empire!

114
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,520
So

115
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,270
we must destroy these traitors

116
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,080
and install Prince Yu
to stabilize the empire!

117
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,270
Those who aid the rebels

118
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,720
will face the extermination
of their families!

119
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,390
(Mingde Gate)
We will follow Prince Yu

120
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,310
to purify the court

121
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,430
and eliminate the demonic consort!

122
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,470
Your Majesty.

123
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,080
Your Majesty!

124
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,480
Director Lu, you're here.

125
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,430
I've come.

126
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,070
Come here.

127
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,200
Your Majesty...

128
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,560
My illness

129
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,480
is worsening.

130
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,480
I'm afraid

131
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,390
the matter of the succession

132
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,240
threatens to be delayed.

133
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
That's why

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,310
I have summoned you today

135
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,560
to draft

136
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,360
the enthronement edict

137
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,720
as a precaution.

138
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,710
Your Majesty,

139
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,530
prioritize your health.
Do not dwell on such matters.

140
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,800
Your Majesty!

141
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,560
Your Majesty!

142
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,500
Your Majesty! Disaster!

143
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,090
Prince Yu is leading rebels
to storm the palace.

144
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,440
They are approaching Funing Hall.

145
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,070
Such a traitor!

146
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,070
How dare he stage a coup!

147
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,750
Your Majesty!

148
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,630
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

149
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,240
- Your Majesty, calm down!
- Your Majesty!

150
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,680
Your Majesty, how are you?

151
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,140
Quickly summon
the Deputy Palace Commander

152
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,360
to stop the rebels!

153
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,070
He has secretly defected to Prince Yu.

154
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,870
The Imperial Guard is standing idle,

155
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,190
allowing Prince Yu's advance.

156
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,120
Greetings, Prince Yu.

157
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,120
Well done, Deputy Palace Commander Qin.

158
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,120
Where is that woman?

159
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,560
Take her away!

160
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,460
(Funing Hall)

161
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,840
Today, my breach

162
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,080
of protocol

163
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,590
is due to

164
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,240
dire necessity.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,150
Because

166
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,870
I have recently

167
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,030
discovered that

168
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,000
your prolonged illness

169
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,470
is the result

170
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,550
of Noble Consort Hua's

171
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,240
poisoning.

172
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,200
I beg Your Majesty to investigate!

173
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,000
Fabricated

174
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,750
accusations!

175
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,480
This accusation

176
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,150
is a mere

177
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,440
pretext

178
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,080
for your rebellion!

179
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,280
Father,

180
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,390
you are deceived by villains

181
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,720
and ignore advice.

182
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,960
Forced to act,

183
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,670
I bring proof here today.

184
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,630
Bring the witness!

185
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,390
Please ask.

186
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,440
Then you will know who the villain is.

187
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,990
Your Majesty,

188
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,080
I did indeed poison

189
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,390
Your Majesty's medicine

190
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,240
on the orders of Noble Consort Hua.

191
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,870
Please, Your Majesty, spare me!

192
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,670
Who led the troops into the palace?

193
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,870
You did.

194
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,630
Who committed treason?

195
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,510
You did!

196
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,510
Your righteous claims slander others!

197
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,240
Get the tiger tally!

198
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,080
Yes!

199
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,390
Your Majesty.

200
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,390
Prince Yu doesn't have the power

201
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,320
to force the entire court.

202
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,870
He'll use the tiger tally

203
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,320
to mobilize troops
and threaten officials.

204
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,150
We must

205
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,790
hide it now.

206
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,030
Prince Yu

207
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,870
must never get it.

208
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,510
Your Highness,
we've searched everywhere.

209
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,580
The tiger tally is still missing.

210
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,900
(Funing Hall)

211
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,030
You are still delusional.

212
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,120
As the eldest son,

213
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,770
I should have been
the Crown Prince long ago,

214
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,630
according to the ancestral rule.

215
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,200
But because my mother

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,390
lacked Noble Consort Hua's noble birth

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,270
and died neglected,

218
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,200
I watched you

219
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,910
raise Prince Rui

220
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,870
against me.

221
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,440
When my mother died,

222
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,150
all you cared about
was spoiling your consort,

223
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,200
not even attending her funeral.

224
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,240
Now you ask me

225
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,390
to show mercy

226
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,790
to the woman

227
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,320
who stole

228
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,790
my mother's place?

229
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,080
You...

230
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,270
You heartless monster!

231
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,480
In my heart,

232
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,750
you and Prince Rui

233
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,670
are both my sons.

234
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,210
I've never shown partiality
to any of you.

235
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,000
This is my eldest son.

236
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,200
Heaven shows
an auspicious omen to Da'an.

237
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,650
The imperial succession concerns
the stability of the empire.

238
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,670
Therefore, I've carefully considered it.

239
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,840
You can't wait...

240
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,750
Lies!

241
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,360
You can't fool me.

242
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,870
You beast.

243
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,960
You...

244
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,680
You...

245
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,340
I'll kill you.

246
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,040
Your Majesty!

247
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,200
Your Majesty!

248
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,590
Your Majesty...

249
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,750
Your Majesty...

250
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,080
Your Highness!

251
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,000
Mutual destruction

252
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,600
will benefit

253
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,630
neither of us.

254
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,080
Your Highness,

255
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,320
please summon
the imperial physician here.

256
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Your Highness...

257
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,200
Summon the imperial physician.

258
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,870
Summon the imperial physician!

259
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,000
- Hurry up!
- Yes!

260
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,000
Your Majesty...

261
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,510
- Your Majesty...
- Your Highness,

262
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,440
Your Majesty...

263
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,370
Prince Rui secretly left
the capital before.

264
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,550
He has just returned

265
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,390
with Lu Chang,

266
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,420
Song Qingzhao, and others.

267
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,150
Your Majesty...

268
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,390
Your Majesty...

269
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,110
You are

270
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,720
- uncertain about whom to name as heir?
- Your Majesty...

271
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,510
Then see for yourself.

272
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,270
Your beloved Prince Rui

273
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,000
is coming to take the throne.

274
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,390
You'll thank me

275
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,910
for what I've done.

276
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,660
(Mingde Gate)

277
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,340
(An)

278
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,280
Outrageous!

279
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,480
Who dares to block Prince Rui?

280
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,000
Noble Consort Hua's poisoning
of His Majesty

281
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,040
has been discovered.

282
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,720
By imperial edict,

283
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,250
Prince Yu has entered the palace

284
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,320
to eliminate the traitors.

285
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
We have been ordered

286
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,250
to bring Prince Rui in for questioning.

287
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,350
Guards,

288
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,390
seize him!

289
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,040
Stop!

290
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,710
Father?

291
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,750
I'm Song Mingjie, Deputy Censor
of the Privy Council.

292
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,600
Put your blades down

293
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,790
or

294
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,120
face the consequences!

295
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,190
Deputy Censor Song,

296
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,120
we are acting on His Majesty's orders

297
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,270
to bring Prince Rui in.

298
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,630
How dare you stop it?

299
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,920
Could it be

300
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,750
that you defy the imperial edict?

301
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,880
- Where is the imperial edict?
- This...

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,100
Where is the imperial edict?

303
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,350
This...

304
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,150
Without an imperial edict,

305
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,600
a mere seventh-rank officer

306
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,510
dares to intercept Prince Rui?

307
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,720
Do you know what it is?

308
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,320
That is high treason!

309
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,040
Deputy Censor Song,

310
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,960
we are all aware

311
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,670
of today's events.

312
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,160
Now

313
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,270
His Majesty is gravely ill

314
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,720
and can't issue edicts.

315
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,750
However,

316
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,480
Prince Yu has received verbal orders.

317
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,480
It's the equivalent
of an imperial edict.

318
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,800
Deputy Censor Song,

319
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,480
if you change your allegiance,

320
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,960
Prince Yu will spare

321
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,320
you and your son.

322
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,870
But

323
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,200
if you resist,

324
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,560
you will

325
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,510
die.

326
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,350
Nonsense!

327
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,320
You...

328
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,840
Listen,

329
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,630
our Song Family has been
in imperial favor for generations.

330
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,650
Without an imperial edict,

331
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,720
if you ever touch Prince Rui,

332
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,970
I'll slaughter you all!

333
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,910
You...

334
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,790
Guards,

335
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,920
escort Prince Rui to his residence.

336
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,960
Kill any

337
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,320
who interfere!

338
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,160
You...

339
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,750
All right, Song Mingjie.

340
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,150
Your stubbornness will cost you.

341
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
Wait and see!

342
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,800
Let's go!

343
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,960
Prince Rui,

344
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
after receiving my son's message,

345
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,420
I galloped back to the capital.

346
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,440
Fortunately, I caught up.

347
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,910
The capital is on edge,

348
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,440
but we lack troops.

349
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
We must plan

350
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,720
our strategy carefully.

351
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,890
Thank you, Deputy Censor Song.

352
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,590
Deputy Censor Song,

353
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,790
how is the situation

354
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,790
in the palace?

355
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,640
I have some good news for you.

356
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,920
Your beloved son

357
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
is conspiring

358
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,550
with Song Mingjie.

359
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,790
He thinks Song Mingjie's protection

360
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,960
will make me helpless?

361
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,200
How could the tiger tally

362
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,830
not be found?

363
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,510
Have all the palaces been searched?

364
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,590
Although Prince Yu

365
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,070
has bribed Deputy Palace Commander Qin

366
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,740
to control the palace guards
with the troops of the Palace Guard,

367
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,510
many soldiers

368
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,440
are acting under duress.

369
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,310
The Cavalry

370
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,680
and Infantry Commands

371
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,070
remain undeterred.

372
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,480
Deputy Censor Song,

373
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,240
as the Deputy Censor
of the Privy Council,

374
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,200
can you mobilize other commands

375
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,350
to save His Majesty?

376
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,160
These commands

377
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,550
remain loyal to His Majesty.

378
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,640
Without imperial edicts,

379
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,790
they obey no one.

380
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,070
That's why Prince Yu didn't bribe them.

381
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,350
Outside of us,

382
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,590
few know the truth

383
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,000
about the coup.

384
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,550
If we order them arbitrarily,

385
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,110
they'll see us

386
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,960
as rebels

387
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,790
no different

388
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,030
from Prince Yu.

389
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,640
But if His Majesty
is imprisoned by Prince Yu,

390
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,030
how can we issue imperial edicts?

391
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,550
I remember.

392
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,240
With the tiger tally,

393
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,350
we can act

394
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,480
in His Majesty's name.

395
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,430
Prince Rui.

396
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,520
Marshal.

397
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,590
This is exactly why I rushed back

398
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,270
to the capital after receiving

399
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,590
Lu Chang's letter.

400
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,240
His Majesty has entrusted me

401
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,380
with half of the tiger tally.

402
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,190
The other half remains at the palace.

403
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,750
Without the full tiger tally,

404
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,680
Prince Yu

405
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,350
can't fully command the troops,

406
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,720
which will

407
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,590
buy us time.

408
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,640
Then,

409
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,830
if we infiltrate the palace

410
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,200
to retrieve the other half,

411
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,720
we can command both commands

412
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,660
and suppress the rebels.

413
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,190
Correct.

414
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,510
But Prince Yu's tight defenses

415
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,960
make a direct invasion

416
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,960
suicidal.

417
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,080
Your Highness, something's wrong.

418
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,030
Assassins have kidnapped Lady Lu.

419
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,590
What?

420
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,640
Prince Yu wants to use Mingshu

421
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,920
to force me to act against you.

422
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,150
We must act immediately.

423
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,240
Let's go to the palace.

424
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,160
Fortunately, we've kept all the news
during our journey.

425
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,360
Prince Yu remains unaware
of Cao Hai's death.

426
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,400
We should enter the palace
under Cao Hai's name

427
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,270
and stall him.

428
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
However, we still need someone

429
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,240
to locate the tiger tally.

430
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,590
I have Cao Hai's token.

431
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,720
We can use it

432
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,830
to impersonate him.

433
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,510
This is our only option.

434
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,350
Desperate times

435
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,030
call for desperate measures.

436
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,750
Prince Rui, I implore you

437
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,550
to join me outside the palace gates

438
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,030
to convince both commands.

439
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,590
But without

440
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,550
the other half of the tiger tally,

441
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,550
our chances are slim.

442
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,550
Since this is the only way,

443
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,440
we must risk everything.

444
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,160
Marshal,

445
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,030
make the preparations.

446
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,670
Understood.

447
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,480
Lu Chang,

448
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,720
I'll send

449
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,970
my best guards

450
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:47,880
to accompany you

451
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,430
- to infiltrate the palace in disguise.
- Okay.

452
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,390
I'll go.

453
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,480
Me too.

454
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,920
Absolutely not!

455
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,920
Qingzhao,

456
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,750
your loyalty

457
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,720
honors me

458
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,750
as your father.

459
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,440
But have you considered?

460
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,480
Your mother loves you

461
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,310
more than her life.

462
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,310
If misfortune befalls you,

463
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,720
her remaining years

464
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,960
will be a torment.

465
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,480
Qingzhao,

466
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,000
Deputy Censor Song speaks the truth.

467
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,030
Stay at the residence.

468
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,760
Father,

469
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,800
Prince Rui,

470
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,750
I've given this a lot of thought.

471
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,800
Firstly,

472
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,590
to capture Prince Yu in the palace,

473
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,960
I know the layout

474
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,410
of the palace far better than Mr. Lu.

475
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,590
Secondly,

476
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,680
Mr. Lu is my sworn brother

477
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,160
and dearest friend.

478
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,590
How can I stand idly by

479
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,160
while they risk their lives?

480
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,480
I have loving parents,

481
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,720
but Mr. Lu

482
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,640
and the others

483
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,350
have parents

484
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,920
and other families.

485
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,070
I'll fight

486
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,200
to return safely.

487
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,350
But if fate dictates otherwise,

488
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,960
I ask you

489
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,030
to forgive me for my disloyalty.

490
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,760
Alright.

491
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,480
You can go.

492
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,460
(Funing Hall)

493
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,350
Mingshu?

494
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,110
Your Highness,

495
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,830
why did you bring her here?

496
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,310
To threaten my son?

497
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,070
Director Lu,

498
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,920
I heard your son is a lovesick fool.

499
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,040
Is that true?

500
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,150
Tell me,

501
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,110
faced with loyalty

502
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,880
to his beloved,

503
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,070
what choice will he make?

504
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,830
I await with interest.

505
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,200
Your Highness, you...

506
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,280
Mingshu!

507
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,800
Your Highness,

508
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,870
this...

509
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,960
Congratulations, Prince Yu.

510
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,200
The tiger tally has been found.

511
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,350
Heaven is favoring me.

512
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,030
With this,

513
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,200
the court

514
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,830
will be under my control.

515
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,200
I'll mobilize troops now.

516
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,070
How come it's only half?

517
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,280
I don't know.

518
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,640
Director Lu,

519
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,480
where's the other half?

520
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,190
Your Highness,

521
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,070
do you really think His Majesty

522
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,550
is unaware of your rebellion?

523
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,030
The other half

524
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,590
was smuggled out of the palace

525
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,790
by Marshal long ago.

526
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,440
It's not here!

527
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,590
Who is it?

528
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,550
(Mingde Gate)
Cao Hai, the Deputy Commander.

529
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,240
I'm here to meet Prince Yu.

530
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,440
This is my token.

531
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,950
Check him.

532
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,500
(Deputy Commander of Garrison)

533
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,750
Give the token
to Prince Yu for verification!

534
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:08,940
(Mingde Gate)

535
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,350
If we enter without a hitch,

536
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,510
the tiger tally is up to you.

537
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,110
I'll show you the way

538
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,270
to Funing Hall later.

539
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,480
Rest assured.

540
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,720
I'll disguise myself as a maid

541
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,110
to get in

542
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,480
more easily.

543
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,110
Your Highness,

544
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,750
General Cao has returned from Ning'an,

545
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,000
but was stopped by Imperial Guards.

546
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,550
I've checked his token.

547
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,310
How many people in total?

548
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,160
Only 10.

549
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,790
Have Deputy Palace Commander Qin

550
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,790
accompany me.

551
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,640
Tell Cao Hai

552
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,440
to wait in the main hall.

553
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,390
You

554
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,480
guard here.

555
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,000
Don't make a mistake.

556
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,590
Yes.

557
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,030
Your Highness, any further orders?

558
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,960
As a precaution,

559
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,400
this item will be left behind.

560
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,750
(I wonder what foolish attempt)

561
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,750
(Chang will make)

562
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,510
(to save Mingshu.)

563
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,260
(Xuande Gate)

564
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,350
General Cao!

565
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,640
General Cao, Prince Yu has summoned you

566
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,070
to the main hall.

567
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,660
(Jiying Gate)

568
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,510
Mingshu remains in his clutches.

569
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,680
We need contingencies.

570
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,800
Ying Xun,

571
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,160
after Tangli finds the tiger tally,

572
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,110
bring her here quickly.

573
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,390
Yes.

574
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,350
Prince Yu orders that

575
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,830
only General Cao may enter.

576
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,000
The others will wait here.

577
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,000
Please.

578
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,080
What do you do?

579
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,960
It's the Si hour.

580
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,240
I...

581
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,680
I bring pastries for His Majesty.

582
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,480
His Majesty is resting.

583
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,640
No snacks needed.

584
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,750
Leave them here.

585
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,110
Yes.

586
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,910
All right.

587
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,960
These are my pastries.

588
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,000
Take them in.

589
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,950
Wait.

590
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,270
Give them to me.

591
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,240
Get out of here fast.

592
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,510
- I'll deliver them.
- Stop it!

593
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,240
They are mine.

594
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,350
I want her to serve me.

595
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,720
Here, take them in.

596
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,040
What are you doing?

597
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,510
Remove your filthy hands!

598
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,830
Lackey of the traitor!

599
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,920
How dare you

600
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,070
put your hands on my food?

601
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,000
Move aside!

602
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,840
Begone!

603
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,000
- Bring them in.
- Yes.

604
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,920
Prince Yu conspired
with the Deputy Palace Commander

605
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,540
to control the palace
and seal the gates.

606
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,550
His ambition has been exposed.

607
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,510
His Majesty is compromised.

608
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,640
You are loyal,

609
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,190
but

610
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,070
waiting for

611
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,440
an imperial edict

612
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,110
risks missing the rescue.

613
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,110
Prince Rui!

614
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,640
(Mingde Gate)
We obey the emperor's orders.

615
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,720
No full tiger tally, no mobilization.

616
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,070
Rules are rules.

617
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,910
Disaster!

618
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,870
Disaster!

619
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,350
Marshal Wei is massing the Cavalry
and Infantry Commands

620
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,310
at the gates.

621
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,550
Prince Rui persuades them

622
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,480
to save the day.

623
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,640
Marshal is back?

624
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,750
Report this to Prince Yu

625
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,880
and Eunuch Lin at once.

626
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,240
We've ordered someone

627
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,160
to tell Prince Yu.

628
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,480
What's your plan?

629
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,030
Where's Lu Chang?

630
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,510
They'll meet Prince Yu in the hall.

631
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,110
I'm looking for the tiger tally.

632
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,680
He is courting death.

633
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,110
Prince Yu is holding Mingshu

634
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,400
hostage to threaten him.

635
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,480
In that case,

636
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,830
please reveal the location

637
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,590
of the tiger tally.

638
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,440
Prince Yu has hidden it.

639
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,880
No one knows where.

640
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,240
This...

641
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,000
If you find it,

642
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,270
I swear

643
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,200
to deliver it to Prince Rui.

644
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:04,950
Okay.

645
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,750
Start your search there.

646
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,790
Eunuch Lin,

647
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,830
Prince Rui and Marshal

648
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,000
are gathering at the gates.

649
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,240
Don't panic.

650
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,510
Even if Marshal returns,

651
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,880
Prince Rui has only
half of the tiger tally.

652
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,000
They can't command both commands.

653
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,750
Who was that?

654
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,300
She came to send pastries.

655
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,190
Brother,

656
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,350
how was your trip

657
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,350
to Ning'an for Nanny Lin's birthday?

658
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,030
I couldn't go in person.

659
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,550
Was it

660
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,240
great?

661
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:43,870
Guards!

662
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,070
Lu Chang.

663
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,150
That's right,

664
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,270
it's me.

665
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,440
(Where would Prince Yu)

666
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,670
(hide the tiger tally?)

667
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,150
Where is Cao Hai?

668
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,110
General Cao is dead.

669
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,110
My followers

670
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,590
will not die in vain.

671
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,800
Prince Rui

672
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,630
and his faction

673
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,800
will perish.

674
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,000
As for you, Lu Chang,

675
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,510
submit

676
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,150
and obey me now,

677
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,880
then you'll

678
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,320
have glory

679
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,670
under my rule.

680
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,630
But if you persist in your madness,

681
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,550
you can see the end.

682
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,670
Prince Yu, you seek my allegiance?

683
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,000
Let's discuss it.

684
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,280
As an emperor,

685
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,880
how would you surpass Prince Rui?

686
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,670
I know

687
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,680
you are testing my stance on reforms.

688
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,870
I know reforms are inevitable,

689
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,190
but conservatives

690
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,530
dominate the court.

691
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,920
I must consolidate military power

692
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,880
before enthronement.

693
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,360
After all,

694
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,880
gradual steps

695
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,030
lead to greatness.

696
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,190
Prince Yu, according to you,

697
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,480
sacrificing loyal subjects

698
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,630
and raising private armies

699
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,230
for personal gain

700
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,960
are merely incremental strategies
to consolidate power?

701
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,320
But I believe that

702
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,440
power gained
through the blood of the innocent

703
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,630
will inevitably demand more sacrifice

704
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,440
to sustain itself.

705
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Such a ruler

706
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,920
would only bring disaster to Da'an.

707
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,840
Lu Chang,

708
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,840
I have shown you ample courtesy.

709
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,290
Now that the entire capital

710
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,510
is under my control,

711
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,960
what leverage do you have?

712
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,150
The throne of Da'an

713
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,700
can't be occupied by anyone
without virtue.

714
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,920
It's not yours now,

715
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,550
nor will it ever be.

716
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,440
I'm tired

717
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,670
of your futility.

718
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,480
I can't bear to see your blood
stain the hall.

719
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,710
So boring.

720
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,550
Enough empty words.

721
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:57,920
Where is Mingshu?

722
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,230
(It looks like Lady Su
found the tiger tally.)

723
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,190
Eunuch Lin!

724
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,960
When will you

725
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,000
summon the physician

726
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,710
for me?

727
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,480
I've made it clear.

728
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,630
It can be negotiated.

729
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,630
Now, Prince Rui is

730
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,490
assembling the two commands
outside the palace.

731
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,960
If you can bring

732
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,110
Prince Rui's half of the tiger tally,

733
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,000
I'll get you

734
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,510
the best imperial physician.

735
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,190
If you remain obstinate,

736
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,480
don't blame me for being ruthless.

737
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,200
Director,

738
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,760
consider your options.

739
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,280
Eunuch Lin,

740
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,150
I'll help

741
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,800
Prince Yu

742
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,710
persuade Prince Rui.

743
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,880
Really?

744
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,070
Director,

745
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,510
how are you going to convince him?

746
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,630
No need

747
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,550
to worry.

748
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,320
Years at court

749
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,230
have honed

750
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,800
nothing

751
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,400
but my silver tongue.

752
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,640
Alternatively,

753
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,710
you can allow me

754
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,630
to take Noble Consort Hua

755
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,440
as a hostage.

756
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,670
If Prince Rui resists,

757
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,760
he becomes a traitor.

758
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,200
But

759
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,960
after that,

760
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,190
I demand

761
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,920
to remain

762
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,480
in power

763
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,030
until

764
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,280
I retire.

765
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,360
Eunuch Lin,

766
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,030
what do you think?

767
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,590
Success

768
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,190
makes all things

769
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,280
possible.

770
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,600
Guards.

771
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,920
Escort

772
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,920
Director

773
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,030
and Noble Consort Hua

774
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,400
to the gates.

775
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,600
Yes.

776
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,240
Wait.

777
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,840
Eunuch Lin,

778
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
persuasion

779
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,550
requires gravity.

780
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,880
Let me

781
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,590
compose myself

782
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,000
to show solemnity.

783
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,150
Besides,

784
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,960
if I go there like this,

785
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,000
it seems I've been coerced by you.

786
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,480
They won't believe me.

787
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,550
Please allow me

788
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,070
to prepare myself in the side chamber.

789
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,590
Just a moment.

790
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,800
Release me!

791
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,030
Mingshu!

792
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,870
Lu Chang!

793
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,510
Mingshu!

794
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,260
Retrieve half of the tiger tally

795
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,360
from Prince Rui's possession for me,

796
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,680
and I may

797
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,400
spare her life.

798
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:10,870
Lu Chang...

799
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,510
Prince Yu is wreaking havoc.

800
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,070
Cao Hai has slaughtered

801
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,190
the Jian Family for him.

802
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,550
If you care about me,

803
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,840
don't give in!

804
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,400
Otherwise, I'll never forgive you.

805
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Do you hear me?

806
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,120
Is that so?

807
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,960
