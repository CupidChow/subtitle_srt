28
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,920
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,680
Gao Shicai,

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,350
now I've come to see you myself.

31
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,550
Do I qualify

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,480
to interrogate you?

33
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,760
Your Highness, you're imperial nobility.

34
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,200
Of course you do.

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,400
To tell you the truth,

36
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,430
I had no intention of sparing you.

37
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,640
But Lu Chang advised me,

38
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,070
saying that you're merely

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,430
a disposable pawn in this game.

40
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,000
The true culprit lies behind you.

41
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,350
That's why I agreed

42
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,560
to give you a chance to live.

43
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,280
Do you mean it?

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,430
My word is bond.

45
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
Believe it or not.

46
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,360
But you should know

47
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,800
the Jian Family's case implicates dozens,

48
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,470
and Su Changhua's embezzlement

49
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,750
involves hundreds of lives.

50
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,360
The crimes warrant clan extermination.

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,800
You might as well

52
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,590
weigh your own worth

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,960
and see if you can bear the consequences.

54
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,870
Gao Shicai,

55
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,590
just tell us

56
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
if Prince Yu

57
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,520
instructed you to do this.

58
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,920
How do you know?

59
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,150
During Su Changhua's tenure in Jianglin,

60
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,590
he secretly investigated some local officials.

61
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,310
They embezzled, perverted the law,

62
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,560
and exploited the people,

63
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,120
yet evaded justice due to their

64
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,590
powerful networks and factional alliances.

65
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,280
Without exception,

66
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,680
they opposed the reforms.

67
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,360
His Majesty hesitated to initiate reforms,

68
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,800
even banning discussions about them.

69
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,750
If Su had reported how the officials

70
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,960
exploited loopholes in the old system

71
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,190
and undermined the state's integrity,

72
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,710
His Majesty would've recognized its flaws.

73
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,870
It would've reignited debates on the reforms,

74
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,560
forcing His Majesty to commit to reform.

75
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,000
As a defender of the old system,

76
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,960
Prince Yu wouldn't stand by.

77
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,190
He must eliminate Su to smother

78
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,190
any chance of the reforms' revival.

79
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,680
Before Su died,

80
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,710
he entrusted the evidence

81
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,000
of the officials' crimes to Jian Jinhai.

82
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,310
That's why the Jian Family was massacred.

83
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,080
When you failed to find the evidence,

84
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,560
you relentlessly hunted and tried to

85
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,150
wipe out Jian Jinhai's daughter,

86
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,150
Jian Mingshu.

87
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,190
Your account is flawless.

88
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,480
No wonder a prized disciple of Su Changhua.

89
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,560
Do you know the identity of the black-cloaked

90
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,070
masked assassin who tried to kill you?

91
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
I don't know his true identity.

92
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,510
I only know

93
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,360
he is deeply trusted by Prince Yu.

94
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,000
He relayed Prince Yu's every order.

95
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,680
The massacre and Jian Mingshu's assassination

96
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,000
were all his doing.

97
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,200
Your Highness,

98
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,000
I've told you everything.

99
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,000
Would you

100
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,560
spare my life?

101
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,310
Gao Shicai,

102
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,560
are you trying to negotiate with me?

103
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,950
Show your bargaining chips.

104
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,750
Su Changhua took up the position of prefect

105
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,160
in order to gather evidence

106
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,750
of Prince Yu's faction's corruption.

107
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,920
When Prince Yu learned of this,

108
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,920
he ordered me, Wei Xian, and Lu Zegang

109
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,510
to frame Su for embezzling relief funds.

110
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,000
He also coerced Clerk Liu

111
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,000
into false testimony to ensure Su's death.

112
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,270
We've survived the officialdom this long.

113
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,390
We know once the birds are killed,

114
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,360
the bow will be put away.

115
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,310
How could we not take any precautions?

116
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,480
Do you have evidence against Prince Yu?

117
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,390
After His Majesty ordered

118
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,920
to reopen Su Changhua's case,

119
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Wei Xian was killed.

120
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,680
Prince Yu clearly silenced him.

121
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,160
Where is the evidence?

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,840
Your Highness,

123
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,800
I aided the evildoer and framed the upright.

124
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,160
I deserve to die.

125
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,360
But my family knew nothing.

126
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,800
They're innocent.

127
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,630
Your Highness,

128
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,560
please spare their lives.

129
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,040
I'll submit

130
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,950
to any punishment.

131
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,720
You are ruthless

132
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,270
and have committed countless evils,

133
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,360
yet you care for your family.

134
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,710
Fine.

135
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,720
Testify against Prince Yu,

136
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,190
and I'll ensure their safety.

137
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

138
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,120
I have ledgers

139
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,600
documenting Prince Yu's embezzlement

140
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,310
of Jianglin's taxes and military supplies.

141
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,750
I hid them in the capital.

142
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,350
Moreover,

143
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,560
as far as I know,

144
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Lu Zegang holds

145
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,720
critical evidence on Su Changhua's case.

146
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,680
He's long wished to defect to Your Highness.

147
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,880
I,

148
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,310
I can persuade him to surrender the evidence.

149
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,760
Lu Chang,

150
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,560
keep Gao Shicai safe

151
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,800
and escort him to the capital in three days.

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,840
Yes.

153
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,880
Your Highness.

154
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,350
Reviewer Lu.

155
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,310
Prince Yu's influence

156
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,750
runs deeper than we imagined.

157
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,950
Why do you say that?

158
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,750
After Jian Jinhai got the evidence,

159
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,310
he wrote to Lu Wenhan to appeal for justice.

160
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,560
But Lu Wenhan stood by

161
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,950
and watched Su Changhua die unjustly.

162
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,950
This proves

163
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,870
others in the court knew of the case,

164
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,120
not just us.

165
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,920
But they all chose to keep silent,

166
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,830
fearing

167
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,000
Prince Yu's power.

168
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,590
Sir,

169
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,310
I didn't expect that after you passed away,

170
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,310
you left such a great help for me.

171
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,790
Lu Chang,

172
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,000
from this day forth,

173
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,190
will you join me in uncovering the truth

174
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,070
and restoring the reforms?

175
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,870
Born of humble origin,

176
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,270
I've seen the suffering of every class.

177
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,480
Our realm's

178
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,070
apparent peace

179
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,920
masks internal decay, external threats,

180
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,160
and numerous drawbacks,

181
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,750
all festering under the outdated system.

182
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,360
Without swift reform to correct this course,

183
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,080
the nation's foundations will crumble.

184
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,910
Thus, the reforms are vital.

185
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,960
I pledge my utmost to aid Your Highness

186
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,200
in implementing the reforms,

187
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,600
to honor my late mentor's spirit

188
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,960
and pacify the people's hearts.

189
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,150
Even if it costs my life,

190
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,790
I will never waver.

191
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,600
You're the right-hand man Mr. Su left to me.

192
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,240
Together, we'll face

193
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,120
whatever comes

194
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,360
without fear.

195
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,550
The case has progressed,

196
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,550
yet you're frowning.

197
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,150
What's happened now?

198
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,960
According to Gao Shicai,

199
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,870
Lu Wenhan could've aided my mentor,

200
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,790
but he chose to stand by.

201
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,030
The court

202
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,910
is full of bystanders

203
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,320
clinging to self-preservation.

204
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,350
Moreover,

205
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,870
you haven't acknowledged your blood ties.

206
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,510
Don't dwell on it.

207
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,360
But his inaction

208
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,150
led to Jian Jinhai's death indirectly.

209
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,480
After all, he's my biological father.

210
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,550
When we return to the capital,

211
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,960
how will Mingshu face him?

212
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,200
How will I face her?

213
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,150
In my opinion,

214
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,510
she's much more clear-headed than you.

215
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,150
If she learns of this,

216
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,000
she'll scorn

217
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Director Lu,

218
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,870
but she won't blame you for it.

219
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,790
- But...
- Your care over-complicates things.

220
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,210
All right,

221
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,550
we're going to the night market tonight.

222
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,390
Stop sulking or you'll spoil the fun.

223
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,440
Smile.

224
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,360
- Great!
- Bravo!

225
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,630
Wonderful!

226
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,870
One more time!

227
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,130
Do it again!

228
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,620
Great!

229
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,550
Before coming, I heard there would be

230
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,480
a night market on the Beginning of Summer.

231
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,630
Everyone from nobles to street vendors

232
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,120
flocks there.

233
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,120
I was wondering

234
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,000
what kind of grandeur it would be.

235
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,270
Now from what I can see,

236
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,360
it rivals the capital itself.

237
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,550
The water town has a gentle elegance,

238
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,240
distinct from the capital's

239
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,550
austere majesty.

240
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,400
Nice!

241
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,220
Hurry over here!

242
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,900
The lanterns are stunning!

243
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,230
The lake's beautiful!

244
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,550
What are you looking at?

245
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,600
Someone's probably

246
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,720
been waiting here for you.

247
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,560
Hurry up and go.

248
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,750
Really?

249
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,480
Don't accuse me of ditching you later.

250
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,550
Who would?

251
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,080
You bolt back early recently

252
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,670
to meet your prince.

253
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,870
We're used to it.

254
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,960
Just go.

255
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,390
Go.

256
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,510
What are you looking at?

257
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,800
Just the scenery

258
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,720
in the distance.

259
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,670
I'll go talk to Qingzhao.

260
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,680
Qingzhao.

261
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
They're releasing sky lanterns over there.

262
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,720
Let's go and take a look.

263
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,080
Sure.

264
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,350
Let's go.

265
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,000
What's happening?

266
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,800
Take care, folks.

267
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,630
Hello,

268
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,960
care to buy a sky lantern?

269
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,240
Today is the Beginning of Summer.

270
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,000
Write your wishes on a lantern,

271
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,790
and they'll come true.

272
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,120
Let's buy one.

273
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,800
Ok.

274
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,900
(Carefree)

275
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,060
(Carefree and Joyful)

276
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,420
(Safe and Sound)

277
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,800
Mingshu,

278
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,030
may your days be carefree

279
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,790
and filled with peace and joy.

280
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,510
May we remain true companions,

281
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,150
sharing safety year after year.

282
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,660
(Carefree and Joyful)

283
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,580
(Safe and Sound)

284
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,580
(Carefree and Joyful)

285
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,510
Qingzhao,

286
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,150
I have something to tell you.

287
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,710
Mingshu.

288
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,590
Mingshu,

289
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,200
there are more interesting spots.

290
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,670
Let's explore elsewhere.

291
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,870
For years,

292
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,030
I've dreamed of a man in a black robe.

293
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,320
In my dream,

294
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,150
I'm attracted to him,

295
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,000
but I don't know who he is.

296
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,120
Since you wear black robes too,

297
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,360
so I...

298
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,320
So,

299
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,200
you mistook me for that black-robed man

300
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,870
from your dreams?

301
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,670
You've always been kind,

302
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,270
and I cherished our time together.

303
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,790
I thought it might be love,

304
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,150
but as we've spent more time together,

305
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,200
I've realized that it's not romantic.

306
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,590
Mingshu,

307
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,390
we've been through so much together.

308
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,750
I can feel your care and concern.

309
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,390
How can our true feelings

310
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,150
mean less

311
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,270
than some illusory dream?

312
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,800
The dream

313
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,790
may be illusory,

314
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,550
but feelings don't lie.

315
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,750
Now I know

316
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,630
who I'm really drawn to,

317
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,520
so I...

318
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,390
Mingshu,

319
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,350
don't say it.

320
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,280
You

321
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,870
just give me some more time.

322
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,720
I didn't realize

323
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,270
we had wandered so far.

324
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,080
Are you tired?

325
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,750
How about I carry you?

326
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,870
Really?

327
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,280
Hop on.

328
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,150
So beautiful!

329
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,910
But none compare to my wifey.

330
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,160
What did you call me?

331
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,110
Wifey.

332
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,390
That's how

333
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,160
husbands here address their wives.

334
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,790
Then what should I call you?

335
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,000
Hubby?

336
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,480
Hubby.

337
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,480
Wifey, keep it serious.

338
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,350
People will laugh at me.

339
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,350
Why?

340
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,030
Isn't this normal

341
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,200
for spouses?

342
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,160
I wish all the people of Da'an

343
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,720
could live in peace and prosperity.

344
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,680
My wifey's wish

345
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,920
is mine.

346
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,790
Every soul

347
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,680
has loved ones behind them.

348
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,670
I'll

349
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,070
try my best

350
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,160
to seek well-being for all the people

351
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,310
and let them share peace and prosperity.

352
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,800
I wish to walk side by side

353
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,200
with my wife

354
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,480
on this path.

355
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,160
Mr. Lu?

356
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,200
Why are you still in Jianglin?

357
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,350
You're here investigating the case,

358
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,960
so I'm waiting for the result.

359
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,160
Did Gao Shicai

360
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,200
reveal the mastermind?

361
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,350
I told you,

362
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,920
this isn't your concern.

363
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,070
It doesn't matter if you don't tell me.

364
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,510
When you take him to the capital,

365
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,270
you'll surely act against the mastermind.

366
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,270
By then,

367
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,510
I'll learn the truth regardless.

368
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,880
Then let me tell you something.

369
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,350
Prince Yu didn't help you kill Wei Xian

370
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,350
for your vengeance,

371
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,960
but to use your hand

372
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,320
in silencing

373
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,440
his loose ends.

374
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,750
Thank you for telling me.

375
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,510
I shall take my leave.

376
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,960
Did you not have a pleasant talk

377
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,590
with Lady Tangli?

378
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,880
You don't know.

379
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,590
Ever since the Songling Academy case,

380
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,750
she has defected to Prince Yu.

381
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,880
I already told her

382
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,000
he is the mastermind.

383
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,270
I don't know what she'll do.

384
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,200
With her nature,

385
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,590
she'd brave danger without hesitation.

386
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,350
That's true.

387
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,000
But I can't reason with her anymore.

388
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,960
I just hope she chooses wisely.

389
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,750
Is Su Tangli

390
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,000
the young lady from Jianglin

391
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,440
you've pined for all this time?

392
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,800
No.

393
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,440
No?

394
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,350
Then someone else?

395
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,680
Let me ask you something.

396
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,040
What?

397
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,750
You said our families were deeply connected.

398
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,030
Does that mean

399
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,680
we were close?

400
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
I guess so.

401
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,350
And you were really clingy.

402
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,000
Yong'an Alley is a rough place.

403
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,000
It's not for a precious young lady

404
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,110
like you to come.

405
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,750
Don't come again.

406
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,960
Where I go and where I don't go

407
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,270
is my own business.

408
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,590
I have my considerations.

409
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,720
Besides, I came to see Madam Zeng.

410
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,110
If she welcomes me,

411
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,590
no one can stop me.

412
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,400
You were not just clingy with me.

413
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,960
You pestered Mother to teach you embroidery.

414
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,110
I learned embroidery from Mother?

415
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,030
Her skills are unmatched.

416
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,400
Yet after all this time,

417
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,750
I'm not half as good?

418
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,160
Talent is innate.

419
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,960
You just lack it here.

420
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,350
Your explanation makes sense.

421
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,550
Then answer me,

422
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,550
if not

423
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,160
for Mr. Su's evidence,

424
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,400
would you still have sheltered me

425
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,480
when I fell off the cliff?

426
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,870
Of course.

427
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,390
Why?

428
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,000
I've told you before.

429
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,200
Your parents helped me.

430
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,510
We grew up together.

431
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,790
You're like a sister to me.

432
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,190
Is that all?

433
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,190
Well...

434
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,590
That's how things were back then,

435
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,920
but...

436
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
But what?

437
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,680
But it's really getting late.

438
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,240
Shouldn't you go back and sleep,

439
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,400
my dear young lady?

440
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,480
Not yet.

441
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,200
Tomorrow, we're heading back to the capital.

442
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,480
Do you remember

443
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,110
our last journey back?

444
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,830
Bandits on our heels,

445
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,920
peril at the inn,

446
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,640
we managed

447
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,270
to survive through all the dangers.

448
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,680
Now it feels like a dream.

449
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,520
True.

450
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,350
It's like a dream.

451
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,270
And that dream

452
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,070
has changed us both.

453
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,940
(Residence of Duke of the State)

454
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,630
Father.

455
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,870
Mother.

456
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,840
Son,

457
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,880
finally, you're home.

458
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,680
You left in such a hurry.

459
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
You have no idea how worried I was.

460
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,280
Qingzhao,

461
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,110
Hanlin Academy hadn't approved your leave,

462
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,240
yet you ran off.

463
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
I had to clean up your mess.

464
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,760
Tell me,

465
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,830
where are your discipline and manners?

466
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,590
Your reprimand is justified, Father.

467
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,110
I left with Prince Rui

468
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,270
in an emergency,

469
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,310
so I couldn't arrange formalities.

470
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,510
I beg your forgiveness.

471
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,110
Enough.

472
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,120
Look

473
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,550
how dust-covered and weary he is.

474
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,480
Let him have a rest first.

475
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,150
Fine.

476
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,950
Today,

477
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,200
you get some rest early.

478
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,520
Tomorrow,

479
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,000
attend duty promptly.

480
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,520
I'm not tired.

481
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,750
A quick wash, and I'll depart.

482
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,030
Why the haste?

483
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,030
You must be starving.

484
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,270
I'll make you your favorite Dongpo Stew.

485
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,400
Wait here.

486
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,440
Mother, don't bother.

487
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,240
I'm not hungry.

488
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,270
What do you think

489
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,440
is wrong with Qingzhao?

490
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,590
I feel like he's become a different man

491
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,030
since his return.

492
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,550
Could something have happened?

493
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,160
At least he takes his duties seriously.

494
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,640
He gets that from me.

495
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,830
You're too fixated on your own affairs

496
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,270
to notice your son's state of mind!

497
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,670
State...

498
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,350
State of mind?

499
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,080
Young Master,

500
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,430
are you ok?

501
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,640
Get me a pouch.

502
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,240
I'll wear it close to my body.

503
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,830
You're so devoted to Lady Lu.

504
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,640
If she isn't heartless,

505
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,200
how could she not be moved?

506
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,200
Love isn't about being moved.

507
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,510
Mingshu's heart lies elsewhere.

508
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,750
What can I do?

509
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,800
I'm clumsy with words

510
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,550
and not good at consoling people.

511
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,190
But I know

512
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,750
you're a very, very good man.

513
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,680
Even without Lady Lu,

514
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,640
you'll still get a worthy match.

515
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,920
I don't care about worthy matches.

516
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,200
I only care about Mingshu.

517
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,150
Young Master,

518
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,480
you...

519
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,680
I'm fine.

520
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,550
Don't tell Mother about this yet.

521
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,350
She cares about the marriage arrangement.

522
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,310
I don't want her to be upset.

523
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,750
We'll tell her

524
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,110
when the time's right.

525
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,070
Then, Young Master,

526
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,480
I'll fetch you a pouch.

527
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,060
(Top Scholar Residence)

528
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,190
Mother.

529
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,000
We're back.

530
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,440
Mother.

531
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,080
Mingshu.

532
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,160
I'm sorry.

533
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,480
Why apologize?

534
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,760
You have no idea

535
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,240
how happy I am

536
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,200
to hear you call me Mother.

537
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,070
I've never told you this,

538
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,070
but my

539
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,960
greatest dream

540
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,880
was to have a daughter like you.

541
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,790
These days,

542
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,030
you've made my dream real.

543
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,400
I should thank you,

544
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,240
shouldn't I?

545
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,200
Mother, what are you talking about?

546
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,480
You're the best mother,

547
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,550
and you'll always be my mother.

548
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,590
My sweet girl,

549
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,480
say no more.

550
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,070
My heart aches for you.

551
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,070
We're family.

552
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,070
Between family,

553
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,640
we don't need to dwell

554
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,240
on gratitude or guilt. Understand?

555
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,040
Your path ahead

556
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,920
may have

557
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,310
twists and turns.

558
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,240
I may not be able to help much.

559
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,880
I just want you to know

560
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,920
that no matter how far you go,

561
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,550
if you ever look back,

562
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,960
my eyes will always be on you.

563
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,070
Are you craving my cooking?

564
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,270
Name what you want,

565
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,400
and I'll make your favorite.

566
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,270
You know, it's good

567
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,200
that you're back.

568
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,080
Mother.

569
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,540
(Supreme Court)

570
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,960
The escort of Gao Shicai

571
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,350
(Crystalline Integrity)
went smoothly,

572
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,550
and nothing happened.

573
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,240
Has Prince Yu

574
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,070
chosen not to take action?

575
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,680
Prince Yu acts perversely

576
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,030
and is unpredictable.

577
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,510
Gao Shicai is an important witness.

578
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,070
Prince Yu must have countermeasures.

579
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,030
Keep Gao Shicai

580
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,590
under maximum security

581
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,350
and prohibit any contact with him

582
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,520
to avoid risks.

583
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,480
Relax.

584
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,550
The guards on duty

585
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,590
are our best.

586
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,270
Anything unusual?

587
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,320
All good.

588
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,480
Gao Shicai is compliant too.

589
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,590
Gao Shicai, what are you doing?

590
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,550
Why aren't you eating?

591
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,160
Open it.

592
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,000
Yes.

593
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,150
Gao Shicai!

594
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,240
Gao Shicai!

595
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,640
No, he's dead.

596
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,240
Go get that handyman.

597
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

598
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,680
No external injuries.

599
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,480
We've checked.

600
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,560
Toxicology's clean.

601
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,270
Killed by a silver needle through the brain.

602
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,150
Your Highness,

603
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,480
Gao Shicai is dead.

604
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,230
To challenge me,

605
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,800
Prince Rui is still too green.

606
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,630
Let this be his lesson.

607
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,400
No matter what,

608
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,760
Wei and Gao served Your Highness faithfully.

609
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:23,960
Wouldn't this

610
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,550
weaken your own forces?

611
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,120
At present,

612
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,920
Prince Rui's decision to clear

613
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,150
Su Changhua's name is inevitable.

614
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,590
Wei, Gao, and the others knew too much.

615
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,000
To prevent future troubles,

616
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,190
I must

617
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,960
strike first.

618
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,030
Hundreds of beasts serve as my meal.

619
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,510
Five dragons are my guests.

620
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,150
What a great painting of Tiger's March.

621
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,150
Where is Su Tangli?

622
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,440
I've checked.

623
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,670
She returned days ago,

624
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,360
but she hasn't come to see Your Highness.

625
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,550
Probably,

626
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,110
she's turned traitor.

627
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,840
She will come.

628
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,950
I've failed in my duty.

629
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,840
Please punish me, Your Highness.

630
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,760
Though I had arranged for strict guard,

631
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,110
there was still an unforgivable lapse

632
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,070
and a handyman breached our defenses.

633
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,710
Gao Shicai is dead.

634
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,110
Our plan to expose Prince Yu

635
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,320
must be put on hold.

636
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,870
Lu Chang,

637
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,070
I don't demand your apology.

638
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,430
I only

639
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,760
demand your solutions.

640
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,720
Rest assured, Your Highness.

641
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,280
I won't stop

642
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,670
until this case is closed.

643
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,710
I'll maintain utmost vigilance.

644
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,360
But as Gao Shicai warned,

645
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,990
Prince Yu's influence

646
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,920
is more formidable than we imagined.

647
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,880
He's quietly

648
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,320
infiltrated the Supreme Court.

649
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,590
This proves

650
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,480
we've struck his vital point.

651
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,670
If we can shake

652
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,110
the resolve of his supporters,

653
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,280
it might become an opportunity.

654
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,320
You mean

655
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,640
Lu Zegang?

656
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,550
With Wei Xian and Gao Shicai

657
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,110
both dead,

658
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,440
I don't believe that he'll remain idle.

659
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,700
(Confidential)

660
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,760
Minister Lu,

661
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,440
Mr. Gao has been murdered.

662
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,800
Before his death,

663
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,360
he instructed me

664
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,920
to deliver

665
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,220
his hidden evidence to you if anything

666
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,590
(List of Accounts)
happened to him.

667
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,590
You must avenge him,

668
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,680
Minister!

669
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,000
Don't worry.

670
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,880
I know what to do.

671
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,920
I'll never let Mr. Gao die in vain.

672
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,480
Thank you, Minister.

673
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,320
I shall take my leave.

674
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,800
Master, is this

675
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,550
the ledger proving Prince Yu's embezzlement?

676
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,620
(Prince Yu's Jianglin Embezzlement)

677
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,920
I kept Su Changhua's

678
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,920
signed testimony all along.

679
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,360
It details

680
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,510
how Prince Yu framed him.

681
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,920
With this ledger,

682
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,620
(Prince Yu's Jianglin Embezzlement)

683
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,230
we can fully corroborate his testimony.

684
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,320
Prince Yu has always been ruthless.

685
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,400
(Grand Ambitions)
With Wei and Gao dead,

686
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,840
he'll surely

687
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,800
come for me next.

688
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,320
I must swiftly ally with Prince Rui

689
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,190
and help him

690
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,150
overthrow Prince Yu.

691
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,110
You followed me to Jianglin without orders.

692
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,000
Did Prince Yu not punish you?

693
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,320
He rewarded me.

694
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,320
Old fox.

695
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,100
(Tablet of My Late Father Su Changhua)

696
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,720
The mansion is swarming with his spies.

697
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,670
Just an act.

698
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Don't worry.

699
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,710
Su Tangli, you've finally come to see me.

700
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,110
You made me wait so long.

701
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,630
I'll kill you!

702
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,320
Since you've returned,

703
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,320
why didn't you come to me earlier?

704
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,900
What's wrong?

705
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,070
After being apart for these days,

706
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,550
don't you miss me at all?

707
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
But I miss you so much.

708
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,190
You killed my father.

709
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,110
I want you to pay with your life!

710
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,320
Who told you that?

711
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,200
Lu Chang?

712
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,230
Lu Chang serves Prince Rui.

713
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,320
He's trying to use your hand

714
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,110
to eliminate me, his greatest threat.

715
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,800
Can't you see through such tactics?

716
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,110
Who's using me,

717
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,590
he or you?

718
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,880
The only reason you've stayed

719
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,760
by my side this long is because

720
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,510
I allowed it.

721
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,360
Is that so?

722
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,590
If you behave,

723
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,550
I'd gladly entrust my life

724
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,740
to you.

725
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,150
What more do you want?

726
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,000
Are you the killer?

727
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,360
You only know

728
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,070
what they want you to know!

729
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,070
If I

730
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,550
truly murdered your father,

731
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,110
would I dare to keep you close?

732
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,190
Do you think I'd risk

733
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,230
letting you kill me?

734
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,320
You can't bear to lose me, can you?

735
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,880
I beg you,

736
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,510
tell me

737
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,000
there's a place for me in your heart.

738
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,320
Your Highness,

739
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,550
my father died unjustly,

740
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,800
but I still don't know who murdered him.

741
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,240
I

742
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,630
really don't know what to do.

743
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,880
Trust me.

744
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,280
All you need to do is trust me.

745
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,780
(Supreme Court)

746
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,430
Please.

747
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:11,540
(Crystalline Integrity)

748
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,390
Reviewer Lu.

749
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,190
What brings the honorable Director Lu

750
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,150
to our Supreme Court?

751
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,070
Today,

752
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,840
I happened to pass by

753
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,480
while on business.

754
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,230
So I came in to see you.

755
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:34,550
Without official business,

756
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,670
you'd better visit less,

757
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,920
unless you want rumors

758
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,030
about involvement in major cases.

759
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,480
A descendant of the Lu Family works here.

760
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,710
Why shouldn't I visit?

761
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,480
I care nothing for rumors.

762
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,240
I know

763
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,800
you're talented

764
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,590
and wish to prove yourself

765
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,000
without relying on our family reputation.

766
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,110
But after all,

767
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,960
you have the blood of the Lu Family.

768
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,360
When I learned

769
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,670
that we had a descendant,

770
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,590
I was so relieved.

771
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,320
Lu Chang,

772
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,920
who you are

773
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,920
was decided

774
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,710
at your birth,

775
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:29,320
and no mortal escapes this truth.

776
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,480
Director Lu, you asked earlier

777
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,070
if I had any problems.

778
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,480
I do have one.

779
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,480
Would you please enlighten me?

780
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,150
Of course.

781
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,070
Speak freely.

782
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,920
When Prefect Su Changhua of Jianglin

783
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,360
was jailed for embezzlement,

784
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,760
Jian Jinhai, the city's richest man,

785
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,230
wrote to beg your help.

786
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:05,760
Did this happen?

787
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,360
It did.

788
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,400
Then why did you

789
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:13,750
turn a blind eye to it?
