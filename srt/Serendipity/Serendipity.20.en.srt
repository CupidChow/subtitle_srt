36

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,960
You got injured
because of me.

40
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,590
You also need fortune.

41
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,430
Good to see you back,
Buddy.

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,310
Here's the soup.

45

I'm too happy to
get tired today.

46
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,430
Mother, stop the work.

47
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,360
That's enough already.

48
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,560
Not yet.

49
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,240
I need to
welcome my son home

50
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,120
and wish
my daughter recover soon.

51
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,960
And you'll attend
Metropolitan Exam.

52
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,560
This brings you luck.

53
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,400
Wait a moment.

54
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,110
Mother must have been

55
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,310
worried about me.

56
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,030
Buddy,

57
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,470
Buddy,

58
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,670
be careful.

59
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,950
Mother was here.

60
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,070
I didn't dare to ask you.

61
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,630
How's your injury?
Has it recovered?

62
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,160
Do I look like
I'm in pain?

63
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,110
What about you?

64
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,830
Does it still hurt?

65
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,830
A little.

66
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,160
But it no longer did

67
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
the moment you came back.

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
How could you laugh?

69
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,390
I failed to protect you

70
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,680
since I was in jail.

71
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,600
I promise

72
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
you won't run into

73
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,040
such danger ever again.

74
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,070
But you should
take care of yourself.

75
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,030
Do you hear me?

76
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,200
Buddy,

77
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,240
I made some dreams

78
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,560
in the coma.

79
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,800
I dreamed of

80
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,800
a man

81
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,830
that cared
a lot about me.

82
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,920
I could even felt

83
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,510
his warmth in my dream.

84
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,830
He indulged me the way

85
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,870
just like

86
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,510
a loving father would.

87
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,270
But I couldn't
see his face.

88
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Would it be Father?

89
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,190
Perhaps.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,310
Or maybe just a dream.

91
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,830
I dreamed of you too.

92
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,560
Me?

93
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,390
You were

94
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,310
harsh to me.

95
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,920
You kicked me out
after I sent you food.

96
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,830
Luckily, just a dream.

97
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,950
You wouldn't do that
to me.

99

before.

101
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
I upset you.

102
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,360

103
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,040
What do you mean?

104
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,240
What?

105
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,680

Everyone can see that.

339
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,680
If you keep silent,

340
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,480
it's against reason
and sentiment.

341
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,400

342
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,510
whenever I am with him.

343
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,920
But I never think

344
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,790
about other stuff.

345
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,270
If you really like him,

346
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,400
I'll bring you together.

347
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,680
But if you hesitate,

348
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,110
you should keep distance

349
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,790
in case
he misunderstands you.

350
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,750
It'll bring him pain.

351
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,350

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,080

353
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,880

354
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,440
and will be
a good husband.

355
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,480

356
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,070
have a crush on him.

357
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,030
And I never have
a crush on him

358

on the guy in my dream.

361
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,520
After this tribulation,

362
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,790
I figure out one thing.

363
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,200
I can't lose Mingshu.

364
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,870
Absolutely not.

365
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,240
Well,

366
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,400
as your friend,

367
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,110
I support you.

368
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,920
But Mingshu
is your sister.

369
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,680
You acknowledged
it yourself.

370
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,520
What will you do?

371
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,720
I know.

372
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,790
I asked for the pain.

373
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,920
She said she dreamed
of the past.

374
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,000
I hope I can

375
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,510
restore her memory.

376
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,270
Then I can walk

377
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,270
to her openly.

00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,790
But you're her brother.

379
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,400
You guys
can't be together

380
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,240
unless you tell her
the truth.

381
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,630
No way.

382
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,200
If she knows

383
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,070
all her family
died miserably,

384
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,070
I don't know
what she'll do.

385
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,880
I can't take that risk.

386
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,760
Well,

387
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,880
tell her she was adopted.

388
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,550
After all,
she knows nothing

389
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,390
about her past.

390
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,070
This covers all bases!

391
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
No,

392
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,070
we should consider
her feelings.

393
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,110
I can't be so selfish.

394
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,270
Look at you,

395
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,480
you denied
all the proposals.

396
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,830
If you don't
stop hesitating,

397
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,640
Mingshu will choose Qingzhao
over you.

398
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,240
Then you'll regret.

399
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,920
If she's not
into Qingzhao,

400
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,920
I can take time
to look for a chance.

401
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,640
But on one premise,

402
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,000
not to hurt her.

403
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,020
(Hualang Pavilion)

404
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,270
Lady, come have a look.

405
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,320
This way.

406
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,910
Finally,

407
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,110
my cousin gave it
to you.

408
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,080
Mingshu,

409
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,440
I've wanted to ask you.

410
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,640
How do you feel

411
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,640
about my cousin?

412
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,640
I'm not sure.

413
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,480
He's very into you.

414
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,830
We all can tell.

415
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,640
He took great
care of you

416
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,830
when you were
in a coma.

417
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,070
That was touching.

418
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,880
If you can tie the knot,

419
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,510
we'll feel happy for you.

420
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,790
We wonder

421
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,030
what you're
concerned about.

422
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,720
Since we're friends,

423
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,640
I won't keep this
from you.

424
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,830
I treat Qingzhao

425
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,880
just as a friend.

426
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,830
Although I took marriage
into consideration,

427
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,790
for a second thought,

428
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,000
I don't have
a crush on him.

429
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,070
I shouldn't mistake

430
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,030
friendship for romance.

431
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,550
What do you think?

432
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,640
I'll go first.

433
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,880
If you're a couple,

434
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,550
you'll become my family.

435
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,110
But it's up to you

436
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,920
whether it'll work.

437
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,350
Even if you're not
my sister-in-law.

438
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,200
we're still besties.

439
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,590
Wen'an, thank you.

440
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,880
We'll support you

441
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,590
whatever decisions
you make.

442
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,750
Good to have you guys.

443
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,400
The charity sale
is undergoing.

444
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,480
Let's get back to work.

445
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,320
Mingshu.

446
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,350
Qing...

447
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,430
Qingzhao,

448
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,670
you're here.

449
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,440
I have something
to tell you.

450
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,110
We'll leave you

451
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,110
guys alone.

452
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
Qingzhao must be
very sad.

453
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,720
It's been dry
these days.

454
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,110
This is?

455
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,920
Since Madam Li
coughs a lot,

456
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,880
I made this soup for her.

457
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,870
Also for you.

458
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,270
Madam Li, come on.

459
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,000
Lady Zeng, don't mind it.

460
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,240
Her illness must
flare up again.

461
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,760
My bad.

462
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,200
Come on, Madam Li.

463
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,070
Have some soup.

464
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,590
Come on.

465
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,790
Have it while it's hot.

466
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,760
Come on.

467
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,720
Well...

468
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,310
She likes to be clean.

469
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,790
She's afraid to spill

470
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,070
soup on her clothes,
right?

471
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,270
I understand now.

472
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,270
No one else

473
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,510
but Lady Zeng

474
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,030
could be so careful.

475
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,480
Nothing worth mentioning.

476
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,030
Don't just stand there.

477
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,070
Have it.

478
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,830
We have to finish it.

479
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,270
Finish it all.

480
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,440
There's a lot.

481
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,880
Let's finish it.

482
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,280
Qingzhao,

483
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,030
thank you

484
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,880
for saving me

485
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,440
and taking care of me.

486
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,640
I know everything.

487
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,070
I really appreciate it.

488
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,190
Mingshu,

489
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,030
don't mention it.

490
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,000
One more thing.

491
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,280
This is

492
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,070
the hibiscus hairpin

493
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,030
you customized in
Hualang Pavilion.

494
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,790
I know it's valuable

495
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,680
and I can tell

496
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,920
the meaning
behind it.

497
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,630
But

498
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,160
I can't respond

499
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,070
to your feelings
for the moment.

500
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,480
Is it a no?

501
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,280
Qingzhao,

502
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,590
you're really nice.

503
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,750
I get along
with you.

504
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,480
But uh,

505
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,960
the thing between us

506
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,200
is not that thing.

507
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,160
Can I put it this way?

508
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,240
You like my character

509
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,640
and my company

510
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,160
but you're not sure

511
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,550
if we should
become lovers.

512
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,350
I'm sorry, Qingzhao.

513
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,270
You've done all this
but I...

514
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,320
I...

515
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,950
- I...
- Mingshu,

516
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,550
don't mistake gratitude
for love.

517
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,310
No pressure on this.

518
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,270
I won't force you

519
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,270
to make a decision.

520
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,000
We can get along

521
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,720
the way we used to.

522
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,270
You really think so?

523
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,400
If your heart
leans my way,

524
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,790
I'm blessed.

525
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,240
But if not,

526
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,480
I respect you.

527
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,880
I won't complain.

528
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,680
Thank you, Qingzhao.

529
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,520
Well...

530
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,480
Since I gave you this,

531
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,550
I can't take it back.

532
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,110
You can return it

533
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,400
whenever you meet

534
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,030
someone you like.

535
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,190
- Well...
- Mingshu.

536
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,920
Buddy, why are you here?

537
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,880
I'm here for you.

538
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,720
What's the matter?

539
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,800
We should

540
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,160
talk about it outside.

541
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,670
Mr. Song,

542
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,070
would us excuse us?

543
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,430
Excuse us.

544
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,840
Let's go.

545
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,680
Buddy, what is it?

546
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,070
Why don't you
tell me now?

547
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,880
I'm doing it.

548
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,680
You wanna hang out
with me?

549
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,390
Can't I?

550
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,720
As far as I know,

551
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,440
you don't like
hanging out.

552
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,590
As long as you like it.

553
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,350
I mean

554
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,880
I should spend
more time with you

555
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,640
since I was
too busy studying.

556
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,030
So many foods
and fun places here.

557
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,240
We can't miss them.

558
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,590
There's a
famous soup shop there.

559
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,320
Let's go have a try.

560
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,070
(He's so weird today.)

561
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,880
(Why is he holding
my hands?)

562
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,140
(Yizhan Liunian)

563
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,400
Here's the menu.

564
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,200
The ring cakes here
taste good.

565
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,060
I want ring cakes.

566
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,910
Okay.

567
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,960
And red bean soup.

568
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,880
Sure.

569
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,720
You came before?

570
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,590
I did, with Qingzhao.

571
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,750
Why would I choose
this shop?

572
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,790
Buddy, what did you say?

573
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
You said you wanted

574
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,550
to have a kind of soup.

575
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,270
Have you heard of
regret soup?

576
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,590
Regret soup?

577
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,880
If you drink this soup,

578
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,270
you can salvage
whatever you regret.

579
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,070
I never heard of this.

580
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,680
I don't believe it.

581
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,240
If you knew regret,
why act in haste?

582
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,440
In my opinion,

583
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,680
those who regret
should suffer

584
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
so that they can

585
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,880
remember the lesson.

586
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,070
(I paid
too dearly already.)

587
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,400
(Mingshu,
don't be too harsh.)

588
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,070
You agree, Buddy?

589
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,270
Yes.

590
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,350
Sir, would you still
want the soup?

591
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,240
No, thanks.

592
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,270
I'd like to order

593
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,480
some dimsum.

594
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,320
No problem.

595
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,040
Lady Zhu,

596
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,750
why is there
no music today?

597
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,240
The musician asked

598
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,080
for a leave today.

599
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,000
It's Phoenix Seeking.

600
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,400
This song brims with
profound emotion.

601
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,790
If I am right,

602
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,480
he's expressing
his feelings to you.

603
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,830
No way, he's my brother.

604
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,400
Sorry about it, Lady.

605
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,400
But I can tell
from the music

606
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,400
that your brother

607
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,200
is in love with someone.

608
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,910
Take your time.

609
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,750
Are you into a girl?

610
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,000
Mingshu,

611
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,310
have you thought about

612
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,550
not calling me Buddy?

613
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,310
How should I
call you then?

614
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,150
Call me

615
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,480
Chang

616
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,550
or Lu Chang.

617
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,750
Chang?

618
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,640
Chang.

619
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,540

632
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,680
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

633
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,320
Mother.

634
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,030
Mother, this is?

635
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,610
Uncle Wei,
who saved me.

636
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,270
Thank you for
saving my mother.

637
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,480
Don't mention it.

638
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,110
Since I've sent

639
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,240
your mother home,

640
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,440
I should go.

641
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,550
I'll visit you
another day.

642
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,880
He's exuberant
and eloquent.

643
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,270
Beauty rescued,
hero glorified.

644
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,440
This only happens
in stories.

645
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,550
You two even

646
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,200
make fun of me.

647
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,160
Will you support her

648
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,790
if Mother sees someone?

649
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,400
If she likes him,

650
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,160
I have nothing to say.

651
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,480
Why are you

652
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,720
so worked up about this?

653
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,580
(Announcement)

654
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,110
- Where's Mr. Lu?
- Mother.

655
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,720
This is him.

656
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,920
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

657
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,000
You achieved
the Huiyuan title.

658
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,140
(Announcement)

659
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,720
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

660
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,830
Thank you.

661
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,680
Did I hear it wrong?
He's Huiyuan?

662
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,640
That's true.

663
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,070
Mr. Lu won
the first place.

664
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,630
If you win
the Palace Examination,

665
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,000
you'll be Zhuangyuan.

666
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,150
Thank you, Officer.

667
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,100
- Thanks for you reward.
- Mother.

668
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,920
Chang,

669
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,480
just as you wish.

670
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,200
Buddy.

671
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,240
Master,

672
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,070
Master, if you

673
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,360
return home
reeking of alcohol,

674
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,110
Her Highness
will inquire you.

675
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,150
I'm happy.

676
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,720
More.

677
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,280
Whoever wins

678
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,360
will be over the moon.

679
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,510
But you lost much weight.

680
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,440
Obviously,
you're not happy.

681
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,800
You're drowning
sorrows in alcohol.

682
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,960
Mingshu is
my motivation.

683
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,760
If I can't marry her,

684
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,070
it's meaningless
to win.

685
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,070
Don't give up, Master.

686
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,280
Perhaps

687
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,440
Lady Mingshu

688
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,960
is playing
hard to get.

689
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,320
Mingshu won't do that.

690
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,710
I'm afraid she really
has no feeling for me.

691
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,920
You'll give up then?

692
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,030
No.

693
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,670
Master, think about it.

694
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,110
Besides Mr. Lu,

695
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,000
what other man could

696
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,470
be by
Lady Mingshu's side?

697
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,440
If Lady Mingshu is to
get married,

698
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,280
you'll be the first one
she'll recall.

699
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
You're right.

700
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,400
Despite the chance
is slim,

701
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,280
I won't ever give up.

702
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,150
I can no longer rely
on my family

703
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,000
only if I enter
government service.

704
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,710
If Mingshu is willing
to marry me,

705
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,360
I can marry her
with integrity.

706
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,670
That's right.

707
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,920
Since you're happy,

708
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,190
let's toast and enjoy!

709
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,880
We're done drinking.

710
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,720
Let's go home.

711
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,440
I'll go find Mingshu.

712
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,600
Well,

713
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,280
okay.

714
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,230
Buddy, you look charming,

715
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,710
way better than

716
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,840
the scions.

717
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,880
Luckily we didn't
go check the rankings.

718
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,900
Or else,

719
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,880
you'd have
been caught.

720
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,230
But it's said

721
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,670
marrying into
the official family

722
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,360
helps with the promotion.

723
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,920
I will never ever
use marriage

724
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,280
to exchange wealth
and career.

725
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,670
My wife is someone

726
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,710
who my heart belongs to

727
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,510
instead of a chip.

728
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,200
And?

729
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,230
Love is love.

730
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,810
Gratitude has nothing
to do with love.

731
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,920
Love doesn't bow
for worldly conventions

732
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,280
or change for fortune

733
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,190
and career.

734
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,710
Good. That's my brother.

735
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,150
I'll kick away whoever

736
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,360
wants to recruit you
as son-in-law.

737
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,830
You don't need
to do anything

738
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,320
when you're with me.

739
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,110
Just watch me.

740
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,510
It's been a while,
Mr. Song.

741
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,840
Congratulations on you!

742
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,400
Thank you, Madam Zeng.

743
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,510
They're in Chang's room.

744
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,680
Come with me.

745
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,030
And the size
of your neck.

746
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,670
Mr. Song is here.

747
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,280
Qingzhao,

748
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,110
I'm measuring
Buddy's size.

749
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,960
Have you prepared
the new clothes?

750
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,830
Would you like to
dine with us?

751
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,550
Sure.

752
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,670
Congrats! You're now
the tribute students!

753
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,360
An edict has
been issued

754
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,070
to appoint me
as Minister.

755
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,670
Congratulations,
Your Highness.

756
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,120
Mr. Lu,

757
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,800
you've been thinking

758
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,810
about exonerating
your mentor.

759
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,150
It's finally
within reach!

760
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,150
Thank you, Mr. Song.

761
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,030
Your Highness,

762
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,880
I have something important
to report.

763
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,480
May I talk with you
in private?

764
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,840
It's about
someone's privacy.

765
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,150
I'll tell Mr. Song

766
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,480
when the moment is right.

767
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,390
In that case,

768
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,280
I should leave.

769
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,390
I can go

770
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,550
help with
the charity sale.

771
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,800
Huaian.

772
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,660
(Hualang Pavilion)

773
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,360
What do you think
of the sale?

774
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,030
It's so bustling here.

775
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:53,880
It is.

776
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,110
I guess we've got
all the wives

777
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,950
gathered here.

778
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,800
It's the spring
planting season.

779
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,150
Farmers had no seeds
to plant last year.

780
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,280
Lady Mingshu proposed

781
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,150
organizing a charity sale

782
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,840
upon knowing about that.

783
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,550
All funds raised
will be recorded

784
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,840
to help the farmers
with planting.

785
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,070
It's beneficial to
the nation and people.

786
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,510
We should support it.

787
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,280
- Yes.
- Since it was approved

788
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,670
by Her Highness,
it must be worth a visit.

789
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,190
Let's go have a look.

790
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,280
All the funds
will be recorded.

791
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
- We shouldn't miss it.
- Indeed.

792
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,480
You should go
look around.

793
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,360
This way, please.

794
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
- Let's go.
- Please.

795
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,320
Look at this hairpin.

796
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,110
(Star Mark)
It's the newest style.

797
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,670
We have
the best craftsmanship

798
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,630
all over the capital.

799
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,470
Really?

800
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,800
Check this out.

801
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,510
It's stunning.

802
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,480
Look at the technique.

803
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,150
I'm sure Mingshu is short

804
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,480
of hands on the sale.

805
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,510
Let's go find her.

806
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,280
We haven't found her

807
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,720
but Master,

808
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,110
someone has
her eyes on you.

809
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,070
I didn't have the chance

810
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,320
to congratulate you,
Mr. Song.

811
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,480
Please forgive me.

812
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,880
Thank you.

813
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,840
But I have an errand
to run.

814
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,840
Would you excuse me?

815
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,280
Who does she think
she is?

816
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,400
The Jiangs dare to
covet Mr. Song.

817
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,800
Pearls evoke

818
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,360
the movement
of rolling waves.

819
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,670
What about this one?

820
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,070
It's nothing special.

821
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,590
Never mind.
Let me take a look.

822
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,320
Mr. Song.

823
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,160
Mingshu.

824
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,120
Qingzhao.

825
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,000
If you need any help,

826
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,480
just let me know.

827
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,360
I don't need help here.

828
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,280
If you have time,

829
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,440
go help Shujun.

830
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,550
She's over there.

831
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,680
No problem.

832
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,720
Well,

833
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,280
who is Lady Mingshu?

834
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,390
Wait a minute.

835
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,920
I have something
to ask you.

836
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,250
Please go ahead,
Your Highness.

837
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,880
About the death
of Mr. Su,

838
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,030
I didn't offer to help.

839
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,400
You've never complained
about me?

840
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,480
I have, to be honest.

841
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,150
What was in your mind?

842
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,510
My mentor was set up
but there was evidence.

843
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,280
If I begged for mercy,

844
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,960
it might intensify
palace divisions,

845
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,480
and trigger aggressive
countermeasures

846
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,760
by anti-reform factions.

847
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:37,000
My mentor took his life
to pacify the conflict,

848
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,590
preserving your strength
for the right moment.

849
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,720
Right.

850
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,480
My authority had
its limits that year.

851
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:47,950
Mr. Su was trying to

852
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,800
sacrifice himself to pave

853
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,030
a way for new policies.

854
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,030
Your Highness is committed
to clear his name.

855
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,000
If my mentor knew it,

856
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,800
he'd feel
deeply relieved.

857
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,720
Tell me

858
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:04,960
what it is

859
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,670
that you want to
tell me alone.

860
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,300
I beg your forgiveness,
Your Highness.

861
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,210
