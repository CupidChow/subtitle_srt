28
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,790
My Lady.

29
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,070
My Lady.

30
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,190
Where is His Highness?

31
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,430
He left for court at Yin hour.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,430
Next time he goes to court,

33
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,280
remember to wake me up
to help him change.

34
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,000
I need to act like
what I supposed to be.

35
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,400
He grants me freedom
within the residence,

36
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,430
so I must fulfill my duty as a consort.

37
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,680
This is a win-win thing.

38
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,840
Have you fulfilled your marriage
last night?

39
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,520
There's no need for that.

40
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,710
As long as he plays his role well,

41
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,550
that's enough.

42
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,240
Are you really not planning

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,280
to fulfill it with His Highness?

44
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,630
After all that has happened,

45
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,710
romance is hardly worth mentioning.

46
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,400
What a coincidence, Mr. Wensheng.

47
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,520
No wonder these days

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,870
you've been nowhere to be found.

49
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,120
So you were hiding here
at Songling Academy.

50
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,840
It hurts, it hurts!

51
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,960
Mr. Lu, that's not correct.

52
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,870
I have been studying here all along.

53
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,590
But seeing you here,

54
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,310
it seems your esteemed father
has made quite an effort.

55
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,150
It hurts!

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,680
Lu Chang,

57
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,750
you infiltrated my Lu family,

58
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,710
cutting off my path to patronage. Why?

59
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,870
Come, let's go see the magistrate.

60
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,920
OK then.

61
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,120
With my status
as a Prefectural Graduate,

62
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,710
I'll surely cause a huge stir in court.

63
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,750
By then, all the filthy deeds
you've done

64
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,190
will spread across every street
and alley.

65
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,560
Even Songling Academy won't be able
to keep you.

66
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,910
Have you thought about how to explain it
to your father?

67
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,750
You're truly cunning!

68
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,310
Mr. Lu,

69
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,960
I advise you not to waste

70
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,400
your father's good intentions.

71
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,400
Behave yourself and focus on
your studies.

72
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,590
Also,

73
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,390
the next time you see me,

74
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,600
if you dare to be so rude again,

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,960
I won't mind

76
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,510
teaching you a proper lesson.

77
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,400
Lu Chang,

78
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,920
just you wait!

79
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,110
Get lost!

80
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,750
I humbly congratulate you

81
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,480
on your wedding, My Lady.

82
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,800
I wish My Lady and His Highness

83
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,240
a hundred years of harmony
and early offspring.

84
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,870
What is this, Lu Mingshu?

85
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
If you keep talking like that,

86
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,120
I'll back out!

87
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,760
You mustn't!

88
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,920
Dear sister,

89
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,760
dear Shujun,

90
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,070
I have something good for you.

91
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,400
What is it?

92
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,120
These are the pair bracelets I designed.

93
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,750
It's my wedding gift to you.

94
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,880
Take a look.

95
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,190
It's just a political marriage,

96
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,190
yet you put so much thought
into blessing me.

97
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,920
But these bracelets are truly beautiful.

98
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,920
Mingshu, you're amazing!

99
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,000
It's not bad,

100
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,360
but at most, it's just some
clever handiwork.

101
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,480
(County Princess Wen'an)
But I don't see the decisiveness,

102
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,800
wit, and chivalrous spirit

103
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,160
you mentioned.

104
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,880
Is this young lady

105
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,000
really as impressive as you say?

106
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,310
And this lady is?

107
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,120
Mingshu, let me introduce you.

108
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,070
This is my close friend,

109
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
the County Princess Wen'an.

110
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,830
She's also a cousin of Mr. Song.

111
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,000
Greetings, My Lady.

112
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,000
No need for formalities.

113
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,920
Actually, she came here today

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,680
to ask you for a favor.

115
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,390
You handled the matter

116
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,000
of the Yin family well.

117
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,750
I admire your independent judgment,

118
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,270
your refusal to blindly

119
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,720
go with the flow.

120
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,680
You flatter me.

121
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,600
If there's anything you need,

122
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,510
please feel free to say it.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,480
Please help me investigate someone.

124
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,960
Investigate someone?

125
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,600
Forgive my bluntness,

126
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,920
but you, My Lady,
were raised in the capital,

127
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,950
with a noble family background.

128
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,920
Whether in terms of connections
or means,

129
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,000
you surpass me greatly.

130
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,720
I've only just arrived in the capital,

131
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,680
and matters like investigations...

132
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,510
If I'm asking you to investigate,

133
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,750
there's naturally a reason.

134
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,510
You're asking for help,
yet you're yelling?

135
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,800
Mingshu, she's just impatient,

136
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
don't mind her.

137
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,040
What's truly bothering her

138
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,120
is her engagement.

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,830
She was betrothed three years ago
to Xie Xi,

140
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,600
the eldest son of Marquis Yongqing.

141
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,830
She's set to marry him next year.

142
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,680
Xie Xi is said to be gentle, talented,

143
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,040
and possesses excellent character.

144
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,750
He's considered an ideal husband.

145
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,630
Doesn't sound like there's a problem.

146
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,040
Everyone says there's no problem,

147
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,390
but I just feel something's wrong.

148
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,040
Why do you think so?

149
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,750
But Xie Xi has always obeyed
your every word.

150
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,430
You said he no longer
treats you as he did before,

151
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,430
yet everyone told you

152
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,360
to stop making trouble.

153
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,000
Though I didn't fully understand,

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,240
I was afraid of misunderstanding her,

155
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,160
so I agreed to let her
investigate him in secret.

156
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,430
But after following Xie Xi
for more than half a year,

157
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,680
there's been no findings at all.

158
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,750
Now even I'm starting to wonder

159
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,000
if you're making a fuss over nothing.

160
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,190
How could even you not believe me?

161
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,000
It's not that I don't believe you.

162
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,480
Then explain clearly:

163
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,720
why do you suspect him?

164
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,270
I can't say exactly why.

165
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,270
It's just a feeling. Understand?

166
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,600
Calm down, My Lady.

167
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,070
Think carefully:

168
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,600
why would you have such a feeling?

169
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
Xie Xi has always

170
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,480
been tolerant with me.

171
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,920
Even when I throw tantrums,

172
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,760
he still

173
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,040
treats me with patience.

174
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,830
That's why my parents

175
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,270
are pleased with this engagement.

176
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,430
But, since last year,

177
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,390
I always feel something's wrong.

178
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,070
Even though

179
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,630
he remains courteous and respectful,

180
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,190
sometimes, there's a thin line

181
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,720
between politeness and distance.

182
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,630
You suspect he has someone else
in his heart?

183
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,720
When choosing a husband, I do not seek

184
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,120
high status or immense wealth,

185
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,510
but I must have a man
of noble character,

186
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,720
faithful and unwavering.

187
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,960
Xie Xi knows well

188
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,000
what I expect of him.

189
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,870
But if he's had

190
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,910
a change of heart

191
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,720
and continues to deceive me,

192
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,870
then he must have another agenda.

193
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,510
I would never marry

194
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,440
a hypocritical villain
with ulterior motives.

195
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,110
My Lady,

196
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,910
I understand your concern.

197
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,080
I'm willing to help you.

198
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,440
Really?

199
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,840
I have always despised

200
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,680
those who are fickle

201
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,840
and toy with sincere feelings.

202
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,120
Besides, by doing this,

203
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,840
you're taking responsibility
for your own happiness.

204
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,510
It's better to find out before marriage

205
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,270
than to regret it afterward,

206
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,110
right?

207
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,710
I support you.

208
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,840
You are indeed, as Shujun said,

209
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,720
a loyal and righteous friend
worth trusting.

210
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,240
No matter what you find out,

211
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,480
I'll be grateful to you.

212
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,270
My Lady, you are too kind.

213
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,230
By the way,

214
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,870
Xie Xi will attend
the Wine Tasting event

215
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,320
before the Metropolitan Exam tomorrow.

216
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll arrange for you to meet him there.

217
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,440
I was planning to attend
that event anyway.

218
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,390
I'll do as you say.

219
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,200
The Wine Tasting event will be bustling.

220
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,840
All the young ladies of the capital

221
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,480
will go there to admire the gentlemen.

222
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,080
If you're going,

223
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,030
you must dress up nicely.

224
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,910
You plan to use the Wine Tasting event

225
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
to help Mr. Lu.

226
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,120
Mr. Lu is full of talent.

227
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,320
If he can showcase a little of it

228
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
at the event,

229
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,510
he will surely rise to fame
in the capital.

230
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,440
And with so many noble ladies
gathering today,

231
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
if I can help Mr. Lu find a good match,

232
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,760
it will benefit my future interactions
with Mingshu.

233
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,030
Impressive.

234
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,120
From what I see,

235
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,270
she only has a budding affection
for Mr. Song.

236
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
(Jinzun Restaurant)
She hasn't truly fallen for him yet.

237
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,300
Please come in.

238
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,350
Since you...

239
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,200
You mustn't let her fall for
someone else.

240
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,320
This way, miss.

241
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,160
No matter what,

242
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,630
as long as she feels happy and blessed,

243
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,360
- that's enough.
- This way, ladies.

244
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,680
That's all I have to say.

245
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,440
I still have official duties
to attend to.

246
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,510
From here on,

247
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,720
it's up to you.

248
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,760
This way, miss.

249
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,820
(Jinzun Restaurant)
Mr. Lu,

250
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,680
why don't you get inside?

251
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,390
I'm waiting for Mingshu.

252
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,240
I'll wait with you.

253
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,750
Mr. Lu,

254
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,490
I know you view the Wine Tasting event

255
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,440
as a vanity fair,

256
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,600
but its influence is far beyond
what you imagine.

257
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,450
This way, sir.

258
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,510
You can make a name for yourself
by winning,

259
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,390
and be favored by the noble ladies, becoming

260
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
an ideal husband candidate.

261
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,550
In that case,

262
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,120
- you must give it your all
- Please come in, miss.

263
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,360
and seize the top prize.

264
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,550
I only wish to accompany my sister

265
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,390
and experience the event.

266
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,720
I can accompany her too.

267
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,510
Today's opportunity is rare.

268
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,670
You must make connections for

269
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,750
your future prospects.

270
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,270
Mr. Song, you really

271
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,320
have put in so much effort for me.

272
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,080
Brother.

Thank you.

286
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,790
Brother, what's wrong?

287
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,320
Your outfit today

288
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,790
suits you very well.

289
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,600
You know how to say sweet words now.

290
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,960
I'll take it as a compliment from you.

291
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,270
You really should advise your brother.

292
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,440
I urged him to make more acquaintances,

293
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,120
but he remains unmoved, only thinking about

294
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,320
taking care of you.

295
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,150
Brother, you should
tend to your own matters.

296
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,510
I can follow Qingzhao.

297
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,280
It's fine.

298
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,800
Have you

299
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,200
embroidered green bamboo

300
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,510
on every outfit of your?

301
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,590
Let's go in.

302
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,300
(Jinzun Restaurant)

303
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,510
The Wine Tasting event is a way
for the taverns

304
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,480
to attract customers

305
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,910
when opening new batches of wine.

306
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,200
The attending scholars compete

307
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,240
by composing poetry and couplets
to determine the winner.

308
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,790
The winner gets to choose
a barrel of wine

309
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,670
to inscribe a poem on.

310
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,280
(Luming Banquet)
Afterwards, the others

311
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,510
choose their wine and compose poems.

312
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,550
(Junzitai)

313
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,550
These wine barrels

314
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,160
(Tianchun Wine)
must not be opened before the exams.

315
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,080
After the exam, the wine
the top scorer chose

316
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,000
will be celebrated as
the "Top Scholar's Wine,"

317
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,550
(Dongting Spring)
and the tavern

318
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,870
(Jingting Pavilion)
will also gain fame.

319
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,790
Thus, the scholar most likely to win

320
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,200
will be highly sought after
by the taverns.

321
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,840
It's inevitable that people
pursue fame and profit.

322
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,910
That's why I urged you

323
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,960
not to miss the chance
to showcase your talents.

324
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,390
My brother doesn't care
about empty fame.

325
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,440
But sometimes,a bit of fame

326
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,030
makes it easier to navigate the capital.

327
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,840
That's Mr. Song.

328
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,120
He'll definitely be the top scholar
this year.

329
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,360
Such a handsome gentleman!

330
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,920
Qingzhao,

331
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,600
everyone's looking at you.

332
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,720
But the one I care about isn't them.

333
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,240
I'll go take a look there.

334
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,190
Sir, come try our wine!

335
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,420
Miss, our new wine!

336
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,120
Sir, sir,

337
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,670
can you come try

338
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,790
our wine?

339
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,390
Where is it?

340
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,350
Over there.

341
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,680
Have a seat.

342
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,720
Can I try your wine?

343
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,600
Alright.

344
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,200
Please.

345
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,590
Thank you.

346
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,670
The wine is thick,

347
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,480
sweet and mellow.

348
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,360
It's a fine wine.

349
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Does this wine have a name?

350
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,600
Our humble shop is unknown,

351
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
no one asks about it.

352
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,150
This wine is brewed from pine pollen,

353
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,910
and has no name.

354
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,240
An unknown man drinking unknown wine,

355
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,390
how fitting.

356
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,630
You are no ordinary person.

357
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,990
Sir.

358
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,030
Sir, please try mine!

359
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,870
Mr. Xie is here!

360
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,960
- Mr. Xie!
- Mr. Xie!

361
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,230
Mr. Xie!

362
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,030
Gentlemen.

363
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,510
And this is?

364
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,750
He is Xie Xi,
the son of Marquis Yongqing,

365
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,360
and a hot favorite to top

366
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,480
this year's spring exam.

367
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,630
However, he's already

368
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,320
- engaged to County Princess.
- Not at all, not at all.

369
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,360
(Xie Xi)
So he's already occupied.

370
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,120
I heard Shujun mention this.

371
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,390
In your opinion,

372
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,030
is he worthy of the county princess?

373
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,550
He's indeed a hot contender

374
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,550
for the top scorer this year.

375
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,200
He has great talent and character,

376
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,120
and he's quite respected
among his peers.

377
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,240
Both the headmaster and the tutors value him.

378
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,390
He is a fine match.

379
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,200
Mr. Song is here.

380
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,550
Mr. Song! Mr. Song!

381
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,360
- Please try our wine!
- No, no,

382
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,960
thank you, thank you.

383
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,320
It's rich in fragrance.

384
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,240
Thank you, everyone.

385
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,320
Where's Brother?

386
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
Have a taste.

387
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,360
Mr. Xie, Mr. Xie,

388
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,480
try our wine!

389
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,870
Ours is better!

390
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:03,720
Mr. Xie,

391
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,350
come try our Tianzhong Wine!

392
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,350
This wine has excellent flavor.

393
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,840
- Then I'll have a taste.
- Ours is good too!

394
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,110
What about another drink?

395
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:10,950
Brother!

396
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,160
I thought you forgot me.

397
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,160
Those people only know
to fawn over power,

398
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,400
blind to true talent.

399
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,720
I'm afraid you

400
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,040
might feel hurt.

401
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,960
I am drinking and chatting happily

402
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,000
with the old gentlemen.

403
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,880
No need to worry about that.

404
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,080
It's starting, Brother!

405
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,080
It is time.

406
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,190
I hereby announce

407
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,280
the start of the

408
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,510
Wine Tasting event.

409
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,880
Everyone,

410
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,750
this year's gathering is hosted
by my Jinzun Restaurant.

411
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,720
It is my honor to have the privilege.

412
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,160
Talented scholars

413
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,270
from all over

414
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,680
have answered the invitation,

415
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,310
bringing great honor
to Jinzun Restaurant.

416
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,750
- Well said!
- Well said!

417
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,310
Everyone, please look,

418
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,680
this golden goblet was crafted

419
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,070
at great expense by us.

420
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,350
Later, the winner of the poetry contest

421
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,400
will take home the golden goblet.

422
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,310
The design of the goblet
follows ancient styles,

423
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,550
with patterns resembling
auspicious clouds.

424
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,350
If I place it in Hualang Pavilion,

425
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,070
it would certainly have special meaning.

426
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,270
Then, following tradition,

427
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,000
I, as the host, shall present
the first line.

428
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,160
Scholars, listen carefully:

429
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,790
Feasts start by will,

430
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,880
yet end beyond will;

431
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,480
Partings and meetings,

432
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,070
best be lightly borne.

433
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,920
What a line!

434
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,110
Easy to say,

435
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,950
hard to do.

436
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,070
Fine wine stirs the soul,

437
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,070
its fragrance stirs the soul;

438
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,480
A lingering bouquet drifts from the cup.

439
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,000
Mr. Xie is truly talented!

440
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,960
Among all the talents in the world,

441
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,030
Mr. Xie must possess
eight tenths of them.

442
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,480
Mr. Xie, please give the next line.

443
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,240
(Luming Banquet)
Fine wine may ease all grief;

444
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,920
At such a feast,
none should bear sorrow.

445
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,310
At such a feast,
none should bear sorrow...

446
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,090
This is a really hard one.

447
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,750
Fair halls resemble painted scenes;

448
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,200
All who lean on the rail
seem part of the picture.

449
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,510
- Excellent!
- Really excellent!

450
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,440
Mr. Song

451
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,510
is indeed full of talent!

452
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,400
Now, Mr. Song, please present
the next challenge.

453
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,440
Today, fine wines are gathered together.

454
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,920
Let us dispel our worries in drink!

455
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,790
Please listen to the next couplet:

456
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,400
Within a pot, the world concealed;

457
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,110
With skill and ease,
the blade moves free.

458
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,440
Laugh, as butchers find their peace
in quiet retreat.

459
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,350
- Great!
- Excellent!

460
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,250
What a brilliant line!

461
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,480
We've long heard of
Mr. Song's extraordinary talents;

462
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,680
today we finally see it for ourselves.

463
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,110
Truly deserving of his reputation.

464
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,160
He has both family background
and talent.

465
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,350
It seems Mr. Song will surely

466
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,030
come out on top in the spring exam.

467
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
Indeed.

468
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,160
Is there anyone

469
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,310
who can match Mr. Song's couplet?

470
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,480
Brother, why don't you step up?

471
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,590
Are you afraid to lose to Mr. Song?

472
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,880
Of course not.

473
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,000
It's just a matter of hollow fame.

474
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,480
Even if it's hollow fame,

475
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,880
I still wish for you to fight for it.

476
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,350
Here are nothing but
sons of noble houses.

477
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,160
I want you to stand out,

478
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,030
to inspire scholars from humble origins.

479
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,110
Even if you don't take first place,

480
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,790
you will surely surpass
most of them here.

481
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,160
You're right.

482
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,680
Then I shall represent
the sons of humble families

483
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,070
and compete against

484
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,800
the noble sons.

485
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,350
I am willing to try.

486
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,160
Mr. Lu, please.

487
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,110
Who is this person?

488
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,000
Mr. Lu?

489
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,070
This Mr. Lu is unheard of.

490
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,200
He must be of humble birth.

491
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,270
Daring to challenge Mr. Song,

492
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,200
how audacious.

493
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,880
If he fails, it'll be embarrassing.

494
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,910
Everyone, this is Lu Chang,

495
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,070
the Prefectural Graduate of Jianglin,

496
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,110
and my close friend.

497
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,510
The sun and moon abide through time;

498
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,480
Come, lift a cup and share our dreams.

499
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,920
Ask not who shall claim the crown.

500
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,790
- Nice lines!
- What a great match!

501
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,440
Really good.

502
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,070
Well said, Brother!

503
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,920
Mr. Lu's brilliance shines through,

504
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,160
rising from behind.

505
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,680
Mr. Lu, please present
the next challenge.

506
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,070
By a small lattice window,

507
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,720
the song ends, guests drunk;

508
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,680
A clear breeze joins the seats,
the bright moon leans on the eaves.

509
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,270
A year's fine scenes—pray you remember;

510
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,550
Ancient scents, ancient sights,
ancient names,

511
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,750
all fulfill the olden dreams.

512
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,550
Wearing green bamboo hats,
amid rushing rain and flying clouds;

513
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,750
With emerald eaves for halls,

514
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,790
and jade towers set for feasts.

515
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,510
Speaking of times old and new,
I return again;

516
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,880
Drunk on wind, drunk on moon,
drunk on wine—

517
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,310
yet better still, drunk at heart.

518
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,160
- Well done!
- Bravo!

519
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,880
What a thrill!

520
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,750
Mr. Lu, please continue
to present the challenge.

521
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,350
Mr. Song,

522
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,840
listen carefully.

523
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,440
A gathering to judge the wine,

524
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,820
a gathering to savor its soul;

525
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,110
At the judging, savor the soul of wine;

526
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,170
The gathering lives through ages,

527
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,400
the spirit of wine endures through time.

528
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,880
This upper line sounds simple,

529
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,160
but if you savor it carefully,

530
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,790
you'll find profound depth within.

531
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,720
- Yes.
- Indeed.

532
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,280
Everyone,

533
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,590
is there anyone who can match
Mr. Lu's couplet?

534
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,960
If not,

535
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,400
then Mr. Lu shall be the winner.

536
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,270
Even Mr. Song couldn't match it?

537
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,440
Even Mr. Song couldn't match it?

538
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,880
Mr. Lu's upper line

539
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,720
balances movement and stillness,

540
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,830
truly a masterpiece.

541
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,960
The words are familiar yet fresh,
and they fit the occasion.

542
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,200
I am dull-witted and unable to answer.

543
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,510
"the spirit of wine
endures through time." Nice!

544
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,920
I hereby announce,

545
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,030
today's winner is Mr. Lu!

546
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,240
- Good job!
- Congrats!

547
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,400
Mr. Lu.

548
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,850
- Please.
- Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

549
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,760
Everyone,

550
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,200
this golden goblet now
belongs to Mr. Lu.

551
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,030
Congratulations, Mr. Lu!

552
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,590
Thank you.

553
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,720
Mr. Lu,

554
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,270
which tavern's wine has caught your eye?

555
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,350
Please compose a poem for it.

556
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,110
I choose that one.

557
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,300
Why did he choose their wine?

558
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,590
(Lanzhi Wine, Drunken River Tower)
Grandpa, Mr. Lu has won!

559
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,440
He has won!

560
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,220
(Pine pollen)

561
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,220
(Tea)

562
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,680
Pine pollen infused in wine,
spring water brewed for tea,

563
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,110
sober beneath the bright moon,
drunk amidst the clear breeze.

564
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,000
What a poem!

565
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,980
Good!

566
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,660
(Lu Chang)

567
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,790
Mr. Lu, may I ask the name of this wine?

568
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,000
Drunken Pine Pollen.

569
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,630
Excellent!

570
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,950
Sir,

571
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,550
our restaurant will purchase
all your wine.

572
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,960
Later, we will settle the account
with you.

573
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,590
If Mr. Lu becomes the top scholar,

574
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,880
your wine will be crowned
the Top Scholar's Wine!

575
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,000
Thank you, Mr. Lu!

576
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,550
Thank you, Mr. Song!

577
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,030
Today's victory Mr. Lu

578
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,720
will surely inspire many scholars
from humble families

579
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,400
to march forward bravely.

580
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,510
I live among the common folk

581
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,640
and know the power of word of mouth.

582
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,480
Thank you, sir.

583
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,880
Do you mind

584
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,270
not winning today?

585
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,940
Exchanging couplets with Mr. Lu

586
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,440
was a great joy of life.

587
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,310
Seeing Mr. Lu display his talent,

588
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,400
I am delighted.

589
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,720
Thank you for thinking of my brother.

590
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,550
To have a friend like you

591
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,350
is truly a great blessing in life.

592
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,070
Mingshu, you are too kind.

593
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,030
Mr. Lu is also talented and virtuous,

594
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,920
truly outstanding.

595
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Mr. Lu is indeed full of talent.

596
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,720
Though of humble origins,
he is still worthy of marriage.

597
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,600
Indeed.

598
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,760
What do you mean "worthy of marriage"?

599
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,750
He may not even fancy you lot!

600
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,560
Let's go.

601
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,040
This is for you.

602
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,430
Thank you, Brother.

603
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,240
Today, Mr. Lu has taken the stage

604
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,070
and secured his place
among the noble ladies.

605
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,590
Lady Mingshu,

606
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,030
please come with me.

607
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,310
Though I didn't win today,

608
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,880
a tavern gifted me a bottle of
Rose Dew Wine.

609
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,310
This wine is mild,

610
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,830
perfect for you.

611
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,200
Early spring is still cold,

612
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,880
it's easy to catch a chill.

613
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,750
Be careful not to fall ill.

614
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,270
(Though Xie Xi's actions are intimate,)

615
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,920
(his manner remains proper
and gracious.)

616
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,240
Earlier, when you were on stage,

617
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,080
you had no idea

618
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,680
how the young ladies in the crowd

619
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,240
were looking at you.

620
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,480
Since you and I are already engaged,

621
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,880
no other woman will ever catch my eye.

622
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,710
However,

623
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,720
today's gathering is quite rowdy.

624
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,750
I fear someone may get drunk

625
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,720
and offend you.

626
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,840
So,

627
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,400
how about I escort you home early?

628
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,760
My Lady,

629
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,200
Mr. Xie's friends are outside asking

630
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,310
for him to come down to drink
and compose poetry.

631
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,680
Tell them to wait. Tell them

632
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,090
I'm attending to the County Princess.

633
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,250
Since we rarely get to see each other,

634
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,640
I wish to spend time with you.

635
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,480
Don't make them wait too long.

636
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,440
Go entertain them.

637
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,880
My carriage is right outside,

638
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,000
ready to leave at any time.

639
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,350
Very well.

640
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,480
Then I'll be downstairs.

641
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,400
If anything happens, just call for me.

642
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,310
Xie Xi is gentle and elegant,

643
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,590
and shows deep affection toward you,

644
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,640
unlike someone whose heart has changed.

645
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,240
He seems

646
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,240
like a flawless lover.

647
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,750
But there is no such thing
as true perfection!

648
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Either such flaws

649
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,550
have yet to be discovered by others,

650
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,040
or

651
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,880
the perfection itself
is but an illusion.

652
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,350
I understand what you mean.

653
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,240
Everyone harbors selfishness
and emotions.

654
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,830
But Mr. Xie

655
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,720
acts too flawlessly,

656
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,070
his emotions too rational,

657
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,160
not like true affection.

658
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,320
Exactly.

659
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,390
That's it.

660
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,790
Though he appears attentive toward me,

661
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,720
there's an indescribable
sense of calculation.

662
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,510
As if it were all premeditated.

663
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,400
I can't quite point out what's wrong,

664
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,680
but I just feel that something is off.

665
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,880
For instance, when he put clothes
on you—

666
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,680
this room clearly had a brazier burning.

667
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,000
Even in early spring,
it wasn't that cold.

668
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,440
It looked like concern,

669
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,720
but in truth,

670
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,680
it was a rehearsed move,

671
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,070
not heartfelt.

672
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,430
Yes.

673
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,480
Exactly like that.

674
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,310
But I've investigated him
for over half a year,

675
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,560
and I—

676
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,350
I've found nothing suspicious.

677
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,110
It leaves me at a complete loss.

678
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,550
He usually stays at the academy.

679
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,030
Have you checked the academy?

680
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,520
The academy?

681
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,750
What is there to investigate there?

682
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,720
It's full of men.

683
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,070
(It's all men...)

684
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,240
(How would I go about investigating?)

685
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,640
(Jinzun Restaurant)

686
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,480
Shishu.

687
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,480
Let me help.

688
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,070
How much did he drink?

689
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,200
How did he get so drunk?

690
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,720
Someone pulled him into a few rounds.

691
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,680
He drank too fast and couldn't hold it.

692
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,720
Mr. Lu, the gathering's over.

693
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,200
Let's head back to the academy.

694
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,000
This wine's not bad.

695
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,550
Where's Mingshu?

696
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,550
Mingshu...

697
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,240
Even drunk, he's thinking about Mingshu.

698
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,340
Let's go home.

699
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,030
Consort Rui sent a carriage for Mingshu.

700
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,240
Here, here,

701
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,800
easy.

702
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,280
Mr. Lu,

703
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,840
careful.

704
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,380
(Heaven Rewards Diligence)

705
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,480
Mr. Lu...

706
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,070
Does Mingshu

707
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,200
have any affection for me?

708
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,200
Mingshu...

709
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,950
Mingshu...

710
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,630
Mingshu...

711
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,030
Where's Mingshu?

712
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,240
She's already gone home.

713
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,840
Mingshu...

714
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:49,910
Drink some water.

715
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,280
Come on.

716
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,560
Mr. Lu...

717
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,520
Thank you.

718
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,570
Here, here.

719
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,630
Drink some water.

720
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,800
Mr. Lu.

721
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,110
Mr. Lu.

722
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,110
Are you feeling unwell?

723
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,390
It's mine.

724
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,950
It's yours?

725
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,350
It's mine.

726
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,910
What is yours?

727
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,110
It's mine.

728
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,320
Mr. Lu!

729
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,280
Mr. Lu! Mr. Lu!

730
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,670
Mr. Lu!

731
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,510
- It's mine.
- Mr. Lu.

732
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,910
It's mine.

733
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,510
Who would've thought

734
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,280
the scholarly, upright top scorer,

735
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,960
after a few drinks,
would be so troublesome?

736
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,480
Sometimes, the most dangerous place
is the safest.

737
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,350
What seems least likely

738
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,160
is often the hardest to detect.

739
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,550
The clue might just be
in Songling Academy.

740
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,070
What do you think?

741
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,110
However,

742
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,440
there's a difficulty for me.

743
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,400
If I go to the academy,

744
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,920
I'll have to live in the same place
as my brother.

745
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,770
That absolutely cannot happen!

746
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,920
You feel the same way, don't you?

747
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,390
What?

748
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,520
You...

749
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,350
You want to become his page?

750
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,200
But a page has to do chores!

751
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,240
You won't be able to handle it.

752
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,110
Those things won't be a problem for me.

753
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,350
I'll learn as I go.

754
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,480
But... does Mr. Lu know

755
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,160
about you entering the academy?

756
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,110
I know your purpose
for going to the academy.

757
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,960
But from what I know of Xie Xi,

758
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,590
he doesn't seem to be unfaithful.

759
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,630
He shows no unusual behavior
at the academy either.

760
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,240
Perhaps you should give up?

761
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,440
Xie Xi's conduct and demeanor

762
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,830
are too flawless.

763
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,590
But there's no such thing
as a perfect man.

764
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,190
I suspect Xie Xi
must be hiding something.

765
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,800
Since he's living at the academy,

766
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,070
the flaw must be hidden there.

767
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,630
I must go to the academy,

768
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,110
observe him up close,

769
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,840
and get to the bottom of this.

770
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,630
I know what you're concerned about.

771
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,760
I absolutely won't

772
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,550
cause you any trouble.

773
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,030
Aren't you worried that
I might tell Mr. Lu?

774
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,480
I trust you.

775
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,640
But...

776
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,120
Have some water.

777
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,680
Alright.

778
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,240
Wait, no,

779
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,840
then where should I go?

780
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,710
You don't look very well.

781
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Go back and rest for a few days.

782
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,870

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,630
- Mr. Song.
- Mr. Song.

786
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,150
This is your room?

787
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,160
Take a look.

788
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,840
Mingshu, since you're a girl,

789
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,320
you should stay in the inner room.

790
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,630
I'll study in the outer room.

791
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,760
You've already helped me a lot;

792
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,230
how could I trouble you further?

793
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,190
I'm just happy you're here;

794
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,200
there's no talk of trouble.

795
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,920
I've thought it through,

796
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,880
since I'm new here,

797
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,070
I need to quickly get familiar

798
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,190
with Xie Xi's daily routines.

799
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,690
That way, it'll be easier
for me to investigate.

800
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,190
Life at the academy is quite orderly.

801
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,550
The students rise at Mao hour

802
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,960
and recite texts for an hour.

803
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,290
Breakfast is at the third quarter
of the Mao hour.

804
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,030
Classes start at the Chen hour

805
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:22,960
and end by noon.

806
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,710
After that, students

807
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,480
do their assignments or self-study.

808
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,280
Some return to their rooms;
some go to the library.

809
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,960
I won't be able to enter Xie Xi's room,

810
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,110
so I'll observe him in class
and at the library.

811
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,360
Don't rush.

812
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,400
You've just arrived.

813
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,440
Get familiar with here first.

814
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,660
Come, let me show you something.

815
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,840
What is it?

816
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,510
Please sit.

817
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,550
What is it?

Look.

00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,420

I was afraid you'd be bored,

820
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,690
(Red Agate Phoenix Headpiece)
so I brought this

821
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,760
from the study at home.

822
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,030
I thought it might inspire you
in designing jewelry.

823
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,320
The illustrations are so beautiful.

824
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,800
This book is truly a rare find.

825
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,840
I'm glad you like it.

about me staying in the academy,

you mustn't tell my brother!

842

that when studying ancient works,

876

one should appreciate the essence,

877
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,400
rather than focusing on cleverness

or lavish ornamentation.
