(Jianglin Prefecture)

29
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,380
(Jianglin Prefecture)

30
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,720
Welcome, Reviewer Lu.

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,590
Greetings, Prefect Gao.

32
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,630
You honor me too much.

33
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,350
How dare I accept the courtesies
of the new top scholar?

34
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,230
This is overwhelming.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,950
I have long heard
of your triumphant success in the capital.

36
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,600
Although I'm stationed in Jianglin,

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,360
I rejoice in your achievements.

38
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,440
Prefect Gao, you flatter me.

39
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,440
I came to Jianglin

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,880
on Prince Rui's orders

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,550
to investigate the Jian Family massacre.

42
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,630
I trust that you will help us

43
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,910
close this case quickly.

44
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,750
But the bandits
who slaughtered the Jian Family

45
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,350
have already been executed on the spot.

46
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,350
Exactly why this case

47
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,440
remains in doubt.

48
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,240
At that time, you convicted

49
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,360
(Jianglin Prefecture)
the Jian Family of conspiring with bandits

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,630
years ago,

51
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,470
what was the evidence?

52
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,470
Those bandits were eliminated

53
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,880
after the massacre.

54
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,680
Were any confessions recorded?

55
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,030
All the matters raised by you
have been thoroughly documented.

56
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,040
Should you require them,

57
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,320
I can provide them for your review.

58
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,910
Don't worry.

59
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,800
I'll fully support

60
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,750
the Supreme Court's investigation.

61
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,320
Didn't I tell you to be careful?

62
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,910
Lu Chang's questions
about the Jian Family made you panic.

63
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,440
Do you want him to suspect me?

64
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,230
I dare not.

65
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,710
I only prepared answers

66
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,520
about Su Changhua's case,

67
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,840
never expecting him to ask

68
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,240
about the Jian Family massacre.

69
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,440
No one has mentioned

70
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,120
that case for years.

71
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,230
Nowadays, the Supreme Court
wants to check it.

72
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,280
If he finds out that
the case is related to us...

73
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,160
Enough!

74
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,510
He won't find anything.

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,600
Before I left Jianglin,

76
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,230
I asked Uncle Feng

77
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,050
to investigate
the Jian Family massacre in detail.

78
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,910
Any clues?

79
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,780
My father said the authorities
closed the case in a hurry,

80
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,680
and even the commoners

81
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,120
found it too horrible

82
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,880
to discuss.

83
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,040
It's truly difficult to find any clues.

84
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,240
However,

85
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,910
heaven rewards the diligent.

86
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,360
He found jade ornaments

87
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,230
in the market.

88
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,470
A former Jian servant

89
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,910
recognized them

90
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,990
as belonging to the ladies
of the Jian Family.

91
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,280
The case files mention that

92
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,750
all Jian Family's property
has been stolen

93
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,760
by bandits.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,280
These ornaments must be related to them.

95
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,600
Who sold them?

96
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,080
It was Gao Shicai's cousin, Gao Wan.

97
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,000
He used to wear

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,170
my late mentor's jade pendant,

99
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,110
and now trades
in Jian Family's belongings.

100
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,110
Clearly, Gao Shicai

101
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,760
has no control over his cousin.

102
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,910
Let's follow

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,880
this lead.

104
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,230
How will you proceed?

105
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,870
Gao Wan, dressed like that,

106
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,520
where are you going?

107
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,280
Reviewer Lu,

108
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,230
I know you're the celebrated

109
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,960
new top scholar,

110
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,960
but don't forget

111
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,800
I'm Prefect Gao's cousin.

112
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,910
You arrest me for no reason.

113
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,110
My cousin won't let you go!

114
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,550
Silence before Reviewer Lu!

115
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,470
For no reason?

116
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,520
If you are innocent,

117
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,520
why run in advance?

118
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,870
We've arrested merchants

119
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,310
from the Linlang Pavilion

120
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,760
who confessed that

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,870
you sold them

122
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,910
Jian Family's jewelry.

123
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,910
Where did you get them?

124
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,350
Speak the truth.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,080
Guards! 50 strokes.

126
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,870
Wait!

127
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,600
Spare me, Reviewer Lu. I'll confess.

128
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,190
I'll confess.

129
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,720
I was blinded by greed.

130
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,400
After the massacre, I heard that

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,640
there were many treasures in the house.

132
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,720
So I sent servants to steal them.

133
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,110
Reviewer Lu, if it's okay,

134
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,990
please punish me alone!

135
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,350
(Such a quick confession.)

136
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,960
(There must be secrets lurking beneath.)

137
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,200
Why do you

138
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,870
still see me?

139
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,680
I don't like you,

140
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,310
but you must understand that

141
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,310
losing one's family

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,520
feels like a bone-deep agony.

143
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,910
I think I know how you feel.

144
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,480
That's right.

145
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,670
Since Father's death,

146
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,760
pain and hatred

147
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,470
have burned me daily.

148
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,470
Every time I think about it,

149
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,550
I'm in pain.

150
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,910
Countless times

151
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,960
I've wished for death

152
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,840
to reunite me

153
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,430
with them.

154
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,910
But no.

155
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,280
With revenge unfulfilled
and injustice unresolved,

156
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,720
I have no face to meet them.

157
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,910
Jian Mingshu,

158
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,910
how fortunate you are.

159
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,520
You have no painful memories.

160
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,910
You can't feel the pain.

161
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,240
Why am I telling you this?

162
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,240
You remember nothing anyway.

163
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,480
That's why I want
to do soul-summoning rituals again.

164
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,840
Now that I know everything,

165
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,880
I don't want to live blindly.

166
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,240
I want to remember
the faces of my family

167
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,150
and my past, everything

168
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,030
that made me

169
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,710
Jian Mingshu.

170
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,430
But that foreign physician is dead.

171
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,760
Even if you try soul-summoning rituals,

172
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,120
there's no chance.

173
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,790
What's more,

174
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,440
your brother would never allow

175
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,360
such forbidden arts.

176
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,550
I won't give up.

177
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,120
I have to find the killers of my family

178
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,240
and avenge them.

179
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,960
Lu Chang!

180
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,910
What did you find?

181
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,480
Soon after we arrived at Jiang,

182
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
Madam Gao

183
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,190
brought Gao Wan's

184
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,720
Concubine Qiu

185
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,750
to live with her.

186
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,630
A few days later, they announced

187
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,880
Qiu's pregnancy.

188
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,790
After hearing this news,

189
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,750
Gao Wan, childless for years,

190
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,120
rejoiced.

191
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,720
But Gao Shicai

192
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,120
kept Qiu imprisoned.

193
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,430
On the night of Gao Wan's arrest,

194
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,950
Gao Shicai immediately

195
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,310
sent Qiu away.

196
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,070
Now she's missing.

197
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,670
It seems that Gao Shicai

198
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,640
is using the unborn child

199
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,360
to threaten Gao Wan.

200
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,070
Gao Wan will endure the punishment

201
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,120
to preserve his lineage.

202
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,430
That's true.

203
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,070
We must find Qiu as soon as possible

204
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
to remove his reluctance.

205
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,240
Then he'll reveal everything.

206
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,280
What are you drawing?

207
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,880
Mingshu blames herself for forgetting

208
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,430
the family's appearances.

209
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,950
I'm drawing them

210
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,710
to comfort her.

211
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,830
Who knew you had such tenderness?

212
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,500
(Tomb of Master Jian Jinhai, Jianglin)

213
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,520
These are your family portraits.

214
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,070
Though forgotten,

215
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,710
at least you should know them.

216
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,460
(Jian Jinhai)

217
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,260
(Tomb of Master Jian Jinhai, Jianglin)

218
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,640
These are

219
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,950
all drawn by you, right?

220
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,300
(Jian Jinhai)

221
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,710
Do I look

222
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,790
more like Mother?

223
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,280
Thank you, Buddy.

224
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,040
It's comforting

225
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,430
to know their faces.

226
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,240
The departed rest.

227
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,550
Now we can only

228
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,640
look forward.

229
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,400
(Tomb of Master Jian Jinhai, Jianglin)

230
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,480
Father, rest assured.

231
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,310
I will not drown in grief

232
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,070
nor waste

233
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,070
my second life.

234
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,640
I will catch the murderers

235
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,710
and avenge you.

236
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,710
On my next visit,

237
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,280
I'll restore your tombstone

238
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,310
and worship you properly.

239
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,660
(Tomb of Master Jian Jinhai, Jianglin)

240
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,710
We've found

241
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,910
Gao Wan's Concubine Qiu's whereabouts.

242
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,480
My investigation

243
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,240
shows no pregnancy.

244
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,120
So Gao Shicai is cheating Gao Wan.

245
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,390
He fabricated the child

246
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,670
to trick Gao Wan into taking the blame.

247
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,080
If Gao Wan learns

248
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,910
the truth of Gao Shicai's lies,

249
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,760
he might be able to tell the truth.

250
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,760
It's not that easy.

251
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,120
To convince him,

252
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,480
we need proof.

253
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,710
Can you save Qiu?

254
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,600
Gao Shicai is

255
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,430
watching her closely.

256
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,120
A violent rescue

257
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,160
would alert him.

258
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,040
All defenses have weaknesses.

259
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,640
Besides the guards,

260
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,040
who else attends Qiu?

261
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,760
Someone else?

262
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,120
There is a matron

263
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,720
who cares for her.

264
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
She's obsessed

265
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,390
with fried dough sticks from back alleys

266
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,000
and buys two at dawn.

267
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,880
Do you even know this?

268
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,430
Well...

269
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,520
Qiu isn't pregnant?

270
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,270
She...

271
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,870
Didn't the physician say
she was pregnant?

272
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,840
I've been serving around Qiu.

273
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,120
She's really not pregnant.

274
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,710
Last month, she menstruated.

275
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,510
Others might be deceived,

276
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,480
but not me.

277
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,070
My cousin deceived me?

278
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,480
Without deception,

279
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,880
how can you take his guilt

280
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,120
and die for him?

281
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,000
Die?

282
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,150
I only stole
the Jian Family's treasures.

283
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,950
A few years' imprisonment at worst!

284
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,310
They were

285
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,830
bandits' booty by the robbers.

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,950
It's stolen goods.

287
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,480
Besides, the Supreme Court suspects

288
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,430
collusion

289
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,160
between officials and bandits.

290
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,760
Selling them

291
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,360
makes you

292
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,910
an accomplice to both theft

293
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,670
and conspiracy.

294
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,830
Both are punishable

295
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,640
by death.

296
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,430
Gao Shicai!

297
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,190
You betrayed me! Demon!

298
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,640
We know

299
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,120
you only helped as a backup.

300
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,160
You can testify against him

301
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,910
for leniency.

302
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,590
But if you stay stubborn,

303
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,360
only death awaits you.

304
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,150
Reviewer Lu!

305
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,840
Reviewer Lu, I'm innocent.

306
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,720
Reviewer Lu,

307
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,190
please save me!

308
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,520
That depends

309
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,480
on your innocent evidence.

310
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,630
Yes!

311
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,720
I have proof!

312
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,710
Gao Shicai feared my embezzlement.

313
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,440
He personally wrote lists

314
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,040
whenever he gave me treasures to sell.

315
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,550
And...

316
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,120
I also kept ledgers

317
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,240
of all transactions!

(Law and Prudent Punishment)

319
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,590
The Supreme Court is investigating!

320
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,900
Who dares to obstruct?

321
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,580
(Supreme Court)

322
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,550
Search.

323
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,140
(Qinmin Hall)

324
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,820
(Law and Prudent Punishment)

325
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,900
(Law and Prudent Punishment)

326
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,510
Reviewer,

327
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,200
entire premises searched.

328
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,360
No sign of Gao Shicai.

329
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,630
As expected,

330
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,700
my mentor asked
for Jianglin officials' records

331
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,350
since he became the prefect.

332
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,830
He seemed to have prepared.

333
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,110
Although Mr. Su was from Jianglin,

334
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,070
most capital officials

335
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,240
avoid provincial posts.

336
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,400
Yet he requested to return

337
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,550
to investigate.

338
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,420
(Su Residence)

339

(Prudent Thought, Clear Discernment)

341
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,680
The current laws

342
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,020
deviate from the governance
of the ancient sage kings.

343
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,040
As the ancients said,

344
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,590
benevolent intentions

345
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,720
that don't benefit the people

346
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,040
are the result
of not following proper governance.

347
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,150
(This is my mentor's manuscript.)

348
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,520
(At that time, confiscators
overlooked this treasure.)

349
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,920
(Fortunately, it survived.)

(I vow to continue my mentor's reforms)

352
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,550
(and complete his unfinished work.)

353
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,310
Under Gao Shicai's orders,

354
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,820
Gao Wan sold most of the loot overseas.

355
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,040
Would they flee

356
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,360
by sea?

357
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,880
Here are market records of goods

358
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,790
and recent merchant fleets.

359
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,670
Look.

360
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,460
(Tea. Silk. Hongyuan Trading House)

361
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,920
Look, I've compared
several trading houses.

362
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,550
Only this Hongyuan Trading House's

363
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,550
sea departure records

364
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,680
match the ledger's depreciation dates.

365
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,650
It's very likely
this Hongyuan Trading House

366
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,360
colluded with Gao Shicai
to dispose of stolen goods.

367
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,750
But shouldn't Hongyuan Trading House

368
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,630
be in the tea business?

369
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,720
When did they start dealing in silk?

370
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,310
Let me offer a different perspective.

371
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,760
Silk functions as hard currency

372
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,110
in foreign lands, like silver.

373
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,920
It serves both
as a discreet means of escape

374
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,070
and as portable wealth.

375
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,150
Who wouldn't want that?

376
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,830
If your theory is correct,

377
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,880
Gao Shicai converted

378
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,920
his family's wealth into silk
to avoid suspicion

379
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,520
and planned
to convert it back into money abroad.

380
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,560
Sister Mingshu,

381
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,520
your business acumen

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,960
is also useful in solving cases.

383
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,820
I'll take someone
to Hongyuan Trading House immediately.

384
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,350
I'm sure we'll find out the details

385
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,350
of Gao Shicai's ship

386
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,720
and the departure date.

387
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,840
Wait!

388
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,830
Acting rashly will alert our targets.

389
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,720
Then what should we do?

390
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,110
I have a plan.

391

392
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,040
Welcome, esteemed guests.

393
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,520
Your presence honors
our humble establishment.

394
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,000
How can we

395
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,960
help you?

396
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,400
Sir, greetings.

397
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,310
My Lady has come from Yavadvipa

398
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,960
to trade,

399
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,630
but is stranded with a damaged ship.

400
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,510
Right now, we need to transfer

401
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,240
some Sky-Blue Glazed Brush Washers
from the Ru Ware

402
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,400
back to our country.

403
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,310
I hear you have an imminent departure,

404
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,830
could we secure passage?

405
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,630
Come here, let's discuss it upstairs.

406
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,040
Please.

407
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,800
(Golden Promise)

408
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,320
This is our records of distant voyages,

The Voyage Log.

411
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,920
Lady, which ship
would you like to charter?

412
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,110
We want the best, of course.

413
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,630
Price is not an issue.

414
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,830
Dear guests, take your time.

415
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,300
(Porcelain)

416
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,590
(Liufang Ship)
The Liufang ship appears to be the largest,

417
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,070
already carrying porcelain.

418
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,720
Should we choose it?

419
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,830
It's fully loaded.

420
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,720
It's not safe to add more cargo.

421
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,720
Please consider other options.

422
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,110
My Lady, why don't we take another look?

423
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,990
Please select.

424
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,130
(Master Zhang, Silk, Yongxing Ship)

425
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,110
This Yongxing Ship carries less cargo.
We'll take this one.

426
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,990
This...

427
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,440
This ship is booked. Booked.

428
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,480
My Lady, please don't be angry.

429
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,520
We must have this ship.

430
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,830
Did you hear?

431
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,240
My lady insisted.

432
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,200
You just have to load our goods there

433
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,160
before they leave.

434
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,310
No, but...

435
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,710
We'll double

436
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,910
the price.

437
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,230
How much?

438
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,430
Double the price?

440
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,720
Gao Shicai...

441
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,760
Gao Shicai

442
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,720
must be escaping via Yongxing Ship.

443
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,190
How is that possible?

444
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,550
The Voyage Log shows

445
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,480
that only Yongxing Ship
is carrying silk,

446
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,550
and not at full capacity.

447
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,070
What's the nature of a merchant?
Profit-seeking.

448
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,480
Who sails under capacity?

449
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,240
Except for other desires.

450
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,750
And it was chartered.

451
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,200
It must be Gao Shicai who did it.

452
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,680
He agreed to our shipment

453
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,150
when he saw our deep pockets.

454
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,240
In that case,

455
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,030
we'll catch him like a turtle in a jar.

456
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,360
Arrest him!

457
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,590

00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,590
I can't break my vow.

570
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:04,190
♪Heart is like a web of silken twine♪

571
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,050
♪Fate brews its sweet romance♪

572
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,770
♪Go on a long trip♪

573
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,660
♪In pairs♪

574
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,860
♪Hearts share a silent thread♪

575
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,600
♪Brief as dawn, vast as eternity♪

576
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,920
You call me Buddy.

577
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,070
Family should be like this.

578
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,320
(But Buddy said)

579
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,880
(he was deeply devoted
to thin Jianglin maiden.)

580
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,360
(What am I)

581
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,480
(to him?)

582
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,640
Mingshu? You're awake.

583
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,430
Why don't you go in?

584
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,680
Mr. Ying!

585
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,670
Well...

586
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,470
About Buddy's beloved

587
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,360
Jianglin maiden...

588
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,400
Jianglin... Jianglin maiden?

589
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,310
Who is she?

590
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,840
Is she in Jianglin now?

591
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,320
Well...

592
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,070
She... exists.

593
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,030
But Lu Chang is here.

594
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,320
Why ask me instead of him?

595
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,640
Mr. Ying,

596
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,550
you know Buddy's temperament.

597
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,920
If I ask, he'll scold me.

598
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,000
I have to ask you.

599
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,070
Yes.

600
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,230
Sister Mingshu, I really want to say.

601
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,280
You know,
I'm terrible at keeping secrets.

602
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,400
I feel terrible.

603
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,150
Then tell me if you want!

604
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,960
I just woke up and I'm still weak.

605
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,360
Why do you torture me?

606
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,680
No!

607
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,010
You have to ask him yourself.

608
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,040
What's this?

609
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,920
Buddy, you're awake.

610
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,880
Are you all right?

611
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,910
Let me have a look.

612
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,270
Your poisoning was worse than mine.

613
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,920
If you're all right, how can I not be?

614
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,800
Fear clouds judgment.

615
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,480
Let me fix this for you.

616
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,360
(What am I thinking?)

617
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,550
Buddy,

618
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,460
how is

619
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,960
your unforgettable

620
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,110
Jianglin maiden?

621
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,110
Still in touch?

622
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,030
She...

623
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:43,950
Lu Chang!

624
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,760
Prince Rui and his wife are here

625
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,070
with County Princess Wen'an.

626
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,590
Why did they come?

627
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,750
They were worried about you

628
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,150
and came with Prince Rui.

629
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,390
Mingshu,

630
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,270
we rushed here when we heard.

631
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,800
As sisters,

632
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,800
we couldn't comfort you
in your darkest hours.

633
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,070
Please forgive us.

634
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,070
To see you safe

635
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,920
is comforting.

636
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,000
Your care

637
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,590
and visit across miles

638
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,030
prove the value

639
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,910
of our sisterhood.

640
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,710
You're such a sweet talker.

641
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,320
You seem better.

642
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,070
Though shocked by my origins,

643
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,070
I'm surely sad.

644
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,190
But that's my life.

645
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,110
I must face the truth.

646
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,150
With Gao Shicai captured,

647
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,840
justice for my family

648
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,520
is near.

649
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,110
Now that you know your true parentage,

650
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,800
can you still treat Lu Chang

651
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,190
like a brother?

652
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,110
Shujun,

653
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,590
do you remember when I asked you this?

654
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,070
When I didn't know

655
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,320
we weren't siblings,

656
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,190
I avoided him.

657
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:58,230
I might have been...

658
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,270
It's exactly what we thought.

659
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,070
And what about his feelings?

660
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,630
All I know is

661
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,280
he'd risk his life

662
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,400
and career for you.

663
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,920
But is it a fraternal concern

664
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,920
or more?

665
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,280
We don't know that.

666
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,800
You have to decide.

667
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,550
And...

668
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,550
And...

669
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,270
And that Jianglin maiden...

670
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,110
We don't know her condition.

671
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,270
Neither do I.

672
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,200
Mingshu,

673
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,230
as for...

674
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,270
as for my cousin,

675
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,230
even though you rejected him,

676
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,430
I think

677
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,190
his feelings remain.

678
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,230
After all, he treats you sincerely.

679
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,040
My hasty return to Jianglin

680
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,320
caused you to pass on messages.

681
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,590
That was inappropriate.

682
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,280
Don't worry.

683
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,000
I'll settle this personally.

684
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,900
(Jianglin Post Inn)

685
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,270
I've captured Gao Shicai.

686
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,190
He's a key figure

687
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,670
in both

688
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,630
the Jian Family's case

689
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,880
and Su Changhua's case.

690
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,190
Through him,

691
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,000
the truth

692
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,880
is getting closer.

693
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,470
Good.

694
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,070
You're for this matter.

695
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,960
Be sure to handle this thoroughly.

696
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,160
Yes.

697
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,590
Until now,

698
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,000
you still remain calm.

699
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,520
So admirable.

700
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,190
Innocence needs no defense.

701
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,710
My government

702
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,070
has been upright.

703
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,110
I don't fear your review.

704
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,920
In that case,

705
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,480
why did you flee

706
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,840
via Yongxing Ship?

707
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:12,960
I...

708
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,000
I merely visited the docks.

709
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,200
Your cousin Gao Wan's ledger

710
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,360
records your transferred lists

711
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,520
of the Jian Family's assets

712
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,670
in every transaction

713
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,110
and the details of your disposition.

714
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,800
It's very clear

715
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,440
one by one.

716
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,110
Last year, you declared the Jian Family
colluded with bandits

717
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,360
and they were wiped out
in a booty dispute.

718
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,550
Why does your name

719
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,920
appear in the loot?

720
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,750
Mere pages of this ledger

721
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,070
can't convict

722
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,000
a prefect.

723
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,280
Lu Chang,

724
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,230
you're new to politics

725
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,960
and have a poor understanding
of officials.

726
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,510
I advise you

727
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,360
to stop wasting your time.

728
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,070
This ledger

729
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,270
was found in Wei Xian's hidden box.

730
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,590
(Ledger)
It records

731
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,230
his dirty dealings with various parties.

732
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,070
Can you guess

733
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,320
the most common location

734
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,480
and participant?

735
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,680
It's you,

736
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,270
Prefect Gao of Jianglin.

737
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,520
They're all
the Jian Family's possessions.

738
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,630
Still claiming innocence?

739
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,190
You deserve to die

740
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,440
for the Jian Family massacre alone.

741
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,480
Instead of lecturing me,

742
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,670
consider

743
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,800
how to save yourself.

744
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,480
What do you mean by that?

745
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,400
I want to know

746
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,800
who sent assassins

747
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,150
to kill you.

748
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,320
Who ordered the Jian Family massacre?

749
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,720
And who

750
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,400
instructed you to frame Su Changhua?

751
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,040
Framed Su Changhua?

752
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,320
I don't understand.

753
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,110
At first, you and Wei Xian

754
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,110
framed Su Changhua together.

755
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,360
And then the person behind you

756
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:43,590
learned that Jian Jinhai had proof

757
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,880
of Su Changhua's innocence

758
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:52,190
and ordered you to exterminate them
in the name of banditry.

759
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,070
Your loyalty

760
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,190
is rewarded

761
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,960
with an assassination attempt
instead of saving.

762
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,270
Why still keep your mouth shut?

763
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,070
Without us,

764
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,880
you'd have been dead yesterday.

765
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,440
Even if you're telling the truth,

766
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,270
I have to say

767
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,520
that I'm innocent.

768
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,630
Even if I confess the whole thing,

769
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,920
would you protect me?

770
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,040
I'm tired.

771
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,400
If you want to negotiate,

772
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,040
you're

773
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,480
unqualified.

774
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,360
Since he's unqualified,

775
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,320
what about me?

776
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,110
- Prince Rui.
- Prince Rui.

777
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,840
Gao Shicai,

778
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,320
I've come to see you in person.

779
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,440
