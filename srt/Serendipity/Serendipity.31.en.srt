28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,640
Jian Jinhai,
the richest man in Jianglin,

29
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,950
wrote you a letter asking for your help.

30
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,480
Is this true?

31
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,120
It's indeed true.

32
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,310
Then why did you

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,510
ignore it?

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,230
Could it be because this case

35
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,560
involves Prince Yu?

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,310
Since you are asking this question,

37
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,800
it means that you already know

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,430
all the details of the case.

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,680
Three years ago,
Prince Rui implemented reforms

40
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,280
that caused an uproar in the court.

41
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,520
In his anger,

42
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,680
His Majesty expelled Prince Rui
from the capital.

43
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,840
You must have heard of this.

44
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,660
The reforms advocated
promoting agriculture,

45
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,000
strengthening the military,

46
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,240
reforming examinations,

47
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,780
and correcting administration.

48
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,630
If widely implemented,

49
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,470
they would enrich the nation,

50
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,240
strengthen the military,
and benefit the people.

51
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,080
You're right.

52
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,840
Deep down,

53
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,470
I also support these policies.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,910
However,

55
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,280
they have faced fierce opposition
from conservative factions in the court.

56
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,910
Led by Prince Yu,

57
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,080
these conservatives slandered

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,120
and defamed Prince Rui.

59
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,800
His Majesty was furious

60
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,190
and lost faith in the reforms.

61
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,960
So,

62
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,470
at that time,

63
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,750
His Majesty had just put an end
to the factionalism

64
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,710
and stabilized the court.

65
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,630
If I had stepped forward

66
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,910
to exonerate Su Changhua,

67
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,240
it would have reignited conflict

68
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,560
and endless turmoil.

69
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,190
This is exactly

70
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,840
what His Majesty wanted to avoid.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,150
You understand that, right?

72
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,870
Your refusal to help
when lives were at stake

73
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,520
was merely a calculation of interests.

74
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,190
In order to curry imperial favor,

75
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,750
could you abandon justice

76
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,910
and disregard the lives

77
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,430
of the Su and Jian Families?

78
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,120
It was you

79
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,310
who cut off their last hope of survival.

80
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,200
Ying Xun!

81
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,590
I'm here!

82
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,960
Escort the guest out.

83
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:26,940
(Crystalline Integrity)

84
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:46,300
(He'an Residence)

85
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,510
Don't blame yourself

86
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,800
for his actions.

87
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,000
They were his choices,

88
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,270
nothing to do with you.

89
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,510
What saddens me

90
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,480
is not our blood ties,

91
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,120
but his silence when he knew

92
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,030
the reforms would benefit the nation.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,680
Yet he remained indifferent,

94
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,360
just as when he knew

95
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,310
my mentor was being framed.

96
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,510
For people like him,

97
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,920
self-preservation

98
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,310
outweighs the good of the people.

99
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,750
I can't think about such complexities.

100
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,900
(He'an Residence)
I just believe

101
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,630
that with people like you in the court,

102
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,600
the future will be brighter.

103
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,070
How I wish

104
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,240
he had stood up for justice back then.

105
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,510
In this way, maybe Master Jian

106
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,270
wouldn't have died,

107
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,630
and you would still be

108
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,430
the respected young lady.

109
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,750
But the world

110
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,480
has no room for what-ifs.

111
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,360
I don't know

112
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,240
if the designs here are suitable.

113
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,310
Third Lady of Lu,

114
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,240
you've arrived.

115
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,430
Will you be looking at jewelry
or embroidery today?

116
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,870
Both.

117
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,880
Wan'er,

118
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,720
come with me. Let's go upstairs.

119
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,310
Go upstairs?

120
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,680
When our Lu Family appears in public,

121
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,120
we must maintain our dignity.

122
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,510
So strange.

123
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,720
Madam Lu has a daughter?

124
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,920
Why haven't I heard of it?

125
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,900
(Lu Wan'er)
She's called Liu Wan'er.

126
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,270
No,

127
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,480
now she's called Lu Wan'er.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,570
Originally, she was Lu Ruishan's sister.

129
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,530
13 years ago,
she was kidnapped

130
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,900
- as a child.
- Wan'er, choose something.

131
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,720
- She was found three months ago.
- See if you like it.

132
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,270
Mother!

133
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,870
Mother, the styles here are outdated.

134
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,630
I know a shop with better designs

135
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,510
for Sister Wan'er.

136
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,000
Really?

137
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,560
Let's go then.

138
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,910
Lu Ruishan seems

139
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,510
still resentful

140
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,600
after Mr. Song's rejection.

141
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,080
So petty.

142
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,910
She's less dignified than that Wan'er.

143
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,480
Although she grew up in the countryside

144
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,510
and seemed

145
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,120
uneducated in etiquette,

146
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,930
Madam Lu
must have trained her rigorously

147
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,790
to present her in public.

148
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,270
Reuniting after years apart

149
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,670
is remarkable.

150
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,320
As the saying goes,
"No coincidence, no history."

151
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,480
Not long ago,

152
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,120
Madam Lu visited a temple

153
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,270
and saw Lu Wan'er

154
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,030
praying there.

155
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,700
She recognized the girl's token

156
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,910
and confirmed that she was looking
for her birth parents

157
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,390
with the blessing of the Buddha.

158
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,120
She was even more convinced

159
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,910
they were mother and daughter.

160
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,910
So they were reunited

161
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,910
under the circumstances.

162
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,200
It's all by Heaven's arrangement.

163
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,120
What's wrong, Mingshu?

164
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,480
Is something wrong?

165
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,390
It seems too coincidental.

166
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,120
How did Liu Wan'er accidentally

167
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,480
meet Madam Lu?

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,440
For ordinary people,

169
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,910
I'd dismiss it as a heartwarming tale.

170
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,510
But...

171
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,840
with Lu Zegang tied to Prince Yu...

172
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,630
Perhaps I'm thinking too much.

173
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,630
Your suspicions

174
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,910
aren't unfounded.

175
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,670
Should I investigate Lu Wan'er?

176
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,510
Let Mr Ying handle it.

177
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,700
As an official of the Supreme Court,

178
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,910
he has easier access.

179
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,080
I agree.

180
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,280
When we were young,

181
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,030
you used to take me everywhere.

182
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,390
In my mind,

183
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,670
you were so free-spirited.

184
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,000
Why this despondency now?

185
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,560
All these years,

186
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,670
I've loved no one

187
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,870
but her.

188
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,320
I prepared myself to defy all obstacles,

189
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,120
but nothing came of it.

190
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,720
What do you mean by nothing?

191
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,000
Were your precious moments

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,480
nothing?

193
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,320
Was her kindness

194
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,630
meaningless?

195
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,360
There is more to the world

196
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,120
than romance.

197
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,320
I know the logic,

198
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,630
but the practice

199
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,030
is harder.

200
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,630
Then do more, talk less.

201
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,910
For example,
let the duties of the Hanlin Academy

202
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,720
consume your time.

203
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,720
Or

204
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,910
throw away

205
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,950
these sentimental trinkets.

206
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,990
Don't!

207
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,350
What?

208
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,720
Can't stand it?

209
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,560
I...

210
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,720
Fine,

211
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,960
I'll stop teasing you.

212
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,080
Here.

213
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,390
Qingzhao, I know that

214
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,080
heartfelt feelings

215
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,000
aren't easily discarded.

216
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,120
Take it slowly.

217
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,280
Try this.

218
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
That's right!

219
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,300
(Physician Zhao's Pharmacy)

220
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,390
Buddy!

221
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,350
Mingshu!

222
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,910
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?

223
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,610
Let's go home.

224
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,080
Have you just come from the shop?

225
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,470
How could you go out in the rain
without an umbrella?

226
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,510
It's been raining lately.

227
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,910
If you hadn't met me,

228
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,950
who knows how long you would have waited
for the rain to stop?

229
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,440
The weather was perfectly clear
when I left this morning,

230
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,870
then suddenly the downpour came.

You're all wet.

246

It's okay.

247
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Chang and Mingshu are back.

248
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,040
Why are you...

249
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,120
What's going on here?

250
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,080
Didn't you bring an umbrella?

251
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,510
Why are you soaked?

252
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,110
The wind is too strong
and breaks the umbrella.

253
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,390
That's why we got wet.

254
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,670
A little rain doesn't hurt.

255
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,870
Sit down here.

256
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,250
Sit down.

257
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,840
Mother,

258
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,110
I'm going to my room.

259
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,870
I'll make you some ginger soup.

260
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,270
I'm leaving too.

261
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,040
Mingshu!

262
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,920
Mingshu.

263
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,630
Why are you calling me?

264
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,840
Mingshu, you've always been heartwarming

265
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,270
and closest to me.

266
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,870
Please speak well of me

267
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,480
to your mother

268
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,440
and brother.

269
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
You're right.

270
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,510
But I don't want to.

271
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,550
Director, you should save your efforts.

272
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,120
Look at you.

273
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,270
What's going on here?

274
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,870
Why do you call me

275
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,390
by my title

276
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,390
instead of "Uncle Lu"?

277
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,390
I did it on purpose.

278
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,270
You call yourself "Father",

279
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,870
so I wanted to provoke you.

280
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,600
See?

281
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,120
What's going on today?

282
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,390
You're so feisty.

283
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,600
I know you're still angry

284
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,320
that I left you for years.

285
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,320
That's natural,

286
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,320
but I had my reasons.

287
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,620
Now that

288
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,120
we're reunited,

289
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,790
don't you want our family

290
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,320
to be complete?

291
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,440
Don't you want to be

292
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
the true heiress of the Lu Family?

293
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,440
I follow Buddy and Mother.

294
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,390
If they want to be reunited, fine.

295
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,390
If not, then no.

296
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,870
As for being the heiress,

297
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,510
I don't care

298
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,870
even if I'm called Master Lu.

299
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,320
Director,

300
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,390
save your plans for me.

301
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,200
If there's nothing to do,

302
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,510
please go back.

303
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,320
You're not welcome here.

304
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,680
Mingshu...

305
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,720
Look at her.

306
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,840
Buddy...

307
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,560
Hot! Hot!

308
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,860
Are you okay? Let me blow.

309
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,560
Is it better?

310
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,840
You really don't want
to be the Lu heiress?

311
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,360
I'm already the Jian Family's heiress

312
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,080
and your lady.

313
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,390
I don't like other families' titles.

314
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,120
You treated him like this today.

315
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm sure he'll think twice.

316
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,680
Drink this while it's warm.

317
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,720
I'll do it myself.

318
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,080
Careful, it's hot.

319
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,990
Blow on it.

320
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,840
It's okay.

321
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,560
Yuqing!

322
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,350
Let me do it.

323
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,440
If you have anything to say,
just say it.

324
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,280
Yuqing,

325
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,480
I want you to find a chance

326
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
and persuade Lu Chang.

327
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,310
The politics of the court

328
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,440
are more complex than he imagines.

329
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,830
He'll struggle

330
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,030
to survive

331
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,590
on his own in the future.

332
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,400
It would be better for him
to return to our roots.

333
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,110
If some disaster occurs in the future,

334
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,110
our clan can protect him

335
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,030
from straits

336
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,670
and secure

337
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,510
your future too.

338
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,310
How do you like that?

339
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,720
Lu Chang is no longer a child.

340
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,920
He's got his own ideas.

341
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,440
Whether he reclaims his heritage

342
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,400
is his decision.

343
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,270
As for me,

344
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,310
I'll also be responsible for myself.

345
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,920
There's no need for you to worry.

346
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,870
Yuqing!

347
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,910
Okay.

348
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,000
If you don't want to,

349
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,510
let's not talk about this.

350
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,920
But we should also prepare

351
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,200
for Mingshu's marriage prospects.

352
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,790
She's of age.

353
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,640
I think she and Mr. Song

354
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,960
seem to get along well.

355
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,000
Should we formalize

356
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
their engagement?

357
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,000
How about that?

358
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,400
Since

359
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,200
we're being frank,

360
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,680
I don't want to hide it.

361
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,070
You have no right to interfere

362
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,270
in Mingshu's marriage.

363
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,310
Because Mingshu is not your daughter.

364
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,070
Whoever you acknowledge

365
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,200
as yours

366
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,510
remains mine.

367
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,680
In short, stay out

368
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,310
of her marriage plans.

369
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,790
Yuqing.

370
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,280
Yuqing!

371
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,270
Take your time to reconsider.

372
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,030
His Majesty has ordered

373
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,400
the Supreme Court
to re-examine Su Changhua's case.

374
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,440
As the investigating censor

375
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,240
of the original case,

376
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,310
I must confess

377
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,590
hidden truths to you, Prince Rui.

378
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,110
Minister Lu,

379
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,110
what secrets do you have for me?

380
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,440
In Su Changhua's embezzlement case,

381
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,790
as the investigating censor,

382
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,640
I should have enforced impartially.

383
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,310
Yet I distorted the facts.

384
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,920
That's because I was threatened

385
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,110
and forced to do it.

386
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,110
So you mean

387
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,640
Su Changhua did have a grievance.

388
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,070
And you're forced by others?

389
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,560
Exactly.

390
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm guilty

391
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,510
and embarrassed.

392
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,240
I can't even sleep at night.

393
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,440
So I came here to speak frankly

394
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,400
and beg you

395
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,030
to grant me atonement.

396
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,960
It seems

397
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,310
you sincerely repent.

398
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,510
Name your pressure

399
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,000
and conspirators.

400
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,160
Let's talk about it one by one.

401
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,030
It was Prince Yu.

402
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,150
Bold!

403
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,070
Slandering royalty deserves execution.

404
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
If there's no proof,

405
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,620
you shouldn't talk frivolously.

406
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Would I dare speak

407
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,680
without hard evidence?

408
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,550
Though Gao Shicai is dead,

409
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,440
he left me

410
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,750
conclusive evidence against Prince Yu.

411
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,590
And I have

412
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,400
some additional evidence.

413
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,030
If these documents

414
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,720
are made public,

415
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,480
Prince Yu's power

416
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,920
will crumble

417
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,640
and fall.

418
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,820
(Self-restraint and Integrity)

419
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,000
Before Gao Shicai died,

420
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,640
he had already exposed you
and Prince Yu.

421
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,950
Now, hand over

422
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,790
the evidence

423
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,110
and pledge your loyalty.

424
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,350
It's the only way.

425
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,270
I know my fate,

426
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,550
but I can't

427
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,160
watch you

428
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,550
miss this opportunity.

429
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,480
What do you want?

430
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
State your demands.

431
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,390
I heard

432
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,590
Lu Chang has your trust.

433
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,680
If he can marry our family,

434
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,240
I'll look up

435
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,960
to you

436
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,510
and serve you with all my heart.

437
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,550
As long as Prince Yu
can't get the evidence,

438
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,480
our family will never have peace.

439
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,110
Since Lu Chang has won your favor,

440
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,110
and my daughter has admired him
for a long time,

441
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,830
I beg you to introduce us

442
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,830
to keep our family safe.

443
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,950
I have no right

444
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,880
to interfere
in other people's marriages.

445
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,520
It depends

446
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,510
on Lu Chang's will.

447
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,980
(Self-restraint and Integrity)

448
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Go back first.

449
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,320
We'll discuss it

450
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,590
after consulting with him.

451
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,960
I believe

452
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,110
you and Reviewer Lu

453
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,720
will weigh the priorities.

454
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,240
I await your favorable reply.

455
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,920
What do you think

456
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,680
of his statements?

457
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,350
Mr. Lu is upright

458
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,200
and detests such deals.

459
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,920
According to me,

460
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,200
he'll refuse

461
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,400
this marriage.

462
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,590
My thoughts exactly.

463
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,270
This marriage

464
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,270
shouldn't be accepted.

465
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,310
But Lu Zegang's evidence

466
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,310
is very important for the case.

467
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,830
How can we

468
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,510
get it?

469
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,200
Your essays

470
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,510
are getting better every day.

471
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,880
The scholar came

472
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,000
to praise you

473
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,110
to Master.

474
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,350
And Master was

475
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,480
overjoyed.

476
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,920
Talent shouldn't be wasted.

477
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,830
Although my heart is broken,

478
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,830
I won't wallow in it.

479
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,880
It's very good

480
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,960
that you think so.

481
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,800
Qingzhao!

482
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,110
Mingshu and I are here to visit.

483
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,350
Mingshu has come with me

484
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,480
to thank you

485
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,960
for the tools.

486
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,070
Qingzhao, thank you.

487
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,680
Are the tools working well?

488
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,750
Perfect. No blisters at all.

489
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,110
That's good.

490
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,270
Lady Mingshu,

491
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,790
he tested them repeatedly for you.

492
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,160
His hands were scarred.

493
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,630
He made sure they wouldn't sharpen

494
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,880
before he let me send them over.

495
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,240
Not that bad.

496
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,790
Making tools

497
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,960
is my specialty.

498
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,640
That's right. Just order him

499
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,550
to fix it.

500
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,480
How can you say that?

501
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,110
Qingzhao is a talent
of the Hanlin Academy.

502
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,270
I can't order him around.

503
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,070
Qingzhao, this is for you.

504
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,910
Open it.

505
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,940
(Nan'an Studio)

506
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,030
The four treasures of study
from Nan'an Studio.

507
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,240
This is a rare set,

508
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,110
something that can't be bought
with money.

509
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,100
Their eldest daughter

510
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,620
was quite pleased
with the custom-made jewelry

511
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,640
from our Hualang Pavilion,

512
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,270
so she gave this set as a gift.

513
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,420
I'm just presenting a gift
on someone else's behalf.

514
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,400
It suits Qingzhao perfectly.

515
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,000
I give you tools,

516
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,440
and you give me this.

517
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,350
What kind of an exchange

518
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,110
is that?

519
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,350
My tools

520
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,000
are far less valuable than this set.

521
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,040
You're at a loss.

522
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,550
But the sentiment behind your tools

523
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,200
surpasses anything I could match.

524
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,200
After all the calculations,

525
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,920
I'm still the one who owes you.

526
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,560
Mingshu,

527
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,480
I know you care about me.

528
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,870
Rest assured.

529
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,440
I'll use this

530
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,590
to write many fine articles

531
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,200
and won't disappoint your kindness.

(Top Scholar Residence)

533
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,870
What's this?

534
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,480
An invitation from Lu Ruishan.

535
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,700
(Invitation)
Inviting me

536
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,500
(Please come on the 16th.)
to introduce them to our jewelry.

537
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,830
How strange.

538
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,400
She used to glare at me
with displeasure,

539
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,880
but now she invites me.

540
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,350
I wonder what it means.

541
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,720
It's probably

542
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,000
not Lu Ruishan's idea,

543
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,790
but Lu Zegang's plan.

544
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,840
Lu Zegang?

545
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,350
Why would he want to see me?

546
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,550
Now that Prince Yu
has eliminated Wei Xian

547
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,640
and Gao Shicai,

548
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,830
he's getting restless.

549
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,350
He wants to ally himself

550
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,790
with Prince Rui.

551
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,000
This invitation

552
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,240
is specifically addressed to me.

553
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,790
Then how should I respond?

554
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,430
Go.

555
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,110
Lu Zegang has evidence

556
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,680
against Prince Yu.

557
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,790
If he's serious about defecting,

558
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,750
one failure

559
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,720
won't stop him.

560
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,350
It's inevitable.

561
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,590
Then I'll prepare a reply.

562
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,920
I understand your intention.

563
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,270
I won't fall for their tricks.

564
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,160
Knowing their ulterior motives,

565
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,790
how could I let you go alone?

566
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,880
I'll go with you.

567
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,240
This is what Lu Zegang wants as well.

568
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
I haven't forgotten

569
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,500
how he framed you before.

570
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,240
I'm petty

571
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,080
and hold a grudge.

572
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,440
If he dares to harm you,

573
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,750
I'll make him pay.

574
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,880
Then you must protect me well.

575
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,420
(Third Lady of Lu, my brother hopes
to visit you with me. Lu Mingshu.)

576
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,030
Father,

577
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,440
did you need me?

578
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,270
I want Lu Chang

579
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,680
to marry into our family.

580
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,510
If you marry Lu Chang,

581
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,270
our clan will be safe.

582
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,110
Lu Chang?

583
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,440
The top scholar?

584
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,640
Yes.

585
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,590
Invite Lu Mingshu here

586
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,790
tomorrow.

587
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,720
Lu Chang will surely accompany her.

588
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,790
You have to behave well.

589
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,790
Remember,

590
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,830
no mistakes.

591
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,110
Your mistakes

592
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,790
will have severe consequences.

593
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,200
I understand.

594
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,110
I won't let you down.

595
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,040
Thank you, Father.

596
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,750
Reviewer Lu, please sit down.

597
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,880
Your visit today

598
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,160
coincides with

599
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,440
some good news I wish to discuss.

600
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,240
Good news?

601
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,030
From where?

602
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,270
Reviewer Lu, you and my third daughter

603
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,960
make a fine pair.

604
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,510
You look like a couple
of a gifted scholar and an elegant lady.

605
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,920
Why not

606
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,400
formalize this marriage?

607
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,000
Reviewer Lu,

608
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,550
what do you think?

609
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,310
I've only met Third Lady of Lu

610
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,790
a few times.

611
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,200
Besides,
I have no intention of doing so.

612
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,720
I urge you to reconsider.

613
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,030
Reviewer Lu,

614
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,550
do you think

615
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,920
my daughter is unworthy?

616
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,070
In all the capital,

617
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,440
few can match her

618
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,750
in talent,

619
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,030
beauty, or pedigree.

620
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,830
I don't seek

621
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,790
a great fortune.

622
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,200
I only want

623
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,240
to unite with

624
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,550
your extraordinary abilities.

625
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,350
Reviewer Lu,

626
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,270
how do you react?

627
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,240
I'm confused

628
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,830
by this sudden proposal.

629
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,240
Do you remember

630
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,640
how you sent me to prison

631
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,200
before the spring exam?

632
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,670
That...

633
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,110
The man who wished

634
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,750
for my destruction

635
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,510
now seeks kinship?

636
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,160
I find this hard to believe.

637
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,070
There's no such thing.

638
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,880
I've always

639
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,240
admired you.

640
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,200
What frame?

641
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
You know

642
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,070
the truth.

643
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,830
I don't need to explain.

644
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,780
(Eastern Prosperity)

645
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,830
Anyway,

646
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,270
I hope we can

647
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,270
clear up any misunderstandings.

648
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,910
Look.

649
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,880
Right now,

650
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,000
only I

651
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,590
can help Prince Rui

652
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,400
solve his most pressing case

653
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,590
and bring the real culprit to justice.

654
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,200
The most pressing case?

655
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,830
When I mentioned this to Prince Rui,

656
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,000
he said

657
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,590
it depended on your will.

658
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,110
Prince Rui shows

659
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,160
his immense trust in you.

660
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,270
Minister Lu, do you want me

661
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,550
to exchange marriage

662
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,550
for evidence?

663
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,960
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

664
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,070
Using marriage

665
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,350
as a transaction

666
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,400
is unacceptable for me.

667
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,310
I believe Prince Rui would understand.

668
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,440
Reviewer Lu,

669
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,830
you should know,

670
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,590
this is Prince Rui's courtesy to you.

671
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,830
As subordinates,
we should dedicate ourselves

672
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,550
to repaying his favor.

673
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,830
As his aide,

674
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,750
you know the importance

675
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,790
of this evidence for Prince Rui.

676
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,110
Please

677
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,750
weigh your options

678
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,200
and think them over

679
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,400
carefully.

680
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,550
Don't answer hastily.

681
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,350
This marriage affects many.

682
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,110
However,

683
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,270
remember,

684
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,110
opportunities lost

685
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,750
won't come back.

686
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,200
Reviewer Lu,

687
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,160
be careful.

688
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,200
For us, this is an opportunity.

689
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,270
For you, it's salvation.

690
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,480
A strategist like you

691
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,270
wouldn't block your own path.

692
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,670
If there's nothing else,

693
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,070
I'll take my leave.

694
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,070
You...

695
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,150
Is it true

696
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,070
that Fourth Lady of Lu

697
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,880
is your family's long-lost child,

698
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,920
recently reclaimed?

699
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,030
The news seems

700
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,480
to have spread throughout the city.

701
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,760
It's no longer a secret.

702
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,440
Then...

703
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,710
Why has she only returned now?

704
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,800
Where did she go before?

705
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,470
Before...

706
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,440
From what she said,

707
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,760
after she was kidnapped,

708
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,880
a physician

709
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,480
bought her as a child bride.

710
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,880
He had been living

711
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,190
in the suburbs of the capital.

712
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,710
After that, he took her travelling
as a physician.

713
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,710
For a long time,

714
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,000
he treated her as his own daughter.

715
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,590
When she came of age,

716
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,710
the physician discovered

717
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,880
that his son was a gambler.

718
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,070
Unwilling to ruin her life,

719
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,670
he revealed her background

720
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,070
and returned the handkerchief

721
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,800
she had worn

722
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
when she was bought.

723
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,670
That's how

724
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,550
she was reunited with Mother.

725
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,320
Where's the physician now?

726
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,000
After raising her for so long,

727
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,230
did he just let her go?

728
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,390
I don't know.

729
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,800
Father sent investigators.

730
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,440
They said

731
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,320
he returned home seriously ill.

732
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,920
Who knows?

733
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,910
He may

734
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,400
have died.

735
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,240
Buddy,

736
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,000
did your meeting with Minister Lu

737
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,550
go badly?

738
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,550
As expected,

739
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,230
Lu Zegang really wants
to defect to Prince Rui with evidence

740
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,550
against Prince Yu.

741
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,030
Isn't that good?

742
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,190
Are you worried

743
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,760
he won't hand over the evidence quickly?

744
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,670
This is the fate of his family.

745
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,920
He won't give up
his bargaining chip easily.

746
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,880
He'll manoeuvre

747
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,760
to survive this crisis.

748
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,590
What outrageous demand has he made?

749
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,840
I know it.

750
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,710
Did he want Third Lady of Lu

751
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,550
to marry you?

752
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,870
You guessed it?

753
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,190
In my opinion,

754
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
Third Lady of Lu

755
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,280
is warm-hearted and meticulous.

756
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,070
She's quite compatible with you.

757
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,480
Do you really think so?

758
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,320
What do you want me to think?

759
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,400
All that talk about caring for me

760
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,070
was wrong.

761
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,480
Pushing me away so easily.

762
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,800
Buddy, your romantic prospects

763
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,630
are multiplying every day.

764
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,960
First, the Jianglin maiden,

765
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,590
now the Third Lady of Lu.

766
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,190
I'm really happy for you.

767
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,580
(Grand Ambitions)

768
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,670
I raised her in luxury,

769
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,670
educated her in the arts.

770
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,280
And what good is it?

771
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,800
Now,

772
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,760
(Yamo Pavilion)
even a poor scholar like Lu Chang

773
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,710
despises her.

774
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,440
What greatness can she achieve?

775
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,680
I've heard

776
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,630
that she has recently

777
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,590
received marriage proposals.

778
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,670
If she can't get Lu Chang,

779
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,480
she'll have to settle for these.

780
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,000
I'll have Wan'er

781
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,320
approach Lu Chang instead.

782
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,120
No!

783
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,840
That suitor is a wastrel

784
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,110
who haunts brothels.

785
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,040
I refuse!

786
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,070
I'll marry Lu Chang.

787
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,320
No one will take him away from me!

788
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,440
Lu Chang showed

789
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,630
no interest today.

790
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,110
How will you

791
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,590
get him to agree?

792
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,320
That's my worry.

793
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,630
I'll find a way

794
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,760
to get him to marry me.

795
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,160
Good.

796
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,230
I'll give you one more chance.

797
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,710
Don't fail me again.

798
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,840
Ladies,

799
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,400
perhaps you should wait here

800
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,110
until the rain stops?

801
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,240
Okay.

802
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,670
Look, our jewelry

803
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,550
is exquisite.

804
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
Last time,

805
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,840
Third Lady of Lu specifically asked

806
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,280
where I bought my pieces.

807
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,840
- Third Lady of Lu?
- Let me show you this.

808
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,920
Is that the daughter
of the Minister of Works?

809
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,800
Rumor has it that
her wedding is imminent.

810
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,150
Her wedding?

811
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,320
It's the talk of the city.

812
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,670
It seems

813
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,710
she's to marry
the capital's rising star.

814
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,550
More than a rising star,

815
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,480
it's the celebrated top scholar!

816
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,670
How many ladies dream

817
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,030
about this kind of groom?

818
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,160
Excuse me,

819
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,930
what are you discussing?

820
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,140
Who is Third Lady of Lu marrying?

821
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,550
The current top scholar,

822
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,030
Lu Chang.

823
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,150
How is that possible?

824
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,070
It's all rumors. Don't believe it.

825
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,710
It's really not a rumor.

826
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,920
My friend

827
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,360
knows Third Lady of Lu.

828
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,550
She says the match

829
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,880
is settled.

830
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,870
Why else would rumors

831
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,280
be so widespread?

832
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,430
- Really?
- Really.

833
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,400
My parents are already
preparing presents.

834
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,070
The wedding should be imminent.

835
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,190
It's still raining outside.

836
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,280
What happened?

837
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,150
Lu Chang marrying Lu Ruishan?

838
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,190
Now rumors of Lu Chang's union
with Lu Ruishan

839
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,960
are flooding the capital.

840
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,630
Given Mr. Lu's reputation for integrity,

841
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,680
this rumor

842
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,760
will plague him terribly.

843
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,000
Once news of Lu Chang's marriage
to a Lu daughter spreads,

844
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,150
it'll cause endless trouble.

845
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,840
Otherwise...

846
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,870
Your Highness,

847
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,480
this is the perfect moment
to expose Prince Yu.

848
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,280
You mustn't hesitate...

849
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,510
Enough. I know.

850
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,320
To achieve our goal,

851
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,920
this method must suffice.

852
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,510
So, the marriage
of Lu Chang and Lu Ruishan

853
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,590
was your plan?

854
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,030
I thought you had principles.

855
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,550
I didn't think you were like this!

856
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,870
I...

857
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,030
What kind of man am I?

858
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,190
Bold in action,
but afraid of responsibility!

859
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,110
Forcing Lu Chang

860
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,430
to marry Lu Ruishan for your own purpose

861
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,190
is tyranny!

862
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,230
Now you are courting me.

863
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,110
Is this also political manoeuvring

864
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,480
for selfish gain?

865
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,670
Put Lu Chang's marriage in order

866
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,030
at once.

867
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,870
Otherwise...

868
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:09,950
Buddy!

869
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,550
You're marrying Lu Ruishan?

870
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,230
Why are you soaked?

871
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,000
- I... I'm asking you.
- Hurry up.

872
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,400
No... Is it true?

873
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,280
Didn't you say
you didn't like this affair?

874
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,280
Let me dry you first.

875
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,590
Stop. Tell me if it's true.

876
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,550
Dry you first.

877
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Stop wiping.

878
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,590
Stop wiping!

879
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,920
I had no choice.

880
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,920
They put pressure on me.

881
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,960
So you agreed?

882
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,550
I don't like her!

883
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,710
Why not?

884
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
Lu Ruishan is unstable.

885
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,820
She's not a good wife.

886
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,000
Anyway, I refuse this marriage.

887
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,120
I won't accept this sister-in-law.

888
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,880
If you go ahead with this,

889
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,840
I'll...

890
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,840
I...

891
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,430
You'll what?

892
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,480
I'll sever our sibling ties.

893
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,550
Fine.

894
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,600
Gladly.

895
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,190
Buddy, you...

896
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,150
That's not what I want.

897
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,150
Prince Rui

898
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,110
cares too.

899
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,800
He values me so much.

900
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,070
How can I not share his burdens?

901
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,590
What about your earlier words?

902
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,400
You said that love is love.

903
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:35,430
It's not born of gratitude,

904
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,510
and it's not bowed to convention.

905
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,510
It's unaffected by wealth

906
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,670
and unaltered by career.

907
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,880
How could I...

908
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:42,990
How could I cherish those words?

909
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,190
