Because

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,560
you're the one

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,390
pretending to be a ghost
and causing trouble

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,110
in this residence, Nanny Lyu.

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,320
Fairy Xuanqing,

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,640
are you saying

34
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,080
that the ghost impersonator
is Nanny Lyu?

35
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,760
Fairy Xuanqing,

36
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,910
are you sure?

37
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm not afraid of your accusation.

38
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,950
I'm a human being, not a ghost.

39
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,190
Of course, you're human.

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,640
Madam,

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,990
do you remember the day
we met the ghost?

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,320
Help me...

43
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,870
What I saw that day

44
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,320
was actually your shadow.

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,300
Tell me, what kind of ghost
casts a shadow?

46
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,750
That was clearly a human impostor.

47
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,360
Even if it was a human impostor,

48
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,350
how can you say that person was me?

49
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,840
The ghost disappeared as soon as

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,120
she reached the corridor.

51
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,790
I checked with the servants.

52
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,150
All the gates from the courtyard

53
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,160
are guarded.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,240
Except for the partial courtyard

55
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,160
where Nanny Lyu lives.

56
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,910
So I deduced

57
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,630
that the culprit fled
into this courtyard.

58
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,160
As for the ghostly props,

59
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,750
they could still be here.

60
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,950
What excuses

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,600
are there at this point?

62
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,630
Qingmei, search here!

63
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,510
Yes.

64
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,190
Seal it!

65
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,160
Hurry up and seal it!

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,560
So it's you, Lyu Chunlian!

67
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,360
Pretending to be a ghost to scare people

68
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,910
and throw the Wei Family into chaos!

69
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,910
Fairy Xuanqing,

70
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,560
let's gather the household

71
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,750
and punish this evil servant!

72
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,910
Madam, wait!

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,520
Surely you realize

74
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,610
that Nanny Lyu has been Master's spy
for a long time,

75
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,040
spying on Madam Wei.

76
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,680
Even if we expose

77
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,040
her ghostly charade,

78
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,280
we have to tell Madam Wei

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,880
the whole story first.

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,510
You're right.

81
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,160
Qingmei,

82
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,520
summon Madam Wei at once!

83
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,400
Yes.

84
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,750
Wenhui,

85
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,080
we've discovered

86
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,150
that Nanny Lyu

87
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,160
is the ghostly impostor.

88
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,910
We're taking her in for punishment.

89
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,000
Madam Wei,

90
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,400
do you have anything to say?

91
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,310
Wenhui,

92
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,470
after all this,

93
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,670
are you still protecting Wei Xian?

94
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,830
He spied on you

95
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,760
and sent ghosts to haunt you.

96
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,040
Madam, please stay calm.

97
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,670
Let me speak

98
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,710
for Madam Wei.

99
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,990
Nanny Lyu's haunting

100
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,960
was ordered by Madam Wei herself.

101
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,470
Wenhui!

102
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,310
Why are you doing this?

103
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,510
The entire Wei Family

104
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,080
is under Wei Xian's control.

105
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,280
No news can escape.

106
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,870
So I guess

107
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,480
Madam Wei used this method

108
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,520
to seek outside help.

109
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,990
Fairy, you're right.

110
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,990
Ghostly interference

111
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,160
was my last hope

112
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,600
for salvation.

113
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,440
I should have

114
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,960
heeded my parents' warnings

115
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,280
and your advice

116
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,790
instead of marrying that scoundrel.

117
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,840
For 20 years,

118
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,000
I've been living

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,870
in hell.

120
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,120
Wenhui,

121
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,550
I never imagined

122
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,000
your suffering would

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,230
last for decades.

124
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,390
He forbade me

125
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,870
to socialize,

126
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,040
so I cut all ties

127
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,910
with the outside world.

128
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,600
He called me foolish,

129
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,280
saying no one else would care for me.

130
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,470
All these years,

131
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,430
I obeyed him

132
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,870
like a docile lamb.

133
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,310
When he was pleased,

134
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,720
he'd pet me.

135
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,110
When he was angry,

136
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,670
he'd kick

137
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,670
and punch me.

138
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,910
I...

139
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,790
That beast!

140
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,350
How dare he strike you?

141
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,640
A man attacking

142
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,480
a defenseless woman!

143
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,870
Wei Xian is not human!

144
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,310
Actually,

145
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,200
I tried to divorce him.

146
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,990
But with my family's decline,

147
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,270
he threatened the lives

148
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,790
of my relatives.

149
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,560
He cut off

150
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,520
all my connections

151
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,040
and imprisoned me

152
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,840
in this house.

153
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,600
My cries reached
neither heaven nor earth.

154
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,520
I...

155
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,560
Nanny Lyu

156
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,750
was sent

157
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,350
to watch over me.

158
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,360
But she took pity

159
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,870
and changed sides.

160
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,390
So

161
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,840
we staged

162
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,760
ghostly hauntings

163
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,790
to seek help.

164
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,280
Since I came,

165
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,720
why didn't you confide in me

166
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,240
right away?

167
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,080
Why continue the ghostly trick?

168
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,040
Ruoyi,

169
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,870
you're impulsive

170
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,760
and guileless.

171
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,910
If I had told you earlier,

172
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,110
I was afraid of the consequences.

173
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,430
Do you remember

174
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,830
when I provoked you

175
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,790
in the hope that you'd help me escape?

176
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
But Wei Xian

177
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,720
returned too quickly.

178
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,160
You think

179
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,910
I'm reckless.

180
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,670
So it wasn't me

181
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,680
you wanted to attract

182
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,760
from the beginning,

183
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,600
but Yaoqing, right?

184
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,160
- No.
- And you scared me with a ghost.

185
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,040
Ruoyi,

186
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,910
don't misunderstand.

187
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,750
Madam,

188
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,430
Madam Wei's caution

189
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,080
is not out of suspicion,

190
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,790
but out of fear.

191
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,240
Consort Zhanghuai

192
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,310
handles such matters

193
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,310
with great skill.

194
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,310
Isn't that why you admire her

195
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,110
as a close friend?

196
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,670
That's right.

197
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,070
Yaoqing has always been

198
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,160
the most capable among us.

199
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,000
She's resolute in a crisis.

200
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,950
If she had intervened,

201
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,710
you'd have been released long ago.

202
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,240
I'm so useless.

203
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,190
Madam, don't despair.

204
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,620
Even though we don't have the authority
of Consort Zhanghuai,

205
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,870
we can still

206
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,000
help Madam Wei

207
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,400
escape this torment.

208
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,360
Wenhui,

209
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,040
trust me.

210
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,740
(Wei Residence)

211
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,310
Madam Wei!

212
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,880
May we speak privately?

213
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,120
What do you want to talk about?

214
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,150
(Siyi Pavilion)

215
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,120
Do you know the origin

216
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,070
of the bracelet Wei Xian gave you?

217
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,190
Fairy Xuanqing,

218
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,520
though you are ostensibly here
for Second Lady of Wei,

219
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,840
your true goal

220
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,790
is this golden bracelet, isn't it?

221
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,360
What exactly is your purpose?

222
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,070
Rest assured, Madam Wei.

223
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,910
I seek only the history of the bracelet.

224
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,280
It's vital to me.

225
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,950
Even without knowing its origin,

226
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,120
I'll help you.

227
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,840
Why?

228
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,550
As a fellow woman,

229
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,030
your plight

230
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,040
resonates with me.

231
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,030
How can I remain aloof

232
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,360
when I know the truth?

233
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,120
There must be a deeper reason

234
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,400
for your request.

235
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,670
Since you're sincerely helping me,

236
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,590
I'll return the favor.

237
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,880
I really don't know

238
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,830
the origin of the bracelet.

239
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,360
But Wei Xian catalogs

240
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,960
all valuables

241
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,120
with their history.

242
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,670
However,

243
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,270
that ledger

244
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,760
remains in his possession.

245
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,070
My late father, a great craftsman,

246
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,390
made me

247
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,790
a treasure chest

248
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,160
as a dowry.

249
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,590
After our marriage, Wei Xian took it

250
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,910
and even changed

251
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,190
the combination lock.

252
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,670
I don't know it either.

253
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,060
(Ledger)

254
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,550
So even if

255
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,040
I get the treasure chest,

256
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,550
it's useless?

257
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,710
Fairy, don't worry.

258
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,670
The treasure chest is my dowry

259
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,070
and my father's legacy.

260
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,120
I must reclaim it.

261
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,840
Through divorce,

262
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,750
the law

263
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,360
requires him

264
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,480
to return my dowry.

265
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,670
Then he'll retrieve
his personal belongings

266
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,620
from it into the hidden compartment
in the study.

267
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,080
Won't there be

268
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,520
an opportunity then?

269
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,240
Divorce damages
the honor of the Wei Family.

270
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,710
It won't be easy.

271
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,590
You'll have to endure more hardship.

272
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,950
What's more hardship

273
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,360
after decades?

274
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,710
As long as I can leave him,

275
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,000
I can bear

276
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,190
any hardship.

277
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,830
I've been assigned
to investigate Wei Xian.

278
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,150
He's involved

279
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,280
in my mentor's case.

280
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,400
(If he really framed Mr. Su,)

281
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,530
(there might be)

282
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,600
(clues inside the treasure chest)

283
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,240
(that Buddy wants.)

284
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,590
(Both publicly and privately,)

285
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,240
(I must help Madam Wei)

286
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,400
(get a divorce.)

287
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,030
Help!

288
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,550
Assassin!

289
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,910
- Stop!
- Help!

290
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,030
Die here!

291
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,630
Buddy!

292
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,430
Are you okay?

293
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,670
I'm fine.

294
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,240
Keep up!

295
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,310
What's going on?

296
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,120
Someone broke into my room

297
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,360
and tried to kill me!

298
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,360
As a reviewer of the Supreme Court,

299
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,880
you're trespassing

300
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,190
and breaking the law! What do you want?

301
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,000
Returning home tonight,

302
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,550
I heard cries

303
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,320
for help.

304
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,310
So I came to rescue her.

305
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,790
Emergency justifies intervention.

306
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,430
My apologies.

307
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,160
However, I've heard you're good

308
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,910
at commanding

309
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,640
and own a large number of guards.

310
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,240
How could I, a passer-by,

311
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,430
hear the cries,

312
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,840
while you

313
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,280
have just arrived?

314
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,070
Reviewer Lu, you and Fairy Xuanqing

315
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,520
claim an assassin has arrived.

316
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Where is he?

317
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,870
Why can't we see?

318
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,750
He is...

319
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,760
He's gone

320
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,320
during our conversation.

321
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,670
Unfounded accusations.

322
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,150
Fairy Xuanqing,

323
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,200
has your failed exorcism

324
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,550
left you

325
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,070
with delusions?

326
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,360
By the Da'an Codex,

327
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,400
the death penalty awaits rumor-mongers.

328
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:25,910
Guards,

329
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,160
seize her.

330
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,390
Stop it!

331
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,000
Justice belongs to the authorities,

332
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,400
not to you.

333
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,360
And how dare your Wei Family guards

334
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,430
make unauthorized arrests?

335
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,070
Although the assassin escaped,

336
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,590
we didn't see anyone coming or going.

337
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,270
He must have been using the chaos

338
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,790
to infiltrate the ranks
of your subordinates.

339
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,480
Let's take a closer look.

340
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,760
Our general has many subordinates.

341
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,030
We don't have time
for your detailed investigations.

342
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,710
It won't take much effort.

343
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,320
Chief Commander Wei,

344
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,670
just order your men

345
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,710
to put out all the torches.

346
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,950
Surely you won't refuse
even this small request?

347
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,830
If you refuse even this,

348
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,960
I'll have to take these people back

349
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,490
to the Supreme Court for investigation.

350
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,000
Reviewer Lu,
you must have great authority.

351
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,880
Put out the torches!

352
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,030
It's him.

353
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,550
I sprinkled phosphorescent powder

354
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,560
on the assassin's head earlier.

355
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,690
When the torches are extinguished,

356
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,790
he'll be immediately visible.

357
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,950
Speak! Who told you
to assassinate me tonight?

358
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,200
Chief Commander Wei!

359
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,600
How dare you
eliminate witnesses in public?

360
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,630
His breaking into
Fairy's chamber tonight

361
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,030
is clearly motivated by lust.

362
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,550
I'll deal with him
according to military law.

363
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,910
It seems that

364
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,550
this is the same person
who's been pretending

365
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,750
to be a ghost and harassing women
for the past few days.

366
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,950
The mystery has been solved.

367
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,430
Guards!

368
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,600
Take this villain's corpse out

369
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,520
to feed the dogs.

370
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,840
- Yes!
- Yes!

371
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,720
Why did you infiltrate

372
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,760
the Wei Residence?

373
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,550
By request.

374
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,550
Madam Wei wants a divorce.

375
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,910
I stayed to help her.

376
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,510
I never expected that Wei Xian

377
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,000
would try to kill me.

378
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,110
Wei Xian, being investigated,

379
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,000
naturally acts guilty

380
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,150
and paranoid.

381
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,280
He assumed you were my agent

382
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,280
when you entered Wei Residence.

383
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,790
Continue with your plans.

384
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,720
I'll protect you as best I can.

385
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,150
Buddy,

386
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,550
why are you treating me so well?

387
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,000
Why should I...?

388
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,200
You call me Buddy.

389
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,590
A family should act like this.

390
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,760
(With such a good brother,)

391
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,720
(I'm already the happiest person alive.)

392
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,310
(Why investigate my origins)

393
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,830
(and dig into the past?)

394
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,600
♪Don't let us miss growing old together♪

395
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,850
♪May this heart stay true
as the first day♪

396
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,130
♪I'll wait through blooms and dew♪

397
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,680
♪Let greed and wrath fade with the wind♪

398
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,020
♪If all scenes fade to view♪

399
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,950
♪Will you return♪

400
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,040
♪Through years with sincere love♪

401
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,200
♪May all enigmas grow clear♪

402
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,770
♪Counting endless nights♪

403
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,830
(But if not to investigate,)

404
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,960
(why this uneasiness in my heart?)

405
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,280
(What exactly was my past relationship)

406
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,760
(with Buddy?)

407
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,660
(Wei Residence)

408
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,680
Madam Song, you mentioned earlier

409
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
that you were staying longer.

410
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,440
Why the sudden departure?

411
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,760
Wenhui hasn't fully recovered.

412
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,920
I shouldn't leave.

413
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
But my son

414
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,590
suddenly noted to me

415
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,760
that Father was seriously ill.

416
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,720
As a daughter-in-law,

417
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,110
I have to go back to look after him.

418
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,440
Therefore, let's say goodbye for now.

419
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,520
Wenhui,

420
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,790
after he gets better,

421
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,870
I'll come back to see you.

422
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,360
I understand.

423
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,630
So that's how it is.

424
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,760
Madam Song, you can go in peace.

425
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,350
I'll take care of Wenhui.

426
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,360
No need to worry.

427
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,360
Ding Xuan,

428
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,550
see Madam Song out for me.

429
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,800
Chief Commander Wei,

430
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,240
since the attack,

431
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,350
my power has failed

432
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,440
to solve your household's problems.

433
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,280
I must leave.

434
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,590
Please find another expert.

435
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,070
Fairy, you have tried your best
to help our Wei Family.

436
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,240
Since you're leaving voluntarily,

437
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,630
I won't insist.

438
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,680
Ding Xuan, see our guest out.

439
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,860
(Wei Residence)

440
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,760
Both guests, this way.

441
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,040
Close the door.

442
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,520
Wenhui,

443
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,280
tell the truth.

444
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,110
Did you arrange

445
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,150
Madam Song's visit

446
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,790
this time

447
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,390
on purpose?

448
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,910
Wei,

449
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,070
no.

450
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,280
I did not...

451
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,760
Wenhui,

452
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,040
remember my warning.

453
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,600
You

454
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,870
can't escape.

455
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,200
Only I love you

456
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,000
in this world.

457
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,440
Only I

458
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,520
can protect you.

459
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,960
If you try to escape,

460
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,310
you risk not only your life,

461
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,350
but the lives of the entire Du Family.

462
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,440
I... I wouldn't dare.

463
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,350
I... I won't.

464
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,920
Let go of me.

465
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,500
(Siyi Pavilion)
Go!

466
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,390
Let's go!

467
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,630
Follow me to see Master!

468
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,710
Come here!

469
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,960
Madam, save me!

470
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,310
Madam, save me!

471
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,800
Ding Xuan,

472
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,110
what are you doing?

473
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,240
Treacherous old slave!

474
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,920
How dare you escape punishment!

475
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,110
Master,

476
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,280
I discovered

477
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,390
that it was Lyu Chunlian

478
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,870
who did the hauntings.

479
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,310
Explain it.

480
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,150
I was passing by the backyard.

481
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,350
And I saw Lyu Chunlian

482
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,790
sneaking something out of there.

483
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,720
Suspecting theft,

484
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,720
I searched her

485
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,830
and found this!

486
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,710
Lyu Chunlian,

487
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,390
tell me.

488
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,440
Who instructed

489
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,040
your haunting act?

490
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,120
It...

491
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,800
It was...

492
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,310
It was me! I did it!

493
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,480
Not her fault!

494
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,350
As I suspected.

495
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,200
I suspected it a long time ago.

496
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,680
How else would hauntings

497
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,390
suddenly appear?

498
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,790
How could Xu

499
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,060
have suddenly arrived at Wei Residence

500
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,070
and refused to leave?

501
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,190
So this is

502
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,040
all because of you

503
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,960
and your conspiracy.

504
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,440
Haven't I treated you well

505
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,240
since you married into the Wei Family?

506
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,040
So desperate to leave?

507
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,720
You even conspired

508
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,920
with your friends against me!

509
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,480
Treating my sincere heart

510
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,480
like rubbish!

511
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,480
In your heart,

512
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,640
you always despised

513
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,150
my lowly origins.

514
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,720
You regretted marrying down.

515
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,390
Wei,

516
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,760
no!

517
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,240
You shrew!

518
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,560
Liar!

519
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,350
You deceived me!

520
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,630
You lied to me!

521
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,760
Ungrateful wretch!

522
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,940
(Wei Residence)

523
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,390
Why is there still no movement?

524
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,070
Did something happen?

525
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,950
Mother, don't worry.

526
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,280
Everything is planned.

527
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,360
It's going to be okay.

528
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,680
Fairy Xuanqing, what do you think?

529
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,110
I trust you the most now.

530
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,350
Madam, rest assured.

531
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,480
With Reviewer Lu and Mr. Song here,

532
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,720
our chances are better.

533
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,540
(Wei Residence)

534
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,830
Everyone!

535
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,440
- How's it going?
- Hurry up!

536
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,880
Save Madam!

537
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,110
Master is beating her

538
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,240
to death!

539
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,800
Let's go!

540
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,600
Wretch!

541
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,560
- Stop it!
- Madam!

542
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,500
Madam!

543
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,400
Wei Xian,

544
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,390
- Move!
- what are you doing?

545
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,590
A grown man

546
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,350
attacking a defenseless woman!

547
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,640
Such disgraceful behavior.

548
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,790
Shame on you!

549
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,520
Wenhui, are you alright?

550
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,760
It's been more than a decade.

551
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,830
I'm used to it.

552
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,470
Wei Xian!

553
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,310
You beast!

554
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,960
How could you

555
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,200
attack your own wife?

556
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,000
We'll report you
to the Liangzhou Prefecture

557
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,480
and charge you with spousal abuse!

558
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,630
When did I ever abuse my wife?

559
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,390
We all witnessed it!

560
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,960
Wenhui's injuries prove it.

561
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,240
The evidence is conclusive.

562
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,440
How can you deny it?

563
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,510
Those injuries were caused

564
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,760
by her falling.

565
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,150
On the contrary, Madam Song,

566
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,920
you manipulated my wife

567
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,110
under the guise of friendship.

568
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,350
As an outsider,
you have repeatedly interfered

569
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,720
in the Wei Family's affairs

570
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,200
and colluded with my wife

571
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,280
to frame me.

572
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,630
What are

573
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,630
your real intentions?

574
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,880
You...

575
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,350
To frame you?

576
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,760
This is ridiculous!

577
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,520
Chief Commander Wei,

578
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,510
do you think

579
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,630
only Madam Song and her son
can testify today?

580
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,990
Or what?

581
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,950
Can the testimony

582
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,040
of you

583
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,110
and Reviewer Lu

584
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,630
bring me down?

585
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,150
There's another witness.

586
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,840
Physician Liu,

587
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,280
come in, please.

588
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,760
How was Wenhui's condition?

589
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,070
Madam Song,

590
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,590
Madam Wei's injuries

591
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,040
have accumulated

592
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,790
over years

593
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,000
of abuse

594
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,040
and torture.

595
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,790
She requires some medicine

596
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,790
and prolonged treatment.

597
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,240
And the recovery is uncertain.

598
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,710
Chief Commander Wei,

599
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,590
with Physician Liu's testimony,

600
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,240
do you still deny

601
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,870
spousal abuse?

602
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,160
Wei Xian,

603
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,350
either you grant Wenhui

604
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,550
a divorce today,

605
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,270
or physician Liu reports this

606
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,790
to His Majesty.

607
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,440
You pretend

608
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,510
to care for your sick wife

609
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,680
while you abuse her.

610
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,350
Should His Majesty hear of this,

611
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,000
charges of deceiving await!

612
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,480
Let's go.

613
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,360
Ruoyi,

614
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,520
I need to

615
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,350
talk to him.

616
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,550
Wenhui!

617
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,280
Wenhui,

618
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,720
do you really believe them?

619
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,630
Only I love you

620
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,390
in this world.

621
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,070
Only I treat you best.

622
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,280
They...

623
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,000
They're using you

624
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,440
against me!

625
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,430
Wei Xian,

626
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,550
for more than a decade,

627
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,030
I have been

628
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,440
blind.

629
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,440
I was blinded by love

630
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,880
to ignore my family's warning
and friends' suggestions

631
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,920
to marry you.

632
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,000
Let me tell you.

633
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,400
From now on,

634
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,790
I won't be controlled by you.

635
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,310
I demand a divorce!

636
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,920
What if I refuse?

637
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,920
If you don't agree,

638
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,400
I'll sue you

639
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,040
in Liangzhou Prefecture.

640
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,350
I'll expose

641
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,590
all your crimes

642
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,680
of over a decade

643
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,070
in court.

644
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,550
I'll make you, Chief Commander Wei,

645
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,680
infamous in the capital.

646
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,310
And I'll ruin

647
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,760
your career!

648
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,600
Fine.

649
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,480
I agree to the divorce.

650
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,840
Xueyan.

651
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,580
(Signed: Du Wenhui)

652
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,910
Wei Xian,

653
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,350
I've waited

654
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,150
for over a decade for this.

655
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,480
Sign this divorce letter

656
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,040
at once!

657
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,590
All present

658
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,110
are witnesses.

659
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,660
(Signed)

660
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,940
(Signed: Wei Xian)

661
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,620
(Signed: Wei Xian)

662
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,120
Wei Xian,

663
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,760
what trick now?

664
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,720
Tonight's banquet

665
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,310
is for the honor of the Wei Family.

666
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,150
I must make sure
there are no disruptions.

667
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,110
If the banquet

668
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,760
goes smoothly,

669
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,710
I'll give you

670
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,110
the divorce letter tomorrow

671
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,680
and let you go.

672
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,560
Okay.

673
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,830
I agreed.

674
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,310
But return

675
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,550
all my dowry,

676
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,640
including

677
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,310
my father's handmade

678
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,310
treasure chest.

679
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,710
Fine.

680
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,520
I'll give it to you.

681
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,240
Important guests are arriving.

682
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,070
Reviewer Lu and Mr. Song

683
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,270
are outsiders,

684
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:10,150
so it's inappropriate for them
to remain in the inner chambers.

685
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,480
We'll leave.

686
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,280
Madam Wei,

687
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,150
Fairy Xuanqing,

688
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,720
we'll wait outside.

689
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,040
Let us know

690
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,960
if you need anything.

691
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,870
Mother, take care.

692
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,150
Rest assured.

693
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:47,380
(Wei Residence)

694
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,280
It seems you haven't explained

695
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,050
your feelings for Mingshu
to your mother.

696
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,550
Mr. Lu, you witnessed it.

697
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,880
Now my mother is getting on well

698
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
with Mingshu

699
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,760
at the moment.

700
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,030
Because she doesn't know

701
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,960
that you have a crush on Fairy Xuanqing.

702
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,310
If she knew,

703
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,550
what would she do?

704
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,790
Mr. Lu, rest assured.

705
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,350
I'll explain to Mother.

706
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,680
I won't let Mingshu suffer.

707
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,590
Can you defy convention

708
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,720
and family

709
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,200
for a woman?

710
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,590
You always warn me

711
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,870
about Mingshu's unsuitability.

712
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,150
What about you?

713
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,070
Remember

714
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,550
you're Mingshu's brother now.

715
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,780
How will she react
when she learns the truth?

716
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,350
Have you thought about it?

717
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,720
Mingshu values freedom

718
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,150
and liberty.

719
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,830
I, Lu Chang, swear it today.

720
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,760
I'll never bind her with convention.

721
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,830
All worldly pleasures

722
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,310
shall be hers.

723
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,350
If Mingshu accepts me,

724
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,790
I'll never betray her

725
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,390
in my whole life.

726
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,200
Death shall not part us.

727
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,600
Wait.

728
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,550
You're siblings now.

729
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,440
It's too early

730
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,720
for such vows.

731
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,900
(Wei Residence)

732
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,950
Marshal,

733
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,160
I'm honored

734
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,880
by your presence

735
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,590
tonight.

736
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,560
Here.

737
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,280
Let me toast to you.

738
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,720
Chief Commander Wei, did you invite me

739
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,280
just for drinks?

740
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,900
We haven't seen each other
in a long time.

741
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,550
I heard

742
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,920
that you're looking

743
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,830
for a promotion.

744
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,190
As the saying goes,

745
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,710
people move upwards,
while water flows downwards.

746
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,760
It's natural for you

747
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,230
to seek promotion.

748
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,040
But it's unclear

749
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,360
whether you're trying

750
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,320
for public good

751
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,150
or private gain.

752
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,960
I rose from humble beginnings.

753
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,130
I'm grateful for my current position

754
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,750
and I should repay the court.

755
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,110
I hope

756
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,670
you can support me

757
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,920
and believe me

758
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,190
in serving the country.

759
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,110
I believe you

760
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,520
serve the public good.

761
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,960
I should support it.

762
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,960
But it's quite

763
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,270
difficult.

764
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,480
Marshal, you have fought
many battles for Da'an

765
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,800
and made numerous achievements.

766
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,070
However,

767
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,480
the position of your wife
remains vacant for years

768
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,070
without concubines.

769
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,510
I've prepared

770
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,710
a modest gift

771
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,070
to ease your hardship.

772
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,440
I'm Yanshao.

773
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,590
Greetings, Marshal.

774
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,700
May you have boundless blessings.

775
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,800
I must attend to other matters.

776
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,070
I'll take my leave.

777
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,320
Marshal.

778
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,550
Yanshao,

779
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,480
serve Marshal well.

780
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,100

781
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,300

782
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,620

783
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,580

784
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,220

785
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,340

786
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,780

787
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,940
(Divorce Letter. Ledger)

788
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,060
(Divorce Letter)

789
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,160
Zhao Jin.

790
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,470
General.

791
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,510
Deliver the treasure chest

792
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,400
to Madam.

793
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,070
Did you really

794
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,880
divorce Madam?

795
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,150
Zhao Jin,

796
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,840
you've been following me for years.

797
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,920
Don't you understand stalling tactics?

798
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,920
Wenhui will remain

799
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,710
the Wei Family's living person

800
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,480
or dead ghost.

801
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,320
Understood.

802
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,800
I can finally get rid of Wei Xian.

803
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,470
Ruoyi,

804
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,880
Fairy Xuanqing,

805
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,670
thank you both

806
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,040
for rescuing me.

807
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,750
Seeing you stand up

808
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,230
to fight against Wei Xian today

809
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,400
relieves me.

810
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,960
It reminds me

811
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,230
of the brave,

812
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,150
vibrant Wenhui

813
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,270
of 20 years ago.

814
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,550
Yes,

815
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,880
it has been 20 years.

816
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,520
I was blinded by love then

817
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,710
and believed his lies.

818
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,710
I ignored my parents' warnings
and your advice.

819
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,480
Madam Wei, you were too involved

820
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,550
to see clearly.

821
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,270
Exactly.

822
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,750
Outsiders see things more clearly.

823
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,000
Especially about marriage,

824
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,360
be sure to heed your friends and family.

825
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,550
Don't act alone.

826
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,710
Why not

827
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,880
let my unfilial son

828
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,480
hear this?

829
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:24,840
He insisted

830
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,280
on being with that common woman

831
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,190
and disregarding my advice.

832
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,110
He's so...

833
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,800
Fairy, what do you think?

834
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,070
Yes.

835
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,230
Past troubles

836
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,400
are over.

837
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,800
I believe Madam Wei

838
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,190
will be more discerning from now on

839
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,230
and won't be influenced by others.

840
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,630
I've learned from my mistakes.

841
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:47,990
Later,

842
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,960
I'm sure I won't do it again.

843
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,920
I'm relieved

844
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,040
to hear that.

845
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,590
Fairy Xuanqing,

846
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,040
I'll keep

847
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,360
my promise.

848
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,360
Since you helped me escape
from the Wei Family,

849
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,150
I'll repay you properly.

850
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,030
Madam felt unwell earlier.

851
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,400
You two, get a physician.

852
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,720
Nanny Lyu,

853
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,190
we've been ordered

854
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,190
to guard the study.

855
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,110
We can't leave.

856
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,840
Please go find others

857
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,040
in the backyard.

858
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,190
Nonsense!

859
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,030
The banquet is in progress
for the honest guest.

860
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,630
No one is available!

861
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,880
And you,

862
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,840
where do you want to go?

863
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,670
You rascals,

864
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,440
if you dare to slack off,

865
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,070
I'll report you to Madam

866
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,480
and beat you senseless!

867
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,440
(East bookcase

868
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,710

00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,400

873
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,880
Er.

874
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,680
Er...

875
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,320
Zhi.

876
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,160
Zhi...

877
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,340
(Divorce Letter)

878
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,150
Divorce letter

879
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,630
and ledger.

880
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,460
(Ledger)

881
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,710
Guards! Master's in trouble!

882
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,590
Somebody help!

883
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:24,950
Hurry!

884
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,760
Master...

885
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,030
Master!

886
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,280
Wake up!

887
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,360
Master, what happened to you?

888
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,550
Master!

889
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:38,950
Xueyan,

890
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,550
what's going on?

891
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,190
Deputy Zhao found...

892
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,070
Master's body.

893
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,420
He has reported to the authorities.

894
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,840
Liangzhou Prefecture is investigating!

895
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,840
No shouting!

896
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,510
Master!

897
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,360
Master!

898
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,400

Master...

900
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,520
Master...

901
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,750
Inspect everyone

902
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,440
in the house.

903
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,000
No one is exempt.

904
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,510
- Yes!
- Yes!

905
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:48,460
(Eastern Prosperity)

906
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:56,800
Fairy Xuanqing!

907
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,590
Are you the Tian Xuanqing

908
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,440
from Zhongnan Mountain

909
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,550
who can subdue ghosts

910
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:21,630
and vanquish devils?

911
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,070
Yes, my Taoist name

912

You swindling juggler,

914
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,520
why don't you keep on cheating?
