Tangli, Wei Xian is dead.

29
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,590
Your vengeance is fulfilled.

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,590
What more do you want?

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,950
Was there

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,120
no one else but Wei Xian?

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,070
Until my father's death is avenged,

34
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,350
I will always be Su Tang Li.

35
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,790
You're right.

36
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,520
In this world,

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,750
there is only one Su Tang Li.

38
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,180
(Siyun Pavilion)

39
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,400
What I can do is

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,280
to ensure you live well

41
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,870
as Su Tangli.

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,960
Your Highness.

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,400
I will clear your father's name.

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,710
I swear.

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,280
But Tangli,

46
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,800
could you promise me

47
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,150
that you'll leave this matter

48
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,560
to me alone?

49
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,910
As for you…

50
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
You can

51
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,710
just stay by my side

52
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
and witness it.

53
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,710
I'm grateful for your care,

54
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,870
which nearly made me

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,680
forget who I am.

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,910
Rest well, Your Highness.

57
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,820
(Hualang Pavilion)

58
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,560
Isn't Lu Chang your biological brother?

59
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,720
Mingshu, do you know your true origins?

60
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,720
I've longed to ask Mother and Chang,

61
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,750
but I think they've been keeping it from me

62
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,590
and not telling me

63
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,270
for a reason.

64
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,160
If I push recklessly...

65
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,070
You fear it might shatter what you have?

66
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,720
I fear hurting them.

67
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,000
Even without blood ties,

68
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,480
Lu Chang has been devoted to you.

69
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,920
He'd risk his life for you.

70
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,600
Shujun, what do you mean?

71
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,240
When you were

72
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,440
gravely injured,

73
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,680
Lu Chang came out of prison to see you

74
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,190
and was thus severely punished.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
For fearing that it'd affect your recovery,

76
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,190
Madam Zeng didn't let us tell you.

77
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,120
But now, you should know.

78
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,310
Did he come back while I was unconscious?

79
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,560
Of course.

80
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,950
You'd be surprised.

81
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,480
He was almost going crazy with worry,

82
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,120
breaking every rule to come back.

83
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Whatever he said to you,

84
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,750
after the jailers took him away,

85
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,270
you woke

86
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,480
from the coma.

87
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,800
(The one who kissed me then)

88
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,270
(was Buddy?)

89
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,750
I need to go out.

90
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,160
Mingshu, where are you going?

91
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,560
There's something I must clarify.

92
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,470
Qingzhao,

93
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,870
Shujun told me

94
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,360
while I was unconscious,

95
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,950
my brother visited me.

96
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,680
What did he say to me?

97
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,630
He was alone with you.

98
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,510
I don't know what he said.

99
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,680
After he left

100
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,160
and before I woke,

101
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,360
were you the one watching over me?

102
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,510
After he left,

103
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,720
Physician Liu arrived.

104
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,950
Madam Zeng, Wen'an, Shujun,

105
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,950
Lady Yuanying, and I all took turns.

106
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,480
When you awoke,

107
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,360
I was there by chance.

108
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,800
Did anything unusual

109
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,950
happen between us?

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Unusual?

111
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,680
What's your definition?

112
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,920
If I confessed my feelings, does that count?

113
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,480
Stop joking around.

114
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,360
I'm not joking.

115
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,160
I said it more than once.

116
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,720
But you were unconscious

117
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,390
and never heard a word.

118
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,200
Other than that,

119
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
nothing else?

120
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
What else could there be?

121
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,070
(So)

122
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,720

123
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,160

speak plainly.

161
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,510
We're not here

162
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,150
for a friendly meal or chat.

163
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,390
Why the haste?

164
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,360
Shouldn't you be begging me now?

165
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,440
You know you're not one of the Lu Family,

166
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,470
don't you?

167
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,200
So what?

168
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,440
My mother and brother love me.

169
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,360
I'll always belong to the family.

170
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,000
Stop the act.

171

Reading and writing are not surprising.

But designing jewelry

173
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,030
and managing Hualang Pavilion?

174
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,910
Since when do lowborn girls

175
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,200
possess such talents?

176
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,870
I don't know how Mr. Lu

177
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,840
explained this gold bracelet to you.

178
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,750
Its craftsmanship and material are exquisite.

179
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,910
But how did it become yours?

180
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,080
You were Miss Jian,

181
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,910
Jian Mingshu. Daughter of Jian Jinhai,

182
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,600
the richest man in Jianglin.

183
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,510
Once the manager of Jian's Gold Shop.

184
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,480
Jian...

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,790
Jian Jinhai?

186
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,320
What's wrong with him?

187
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,840
Well, Master Jian

188
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,000
is dead.

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,630
He's dead.

190
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,080
How did you know?

191
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,440
When I went back to Jianglin

192
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,390
searching for evidence of my father's case,

193
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,750
I witnessed it with my own eyes.

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,790
Master Jian wasn't the only one slaughtered.

195
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,600
All 37 members of his family

196
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,720
were massacred.

197
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,390
You're the sole survivor.

198
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,680
Impossible.

199
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,120
Mingshu,

200
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,550
you've always condemned me

201
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,790
for going astray for vengeance.

202
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,240
But if you knew your past,

203
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,630
could you stay out of it

204
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,510
and turn a blind eye?

205
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,120
Then my brother,

206
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,840
Lu Chang,

207
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,840
what is he to me?

208
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,750
Why did he claim me as his sister?

209
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,150
He studied at Jian's Academy.

210
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,200
You knew each other as children.

211
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,150
As for why he's been shielding you,

212
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,200
surely you know

213
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,030
that he swore to clear his mentor's name.

214
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,360
What does that matter?

215
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,750
Because you carry

216
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,510
evidence of my father's case.

217
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,240
When my father was imprisoned,

218
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,200
he told your father where the evidence was.

219
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,720
That's why your father was killed.

220
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,390
Now,

221
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,000
you may be the only one left

222
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,440
who knows the truth.

223
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,200
Mr. Lu didn't save you for your sake,

224
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,030
but for mine,

225
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,870
to clear my father's name.

226
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,790
I don't believe it.

227
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,200
You're just trying to use me.

228
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,080
That's the truth. Why would I lie?

229
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,870
His protection is real.

230
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,630
He has his own reasons

231
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,240
for keeping it from me.

232
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,140
Su Tangli,

233
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,840
why should I believe you?

234
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,030
Don't you want to

235
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,910
reclaim your memories and uncover the truth?

236
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,720
Your family was slaughtered.

237
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,120
Can you just turn a blind eye to it?

238
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,390
Or

239
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,390
when you can help Lu Chang,

240
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,030
can you just feign ignorance,

241
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,790
watching him struggle to redress the case?

242
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,630
Su Tangli, what do you want from me?

243
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,080
I...

244
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,870
It's not about what I want.

245
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
It's about what you'll choose.

246
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,630
Regardless,

247
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,510
I should thank you for this.

248
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,680
Don't.

249
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,960
I'm not doing it for you.

250
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,150
(Only now do I know)

251
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,000
(why he gave me the Forgetfulness Box.)

252
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,360
(He hoped I'd shed the weight of the past.)

253
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,790
(But how can I forget such hatred?)

254
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,870
(I'll uncover my origins.)

255
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,200
(And if my search yields proof to help him,)

256
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,080
(wouldn't it be better?)

257
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,750
Qingzhao.

258
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,560
Wen'an.

259
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,270
What brings you here?

260
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,720
I found these

261
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,670
at Hualang Pavilion this morning.

262
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,630
Mingshu wrote a letter

263
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,550
and asked me to give it to you.

264
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,960
Qingzhao,

265
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,390
your affection is deeply cherished.

266
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,360
I'll remember it,

267
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,440
but I cannot reciprocate.

268
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,080
May you find a worthy match

269
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,320
and lasting happiness.

270
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,990
Mingshu.

271
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,030
I'll go to her.

272
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,030
I know her well.

273
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,510
She wouldn't shy from telling me directly.

274
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,350
Wait.

275
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,600
If she wanted to see you,

276
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,480
why did she send it through me?

277
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,790
Think about it.

278
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,790
Everything was fine when we met last time.

279
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,510
Why this sudden shift?

280
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,440
Matters of the heart are unpredictable.

281
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,360
She told me she wouldn't

282
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,270
come to Hualang Pavilion for a few days,

283
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,360
likely to avoid my questions.

284
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,390
Qingzhao,

285
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,440
calm down.

286
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,240
If you feel distressed,

287
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,030
I'd like to have a drink with you.

288
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,790
Where are you going?

289
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,630
Not your concern.

290
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,280
Your Highness,

291
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,960
where is Mingshu?

292
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
She didn't come today.

293
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,720
She said she wouldn't come for a few days.

294
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,080
Didn't you know, Mr. Lu?

295
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,360
What else did she say?

296
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,200
She asked me

297
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,480
to return the lotus hairpin

298
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,520
my cousin gave her.

299
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,280
Thank you.

300
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,580
(Mingshu)

301
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,680
Mother, Buddy,

302
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,830
I'll be away for a few days. All is well.

303
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,240
Don't worry. Mingshu.

304
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,590
Where could she have gone?

305
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,760
Lu Chang,

306
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,670
Madam Zeng.

307
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,220
(To Reviewer Lu of the Supreme Court)

308
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,160
I got off work late today.

309
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,830
The guy on the night shift just got this.

310
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,830
When I saw it was from Huaiyin Post Station,

311
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,790
I thought it was strange

312
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,550
and brought it to you immediately.

313
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,480
Mr. Lu,

314
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,240
Mingshu is going back to Jianglin with me.

315
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,480
- Don't worry.
- Su Tangli?

316
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,350
She took Mingshu back to Jianglin.

317
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,720
No, what is she planning?

318
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,760
No way.

319
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,640
I'm going to Jianglin now

320
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,720
to bring her back.

321
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,280
Chang!

322
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,540
(Jian Residence)

323
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:34,060
(Jian Residence)

324
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,110
This

325
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,750
is the old residence of the Jian Family.

326
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:11,300
(Jian Residence)

327
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,940
(Seal)

328
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,240
Lady Jian's Adult Ceremony

329
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,590
was held in this courtyard.

330
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,440
Though I didn't know the family well,

331
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,880
almost everyone in Jianglin

332
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
knew of it.

333
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,440
That day,

334
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,270
her silken robes and jewels outshone the sun.

335
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,350
Mr. Jane invited many scholars and gentries.

336
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,880
It was a spectacle of unmatched grandeur.

337
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,310
Unfortunately,

338
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,750
the once prestigious family

339
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,590
was reduced

340
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,680
to ashes overnight.

341
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,440
Think harder.

342
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,750
Do you recall anything?

343
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,830
Look around carefully.

344
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,960
This was your home.

345
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,200
You are Jian Mingshu, their daughter.

346
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,030
Take a good look around here.

347
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,240
Don't you remember anything at all?

348
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,030
Your father was Jian Jinhai.

349
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,750
Your mother died young.

350
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,030
Your father had a concubine.

351
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,920
The maid who grew up with you

352
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,640
was called Xiao Qingting, Xiao Qingting!

353
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,310
Does none of this stir a shadow of memory,

354
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,200
Jian Mingshu?

355
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,720
This was your home,

356
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,030
where you grew up!

357
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,760
- How can you forget it all?
- I don't recall.

358
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,740
Jian Mingshu!

359
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,110
Have a look! Think harder, Jian Mingshu!

360
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,680
Your father was Jian Jinhai.

361
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,570
- Think harder!
- I can't remember.

362
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,920
- Think carefully!
- I can't remember.

363
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,640
Think about it, Jian Mingshu!

364
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,640
Open your eyes! This was your home!

365
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,510
Think about it, Jian Mingshu!

366
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,590
Stop pushing her,

367
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,030
or she'll go crazy,

368
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,680
and not even heaven's mercy could save her.

369
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,910
I'm sorry.

370
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,670
I'm sorry.

371
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,630
Mingshu.

372
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,390
Mingshu.

373
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,480
Mingshu.

374
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,590
This is a Western Region physician

375
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,070
I specially invited for you.

376
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,270
He has a unique medical technique

377
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,440
that treats your condition,

378
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,440
and may help you recall
some past memories.

379
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,550
Would you like to give it a try?

380
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,480
Yes.

381
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,270
Move forward.

382
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Don't be afraid.

383
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,070
You'll see a door.

384
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,720
Push it open.

385
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,680
Greetings, My Lady.

386
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,270
We are no longer the carefree youths.

387
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,070
Responsibilities bind us both.

388
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,590
Besides, I'm a few years older than you.

389
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,350
Propriety demands distance.

390
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,590
What propriety?

391
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,110
Chang, don't treat me like a stranger.

392
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,790
I won't hold you back from your aspirations.

393
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,640
After this separation, we meet as strangers.

394
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,440
May your years rise like bamboo.

395
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,640
May you soon find a worthy match

396
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,960
and have a happy marriage.

397
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,630
Leave.

398
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,640
You see?

399
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,440
It's stirred something deep in her mind,

400
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,350
touched her emotions and made her weep.

401
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,720
Protect Mingshu and the physician.

402
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,100
The soul retrieval mustn't be interrupted.

403
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,560
I'll go.

404
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,630
Be careful.

405
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,520
What's wrong?

406
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,830
I don't know either.

407
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,900
(Glorious Sun Conveys Auspiciousness)

408
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,750
Let's run!

409
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,240
A single guard can't hold them off.

410
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,640
We'll die if we stay!

411
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
If you stop now, I'll kill you!

412
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,550
Run!

413
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,320
Kill them!

414
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,960
Mr. Lu.

415
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,030
Mr. Lu, go help the physician!

416
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,340
The sound of the tambourine mustn't stop!

417
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,000
Mingshu!

418
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,590
Mingshu.

419
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,720
Go get them!

420
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,520
Retreat!

421
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,840
Chase!

422
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,000
Stop!

423
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,150
Mingshu.

424
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,430
Mingshu.

425
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,840
Mingshu.

426
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,440
Mr. Lu, I...

427
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,200
I don't have time for your excuses.

428
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,880
You'd better pray she's unharmed.

429
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,510
Mr. Lu, don't worry.

430
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,000
The young lady merely overexerted her mind.

431
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,440
I've applied acupuncture.

432
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,160
She'll be fine after a few days' rest.

433
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,270
Mr. Lu, is Mingshu all right?

434
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,200
I warned you

435
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,310
not to stimulate her

436
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,830
or force her to regain her memories.

437
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,310
Besides, you know

438
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,920
someone in Jianglin tries to kill her.

439
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,720
Yet you still pushed her.

440
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,840
Su Tangli,

441
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,790
you've gone too far.

442
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,240
You wouldn't tell me the truth,

443
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,960
so I have to obtain it my own way.

444
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,680
That doesn't mean you can hurt her.

445
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,240
Do you know you almost killed her?

446
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,480
I'm sorry.

447
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,880
At least you wrote to me.

448
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,920
If something had happened to her,

449
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,200
I don't know what I would've done.

450
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,510
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

451
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,720
I know you care for her.

452
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,550
So I thought for a long time before I came,

453
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,240
and still decided to tell you.

454
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,800
Besides,

455
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,920
I never meant to hurt Mingshu.

456
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,920
But she might know the evidence

457
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,510
left by Jian Jinhai.

458
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,110
Her life

459
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,400
matters to me too.

460
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,920
You only care about your vengeance.

461
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,550
I ignored it when you used others.

462
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,070
But not her.

463
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,030
She's innocent in your father's case.

464
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,830
You can't use her.

465
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,830
This wasn't my doing alone.

466
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,240
It was her and my choice.

467
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,720
Mr. Lu, perhaps you're unaware,

468
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,640
but Mingshu already knows

469
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,550
that she isn't your biological sister.

470
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,240
She's been chasing her past.

471
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,480
Even if I didn't say anything,

472
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,200
she'd uncover the truth eventually.

473
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,920
You made such a reckless choice.

474
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,550
Didn't you think Mother and I would worry?

475
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,560
What about you?

476
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,790
Will you tell me all your choices?

477
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,480
Will you never hide anything from me?

478
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,880
Do what you must.

479
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,750
I'll do whatever I can to protect you.

480
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,040
Buddy,

481
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,400
why are you so good to me?

482
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,880
What have I done to deserve it?

483
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,590
My head hurts.

484
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,880
What happened?

485
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,960
I vaguely recalled something in my dream,

486
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,680
but why did they vanish when I woke up?

487
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,040
I don't care.

488
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,680
If you hurt her again,

489
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,440
I'll never forgive you.

490
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,350
But she knows her identity now.

491
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,640
Why not push further?

492
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,590
Once her memory returns,

493
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,680
we can retrieve Master Jian's evidence.

494
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,030
The case could be overturned soon.

495
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,070
The evidence matters,

496
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,550
but she's barely surviving now.

497
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,000
How can we demand more?

498
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:38,950
You're awake.

499
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,920
Mingshu, how do you feel?

500
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,350
Any memories?

501
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,110
Nothing at all?

502
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,760
I'm sorry

503
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,920
to disappoint you.

504
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,110
All I know is that I'm from the Jian Family

505
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,680
and my whole family's gone.

506
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,030
You'd better leave now.

507
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,310
I want to be alone.

508
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,150
Mingshu,

509
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,870
don't forget

510
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm also your family.

511
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,240
Ever since learning we're not blood-related,

512
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,920
I've been wondering

513
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,550
why you treated me as a sister.

514
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,750
It turns out I might hold evidence

515
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,270
to overturn the case of the Su Family.

516
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,510
It's not what you think.

517
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,440
There are many reasons.

518
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,480
If you want to listen, I'll tell you.

519
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,000
We're not related by blood.

520
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,480
Whatever your reasons,

521
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,790
you've saved me and taken care of me.

522
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I owe you a great debt for that.

523
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,200
Now that I know what you're after,

524
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,550
I'll do my best to help you.

525
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,510
Consider it as my repayment.

526
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,680
I don't need your repayment!

527
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,310
Don't you know

528
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,110
how I feel about you?

529
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,350
Leave. I don't want to see either of you.

530
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,640
The Jian Family was massacred.

531
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,590
The once prestigious family

532
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,360
was reduced

533
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,710
to ashes overnight.

534
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,350
Mingshu.

535
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,960
I said I don't want to see anyone.

536
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,840
Then I'll stay right here.

537
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,110
I won't disturb you.

538
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,400
I won't leave.

539
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,590
However you push me away,

540
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,510
I won't go.

541
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,440
I'm still the brother

542
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,110
you can trust with your life.

543
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,920
If it hurts, speak.

544
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,480
If you don't feel like talking,

545
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,280
I'll be right here with you.

546
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,920
Then tell me,

547
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,360
who exactly

548
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,680
is the murderer

549
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,840
of my entire family?

550
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,030
I want you to tell me

551
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,190
everything you know.

552
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,030
Are you sure you're ready for this?

553
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,280
I've been investigating the case.

554
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,190
The killers were bandits.

555
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,320
But Prefect Gao closed the case,

556
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,320
claiming your family colluded with them.

557
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,110
I suspect

558
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,670
that he colluded with the bandits.

559
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,320
Gao Shicai?

560
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,510
What grudge did he hold against my family?

561
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,360
He framed my late mentor

562
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,150
to climb to power.

563
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,760
He must've known Master Jian

564
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,960
held evidence on the case of the Su Family.

565
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,190
I came to Jianglin this time

566
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,590
to find you

567
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,710
as well as investigate him.

568
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,710
I must bring him to justice.

569
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,920
Do me one more favor.

570
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,160
Name it.

571
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,480
I need to mourn my family.

572
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,120
Lu Chang!

573
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,280
Lu Chang, you're selfish.

574
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,840
You knew how heartbroken she'd be

575
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,920
when she learned her identity.

576
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,920
Calm down.

577
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,630
I haven't asked you yet.

578
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,320
Did you tell her?

579
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,430
How could I?

580
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,590
Would I dig my grave to give you a chance?

581
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,550
Arguing won't change anything now.

582
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,630
This is your fault!

583
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,880
As her brother,

584
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,150
you didn't know what was on her mind.

585
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,110
This is indeed my fault,

586
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,350
but...

587
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,640
Qingzhao.

588
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,600
You're here.

589
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,720
Yes, Mingshu.

590
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,480
What are you doing?

591
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,070
Your brother is preparing breakfast for you.

592
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,160
Sit and eat something.

593
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,150
Eat a little.

594
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,280
Your favorite rice cakes.

595
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,160
Mingshu,

596
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,920
I brought your favorite ring cakes.

597
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,400
Do you have an appetite?

598
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,000
Thank you, Qingzhao,

599
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,600
but I have no appetite.

600
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,800
Mingshu,

601
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,590
since you left,

602
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
I haven't eaten properly.

603
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,840
Look,

604
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,920
I've lost weight from hunger.

605
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,400
I traveled all night

606
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,710
and I'm starving now.

607
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,120
If you don't eat,

608
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,200
I won't either.

609
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,670
Just eat a little with me.

610
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,480
Stay with her.

611
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,150
I'll go find more of her favorite foods.

612
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,630
Mingshu, have some more.

613
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,600
Why is he here?

614
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,550
He came with Prince Rui

615
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,360
to Jianglin for the investigation.

616
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,440
He couldn't wait to see Mingshu,

617
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,110
so he rode here overnight.

618
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,160
Look at you.

619
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,070
You suffered so much to save her

620
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,320
and even got hurt.

621
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,480
Finally, you're free

622
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,630
from the sibling bond.

623
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,000
Now at this critical moment,

624
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,440
you step aside for someone else.

625
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,280
I really don't get you.

626
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,110
Mingshu just learned about her origins.

627
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,880
She is in a bad mood.

628
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,960
Can't you see it?

629
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,440
Qingzhao comforts her better than I can.

630
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,490
- But...
- Enough.

631
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,920
This isn't the time for jealousy.

632
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,760
What matters is helping Mingshu recover.

633
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,500
(Tomb of Master Jian Jinhai, Jianglin)

634
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,740
(Tomb of Fugui)

635
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,340
(Tomb of Xiao Qingting)

636
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,700
(Tomb of Master Jian Jinhai, Jianglin)

637
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,710
Here we are.

638
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,280
After the Jian Family fell,

639
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,280
they couldn't enter their ancestral graveyard

640
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,190
due to their alleged bandit ties.

641
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,030
Uncle Feng,

642
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,030
Ying Xun's father,

643
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,150
had their bodies collected

644
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,630
and buried here.

645
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
Jian Jinhai

646
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,540
(Tomb of Master Jian Jinhai, Jianglin)

647
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,800
was your father.

648
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,480
He was charitable.

649
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,630
He founded Jian's Academy,

650
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,360
providing financial aid to many commoners.

651
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,960
I benefited greatly myself.

652
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
His devotion to you

653
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,710
was well-known in Jianglin.

654
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,760
He made you the manager of Jian's Gold Shop.

655
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,880
So, in Jianglin,

656
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,360
you were the famous female manager.

657
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,240
Then...

658
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,640
My mother...

659
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,440
Why didn't I see her tomb?

660
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,550
Your mother passed early

661
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,150
and was buried in the ancestral graveyard.

662
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,550
She was very kind too.

663
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,670
When my mother and I arrived in Jianglin,

664
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,230
we were penniless

665
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,110
and homeless.

666
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,880
She hired my mother

667
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,110
as an embroideress out of generosity.

668
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,710
That's how we secured shelter.

669
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,920
Our families were connected this way.

670
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,440
So,

671
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,670
we were kind of childhood friends.

672
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,430
That's right.

673
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,120
The one behind

674
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,020
(Tomb of Liu Shun)
is the steward.

675
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,230
He served your family for over a decade.

676
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,430
That's your maid,

677
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,360
(Tomb of Xiao Qingting)
Xiao Qingting.

678
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,280
You used to take her

679
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,680
wherever you went.

680
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,710
These buried underground

681
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,800
should be my dearest ones.

682
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,400
I ought to feel devastated.

683
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,630
Why...

684
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,400
Why can't I remember their voices?

685
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,070
Why can't I recall their faces?

686
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,550
I can't remember anything.

687
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,550
I...

688
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,630
Don't blame yourself.

689
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,150
This isn't your fault.

690
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:33,910
They

691
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,800
would never blame you.

692
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,280
Your family would only

693
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,110
want you to live a good life.
