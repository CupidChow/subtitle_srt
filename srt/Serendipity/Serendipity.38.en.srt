=Episode 38=

28
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,000
I didn't come to talk you

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,950
out of revenge,

30
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,510
but to tell you,

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,000
there are other ways

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,230
we can bring Prince Yu to justice.

33
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,920
I know.

34
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,200
You know?

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,400
No matter what you do,
I'll stand by you.

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,080
Even if it's a dead end.

37
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,680
I just worry

38
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,800
you'll regret hurting the innocent

39
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,870
in the name of revenge.

40
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,800
Don't worry.

41
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,080
I've looked into the weapon inventories

42
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,120
that Cao Hai reported each year.

43
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,080
I found that the equipment losses

44
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,800
of his militia were far higher
than normal.

45
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,150
I suspect

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,870
Prince Yu ordered him to raise
a private army in secret.

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,590
If we capture Cao Hai,

48
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,470
we can get evidence
of Prince Yu's private troops.

49
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,590
His Majesty will not tolerate that.

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,360
Even if Prince Yu is his eldest son,

51
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,840
he won't forgive him easily.

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,750
Treason

53
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,030
is indeed the best path forward.

54
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,680
As for the imperial marriage decree...

55
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,870
Don't worry about it.

56
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,870
I'll find a way.

57
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,240
Before my father died,

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,750
he gave me this.

59
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,800
I used to wonder

60
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,840
if giving me this bracelet
at that moment

61
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,400
meant something,

62
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,080
whether the evidence Mr. Su

63
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,560
left behind might be hidden inside.

64
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,960
But no matter how I looked at it,

65
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,430
I couldn't find anything strange.

66
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,030
Did you find something?

67
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,080
Look here.

68
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,630
There's a hole here.

69
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,510
I think it's a key.

70
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,030
Mother...

71
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,270
I know where my father

72
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,160
hid the evidence!

73
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,120
You're here.

74
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
Tangli, through the

75
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,390
weapon inventories

76
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,000
Cao Hai reported to the Ministry of War,

77
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,390
we discovered he kept weapons
for himself

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,920
to support Prince Yu's private army.

79
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,240
And through the evidence left
by my mentor,

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,950
we found the ledgers
of that private army.

81
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,270
Raising private troops is treason.

82
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,680
His Majesty will never let that go.

83
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,600
As long as we catch Cao Hai

84
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,390
and locate the private forces,

85
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,630
we can bring Prince Yu to justice.

86
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,480
The clues left by my father,

87
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,040
you found it?

88
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,560
My father hid them

89
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,680
inside a jade statue.

90
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,160
That statue is in the Lin household.

91
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,160
And the key was hidden in that bracelet.

92
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,680
It turns out the evidence

93
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,120
was here all along.

94
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,720
I came today

95
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,510
to discuss with you

96
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,830
whether the plan you and Mingshu
made before

97
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,720
could be put on hold for now.

98
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,070
We've confirmed

99
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,720
the bandits who wiped out
the Jian family

100
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,600
were sent by Cao Hai.

101
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,920
I suspect those "bandits" were

102
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,390
Prince Yu's private soldiers
in disguise.

103
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,310
After the massacre,

104
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,680
Cao Hai wanted to kill

105
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,630
all witnesses.

106
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,650
But one of them, Jiao Chunzhu,

107
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,700
managed to escape.

108
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,390
We've tracked him down.

109
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,510
We can use him to locate Cao Hai,

110
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,270
then use Cao Hai to expose Prince Yu.

111
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,510
With both witness and evidence,

112
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,800
Prince Yu won't escape.

113
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,160
So you feel the same?

114
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,360
Blood for blood may bring
momentary satisfaction,

115
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,270
but in the end,

116
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,920
it only drags others down with you.

117
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,920
If we let Prince Yu die

118
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,590
with the dignity of a royal,

119
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,950
that would be too easy.

120
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,160
Now that we have proof

121
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,310
he raised a private army,

122
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,750
we can strip him of everything,

123
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,680
ruin him completely.

124
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,920
Wouldn't that be more satisfying?

125
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,400
Fine.

126
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,040
As long as it can lead to Prince Yu's

127
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
betrayal by all and eternal ruin,

128
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll cooperate with you.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,840
In that case,

130
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,390
there's no time to waste.

131
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,480
Mingshu and I will draw out
Jiao Chunzhu.

132
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,190
You'll be removing

133
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,510
the gunpowder in the Lin household.

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,840
Alright.

135
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,070
I'll take care of it.

136
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,560
This time, we'll eliminate Prince Yu.

137
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,510
What's this?

138
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,830
Clothing from the state of Li.

139
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,070
From what I've heard,

140
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,190
Jiao Chunzhu has been on the run
for years,

141
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,190
robbing merchants

142
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,270
as he goes.

143
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,180
Recently, through the Canal Guild,
we learned

144
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,750
he's targeting a couple from Li state

145
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,680
who made some money

146
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,430
and plan to return home.

147
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,160
I've spoken to the couple,

148
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,480
told them the truth,

149
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,600
and persuaded them to take
the water route home.

150
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,870
We'll disguise ourselves as them

151
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,240
and travel by land

152
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,430
to lure Jiao Chunzhu out.

153
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,340
Well...

154
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,310
Do that couple have any specific traits?

155
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,830
Shouldn't we rehearse beforehand

156
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,270
to avoid blowing our cover?

157
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,560
It's said

158
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,120
the man in that couple

159
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,630
married into the woman's family.

160
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,030
He's utterly henpecked.

161
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,630
All the family business

162
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,900
is managed by his wife.

163
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,550
He usually just stays at home

164
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,080
taking care of her needs.

165
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,630
That's why his wife

166
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,870
is so arrogant and domineering.

167
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,200
Henpecked, huh?

168
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,840
Got it.

169
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,580
(Yunchuan Inn)

170
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,510
Careful, my dear.

171
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,440
Slow down, my dear.

172
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,720
Sir, please have a seat.

173
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,790
Wipe it!

174
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,630
Please, my dear, have a seat.

175
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,960
Are you staying

176
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,390
for a meal or for lodging?

177
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,630
Both.

178
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,870
And what would you like to eat?

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,670
Lychee kidneys, mandarin fish porridge,

180
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,440
plum blossom cakes, crisp trio,

181
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,720
bamboo shoot dumplings, fried quail,

182
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,240
mutton and chive cakes, stewed lamb.

183
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,670
All of these are my wife's favorites.

184
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,510
Bring them at once.

185
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,630
Esteemed guest,

186
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,670
you've ordered

187
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,080
quite a few of our house specialties.

188
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,480
This would cost quite a bit of silver.

189
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,670
Please settle the bill first.

190
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,150
Only then can we serve you.

191
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,750
You're looking down on me?

192
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,750
You think I don't have
that little silver?

193
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,560
My dear, my dear.

194
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,910
We're traveling,

195
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,870
best not to

196
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,030
flaunt our wealth.

197
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,670
You're lecturing me now?

198
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,240
You're getting bold, huh?

199
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,080
Sit down!

200
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,080
I wouldn't dare.

201
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,240
You are the boss in our house.

202
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I am the boss?

203
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,750
Then who was it that refused
to marry me back then?

204
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,710
What did you say,

205
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,750
I was ruthless,

206
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
greedy,

207
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,150
you'd marry anyone but me?

208
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,670
Well, I was young and foolish back then.

209
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,910
You are beautiful, kind,
and talented in business.

210
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,510
I, your humble husband,

211
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,720
am but a fool.

212
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,630
Good that you know.

213
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,510
Now go!

214
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,870
I'll tell the kitchen right away.

215
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,870
Prepare the very best room.

216
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,790
All the utensils and supplies inside,

217
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,080
change them out for brand new.

218
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,550
I don't use filthy things.

219
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,270
Certainly! The very best room!

220
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,740
(Zhan Yi)

221
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,480
Boss, they must be that couple

222
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,550
from the Li state.

223
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,110
Good.

224
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,510
Go find out more.

225
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,440
(Jiao Chunzhu)

226
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,630
See how many people are with them,

227
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,080
how much gold and silver they carry,

228
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,600
if they have any background,

229
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,200
and how many guards they have.

230
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,750
Got it.

231
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,720
We're always the ones hauling things.

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,440
Couldn't they hire more help?

233
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,390
Watch where you're going!

234
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,270
Sorry, sorry,

235
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,200
sorry!

236
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,480
Really sorry.

237
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,750
Boss!

238
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,110
How is it?

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,910
I saw with my own eyes.

240
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,240
That couple's brought

241
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,960
whole chests of gold and silver.

242
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,000
And they're merchants
from another region,

243
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,750
so they've got no local ties.

244
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,510
They are completely vulnerable.

245
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,000
Perfect.

246
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,360
But there are too many people
at the inn.

247
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
It's hard to make a move.

248
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
We can wait till they leave the city

249
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,340
- and strike.
- Really?

250
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,390
Well done.

251
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,350
Brothers,

252
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,670
we feast tomorrow!

253
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,390
Okay! Good!

254
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,960
Nobody move!

255
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,230
Drop your weapons!

256
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,600
If you want to live,

257
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,560
drop the blades.

258
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,960
Drop them!

259
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,160
Boss,

260
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,080
these are all stones!

261
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,230
It's a trap!

262
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,320
Retreat!

263
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,440
- A trap!
- Go!

264
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,320
Master Jiao, wait!

265
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,670
We have a big deal we'd like to

266
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,510
discuss with you.

267
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,240
We had no choice

268
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,320
but to meet you this way.

269
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,360
Please don't

270
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,200
take offense.

271
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,630
You're not

272
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,750
merchants from Li?

273
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,390
Then who are you?

274
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,480
I am Lu Chang, from Jianglin.

275
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,800
And this one,

276
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,120
you should know her.

277
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,840
My surname is Jian.

278
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,550
Jian family of Jianglin,

279
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sure you know it well.

280
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,320
You were there that night, weren't you?

281
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,840
But don't worry,

282
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,720
the guilty will face justice.

283
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,910
I know it was Cao Hai
who ordered you that night.

284
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,480
Just like you,

285
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,390
I've been hunted

286
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,550
by him ever since.

287
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,750
I had nowhere to go,

288
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,870
became a fugitive in my own land.

289
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,870
Today,

290
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,790
I came to make a deal

291
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,120
with you, Master Jiao.

292
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,080
I want to offer
ten thousand taels of gold

293
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,030
in exchange for your help
in avenging my blood feud.

294
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,440
Would you be willing?

295
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,790
Avenge your blood feud?

296
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,440
Ten thousand taels of gold?

297
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,510
Quite a bold offer.

298
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,480
Your Jian family was massacred
that night,

299
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,870
and all your possessions were looted.

300
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,720
Where would you get that money?

301
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,270
Please look at this.

302
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,000
(Jian's Gold Shop)
This is from the Lin family.

303
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,910
I believe you can see clearly.

304
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,910
This was once property
of the Jian family.

305
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,800
What do you mean?

306
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,720
Why would this be in the Lin household?

307
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,870
You may not know,

308
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,510
Cao Hai

309
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,150
is the son of old madam Lin.

310
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,960
After he looted the Jian family,

311
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,870
he stashed the valuables

312
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,720
in the ancestral hall of the Lin family.

313
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,080
Roughly estimated,

314
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,960
there's about
ten thousand taels of gold.

315
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,440
And just in these few days,

316
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,510
it happens to be Madam Lin's

317
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,790
birthday banquet.

318
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Cao Hai will return home for the event,

319
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,200
and he won't bring many guards.

320
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,320
So, would you be willing

321
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,480
to make this trip with us?

322
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,790
All the Jian family's wealth,

323
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,000
I want none of it.

324
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,120
You can take it all.

325
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,670
I only hope you'll help me

326
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,750
and yourself

327
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,510
kill Cao Hai and take revenge.

328
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,870
Why do I feel like you're setting me up?

329
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,650
Planning to sit back
and reap the benefits?

330
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,440
Think about it,

331
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,720
what if I just kill both of you now,

332
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,030
and go take the gold myself?

333
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,390
Wouldn't that be safer?

334
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,870
The Lin estate has solid defenses,

335
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,320
and is guarded by village soldiers.

336
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,670
With all due respect, Master Jiao,

337
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,870
do you really think

338
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,320
your men can break in without injury?

339
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,080
Even if you do force your way in,

340
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,840
Cao Hai's reinforcements
will likely arrive.

341
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,040
Go on.

342
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,080
I've already infiltrated the Lin family.

343
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,200
With my help from within,

344
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,510
you could enter

345
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,200
without losing a single man.

346
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,480
So in this case,

347
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,670
working with us

348
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,910
is clearly more profitable

349
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,120
than killing us.

350
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,320
Master Jiao,

351
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,000
we have no power, no influence,

352
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,480
what could we gain by betraying you?

353
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,790
You can send your men to investigate

354
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,030
and verify what we've said.

355
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,510
Master Jiao,

356
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,080
Cao Hai is the one who made us homeless,

357
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,910
who destroyed our families.

358
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,080
With such an opportunity,

359
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,120
don't you want revenge?

360
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,750
Very well.

361
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,270
I'll look into it.

362
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,670
If what you said proves true,

363
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,480
I wouldn't mind going along with you.

364
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,000
But if you're lying,

365
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,680
then I'll just kill you another day.

366
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,520
Alright.

367
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,270
Thank you, Master Jiao.

368
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,640
Take that kylin as a deposit,

369
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,240
a small gesture

370
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,320
for your trouble.

371
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,590
Lu Chang,

372
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,030
you've finally returned.

373
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,210
The moment I got your plan
to deal with Prince Yu,

374
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,590
I brought men and rushed over.

375
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,320
Thank goodness

376
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,640
you're all safe.

377
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,830
Now I can rest easy.

378
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,510
Greetings, Your Highness.

379
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,510
Thank you for coming to our aid.

380
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,870
Lu Chang,

381
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,070
you and Mingshu...

382
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,680
Mingshu and I

383
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,790
have decided to face this together.

384
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,950
Mingshu.

385
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
The Ministry of Rites

386
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,400
has already chosen a date

387
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
for your marriage to Qingzhao.

388
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,590
It will be in one month.

389
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,520
What?

390
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,110
But I submitted a formal rejection!

391
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,480
What rejection?

392
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,610
Did I do something foolish?

393
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,920
The most foolish thing you did

394
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,940
was leaving me behind.

395
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,640
But it's fine now,

396
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,480
that mistake has been corrected.

397
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,720
As for the marriage,

398
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,510
don't worry.

399
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,640
We'll find a way.

400
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,550
Didn't we agree

401
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,000
to face everything together?

402
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,110
But this is an imperial decree.

403
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,400
I truly can't think of any way
out of it.

404
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,510
Maybe if we expose

405
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,400
Prince Yu's plot to raise private troops

406
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,880
and rebel against the throne,

407
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,070
the Emperor will show mercy

408
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,400
and dissolve your marriage
to Song Qingzhao.

409
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,030
Would that work?

410
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,110
Even if the Emperor is benevolent,

411
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,720
it affects the royal family's dignity.

412
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,680
It won't be easy to reverse.

413
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,830
If we succeed in this plan,

414
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,830
and with Prince Rui's support,

415
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,310
there will be a way.

416
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,910
I don't care.

417
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,640
Wherever you are, that's where I'll be.

418
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,110
(Mingshu,)

419
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,400
(I'll stand with you.)

420
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,680
(But if the decree doesn't change,)

421
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,110
(will you...)

422
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,640
Thanks for putting

423
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,480
so much thought into
the imperial marriage decree.

424
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,400
But for now,

425
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,880
why don't we set that matter aside?

426
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,270
What's most important now

427
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,270
is capturing Prince Yu and Cao Hai.

428
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,240
Mingshu is right.

429
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,680
If we can resolve the Prince Yu case,

430
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,110
perhaps His Majesty will reconsider

431
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,790
and withdraw the decree.

432
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,910
Lu Chang,

433
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,510
please tell us

434
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,680
the details.

435
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,480
According to investigation,

436
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,350
Cao Hai will arrive in Ning'an

437
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,880
three days before the birthday banquet.

438
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,920
We've already lured Jiao Chunzhu

439
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,640
to strike the Lin family
five days in advance,

440
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,680
making him believe he can loot
the estate before Cao Hai returns,

441
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,440
and set traps specifically for Cao Hai.

442
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,270
Meanwhile, I secretly sent someone

443
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,680
to leak the news of Jiao Chunzhu's
early move

444
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,680
to Cao Hai, without arousing suspicion.

445
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,070
I believe he'll return in time.

446
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,110
Good.

447
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,870
Success or failure

448
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,920
hinges on this.

449
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,300
(Lin Residence)

450
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,800
Drink up!

451
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,350
Cheers!

452
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,880
Come on, another round!

453
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,580
Eat more!

454
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,940
Try this meat!

455
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,800
Madam, time to eat.

456
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,220
Madam, time to eat.

457
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,480
Shu,

458
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,510
please join us.

459
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,400
You've been through so much.

460
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,000
So young, yet spending

461
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,880
your days with an old woman like me,

462
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,960
eating all these bland dishes.

463
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,200
I'm used to eating vegetarian.

464
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,000
What's wrong?

465
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,920
Don't like the food?

466
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,390
No.

467
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,920
I'm just not very hungry.

468
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,350
Then wait till you're hungry,

469
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,750
and go outside

470
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,830
to eat some meat with the others

471
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,680
and treat yourself.

472
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,070
Why does my head

473
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,510
feel heavy?

474
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,240
Madam, what's wrong?

475
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,390
Brothers!

476
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,960
Our good day has come!

477
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,800
Move in!

478
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,760
You're awake?

479
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,070
Then get on your knees.

480
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,560
Kneel!

481
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,760
Shu...

482
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,300
You...

483
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,270
My name is not Shu.

484
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,240
My surname is Jian.

485
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,920
You all must have heard of it.

486
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,960
Last year in Jianglin,
there was a massacre

487
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,350
of an entire household.

488
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,920
You've all heard of it, right?

489
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,310
I am the only daughter of Jian family,

490
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,480
and

491
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,440
the sole survivor.

492
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,350
Then...

493
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,920
Shu,

494
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,300
sorry,

495
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,980
Miss Jian,

496
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,100
why are you...

497
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,100
What you mean to ask is

498
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,020
why am I in your household,

499
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,900
and why did I drug

500
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
and tie up everyone here?

501
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,500
Perhaps you should ask
a different question,

502
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,540
such as:

503
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,700
Who was truly behind the Jian family

504
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,110
massacre?

505
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,980
Answer that,

506
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
and all your other questions

507
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,980
will be answered.

508
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,460
Yes.

509
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,220
You guessed correctly.

510
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,220
It was your son,

511
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,500
Cao Hai.

512
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,560
No.

513
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,460
Impossible.

514
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,620
My son has been to war.

515
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,900
He earned military merit,

516
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,420
received honors from the royal court.

517
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,700
He's the general stationed in Jianglin.

518
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,620
He couldn't have

519
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,860
committed such a crime.

520
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,820
You must be mistaken.

521
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,900
Madam,

522
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,300
that Guanyin statue you kneel before,

523
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,220
you don't know where it came from,
do you?

524
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,420
Let me tell you.

525
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,060
That Guanyin image

526
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,060
was carved by my father, Jian Jinhai,

527
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,220
chisel by chisel,

528
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,340
based on my mother's likeness.

529
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,940
It was a gift

530
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,300
he gave to her many years ago.

531
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,900
After she passed,

532
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,410
it was kept in my father's room.

533
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,500
That

534
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,620
is my mother's likeness.

535
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,300
The one you've been worshipping

536
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,620
is not the Bodhisattva Guanyin,

537
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,500
but my mother.

538
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,700
But...

539
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,900
But you weren't wrong to kneel.

540
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,020
Your whole family

541
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,380
should kneel before my mother,

542
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,900
and before the

543
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,620
thirty-seven souls of the Jian family.

544
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,100
No, no.

545
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,490
That's not true.

546
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,260
This must be a misunderstanding.

547
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,380
Miss Jian,

548
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,580
you must be mistaken.

549
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,100
Mistaken?

550
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,300
Madam Lin,

551
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,900
are the chests of treasure
hidden in your

552
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,900
ancestral hall also a "mistake"?

553
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,140
Even if you claim ignorance,

554
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,340
with so many chests of treasure
stored there,

555
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,220
you felt no guilt?

556
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,100
Do you even wonder
how a military officer like Cao Hai

557
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,100
with his modest annual salary

558
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,300
could amass such vast wealth?

559
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,260
Madam Lin,

560
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,150
you speak so piously of Buddhas,

561
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,140
but do you know that the Guanyin
you kneel to,

562
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,580
the food you eat, the clothes you wear,

563
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,900
every coin you spend
in the name of charity,

564
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,580
is all stained with the blood
of my family?

565
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,860
No...

566
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,840
No...

567
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,860
That's not true...

568
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,060
Miss Jian,

569
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,340
your family

570
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,420
were attacked by bandits.

571
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,500
My son only wiped out those bandits

572
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,700
and happened to claim
some spoils of war.

573
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,900
If anything,

574
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,740
my son

575
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,900
avenged your family.

576
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,380
You should be grateful to us!

577
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,900
How dare you twist the truth!

578
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,700
Then what about Madam Zhou?

579
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,420
If she hadn't carried
your Lin family's bloodline,

580
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,140
she'd have been dead long ago.

581
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,660
Concubine Zhou...

582
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,340
I... I never intended to kill her!

583
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,580
Once she gave birth,

584
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,640
I was going to let her go!

585
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,340
Why did you allow Cao Hai

586
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,940
to blind her, cripple her?

587
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,780
Wasn't it just so she couldn't escape

588
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,060
and expose you all?

589
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,780
You eat vegetarian, chant prayers,

590
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,620
what kind of "virtue" is that?

591
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,360
- I...
- If the Buddhas have eyes,

592
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,060
they would never accept your offerings.

593
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,700
Miss Jian,

594
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,620
you schemed your way

595
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,300
into our house,

596
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,260
captured all of us,

597
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,060
what exactly do you want?

598
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,020
What do I want?

599
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,420
I want your entire family

600
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,300
to kneel before my mother.

601
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,520
I want you to repent

602
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,400
for the thirty-seven lives
of the Jian family.

603
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,100
Kneel and bow your heads!

604
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,940
(Lin Ancestral Hall)
Found it! We found them all!

605
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,900
Boss! We found the treasure!

606
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,740
Look!

607
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,500
We're rich, brothers!

608
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,420
Load it all onto the cart!

609
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,900
Come on, load it up!

610
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,900
Cao Hai?

611
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,220
This is a trap?

612
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,980
Brothers!

613
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,820
The good days are coming!

614
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,340
Fight them!

615
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,180
Go!

616
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,040
Charge!

617
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,140
Get them!

618
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,020
Madam Liu?

619
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,580
Madam Liu?

620
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,700
Mingshu is already making her move?

621
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,100
I can't sit back and do nothing now.

622
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,580
Cao Hai.

623
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,380
Take off Jiao Chunzhu's head now.

624
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,260
- Don't move!
- Prince Rui is here!

625
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,660
Prince Yu, you still refuse to stop?

626
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,740
Prince Rui,

627
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,620
I came to Ning'an

628
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,060
with imperial permission

629
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,380
to celebrate my nursemaid's birthday.

630
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,180
And now you collude with bandits

631
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,300
to stage this entire act,

632
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,820
what is your true intent?

633
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,940
Prince Yu,

634
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,940
Mingshu has already found

635
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,340
the evidence Su Changhua gathered

636
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,340
proving your crime
of keeping private troops.

637
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,780
Jiao Chunzhu and Cao Hai,

638
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,580
one is your private soldier,

639
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,450
the other

640
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,380
assisted in raising your private army.

641
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,900
Raising private troops
is tantamount to treason.

642
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,100
With both evidence and witnesses
in hand,

643
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,100
you'd best surrender now!

644
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,380
Don't celebrate too early.

645
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,500
As long as I live,

646
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,500
this fight

647
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,060
isn't over.

648
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,980
Guards!

649
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,200
Take Prince Yu

650
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,140
and Cao Hai

651
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,180
back to Ning'an Government Office!

652
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,180
Throw the rest

653
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,260
into prison immediately!

654
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,100
Yes, sir!

655
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,700
Move!

656
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,340
Cao Hai!

657
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,300
I'll make you repay

658
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,580
the blood debt of thirty-seven lives

659
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,860
from the Jian family today!

660
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,580
Mingshu!

661
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,700
Mingshu!

662
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,580
He's already dead.

663
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,100
It's over now.

664
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,740
It's all over.

665
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,140
It's okay.

666
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,700
He's dead.

667
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,340
It's over.

668
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,660
Help me...

669
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,620
Help...

670
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,660
Help...

671
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,580
Help me...

672
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,860
Save me...

673
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,060
(Lin Residence)

674
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,780
How is it?

675
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,020
The child is stillborn.

676
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,860
Madam Zhou has lost too much blood.

677
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,300
I fear

678
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,700
she can't be saved.

679
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,780
It's retribution.

680
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,780
It's retribution.

681
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:30,020
I doomed the Jian family.

682
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,500
I...

683
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,780
I failed them all.

684
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,140
The damage is done.

685
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,820
The dead cannot return.

686
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,700
What's the use in saying all this now?

687
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,980
I know

688
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,820
I brought this fate

689
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,180
upon myself.

690
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,900
Even if I fall to the deepest hell

691
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,260
and suffer endless torture,

692
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,540
it still won't redeem

693
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,260
the sins I've committed.

694
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,820
Mingshu...

695
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,620
Mingshu...

696
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,780
All I hope for

697
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,940
in my next life

698
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,140
is to be an ox or a horse

699
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,180
to

700
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,620
repay

701
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,140
