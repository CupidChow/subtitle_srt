You swindling juggler,

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,950
why don't you keep on cheating?

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,070
Lu Mingshu,

31
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,150
it's you again!

32
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,070
I'm Lu Mingshu. Greetings,

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,760
Governor Jia.

34
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,760
You're involved in Songling Academy.

35
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,000
Now you're also involved

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,950
in the murder case here.

37
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,760
You keep

38
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,920
disguising yourself

39
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,150
with endless tricks.

40
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,280
You must be connected

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,790
to this case.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,920
My disguise

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,150
was sent

44
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,950
to investigate the haunting
at Wei Residence.

45
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,670
I beg you
to conduct a fair investigation.

46
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,360
Guards!

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Take her into custody first.

48
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,630
I'll interrogate her

49
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,960
after questioning the others.

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,800
Yes.

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,520
- Governor Jia, wait!
- Governor Jia, wait!

52
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,520
Mingshu, are you alright?

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,800
So it's Examiner Lu.

54
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,710
Congratulations on

55
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,910
becoming a top scholar

56
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,910
and being promoted to the Supreme Court.

57
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,680
But this case

58
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,090
falls under the jurisdiction
of Liangzhou Prefecture.

59
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,870
Why did you bring

60
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,590
so many officials?

61
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,120
Prince Rui heard

62
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,730
that Chief Commander Wei was murdered.

63
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,150
Given the victim's

64
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,630
high official status,

65
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,750
His Majesty has ordered

66
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,850
the Supreme Court

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,760
to assist Liangzhou Prefecture
in the investigation.

68
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
Ying Xun,

69
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,120
secure the scene

70
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,150
right now

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,680
and wait for the coroner.

72
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,560
No one can touch

73
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,150
the body.

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,200
Yes!

75
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,430
We feared your involvement,

76
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,400
so we urgently sought

77
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,770
His Majesty's approval
through Prince Rui

78
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,470
for joint jurisdiction.

79
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,360
Don't worry.

80
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,960
Although you're acting under orders,

81
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,750
Lu Mingshu

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,020
disguised herself as a Taoist
to infiltrate the Wei Residence

83
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,800
with clear murderous intent.

84
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,200
I'm enforcing

85
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,120
the law.

86
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,520
She must cooperate

87
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,310
with the investigation,

88
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,470
but you have

89
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,960
no authority to arrest her.

90
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,590
Since you insist on it,

91
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,430
Lu Mingshu

92
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,470
won't be arrested

93
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,400
for the time being.

94
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,470
It's okay.

95
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,360
The cunning guy wanted to settle

96
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,160
personal scores
under an official pretext.

97
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,680
Without solid evidence

98
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,150
and fearing my position,

99
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,800
he had to back down.

100
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,560
Thank you, Buddy.

101
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,510
Wei Xian's sudden death

102
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,560
is truly

103
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,120
unexpected.

104
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,960
Lu Chang!

105
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,320
Mingshu?

106
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,230
Uncle Wei!

107
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,560
Uncle Wei?

108
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,480
So

109
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,720
you were
Wei Xian's honored guest tonight?

110
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,950
You've visited our house countless times

111
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,190
and befriended our mother,

112
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,560
but we never knew your status.

113
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,750
Official titles are mere formalities,

114
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,120
hardly worth mentioning.

115
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,310
Uncle Wei, why did you

116
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,950
visit the Wei Residence tonight?

117
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,910
Wei Xian invited me

118
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,160
because of his promotion.

119
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,920
I never imagined
that despicable man would...

120
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,270
Enough.

121
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,720
Just as Buddy was tracking down Wei Xian

122
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,870
regarding his mentor's case,

123
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,870
he was killed.

124
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,560
Was he silenced?

125
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,510
We can't be sure yet.

126
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,310
Only finding the killer

127
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,040
will bring clarity.

128
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
Our search

129
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,510
has turned up nothing.

130
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,270
Wei Xian must have been forced

131
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,600
to frame my mentor.

132
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,680
Someone of his cunning

133
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,510
would leave clues.

134
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,600
(I must find Madam Wei quickly.)

135
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,750
(Golden bracelet. One pair)

136
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,510
Wei Xian's gifted bracelet is here.

137
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,510
The ledger shows

138
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,510
that it came from

139
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,440
Jianglin.

140
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,480
Jianglin?

141
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,430
But where exactly?

142
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
The ledger

143
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,070
doesn't say.

144
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,320
(It seems)

145
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,830
(my origins are indeed closely tied)

146
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,920
(to Jianglin.)

147
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,400
Earlier,

148
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,310
when I heard that you

149
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,920
had been summoned for questioning,

150
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,270
I was quite worried.

151
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,430
Madam, rest assured.

152
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,530
The innocent have nothing to fear.

153
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,190
Of course, I'm fine.

154
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,950
But Madam,

155
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,000
how are you?

156
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,800
Wei Xian's cruelty

157
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,270
and wickedness

158
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,070
have finally met

159
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,950
his karmic

160
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,560
retribution.

161
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,750
My only regret

162
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,160
is that the reckoning came too late.

163
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,520
Otherwise...

164
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,950
Otherwise what?

165
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,470
Otherwise,

166
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,750
I could have escaped this misery sooner.

167
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,040
(Ledger)
I found this in the hidden compartment

168
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,920
of Wei Xian's study.

169
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,800
See if it helps.

170
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,380
(Ledger)

171
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,950
Wei Xian's study

172
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,160
was heavily guarded.

173
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,310
How dare you break in?

174
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,200
Lu Mingshu,

175
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,310
you're too reckless!

176
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,390
No risk, no reward.

177
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,630
What's more,

178
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,680
knowing that

179
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,310
you're investigating Mr. Su's case,

180
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,000
I was looking for evidence.

181
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,160
I'll keep

182
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,710
this ledger.

183
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,560
I appreciate your help,

184
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,920
but never take such risks again.

185
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,360
You worry me.

186
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,960
I know.

187
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,240
How can the officials

188
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,660
from Liangzhou Prefecture
handle the case?

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,750
Arresting my maid

190
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,390
and suspecting me?

191
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,460
A madam from the Residence
of Duke of the State

192
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,360
committing murder?

193
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,480
Qingzhao, you must

194
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,000
right this wrong!

195
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,560
Don't let them

196
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,360
slander me!

197
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,270
Calm down, Madam.

198
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,120
Everyone is under suspicion,

199
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,190
regardless of their status.

200
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,190
Even Marshal has been invited
for interrogation.

201
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,120
They can't make

202
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,040
false accusations

203
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,240
without evidence.

204
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,040
Indeed, Mother.

205
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,000
Nobility should rise above pettiness.

206
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,480
We don't argue with them.

207
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,470
Qingzhao,

208
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,390
I vaguely heard

209
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,310
that Lu Mingshu

210
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,360
was here.

211
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,870
And she was

212
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,070
almost arrested as a suspect.

213
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,160
Is that true?

214
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,950
It seems so.

215
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,000
Look!

216
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,360
I warned you

217
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,560
to stay away from her.

218
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,400
See?

219
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,680
Now she's a suspect,

220
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,160
yet you insist on marrying her

221
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,360
without our approval.

222
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,870
Mother, please stop it!

223
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,750
Are you still defending her?

224
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,320
No,

225
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,600
I'm going to confront her!

226
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,000
Where are you going, Mother?

227
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,550
Fairy Xuanqing,

228
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,150
look!

229
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,960
This is my son.

230
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,910
That witch

231
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,750
is eating his heart!

232
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,320
You... Please mediate!

233
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,960
Please argue for me!

234
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,920
Madam,

235
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,550
it's not difficult to meet her.

236
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,390
Actually,

237
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,550
I'm not Tian Xuanqing.

238
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,200
That's my fake name in Wei Residence.

239
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,360
My name is Lu Mingshu.

240
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,840
Names are not important.

241
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,750
You're perfect for me.

242
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,360
What did you say your name was?

243
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,150
Lu Mingshu.

244
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,440
Lu...

245
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,350
Mingshu?

246
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,200
Lu Mingshu?

247
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,030
Which Lu Mingshu?

248
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,150
The... the one he mentioned.

249
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,270
That Lu Mingshu I'm talking about.

250
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,480
That witch, Lu Mingshu?

251
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,320
I'm...

252
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,320
I'm not...

253
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,800
Mother!

254
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,350
It hurts.

255
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,720
My old pain is flaring up again!

256
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,530
Let me help you sit down.

257
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,420
Headache.

258
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,320
Dizziness.

259
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,750
Again.

260
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,930
Are you all right, Mother?

261
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,720
Headache...

262
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,350
Shujun,

263
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,870
you should withdraw
from the Hualang Pavilion.

264
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,480
Prince Rui has barely regained
His Majesty's confidence.

265
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
We must

266
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,120
tread carefully.

267
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,840
Don't give others

268
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,510
the excuse.

269
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,230
Mother,

270
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,550
don't pressure Shujun.

271
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,910
This is inappropriate.

272
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,150
Am I wrong?

273
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,080
You have been accused

274
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,240
of corruption

275
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,910
because of the Hualang Pavilion.

276
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,670
Do you want this

277
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,840
to continue?

278
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,120
I know your concern, Mother.

279
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,870
But false accusations

280
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,040
still persist.

281
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,670
If there were no this excuse,

282
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,240
those people would stop this?

283
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,030
That's why

284
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,240
caution is still necessary.

285
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,080
We're not allowed

286
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,480
to be framed.

287
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,250
But there's nothing wrong

288
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,630
with Shujun's involvement

289
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,030
in Hualang Pavilion.

290
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,800
I promised this

291
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,510
before

292
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,790
the wedding.

293
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,670
Her withdrawal

294
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,550
would suggest

295
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,870
my guilt.

296
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,160
Mother, what do you think?

297
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,550
I understand your concerns, Mother.

298
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,600
I have solutions.

299
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,560
I never thought

300
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,790
I'd cause so much trouble.

301
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,960
Yet you defend me

302
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,670
in front of Mother.

303
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,720
I'll remember

304
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,200
that mercy.

305
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,590
The fault

306
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,240
lies with me.

307
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,120
Your business

308
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
is legitimate.

309
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,000
Mingshu and I

310
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,360
will manage the Hualang Pavilion

311
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,360
or the imperial inspection.

Tonight,

322
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,390
the moon is beautiful.

323
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,120
Tonight, the moon is beautiful.

324
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,900
(Mingcheng Hall)

325
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,000
Is Su Tangli here?

326
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,800
Your Highness,
she's awaiting you in her chamber.

327
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,080
Sit down.

328
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,840
Have a drink with me.

329
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,840
It brings me great joy

330
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,600
to learn of Wei Xian's death.

331
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,830
Your Highness, thank you for helping me

332
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,480
take revenge.

333
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,120
I promised to help you

334
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,670
with your revenge.

335
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,000
With Wei Xian gone,

336
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,720
you can serve me

337
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,480
forever.

338
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,630
Was he really the last person

339
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,870
responsible for

340
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,120
my father's death?

341
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,910
According to my information,

342
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,080
Wei Xian was indeed

343
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,870
the final culprit.

344
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,040
Tangli,

345
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,870
stop this.

346
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,080
From now on,

347
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,100
share in everything I own.

348
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,790
No one will ever disrespect you again.

349
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,910
I'll obey, Your Highness.

350
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,630
Look.

351
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,790
I forgot to drink.

352
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,990
Mingshu!

353
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,000
(If I secretly investigate
my origins in Jianglin,)

354
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,270
(how heartbroken Buddy would be?)

355
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,240
(Once it started,)

356
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,670
(there's no turning back.)

357
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,600
(Should I continue?)

358
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,080
Have you met Madam Wei?

359
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,840
What's wrong?

360
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,120
Something in my eye.

361
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,670
Let me take a look.

362
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,350
Mr. Lu!

363
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,510
What are you doing?

364
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,640
Mingshu has something stuck in her eye.

365
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,920
I'm checking it out.

366
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,070
Remember our agreement.

367
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,940
(Eastern Prosperity)

368
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,830
The time of death

369
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,240
is between mid-Hai hour
and end-Chou hour.

370
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,310
The fatal heart wound

371
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,720
is without struggle.

372
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,030
The victim was drugged.

373
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,030
This explains

374
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,110
why Wei Xian, a martial arts expert,

375
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,240
put up no resistance.

376
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,030
And he was stabbed to death.

377
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,550
According to my findings,

378
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,920
Wei Xian only drank

379
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,200
with Marshal

380
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,590
and Concubine Yanshao

381
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,400
before his death.

382
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,240
He didn't go anywhere else.

383
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,000
He left for the garden

384
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,630
in the middle of the Xu hour.
[Xu hour: from 19:00 to 21:00]

385
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,630
Therefore,

386
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,670
the drug was

387
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,160
probably taken

388
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,000
during the banquet.

389
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,200
Marshal, did you notice

390
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,550
anything unusual?

391
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,960
The drugged wine

392
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,550
came from me.

393
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
Last night,

394
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,000
I mentioned Wei Xian's plan

395
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,960
to control me

396
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,510
with the drugged wine.

397
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,350
Obviously,

398
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,960
he wanted to use Concubine Yanshao

399
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,200
to compromise you.

400
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,920
Since Yanshao belongs to him,

401
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,790
any liaison with her would

402
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,790
give you leverage.

403
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,310
People would think
you occupied his concubine.

404
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,720
As a result,

405
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
you would be

406
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
under his threat.

407
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,200
You would have to join him
in the future.

408
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,920
He thought it was foolproof.

409
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,240
But he couldn't blind my eyes.

410
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,960
After drinking,

411
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,000
Wei Xian excused himself,

412
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,750
leaving Yanshao behind

413
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,200
and waiting for my drug seizure.

414
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,110
And then?

415
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,790
Of course, nothing happened.

416
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,400
I was just trying to make a joke
of Wei Xian.

417
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,510
It wasn't long before I left.

418
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,510
It was

419
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,240
around the end-Xu hour.

420
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,000
Given your physical condition,

421
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,590
Wei Xian's dosage

422
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,000
should be large.

423
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,110
So after drinking,

424
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,350
Wei Xian collapsed quickly.

425
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,240
The killer probably

426
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,880
acted opportunistically

427
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,920
after the discovery

428
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,200
of Wei Xian's faintness.

429
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,510
It means that

430
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
everyone in the Wei Residence
could be a suspect.

431
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,550
So

432
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,880
my earlier suspicion

433
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,640
of Lu Mingshu wasn't unfounded.

434
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,200
On that night,

435
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,200
except for Lady Lu,

436
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,550
everyone else

437
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,240
has an alibi.

438
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,720
Guards,

439
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,790
summon Lu Mingshu!

440
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,630
Yes!

441
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,840
Found it!

442
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,900
(Infinite Heavenly Honor)

443
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,280
Mingshu.

444
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,320
Lu Mingshu,

445
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,440
report your whereabouts

446
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,240
to me

447
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,790
that night.

448
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,620
(Zhi)

449
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,900
(Divorce Letter)

450
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,640
Governor Jia, Reviewer Lu,

451
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,790
we found this in the backyard.

452
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,070
The blade of this dagger

453
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,510
matches the victim's wound.

454
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,000
Probably it's the murder weapon.

455
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,790
Infinite Heavenly Honor.

456
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,400
Lady Lu,

457
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,590
is this

458
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,380
(Infinite Heavenly Honor)
your dagger?

459
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,000
This dagger was indeed brought
into this house by me.

460
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,200
But I didn't kill anyone.

461
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,480
Take her away!

462
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,520
- Stop!
- Stop!

463
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,640
This involves an imperial official,

464
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,330
so I'll take her to the Supreme Court.

465
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,550
No need to bother Liangzhou Prefecture.

466
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,880
Your sister's suspicion is serious.

467
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,270
According to the law,
Liangzhou Prefecture should handle it first.

468
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,640
I'm exercising my authority.

469
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,750
All suspects must be arrested

470
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,790
and detained in Liangzhou Prefecture.

471
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,910
Reviewer Lu,

472
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,680
if you want to take her away
for questioning,

473
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,790
that might be allowed.

474
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,640
But I wonder if you have

475
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,400
any documents
from the Ministry of Justice.

476
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,550
If there are no documents,

477
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,920
please don't interfere

478
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,000
with our Liangzhou Prefecture's
investigation.

479
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,200
Be careful.

480
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,400
I'll find a way to get you out quickly.

481
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,870
Take her away!

482
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,840
I'll go by myself.

483
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,620
I'll find Prince Rui right away

484
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,270
and get the documents
from the Ministry of Justice

485
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,630
to transfer Mingshu
to the Supreme Court.

486
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,750
Mingshu shouldn't be left alone
in prison.

487
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,160
I'll find a way to protect her.

488
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,430
Let's go.

489
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,110
Get in!

490
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,240
Lock the door.

491
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,030
There's a young lady
locked up next door.

492
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,870
Yeah.

493
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,860
What's this all about?

494
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,880
Exactly.

495
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,110
And she's quite pretty.

496
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,240
Buddy!

497
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,720
Buddy...

498
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,190
It's not difficult to issue a document.

499
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,160
But the Minister of Justice

500
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,520
has gone to Ge Village on duty.

501
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,720
He won't be back until tomorrow.

502
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,790
All documents

503
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,440
must wait for his return to sign.

504
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,590
Could you please give me

505
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,620
a token and a handwritten note?

506
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,830
I'll go out to find him.

507
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,840
Okay.

508
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,070
Then go back quickly.

509
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,910
Okay.

510
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,590
These steamed stuffed buns smell great.

511
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,750
- How did it go?
- Let's taste it.

512
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,720
Don't worry, Young Master.

513
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,450
I've already made the arrangements
with the jailers.

514
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,480
When the time comes,

515
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,350
carry this bag

516
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,000
and they'll take you

517
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,440
to Lady Mingshu's cell.

518
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,790
Excellent.

519
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,590
However, this will make you suffer.

520
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,870
Still not enough.

521
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,520
Hit me.

522
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,720
No... This...

523
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,590
I dare not.

524
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,790
Do as I say!

525
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,970
Qingzhao?

526
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,750
Why are you here?

527
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,110
Were you framed too?

528
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,200
Why are you holding your hand?

529
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,160
What's this injury?

530
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,110
Who hit you?

531
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,320
It's nothing.

532
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,070
This injury looks bad,

533
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,400
but it doesn't hurt.

534
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,680
Don't touch it yourself.

535
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,520
Come here. Sit down.

536
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,270
Are you still saying it's nothing?
It's all swollen.

537
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,220
Let me clean it for you.

538
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,640
Don't let it scar you.

539
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,200
Receiving such tender care

540
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,350
from you,

541
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,350
I should thank the guy
who threw the punch.

542
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,270
Don't be silly.

543
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,170
What are you talking about?

544
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,240
Food distribution!

545
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,560
Eat it.

546
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,510
It's finally time to eat.

547
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,350
Tasty.

548
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,200
I'm telling you,
I've been starving all day.

549
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,630
It's so good.

550
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,270
Don't choke, Mingshu.

551
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,480
He's gone.

552
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,110
My apologies.

553
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,260
(Plot effect. No animals harmed.)

554
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,440
Petty scoundrels

555
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,640
are only capable of such tricks.

556
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,110
Mingshu, let's go!

557
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,560
Don't run!

558
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,160
- Buddy?
- Are you okay?

559
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,430
I'm fine.

560
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,950
Let me see.

561
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,790
Such a big cut.

562
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,510
And so much blood was lost.

563
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,110
This injury was

564
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,720
really worth it.

565
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,350
What's going on?

566
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,360
- What happened?
- The document is here.

567
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,590
Who dares make trouble?

568
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,980
(Transfer all prisoners to the Supreme Court.
By Minister of Justice.)

569
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,320
Governor Jia,

570
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,070
I have proof

571
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,880
that the jailer tried to poison me.

572
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,240
Can you prove it?

573
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,880
Examine this steamed bun.

574
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,310
You'll know the truth.

575
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,200
No need for such trouble.

576
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,310
Governor Jia, would you dare to try it?

577
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,790
If His Majesty learns of such filth

578
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,400
in Liangzhou Prefecture,

579
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,480
you might be charged

580
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,270
with negligence.

581
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,910
Governor Jia,

582
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,700
I believe the actions of that jailer

583
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,310
weren't your intention.

584
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,750
But now that
Liangzhou Prefecture is involved.

585
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,220
It's inconvenient for you
to investigate it.

586
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,110
I'll take Lu Mingshu
and this jailer back

587
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,510
to the Supreme Court

588
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,030
for legal interrogation.

589
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,920
Reviewer Lu,

590
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,760
then I'll just

591
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,520
transfer the prisoners

592
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,880
according to the law.

593
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,860
(Residence of Duke of the State)

594
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,720
Madam, rest assured.

595
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,110
Young Master hasn't been
severely injured.

596
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,280
There is no life-threatening danger.

597
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,720
I'll prepare a prescription.

598
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,560
Hurry up.

599
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,950
Deputy Censor Song,

600
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,550
Mr. Song was arrested

601
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,550
and got hurt

602
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,920
to protect my sister.

603
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,400
That was my miscalculation.

604
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,510
I await the punishment of you.

605
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,440
Qingzhao was injured while saving me.

606
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,720
Deputy Censor Song, Madam Song,

607
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,640
this is all my fault.

608
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,480
Father, Mother,

609
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,720
it was the villain who hurt me.

610
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,750
It has nothing to do with them.

611
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,510
Besides, I did it willingly.

612
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,920
Please don't be angry.

613
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,240
You reckless child,

614
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,350
why the urgency?

615
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,510
Do your father and I

616
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,350
seem like unreasonable people?

617
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,320
Mingshu,

618
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,550
Qingzhao's injuries aren't your fault.

619
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,070
What is your fault?

620
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,310
His decision to save you

621
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,830
was his own.

622
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,200
Don't blame yourself.

623
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,750
A man should take the responsibility.

624
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,220
He had a scare this time,

625
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,310
but no real danger.

626
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,640
You don't have to blame yourselves.

627
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:56,300
(He'an Residence)

628
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,000
Buddy,

629
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,870
shouldn't you take me back
to the Supreme Court?

630
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,750
Bringing me back like this,

631
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,550
aren't you afraid of the repercussions?

632
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,110
I've got Prince Rui's permission.

633
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,960
With my official position
as a guarantee,

634
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,350
I'll ensure your whereabouts.

635
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,070
My future

636
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,790
is now in your hands.

637
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,480
So you mustn't run away.

638
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,640
Otherwise, to the ends of the earth,

639
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,680
I'll bring you back for sure.

640
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,900
(He'an Residence)

641
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,870
Mother.

642
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,390
Mingshu!

643
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,670
Mingshu,

644
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,510
- Mother.
- you've returned.

645
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,920
I was so worried.

646
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
Let me see.

647
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,920
Are you hurt?

648
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,830
It's okay. I'm fine.

649
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,640
Good. That's good.

650
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,500
(Residence of Duke of the State)

651
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,590
Young Master!

652
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,440
Lady Lu has come to see you again.

653
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,280
Really?

654
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,440
Then maybe I shouldn't recover too fast.

655
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,970
Otherwise, Mingshu will stop visiting.

656
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,750
Qingzhao!

657
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,920
Mingshu, you're here.

658
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,270
Are you feeling better?

659
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,280
Mr. Lu?

660
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,680
You came too.

661
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,750
You were injured saving Mingshu.

662
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,070
Of course, I should visit you often.

663
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,720
It's just a few flesh wounds.

664
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,790
They shouldn't be serious.

665
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,350
I don't know why

666
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,510
they're healing so slowly.

667
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,440
Why the rush? Take your time to recover.

668
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,080
Young Master,

669
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,240
it's time for medicine.

670
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,800
Okay.

671
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,200
Don't strain

672
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,850
your shoulder injury.

673
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,430
Here.

674
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,070
Give me the medicine.

675
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Let me do it.

676
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,930
I'm the best at administering medicine.

677
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,960
Mr. Lu, let me do it myself.

678
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,110
Your energy and strength

679
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,750
have recovered quite a lot.

680
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,900
I got excited for a moment.

681
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,880
It still hurts a bit.

682
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,310
Since you're the patient,

683
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,070
let me feed you.

684
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,350
Buddy,

685
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,960
don't you have to go to work soon?

686
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,030
Finish your snack and go.

687
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,370
These days,

688
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,550
I'll take care of Qingzhao.

689
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,550
Yeah, Mr. Lu.

690
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,030
Your duties are important.

691
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,440
There's no need to care for me daily.

692
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,320
These are specially bought

693
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,510
from Xingshengchang by me.

694
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,350
Try them.

695
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,480
What's this?

696
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,190
Just a piece of pastry.

697
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,710
It's not a miracle cure.

698
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
Why the grip?

699
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,870
Let go.

700
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,510
I said let go.

701
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,880
If you really want to fight,
nobody gets anything.

702
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,900
(Harmonious Breeze)

703
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,840
Darling, what are you looking for?

704
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,400
Isn't this your family heirloom
reserved for your daughter-in-law?

705
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,260
That's right.

706
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,620
Why are you urgent to give it away?

707
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Aren't you worried?

708
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,400
I'm certainly not anxious.

709
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,710
Yes.

710
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,400
We're different, of course.

711
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,400
You're worried about

712
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
your future in-laws.

713
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,920
I'm worried about my daughter-in-law.

714
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,710
Our Qingzhao

715
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,150
are so devoted to Mingshu.

716
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,280
And Mingshu

717
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,800
is such a wise and kind girl.

718
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,030
As his mother,

719
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,110
of course,

720
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,360
I should help my son.

721
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,640
Qingmei?

722
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,800
Qingmei!

723
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,760
Mingshu!

724
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,840
Mother.

725
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,190
- Madam Song.
- Madam Song.

726
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,840
Mr. Lu,

727
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,800
we're

728
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,510
all family now.

729
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,190
From now on, no need for formalities.

730
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,430
And you,

731
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,440
don't call me

732
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,480
Madam Song.

733
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,110
My maiden name is Xu.

734
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,590
Follow Wen'an

735
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,150
and call me Auntie Xu.

736
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,840
Auntie Xu.

737
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,550
I've been holding

738
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,000
this bracelet for a long time.

739
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,630
I've never worn it either.

740
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,840
I think

741
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,280
it would look better

742
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,150
on a young lady.

743
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,010
Consider it

744
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,110
- a token of my affection.
- Mother,

745
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,440
isn't it your precious...?

746
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,120
Auntie Xu,

747
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,320
I appreciate the sentiment.

748
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,000
But my mother taught me

749
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,930
not to accept precious gifts

750
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,320
from the elders lightly.

751
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,920
Please take it back.

752
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,710
Yes, Mother.

753
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,480
Your sudden gift

754
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,880
might frighten Mingshu.

755
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,710
It's just a bracelet.

756
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,150
Not as serious as you say.

757
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,630
You should accept

758
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,110
my gift.

759
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,110
This bracelet

760
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,440
should be yours.

761
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,320
I...

762
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,760
Madam Song,

763
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,590
as Mingshu said,

764
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,070
if she accepts it,

765
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,510
our mother will scold us.

766
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,480
Yes, Mother.

767
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,710
Since that's the case,

768
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,440
don't pressure Mingshu.

769
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,110
All right then.

770
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,360
It was my fault.

771
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,800
Next time,

772
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,230
when I visit your home,

773
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,800
I'll give it to you properly

774
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,030
in the presence of your mother.

775
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,000
You mustn't refuse

776
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,510
at that time.

777
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,320
Mingshu,

778
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,360
I really like you

779
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,190
from the bottom of my heart.

780
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,190
You should understand

781
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,550
the meaning of that jade bracelet.

782
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,720
Why refuse?

783
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,950
Buddy,

784
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,070
do you want me to accept it?

785
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,600
No.

786
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,230
But I want to know

787
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,320
if you want to accept it.

788
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,110
(With current unclear background,)

789
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,510
(I don't want to think about it at all.)

790
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,590
(But I can't tell Buddy.)

791
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,760
I just don't feel it's the right time.

792
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,680
What is it?

793
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,110
Don't tell me

794
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,440
you've lost interest in Mingshu

795
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,280
and shifted your affection
to another girl.

796
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,960
Mother, don't you know me?

797
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,000
How is that possible?

798
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,440
Then that settles it.

799
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,230
I know you're shy.

800
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,920
So I should

801
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,960
give you a push forward today.

802
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
Everything I do

803
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,280
is for your own good.

804
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,070
I know you mean well.

805
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,510
But I'm afraid

806
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,400
Mingshu isn't ready yet.

807
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,800
What preparation does she need?

808
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,320
Aren't you two devoted to each other?

809
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,320
Your father and I

810
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,070
have discussed this marriage.

811
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,480
It's suitable.

812
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,320
If you agree now,

813
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,560
I'll send a matchmaker
to propose tomorrow.

814
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,420
Really?

815
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,340
Of course, I will.

816
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,110
Not yet.

817
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,320
Proposing now

818
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,570
would be too hasty.

819
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,230
I can't rush it.

820
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,510
You brat,

821
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,710
you're the one who was in a hurry

822
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,670
and in love with Mingshu before.

823
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,690
Now that your father and I

824
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,920
have given in.

825
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,320
You're no longer in a hurry.

826
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,870
Mother,

827
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,510
please listen to me.

828
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,800
Wait a little longer.

829
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,230
You brat,

830
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,510
have I lost control of you?

831
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,720
You're so...

832
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,230
Think carefully yourself.

833
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,510
(He'an Residence)
Yuqing,

834
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,230
I heard Mingshu was unwell.

835
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,230
I brought
some codonopsis roots and others.

836
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,920
Take them to her.

837
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,400
Mingshu has recovered.

838
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,320
She doesn't need them.

839
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,670
I already bought them.

840
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,590
Just take them.

841
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,550
Madam Zeng.

842
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:06,950
Mr. Wei.

843
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,110
I brought some supplements for Mingshu.

844
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,440
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

845
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,800
Marshal?

846
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,070
Director?

847
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,280
You...

848
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,640
Mr. Wei,

849
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,760
please come in.

850
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,980
(He'an Residence)

851
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,840
Give it to me.

852
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,000
She repeatedly refused

853
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,630
the gifts I gave.

854
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,280
She accepted

855
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,480
those from Wei Zhuo.

856
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,870
And she

857
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,070
even calls him

858
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,150
Mr. Wei!

859
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,320
Mr. Wei, you must be curious

860
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,110
about my relationship with Director Lu.

861
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,070
It's no secret.

862
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,880
Lu Wenhan

863
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,710
is Chang's biological father.

864
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,220
(Top Scholar Residence)

865
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,360
To be honest, Marshal.

866
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,840
My wife and child

867
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,960
were separated

868
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,280
from me years ago

869
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,320
because of some misunderstandings.

870
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,070
Now that

871
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,920
we're reunited as a family,

872
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,960
my heart overflows with joy.

873
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,000
Marshal, thank you

874
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,200
for taking care

875
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,840
of my family.

876
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,960
I'm deeply grateful.

877
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,880
Such kindness

878
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,920
will surely be repaid.

879
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,000
You're too kind, Director Lu.

880
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,760
I met Madam Zeng

881
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,630
through fate.

882
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,550
Her noble heart deserves respect.

883
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,230
It's my honor to know her.

884
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,400
Yuqing

885
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,670
is truly a rare, exceptional woman.

886
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,070
There's no need for you

887
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,000
to worry.

888
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,190
I believe

889
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,670
you can understand

890
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,840
my wish

891
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,510
for a family reunion.

892
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,480
I understand

893
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,000
your meaning.

894
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,840
Madam Zeng has a gentle resilience.

895
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:40,590
And she has a strong will.

896
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,070
I hope

897
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,670
you can consider Madam Zeng's feelings

898
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,030
before making

899
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,800
any decisions.

Let me teach you.

903
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,800
Relax your shoulders.

904

Apply your strength.
