Lady,
where are you going?

30
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,310
Let go of me.

31
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,850
Help,

32
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,320
help!

33
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,550
Let me go,

34
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,310
let me go.

35
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,020
Just stop resisting.

36
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,520
Help!

37
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,130
Just stop resisting.

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,350
- Let me go.
- Don't struggle.

39
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,200
Let me go.

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,430
A bandit here.

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,120
(Song Qingzhao)
Sorry for offending you.

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,960
I should thank you
for saving me instead.

43
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,590
- Mingshu.
- Lu Chang.

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
You alright?

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
I'm good.

46
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,580
(Tao Yiqian)

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,910
I'll go see her.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,800
Thank you.

49
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,990
No problem.

50
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,990
Everything is fine.

51
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,590
He was taken down.

52
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,950
Don't panic.

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,630
You saved me.

54
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
Thank you.

55
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,840
It's okay.

56
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,120
It's over already.

57
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,910
And you're fine.

58
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,470
Don't worry.

59
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,240
No one else would

60
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,800
know about this.

61
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,590
Don't worry.

62
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,400
Do you know

63
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,510
who in the inn needs help

64
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,310
apart from you?

65
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,390
My maid and guards.

66
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,920
Could you help me?

67
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
They should have
been drugged.

68
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,240
I'll go find the antidote.

69
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,470
Antidote?

70
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,510
I have Golden-Caged
Toad Venom.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,870
We could give it a shot.

72
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,950
What brought you here?

73
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,920
I was looking for an inn

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,000
on my way to
the capital.

75
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,300
But the bandits had come
before me.

76
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,240
I wanted to save people.

77
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,900
The moment
I got a man down,

78
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,420
I got your help.

79
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,860
Thank you so much.

80
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,260
They're back.

81
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,300
They have only 4 people.

82
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,660
We have a chance.

83
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,460
Who's that?

84
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,260
Lu Chang.

85
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,180
Stop running.

86
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,900
Freeze.

87
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,200
Did you get hurt?

88
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,060
I'm fine.

89
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,900
Buddy?

90
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,180
Buddy!

91
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,020
You're scaring me.

92
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,860
You...

93
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,740
I...

94
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,380
Mingshu, it's me.

95
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,220
If it's the bandit,

96
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,250
I'll revenge even
to the death.

97
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,380
Step forward.

98
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,580
I survived

99
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,740
but you were this close
to kill me.

100
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,980
What?

101
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,860
Why are you
zoning out?

102
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,580
Buddy.

103
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,300
What did you call me?

104
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,220
Buddy.

105
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,620
Buddy?

106
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,780
You finally accept me.

107
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,500
You risked your life
to save me.

108
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,260
You're my brother.

109
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,380
You're always
my buddy.

110
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,460
Fine.

111
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,340
Enough of crying.

112
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,180
It's nothing miserable

113
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,180
to be my sister.

114
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,260
I was scared to death.

115
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,700
I thought
you were dead.

116
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,380
Okay, don't cry.

117
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,540
I'm perfectly fine.

118
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,260
Mother,

119
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,260
sorry for
keeping you await.

120
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,580
I'm alright.

121
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,660
I'm thankful
you're fine.

122
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,380
Have some tea.

123
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,000
Here's the food
and medicine

124
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,060
(Chenxin)
from my lady.

125
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,780
She hopes you could
take a good rest.

126
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,860
And she'll come
to thank you.

127
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,580
Thank her
for caring for us.

128
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,980
Appreciate it.

129
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,940
Mingshu.

130
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,060
What are you doing?

131
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,340
Mother, have some water
to warm you up.

132
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,580
And some food.

133
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,740
What did you
just call me?

134
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,020
Mother.

135
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,700
Say it again.

136
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,740
Mother.

137
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,940
Get up.

138
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,180
It was really
so immature

139
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,340
of me to

140
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,620
misunderstood you

141
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,660
and my brother.

142
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,420
I kept you guys
on edge.

143
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,180
I was so wrong.

144
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,740
Get up and talk.

145
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,860
Honey,

146
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,820
you must have
suffered a lot.

147
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,500
What's done

148
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,100
is done.

149
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,540
I'll protect you

150
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,340
as long as I live.

151
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,620
I will be

152
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,980
your little rock.

153
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,460
I wish Buddy,

154
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,420
Buddy can

155
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,020
achieve the first place.

156
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,780
Buddy, are you in there?

157
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,740
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

158
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,380
Buddy, I...

159
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,020
Don't tell Mother.

160
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,140
You done yet?

161
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,660
You can remove
your hands.

162
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,140
You're so careless.

163
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,900
What would happen
if it wasn't me?

164
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,700
I didn't know
you are here

165
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,420
in the kitchen.

166
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,500
Still justifying, huh?

167
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,420
I'm here to give you
the medicine.

168
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,260
I know you'd
dress the wound sneakily

169
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,460
not to make
Mother worried.

170
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,140
Thank you.

171
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,740
Let's go.

172
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,620
Allow me.

173
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,420
I'm good. I can do that.

174
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,340
You can't reach it.

175
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,180
Shut up, or I'll
have Mother do it.

176
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,460
Does it hurt?

177
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,740
I'll be gentler.

178
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,140
Mingshu and Lu Chang
could be together.

179
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,260
We didn't find her

180
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,340
on every ford.

181
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,500
It must be a feint.

182
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,260
Lu Chang has connections
with the Jian Family.

183
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,660
A guy went to
the capital with his mom.

184
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,340
He should be the man
the servant said.

185
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,300
Anyways, we should
stop them.

186
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,060
How do you feel?
Still hurts?

187
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,820
I'm fine.

188
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,860
Go have a rest.

189
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,420
Give me your hand.

190
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,180
What?

191
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,540
Just do it.

192
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,660
So many chilblains

193
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,500
on your hand.

194
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,660
It feels rough.

195
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,180
You need hands

196
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,140
to write articles.

197
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,540
What is it?

198
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,180
Orchid Moisturizer
from the lady.

199
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,260
Good stuff.

200
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,340
This tiny box
costs a lot.

201
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,260
It moisturizes skin

202
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,540
and cure chilblains.

203
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,220
It's for girls.

204
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,140
You can use it.

205
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,180
I'll do it myself.

206
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,420
You'll paint it randomly.

207
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,860
It's a waste.

208
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,980
Watch carefully.

209
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,100
Palms, backs of hands,

210
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,700
and between the fingers,

211
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,980
don't miss a spot.

212
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,540
It's so generous
of the lady to

213
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,620
give you such
good stuff.

214
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,980
Buddy?

215
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,820
Enough.

216
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,660
I have something else
to do.

217
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,020
You should get back
to your room.

218
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,100
You forget this.

219
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,060
(Yunlai Inn)

220
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,300
Don't move.

221
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,780
Behave yourself.

222
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,100
So many things happened

223
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,060
after I reported
the bandits.

224
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,180
Fortunately,
no harm done!

225
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,140
Sir,

226
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,380
we should thank you

227
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,060
for saving us.

228
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,220
I'm Song Qingzhao
from the capital.

229
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,340
Lu Chang from Jianglin.

230
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,700
Without your help,

231
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,300
we wouldn't catch
the bandits early.

232
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,180
Since we're both heading
to the capital,

233
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,980
(Songling)
we can travel together.

234
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,940
It's a great honor to

235
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,620
make your acquaintance.

236
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,820
Buddy,

237
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,260
how's your hand?
Let me see.

238
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,180
Mr. Song, I should go.

239
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,620
Why do you leave
on seeing me?

240
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,180
- Wait for me.
- I'm hungry.

241
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,540
I wanna eat.

242
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,860
Wait for me.

243
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,740
Mr. Song,

244
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,060
thanks for saving me.

245
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,580
You're welcome.

246
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,940
Buddy, you are
avoiding me.

247
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,420
Master,
this is the rule.

248
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,780
(Shishu)
Don't reveal your name.

249
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,540
These siblings
are upright people

250
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,660
with heroic nature.

251
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,740
It's totally useless to

252
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,300
be wary of these people.

253
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,500
There's an inn en route
to the capital.

254
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,480
Let's go and see.

255
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,520
- Yes.
- Yes.

256
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,740
I am Tao Yiqian.

257
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,460
Thank you, my lifesavers.

258
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,860
These presents
are for you.

259
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,660
Hope you'll take them.

260
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,020
We really appreciate

261
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,060
your kindness.

262
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,940
We should look
out for each other,

263
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,340
being away from home.

264
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,060
In that case,

265
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,860
I'd take it.

266
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,780
Thank you, sir.

267
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,340
Thank you, Lady Tao.

268
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,060
This is what
I should do.

269
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,620
We saved people
in danger.

270
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,100
How could we take

271
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,620
the money?

272
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,260
It's not just a token
of appreciation.

273
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,100
She wants us
to keep secrets.

274
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,820
If you reject it,
she won't rest assured.

275
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,620
Don't worry.

276
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,900
I know about girls
better than you.

277
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,260
It's not wrong
to take it.

278
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,620
Lady Lu is
really observant.

279
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,860
In that case,

280
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,380
we should take it.

281
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,940
And we need
travel expenses.

282
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,380
You'd be a fool
to leave it.

283
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,780
Stop tugging,
it's disgraceful.

284
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,820
We're siblings.

285
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,500
(Yunlai Inn)

286
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,340
Stop there.

287
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,900
Officer,

288
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,980
we're just passing by.

289
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,140
We'd like rooms
for a night.

290
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,340
A crime took place here.

291
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,820
We're guarding here.

292
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,580
It's now only open to
authorized people.

293
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,540
Dude,

294
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,500
it's Lu Chang.

295
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,300
Take the shortcut
and stop him.

296
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,260
Yes.

297
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,480
Go get him.

298
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,140
Stop there.

299
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,540
Don't move.

300
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,500
What can I do for you?

301
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,140
Go search.

302
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,020
I'm Prefectural Graduate
of Jianglin.

303
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,140
I'm on my way for
the imperial examination.

304
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,900
If anything happens,

305
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,220
the government
let you off.

306
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,400
Sir,
it's a misunderstanding.

307
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,780
My lady was missing.

308
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,340
We're looking for her.

309
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,140
My master is anxious

310
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,700
so I offended you.

311
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,220
Given that situation,

312
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,020
move aside now.

313
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,100
Go tell the master

314
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,460
Lu Chang isn't with
Jian Mingshu.

315
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,820
Yes.

316
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,820
Mr. Song,

317
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,740
thanks again
for helping me.

318
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,020
Don't mention it.

319
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,540
You fought against

320
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,180
the bandits
in the inn.

321
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,780
I really admire you.

322
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,740
You're a female warrior.

323
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,860
I'm also a woman.

324
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,740
How could I ignore
the women in need?

325
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,540
You are

326
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,380
indeed

327
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,060
so unique.

328
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,780
As the message said,

329
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,420
Jian Mingshu is
heading to Xiazhou.

330
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,940
If she goes overseas,

331
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,540
we can't find her
in a short while.

332
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,900
Let's go to Xiazhou.

333
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,740
Yes.

334
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,540
Chang.

335
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,220
- Mother.
- Have some water.

336
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,340
Here you are.

337
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,580
Be careful.

338
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,260
You haven't changed
a bit.

339
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,900
Is Mr. Song reliable?

340
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,300
Don't you worry

341
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,100
Mingshu left with him?

342
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,500
Mr. Song is either from

343
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,380
a royal family
or an official one.

344
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,980
But he still risked
his life to save others.

345
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
He's a good person.

346
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,580
How can you tell
his status?

347
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,900
He has Golden-Caged
Toad Venom.

348
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,420
My master once said

349
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,940
it was
a tribute offering.

350
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,060
Ordinary people can't
have it.

351
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,980
I believe you.

352
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,660
What concerns me is

353
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,940
the guy won't give up

354
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,540
hunting Mingshu down.

355
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,700
It's raining.

356
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,880
Hurry, Mother,
let's take shelter.

357
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,860
Hurry.

358
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,260
Shishu, it's leaking.

359
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,460
Pull over, now!

360
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,340
The bandits broke
the carriage.

361
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,180
And the umbrella
is gone.

362
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,740
Sorry about that.

363
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,060
I'm fine.

364
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,500
But Lady Lu may
get sick.

365
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,660
I'm in good health.
Don't worry about me.

366
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,820
Just cover
for yourself.

367
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,700
(Qinxin Pavilion)

368
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,700
There stands a pavilion.

369
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,540
The rain will last
for a while.

370
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,140
Let's take shelter there.

371
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,980
But we'll get wet

372
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,300
if we get off.

373
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,380
Lady Lu,

374
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,340
you'd get a cold.

375
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,650
♪Two swallows dart
through the drizzle♪

376
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,900
♪A lonely shadow
bars the window♪

377
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,460
♪Thoughts lie concealed♪

378
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,460
♪With no one to talk to♪

379
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,340
Since we can't avoid
the rain,

380
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,380
I'd rather enjoy it

381

in actions.

385
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,660
Don't you think
she's reasonable?

386
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,540
Free and untamed.

387
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,380
That's what I long for.

388
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,460
Yeah.

00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,380
Thank you.

409
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,580
Lady Lu.

410
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,860
(Qinxin Pavilion)

411
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,260
Spring paints
the hills green.

412
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,540
Thanks to you,

413
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,620
I can enjoy this scene.

414
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,540
It takes talent
and sensibility

415
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,020
to enjoy
the rain scene.

416
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:13,940
The dirt smells great,

417
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,460
do you agree?

418
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,020
I do.

419
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,500
They should have gone

420
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,660
to the southeast.

421
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,380
The capital is safer
for Mingshu.

422
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,180
This is your tactic?

423
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,660
I'm afraid it's hard

424
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,620
to find
a coachman here.

425
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,580
And our carriage

426
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,820
happened to be broken.

427
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,420
If Lady Tao
doesn't mind,

428
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,820
we could drive your carriage

429
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,860
to the capital.

430
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,100
It must be hard
for you, my son.

431
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,420
You've always
been around me.

432
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,220
I didn't see you
do anything

433
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,260
but you've
had everything arranged.

434
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,820
Get in, Mother.

435
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,300
(The capital)

436
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,500
Thank you, Mr. Song.

437
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,300
May I have your address?

438
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,740
I'll visit you
with Mingshu

439
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,820
to thank you in person.

440
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,860
Don't mention it,
Mr. Lu.

441
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,980
I'm sure we'll meet.

442
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,820
Mr. Lu, you'd better
find an accommodation.

443
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,060
I should go.

444
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,300
See you in the future.

445
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,780
It's the first time
they came here.

446
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,990
Things may be
inconvenient for them.

447
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,180
Keep an eye
on their residence

448
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,580
to see if they need help.

449
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,940
Yes.

450
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,180
Master, you left the capital

451
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,580
after arguing with your father

452
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,940
because of evading the imperial exam.

453
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,220
Master, have you thought

454
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,020
about how to face him?

455
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,780
Escaping is useless.

456
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,500
Later,

457
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,860
we'll go to Panlong Street

458
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,540
to buy seven-grass pastry.

459
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,740
Back home,

460
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,700
I'll behave obediently.

461
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,700
Master,

462
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,700
good for you.

463
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,100
Panlong Street please.

464
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,860
Lady Tao, we should
separate here.

465
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,580
We live nearby.

466
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,820
Let's say goodbye here.

467
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,980
Thanks again
for saving me.

468
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,180
You're welcome,
Lady Tao.

469
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,460
We'll stop
bothering you.

470
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,060
Goodbye.

471
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,860
Yingxun.

472
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,500
Aunt Zeng.

473
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,180
Oh, allow me.

474
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,580
You're finally here.

475
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,780
I arrived two days ago.

476
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,300
And I've rent
a mansion.

477
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,020
Mingshu?

478
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,220
Mingshu.

479
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,580
This is Yingxun.

480
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,060
We've known him

481
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,420
since he was young.

482
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,220
We're like a family.

483
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,940
Mingshu,

484
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,900
don't look down
upon me.

485
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,340
I work in
Liangzhou Mansion.

486
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,100
I can definitely
protect you.

487
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,900
Hello, Yingxun.

488
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,460
Is it the house
you rented?

489
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,580
Aunt Zeng,
it's a good mansion.

490
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,700
Let's go.

491
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,660
Okay.

492
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,300
Come on.

493
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,620
Give it to me.

494
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,020
Come on.

495
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,700
There's a special
tree here.

496
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,540
It's interesting.

497
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,300
This mansion

498
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,060
and the tree

499
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,180
are indeed special.

500
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,900
Well, it must be
the strong wind.

501
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,420
I'm sorry, Aunt Zeng.

502
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,620
I'm so sorry.

503
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,980
I'll go rent
another one.

504
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,180
Yingxun,

505
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,820
the wind caused this.

506
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,540
I'm sure
it happened everywhere.

507
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,180
Just clean it up.

508
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,820
Chang is right.

509
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,540
I think this is

510
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,700
a good mansion.

511
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,980
Clean it up

512
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,420
and we can live here.

513
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,220
Here's the money
from Lady Tao.

514
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,780
We can buy
some furniture.

515
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,020
Be careful.

516
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,140
You done yet, Chang?

517
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,780
Let's stop here

518
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,300
and clean up tomorrow.

519
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,500
Sure.

520
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,540
I think we need

521
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,620
to buy lots of things.

522
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,820
Let's go buy some.

523
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,900
Not today.

524
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,620
We're all tired.

525
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,580
Take a good rest

526
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,700
and work tomorrow.

527
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,400
Yeah.

528
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,540
It must be
hilarious outside.

529
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,100
We're now local people.

530
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,140
Let's go shopping tomorrow.

531
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,260
You three go together.

532
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,060
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

533
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,780
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

534
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,180
Shadow puppetry.

535
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,060
Buddy, this is so sweet.

536
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,900
Have a try.

537
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,580
I wanna see that one.

538
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,900
Sir, you wanna buy cloth?

539
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,220
Buddy,

540
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,260
why do you always
avoid me?

541
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,820
No, I don't.

542
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,380
No?

543
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,940
You wanna buy cloth?

544
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,700
You said that.

545
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,700
See if you like this.

546
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,420
You still remember it.

547
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,420
I don't wanna
get blamed.

548
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,900
This one is good.

549
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,940
It goes well
with my skin.

550
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,500
I'm gonna pass.

551
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,660
Just check yours.

552
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,300
Then I don't
need it either.

553
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,060
Boss, I want this one.

554
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,180
Okay.

555
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,380
This is for inner gowns.

556
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,180
This, this.

557
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,900
This is also
proper for clothes.

558
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,580
Not this one.

559
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,220
Now Mingshu

560
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,780
fully trusts you.

561
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,580
What about this one?

562
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,980
I've longed for

563
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,500
her trust in me.

564
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,340
But she's
unexpectedly clingy.

565
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,060
I'm overwhelmed.

566
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,500
Thank you.
Please trim it out.

567
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,460
Sure.

568
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,940
What do you think
of this style?

569
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,580
It's pretty.

570
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,540
Is it the new arrival?

571
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,380
Yes.

572
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,260
Okay, wrap it up.

573
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,700
It's old and expensive.

574
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,540
But it sells pretty well.

575
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,620
These look great on you.

576
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,780
- Come have a look.
- Take this one.

577
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,580
But people
can afford them.

578
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,540
Doing businesses here
is so easy.

579
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,220
Chang,

580
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,060
Mingshu,

581
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,940
come try
the new clothes.

582
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,300
Mingshu is so smart.

583
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,980
She bought 3 kinds of cloth

584
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,260
at the price of
1 kind.

585
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,660
With some
clever tailoring,

586
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,060
she turned the cloth
into 3 outfits.

587
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,180
Because Mother
has skilled hands.

588
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,260
These are fancier

589
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,660
than the clothes outside.

590
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,100
Buddy, come on.

591
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,940
Have a try.

592
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,140
Mother, look,
it's perfect.

593
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,220
It's perfect.

594
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
You look sharp.

595
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,220
Do you like it?

596
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,220
I have enough clothes.

597
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,820
Your brother is
always like that.

598
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,980
In fact, he's happier
than everyone else.

599
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,780
Don't overthink it.

600
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,340
I don't mind.

601
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,820
He cares for me.

602
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,260
I know his pain.

603
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,260
Oops, the books.

604
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,380
He is a learner.

605
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,260
Learners care
about nothing

606
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,860
but reading.

607
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,340
He masters kungfu,

608
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,540
fixes houses, drives carriages.

609
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,780
He knows
almost everything.

610
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,340
Since we're from
a poor family,

611
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,220
people always bully us.

612
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,700
My brother
has to make time

613
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,820
to make money.

614
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,260
He must be very tired.

615
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,140
Your dad died early.

616
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,580
I could only
do embroidery

617
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,620
to support the family.

618
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,140
Your brother is
the only man.

619
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,660
We depend on him.

620
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,940
Although he
appears indifferent,

621
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,060
he protected me
regardless of his life

622
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,140
whenever I was in danger.

623
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,620
He treats me so well

624
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,220
so I wanna
treat him better.

625
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,940
A new outfit,

626
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,140
a bowl of hot soup,

627
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,740
I'll do whatever
I can do

628
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,980
to help him
support the family

629
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,420
so that he can focus
on study

630
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,100
and reduce his pain.

631
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,180
Mingshu,

632
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,580
you used to

633
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,980
care about him
like this.

634
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,100
He understands you.

635
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,780
I'm happy
if he's good.

636
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,620
Coming.

637
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,620
Fish.

638
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,740
These are all
my favorite, Mother.

639
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,700
Right. Fish stands
for abundance.

640
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,860
Right, we spent

641
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,300
some money
fixing the house.

642
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,500
That's what
we have left.

643
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,340
It's for you, Mother.

644
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,380
I have money.

645
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,660
Are you going to
the academy tomorrow?

646
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,660
You take the money.

647
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,660
I don't need to
spend money.

648
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,100
Mingshu,

649
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,980
you took the money.

650
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,460
You keep it.

651
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,780
Hurry.

652
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,020
Fine.

653
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,700
I'll keep it.

654
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,180
Mingshu is an expert

655
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,540
in managing money.

656
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,700
Yeah.

657
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,740
Let's dig in.

658
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,080
I forgot to say

659
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,740
something auspicious
for the festival.

660
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,540
Here are my wishes.

661
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,780
We can always
be together.

662
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,300
Mother will live
a long life.

663
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,220
Buddy will win the first
place next year.

664
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,660
Got it, I'll fail this year.

665
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,180
- Oh, this year.
- Look at you.

666
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,660
He's just joking.

667
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,300
- Come on.
- Come on.

668
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,100
I wish you
safe and sound.

669
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,540
I wish my son

670
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,860
win the first place.

671
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,740
Win the first place.

672
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,060
Sit down.

673
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,180
Let's eat.

674
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,460
It's a lovely dog.
Whose is it?

675
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,420
I picked it.

676
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,060
You picked it?

677
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,300
It's for you.

678
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,540
I'll go to
the academy soon.

679
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,140
It can look after
the house for you.

680
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,260
You have a family.

681
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,620
What's your name?

682
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,900
Let Buddy give you one.

683
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,380
What about Early?

684
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,500
Early.

685
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,100
Buddy will win EARLY.

686
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,100
You get up EARLY.

687
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,060
Although it'll be
a while

688
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,420
before the enemies
find us,

689
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,060
you should be
more careful.

690
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,620
Stay home when I'm gone.

691
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,100
Don't worry.

692
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,180
We can take care
of ourselves.

693
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,580
We won't let
you worry.

694
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,420
Right?

695
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,020
Lovely Early.

696
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,300
Buddy is also lovely.

697
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,420
Be respectful.

698
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,840
Be respectful.

699
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,580
Early, you're Early.

700
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,700
Will you play with me?

701
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,420
We didn't miss a corner

702
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,380
(Tea)

703
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,260
but still have no
clues of Jian Mingshu.

704
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,740
She's not
in the southeast.

705
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,380
She might be
with Lu Chang.

706
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,860
There should be
another carriage.

707
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,140
Let's head for
the capital.

708
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,340
After I leave,

709
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,980
take care of Mingshu.

710
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,420
I think the bandits

711
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,700
will come one day.

712
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Don't worry.

713
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,620
I treat her
as my sister too.

714
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,100
Keep an eye on
my master's case too.

715
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,660
Don't ignore a tiny clue.

716
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,300
I'll take care of it.

717
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,300
You know I'm good at

718
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,860
hunting for rumors.

719
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,300
You're really going
to Songling Academy?

720
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,380
Since we're both heading
to the capital,

721
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,530
(Songling)
we can travel together.

722
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,380
This case is
widely involved.

723
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,460
I need help of
influential figures.

724
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:13,340
(Songling Academy)

725
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,180
Greetings from
Lu Chang.

726
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,770
(Mingli Hall)
No need for that.

727
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,460
(Xu Shanzhang)
As the Prefectural Graduate,

728
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,940
you add glory to
the academy.

729
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,140
The provincial
examination

730
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,900
is coming
in a few months.

731
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,500
I hope you can win.

732
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,860
You have talents here.

733
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,540
Although that's my aim,

734
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,060
I can't guarantee that.

735
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,780
I made acquaintance

736
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,220
with Mr. Song Qingzhao.

737
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,420
He's the grandchild

738
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,060
of Defender Duke.

739
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,980
Prince Rui is his
maternal half-brother.

740
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,940
Although he was born
into nobility,

741
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,340
he is modest
in demeanor.

742
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,780
You should

743
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,020
communicate more
with him.

744
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,660
Thanks for
your advice, Shanzhang.

745
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,380
- They really live here?
- Wonderful.

746
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,860
Master, don't worry.
I'm sure

747
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,340
that's where they live.

748
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,140
Let's buy some gifts.

749
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,340
Okay.

750
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,020
Over there.

751
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,660
(To make money,)

752
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,660
(what business
should I do?)

753
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,100
Master, how about this?

754
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,500
Seems I saw this before.

755
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,060
