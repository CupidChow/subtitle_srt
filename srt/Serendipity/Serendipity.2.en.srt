(Serenity and Vision)
For my sake?

31
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,760
You don't see the person, just titles.

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,400
To you, it's all about climbing the ladder.

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,790
It's all for your own good.

34
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,630
You...

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,560
I knew this was how you were.

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,590
But now you even drug someone?

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,310
Lu Chang is stubborn like a rock.

38
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,120
I've offered him our family business,

39
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,150
but he ignored it.

40
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,600
Why should he?

41
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,640
So...

42
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,790
So what if I drugged him?

43
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,560
As long as you agree,

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,200
I'll ensure he marries you.

45
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,040
Father!

46
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,920
I, Jian Mingshu, will never
stoop so low as to beg for love

47
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
or force marriage.

48
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,000
If you insist on this, I...

49
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,940
I'd rather never marry in this life.

50
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,560
That's nonsense!

51
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,690
Mingshu,

52
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,630
don't be upset.

53
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,190
Your father cares for you.

54
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,740
(Concubine Zhou)

55
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,910
Zhou is right.

56
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,560
As long as it's someone you like,

57
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,590
I'll make sure you get him.

58
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,400
If this way doesn't work,

59
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,030
I'll try another one.

60
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,870
Father,

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,470
please stop making things worse.

62
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,590
Master? Master!

63
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,360
Mingshu...

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,200
Father!

65
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,800
Come, time to eat.

66
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,840
Time to eat.

67
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,280
You should eat first.

68
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,360
Mingshu told me

69
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,590
about the groom-snatching.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,960
She truly loves you and cares about you.

71
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,710
I thought you'd come around

72
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,280
and agree to this marriage,

73
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,960
but I didn't expect you

74
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,280
to turn it down

75
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,750
so decisively.

76
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,520
I'm afraid you might regret it

77
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,840
if you miss this good match.

78
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,430
Clearing my teacher's name is complicated.

79
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,430
I don't want to get married now.

80
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,240
Mother, please say no more.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,840
Let's eat.

82
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,740
Take the herbal medicine.

83
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,680
Let me do it myself.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,310
Father, are you mad at me

85
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,520
for being immature?

86
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,150
I'll never be mad at you.

87
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,560
It's just that I know you're hurting

88
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,840
because of Lu Chang.

89
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,190
It hurts me too.

90
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,680
Don't worry, Father.

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,030
Since I've fought for it, I have no regrets.

92
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
I've moved on.

93
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,030
Good.

94
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,270
With your talent,

95
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,560
you'll find a husband

96
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,750
a hundred, a thousand times
better than Lu Chang.

97
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,680
Okay, now drink up.

98
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,720
What are you hiding from me now?

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,840
Take a guess.

100
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,560
Look.

101
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,110
- This...
- See?

102
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,950
I had someone custom-make it,

103
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,950
using the design you came up with.

104
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,830
It's for you.

105
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,470
Try it on.

106
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,160
Only Father would do this for me.

107
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Come, let me help you.

108
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,070
Can't believe you made this bracelet.

109
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,640
Do you like it?

110
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,750
I love it. Thank you, Father.

111
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,190
I'm glad you like it.

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,950
Little goldfish.

113
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,630
You've cared for me all day.

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,950
Go rest now.

115
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,630
Alright, I'll check on you later.

116
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,520
Bye.

117
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,960
- Xiao Qingting.
- I'll see her off.

118
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,000
Go on, go on.

119
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,670
Madam Zhou,

120
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,750
the steward said you've been
going out often lately.

121
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,630
Is there somewhere you go to unwind?

122
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,190
I just went to pray for you and Father.

123
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,480
Master still needs me to care for him.

124
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,520
I won't see you off.

125
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,600
Thank you.

126
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,530
Throw it away.

127
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,470
Yes.

128
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,190
My Lady, Nanny Ying said she's found

129
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,800
clues about Concubine Zhou's

130
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,680
whereabouts.

131
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,830
Keep following her.

132
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,800
Let me know if anything comes up.

133
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,910
Yes.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,920
My Lady,

135
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,240
do you still suspect
Concubine Zhou is having an affair?

136
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,160
Her movements are suspicious.

137
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,720
I can't just ignore it.

138
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,040
It must be dealt with
before Father finds out.

139

Can't we leave after New Year?

00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,000
Metropolitan Exam is in March.

143
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,830
Leaving before New Year
makes it easier to settle in.

144
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,800
I can also find out

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,390
whether Tangli really

146
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
died of illness.

147
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,750
Tangli is Mr. Su's only child.

148
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,920
Who would've thought
he'd get dragged into the case?

149
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,190
He passed away so young.

(Memorial Tablet of the Late Mr. Lu)

151
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,430
So, Concubine Zhou really
went to Xinghua Courtyard?

152
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,440
Exactly.

153
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,200

would rest there.

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,270

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,960
from that old man about the evidence.

190
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,150
What exactly is this evidence

191
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,200
you want me to find?

192
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,670
Whatever it is,

193
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,390
there's no need to worry.

194
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,870
Tonight,

195
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
we'll settle it once and for all.

196
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,150
No one in the Jian Family will survive.

197
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,030
Let the evidence burn to ashes.

198
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,480
The Jian Family's fortune will be all yours.

199
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,780
- My Lady...
- Shhh!

200
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,630
Who's there?

201
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,710
Guards!

202
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,960
(Mingshu?)

203
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,550
Stop! Don't run!

204
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,260
(Jian Residence)

205
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,350
Stop!

206
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,420
Quick.

207
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,150
Master, go!

208
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,060
- Run, My Lady!
- Xiao Qingting!

209
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,400
Go tell Master!

210
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,120
Go! Now!

211
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,280
No!

212
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,360
Run!

213
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,910
Go!

214
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,800
Stop!

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,840
Help!

216
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,680
Help!

217
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,990
Stop!

218
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,710
Not running anymore?

219
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,470
Miss?

220
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,160
Mingshu?

221
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,630
Mingshu!

222
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,470
Search carefully!

223
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,030
Dead or alive, bring her back!

224
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,800
Mother!

225
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,440
Mother!

226
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,080
Quick.

227
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,040
Who is she?

228
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,960
Mingshu?

229
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,480
It's not safe here. We must go now.

230
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,790
Check everywhere.

231
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,630
Make it fast.

232
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,750
Let's go.

233
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,030
Someone must've saved her.

234
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,710
My Lord,

235
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,670
we've dealt with the Jian Residence,

236
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,240
but we didn't find any evidence.

237
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,720
Jian Mingshu is the only survivor.

238
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,150
Whether she knows
where the evidence is or not,

239
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,360
we can't let her live.

240
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,870
She's injured,

241
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,000
so she can't have gone far.

242
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,320
Search all nearby medical clinics.

243
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,630
Yes.

244
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,550
What did the doctor say?

245
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,360
She has a severe head injury,

246
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,670
but she'll be okay.

247
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,750
We'll know more when she wakes up.

248
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,150
Weird, huh?

249
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,670
If Mingshu was attacked,

250
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,710
they should've reported it

251
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,720
and had the criminals arrested, right?

252
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,750
Something's not right.

253
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,360
I'll go to the Jian Residence

254
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,790
and inform Master Jian about Mingshu to see

255
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,750
what to do next.

256
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,510
Be careful.

257
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,150
(Jian Residence)
Who did they offend?

258
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,670
Yeah, Master Jian was such a kind man.

259
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,240
How could he have enemies?

260
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,630
Exactly. The entire Jian Family
has been wiped out.

261
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,780
(Harmony Brings Prosperity)

262
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,220
Not a single survivor left.

263
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,540
(Harmony Brings Prosperity)

264
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,060
(Jian Residence)

265
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,440
- Chief.
- Casualties confirmed?

266
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,280
Confirmed.

267
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,590
Clear the crowd. No gatherings here.

268
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,520
Yes.

269
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,590
- Don't look. Go!
- Move along!

270
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,720
Don't look.

271
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,560
Clear out.

272
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,440
Please leave.

273
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,680
Even Jian Mingshu was hunted down?

274
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,350
Must be the same group.

275
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,640
I saved her,

276
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,160
but she's still unconscious.

277
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,830
Besides Mingshu,

278
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,000
Concubine Zhou is missing too.

279
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,160
After the Jian massacre,

280
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,200
the bandits were killed

281
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,440
by the authorities.

282
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,070
Then they turned around

283
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,830
and accused the Jian of aiding bandits,

284
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,590
closing the case in a hurry.

285
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,550
Now the Jian Family are the criminals?

286
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,440
Did the officials fake a fight

287
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,030
with the bandits

288
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,440
just to steal the Jian Family's wealth?

289
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,680
When I searched the Jian Residence,

290
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,750
I found the steward still clinging to life.

291
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,080
He told me someone

292
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,400
came to Master Jian

293
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,750
for an item of Prefect Su.

294
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,960
My late teacher's item?

295
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,160
Did he say what it was?

296
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,510
He died before

297
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,510
he could finish.

298
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,200
That item must be crucial,

299
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,830
or Master Jian wouldn't have...

300
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,640
What we trust you with

301
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,310
is more than this.

302
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,550
There's definitely something
you care about here.

303
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,440
Could the item he mentioned

304
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,590
be the item?

305
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,110
Maybe Mingshu knows something too.

306
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,640
That's why they wanted her dead.

307
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,160
When will you go to the capital?

308
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,960
The appointment should arrive soon.

309
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,480
Then I'll ride there at once.

310
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,720
Once you're there,

311
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,240
find a place near Liang Estate,

312
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,590
so we can stay in touch.

313
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,320
Okay.

314
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,140
(Tianfu Inn)

315
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,070
What a tragedy.

316
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,790
Can't believe this happened
to the Jian Family.

317
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,590
Poor Mingshu.

318
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,070
Shh.

319
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,800
Mingshu,

320
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,310
how are you feeling?

321
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,310
My head hurts.

322
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,590
You are...

323
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,270
Who are you both?

324
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,960
I'm Lu Chang.

325
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,720
Lu Chang?

326
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,110
Who is that?

327
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,190
What about her?

328
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,630
Do you know her?

329
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,870
Mingshu?

330
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,870
So...

331
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,070
Do you know who you are?

332
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,190
I...

333
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,640
Who am I?

334
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,280
I am...

335
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,720
Mingshu, think carefully.

336
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,240
Who are you?

337
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,830
Where is your home?

338
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,560
Mingshu...

339
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,870
Mother,

340
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,590
give her a break.

341
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,400
I'll go get a doctor.

342
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,680
Alright, stop thinking.

343
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,880
If you don't remember, it's okay.

344
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,150
Stop thinking.

345
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,200
Perhaps your daughter hit her head,

346
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,830
causing a blockage in the brain.

347
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,640
That's what led to this condition.

348
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,590
Though rare, this is

349
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,270
recorded in medical books.

350
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,510
It's called "Soul Loss"
when memory is lost due to trauma.

351
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,200
So, how can it be treated?

352
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,720
To be honest,

353
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,310
I've only seen it in medical books.

354
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,350
I'm afraid I'm not skilled enough.

355
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,880
The patient can't be agitated.

356
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,880
We can only use methods to
clear the stagnation and slowly nurture

357
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,160
her back to health.

358
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,200
Please do not rush it.

359
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,070
What are the chances of recovery?

360
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,830
No one can say for sure.

361
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,240
It's all up to fate.

362
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,520
I'll take my leave.

363
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,950
Chang,

364
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,440
I know you're eager to uncover the truth,

365
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,510
but you heard what the doctor said.

366
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,640
Mingshu can't handle any shock.

367
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,070
Mother, don't worry.

368
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,880
I won't do anything recklessly.

369
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,200
The Jian Family is gone,

370
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,510
and now Mingshu is like this.

371
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,000
What should we do from now on?

372
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,910
Mother,

373
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,110
before Mingshu gets her memory back,

374
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,720
don't tell her about the Jian Family.

375
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,680
She's always been strong-willed.

376
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,440
If she finds out, she'll dig

377
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,680
until finds the truth.

378
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,160
It could lead to danger.

379
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,110
But what about the future?

380
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,400
What should we do next?

381
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,400
We'll take her to the capital.

382
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,880
She might be key to
clearing my teacher's name.

383
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,550
Someone wants her dead.

384
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,590
I need to keep her safe.

385
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,200
So, she...

386
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,590
She'll just stay with us?

387
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,440
We'll say she's your daughter

388
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,700
and my younger sister.

389
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,160
The Jian Family has been branded criminals.

390
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,680
Without a new identity,

391
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,070
neither the bandits

392
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,270
nor the authorities will let her go.

393
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,030
And if she lives with us

394
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,070
but isn't a family,

395
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,200
it will raise suspicions

396
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,030
and ruin her good name.

397
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,510
This is the best way to protect her for now.

398
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,400
What if she never recovers?

399
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,750
What will she do then?

400
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,160
If the truth gets out,

401
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,000
you'll lose your career
and can't protect her.

402
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,270
Are you sure you won't regret this?

403
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,000
All I know is,

404
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,550
if I don't help her now,

405
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,270
I'll surely regret it.

406
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,030
If she doesn't recover,

407
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,160
I will protect her for life

408
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,640
as her elder brother.

409
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,520
Lu...

410
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,160
Mingshu.

411
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,520
I'll return

412
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,350
your jewelry someday.

413
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,440
Please live humbly for now.

414
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,480
You're awake.

415
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,750
Lu Chang.

416
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,160
Do you remember me now?

417
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,640
You told me yourself

418
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,920
you were Lu Chang.

419
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,160
Why can't I remember anything?

420
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,110
You accidentally fell off a cliff,

421
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,550
hit your head,

422
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,110
and got Soul Loss Syndrome.

423
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,030
Soul Loss Syndrome?

424
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,030
So... who are you to me?

425
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,240
I'm your elder brother.

426
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
You are Lu Mingshu,

427
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,590
my little sister.

428
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,310
Lu Mingshu?

429
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,720
Lu Mingshu.

430
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,790
That's a beautiful name.

431
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,920
Mingshu, you've been

432
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,200
lying down for a while.

433
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,040
Are you hungry?

434
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,270
Come on, have some porridge.

435
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,110
Sit up first.

436
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,550
Why are you staring at me?

437
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,480
Don't you recognize Mother?

438
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,950
It's warm. Go ahead.

439
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,430
Here.

440
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
I'll do it myself.

441
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,960
We checked all the clinics,

442
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,640
but we didn't find Jian Mingshu.

443
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,960
Here are some notices.

444
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,200
(Liu Yuan)
Go post them up tonight.

445
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,940
(Notice: 100 taels of silver
for any confirmed leads.)

446
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,160
This is a good idea.

447
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,590
If someone sees her,

448
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,960
they'll report to us.

449
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,440
(Are they really my mother and brother?)

450
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,240
(Why do they feel like
they came out of nowhere?)

451
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,550
(It feels so unreal.)

452
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,680
(Her hands show the signs of hard labor,)

453
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,000
(but my hands are soft and slender,)

454
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,920
(not rough and calloused.)

455
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,030
(I'm also wearing
this expensive gold bracelet.)

456
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,400
(But if we aren't family...)

457
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,640
Wipe your sister's mouth.

458
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,880
I'm your elder brother.

459
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,510
You are Lu Mingshu,

460
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,110
my little sister.

461
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,830
(They give me a strange sense)

462
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,680
(of familiarity.)

463
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,550
(They spent money to save me)

464
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,000
(and took good care of me.)

465
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,400
(What could they possibly want?)

466
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,860
(Tianfu Inn)

467
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,580
You're not fully recovered.

468
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,680
Why do you get up?

469
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,640
Stay in bed and rest.

470
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,400
Don't move around.

471
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,550
Why can't you just listen?

472
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,400
I just wanted some water.

473
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,350
I'll get it for you.

474
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,750
(Why's he acting so strangely?)

475
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,350
(Is he really my elder brother?)

476
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,310
(Notice)

477
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,790
Anyone who spots this girl,

478
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,070
100 taels of silver for any confirmed leads.

479
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,070
This girl was kidnapped.

480
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,240
Her family's looking for her

481
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,350
and offering a big reward.

482
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,510
She does look familiar.

483
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,880
No wonder there are three notices posted.

484
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,550
She really does look familiar.

485
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,940
(Notice)

486
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,970
100 taels of silver.

487
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,070
Why are you up?

488
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,270
Lie down and get some rest.

489
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,920
I've rested enough.

490
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,030
- I need some fresh air.
- No.

491
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,350
You'll catch a cold like this.

492
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,840
You can't go out.

493
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,950
Why?

494
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,680
There are enemies hunting us.

495
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,160
E... enemies?

496
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,270
I'll explain later.

497
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,920
Just know you can't go out now.

498
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,440
Stop asking.

499
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
Listen to your brother.

500
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,390
Mother,

501
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,960
please come with me.

502
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,400
Stay in the room, okay?

503
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,720
Try to get some sleep.

504
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,560
Lie down.

505
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,590
Mother.

506
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,640
Her portraits are all over the town.

507
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,070
They acted like her family.

508
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
We can't let her go out.

509
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,920
If someone recognizes her,

510
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,440
it'll be a disaster.

511
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,280
Okay.

512
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,590
I'll go find Ying Xun

513
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,830
and look for a side route.

514
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,480
We need to leave here.

515
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,140
(Notice: 100 taels of silver
for any confirmed leads.)

516
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,480
(No wonder they won't let me out.)

517
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,240
Why are you just standing there?

518
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,880
Come on, eat something.

519
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,150
Come on.

520
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,110
You should eat

521
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,350
while it's warm.

522
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,240
You need the strength,

523
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,390
right?

524
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,000
(She seems so kind.)

525
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,790
(If I hadn't seen those notices,)

526
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,920
(I might have come to trust her.)

527
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,760
Here, chopsticks.

528
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,800
What's wrong?

529
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,720
I'm not really in the mood for this.

530
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,110
I'd prefer something lighter.
Maybe some porridge.

531
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,270
Wait here.

532
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,680
I'll get it from the guest hall.

533
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,070
Save these for dinner.

534
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,080
I'll be right back.

535
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,840
Pendants and trinkets for sale!

536
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,440
Come take a look, sir!

537
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,380
(Jian's Gold Shop)

538
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,920
Jian's Gold Shop?

539
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,420
(Jian's Gold Shop)

540
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,700
(Jian's Gold Shop)

541
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,030
(This gold bracelet looks unique.)

542
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,440
(Maybe)

543
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,750
(I can find some answers
at the gold shop.)

544
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,270
Didn't even lift a finger.

545
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,960
She came straight to us.

546
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,590
(There are enemies hunting us.)

547
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,350
(I'll explain later.)

548
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,110
Stop right there!

549
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,450
- Help!
- Move aside!

550
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,670
Stop right there!

551
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,390
Officer, that way.

552
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,800
They're gone.

553
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,160
What just happened?

554
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,150
Who were they?

555
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,600
Let's go back now.

556
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,600
Sir.

557
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,760
Mother.

558
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,670
There you are.

559
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,190
You had me so worried.

560
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,960
Go get packed.

561
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,800
We're leaving now.

562
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,070
Okay.

563
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,910
Sir?

564
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,510
Back me up.

565
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,160
Come in.

566
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,760
Sir, I've brought water for you.

567
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,990
Okay.

568
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,670
We're heading south

569
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,630
by boat this time.

570
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,800
Is that okay?

571
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,240
That's great!

572
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,630
I've been wanting to sail.

573
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Then go get packed,

574
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,190
or we'll miss the ferry.

575
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,070
If you want a repeat of earlier,

576
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,240
just go out again.

577
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,550
Now, let's go.

578
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,340
(Notice)

579
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,440
Is this the woman

580
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,710
you just saw?

581
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,350
It's her.

582
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,550
I remember it clearly.

583
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,070
They're heading south

584
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:23,910
by boat.

585
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,360
Who came with her?

586
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,640
A man and a woman.

587
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,590
They looked like family.

588
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,230
Do you know who they are?

589
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,920
I don't really know.

590
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,430
Let's go to the ferry crossing.

591
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,150
What about my reward money?

592
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,960
Thanks for saving me earlier.

593
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,680
Not at all.

594
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,510
We've been traveling for hours.

595
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,760
Shall we stop for a rest?

596
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,360
If they go to the inn,

597
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,760
they'll think we went down south.

598
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,230
Going the wrong way,

599
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,550
they won't catch us.

600
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,400
Don't let your guard down.

601
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,550
It's getting windy.

602
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,550
Get in the carriage.

603
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,710
Who were those people?

604
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,800
Why are they after me?

605
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,960
Could it be something I did

606
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,360
before I lost my memory?

607
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,680
It's not you.

608
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,710
It's because of my teacher.

609
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,280
Your teacher?

610
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,640
Yes.

611
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,190
He was falsely accused and died.

612
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,550
I looked into it and got targeted too.

613
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,030
You fell off the cliff because of that.

614
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,030
Still dare to run off?

615
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,680
I'm sorry.

616
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,400
The gold bracelet feels uncomfortable.

617
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,510
I just wanted to see

618
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,030
if it could be fixed.

619
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,000
Is that so?

620
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,230
I happened to see the notices on the street.

621
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,230
They're getting more people to find you

622
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,630
and threaten me.

623
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,070
The bracelet looks expensive.

624
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,480
Is it really mine?

625
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,590
You've always been frail.

626
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,280
Mother has doted on you.

627
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,070
She never made you do chores

628
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,190
and always gave you

629
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,840
the best.

630
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,000
The wind's picking up. Get in.

631
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,120
It's stuffy in there.

632
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,070
The breeze out here feels better.

633
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,960
Otherwise, I feel all out of sorts.

634
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,160
Don't move.

635
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,510
Luckily, you're careful.

636
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,190
Mingshu comes from a wealthy family.

637
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,400
She's not used to my rough fabric.

638
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,880
All those rashes on her back are from

639
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,280
the cloth rubbing against her skin.

640
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,230
Looks like it's been
bothering her for a while.

641
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,960
She has been pampered her whole life,

642
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,280
can't handle any discomfort.

643
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,510
But she didn't say a thing.

644
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,240
I think

645
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,030
she didn't want to trouble us.

646
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,030
See?

647
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,280
You still see her as the little girl she was.

648
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,630
She's smart and knows
how to carry herself,

649
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,320
not like those other spoiled noble ladies.

650
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,280
You should get to know her better.

651
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,110
When we get to town,

652
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,280
buy her some ointment,

653
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
and herbs for a steam bath.

654
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,880
That'll help ease the rash.

655
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,760
Okay.

656
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Looks like

657
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,880
she still doesn't fully trust us.

658
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,150
Be careful.

659
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,000
Don't give anything away.

660
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,280
She was born into wealth

661
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,440
and lived in comfort,

662
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,870
not like us at all.

663
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,320
Living in different worlds

664
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,030
brings many differences.

665
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,760
She's so smart.

666
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,960
She sees through it.

667
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,070
But don't worry, Mother.

668
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,480
I will make sure

669
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,880
she fully believes

670
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:44,910
she's my sister.

671
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,660
(Junlan Inn)

672
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,390
Why did

673
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,590
your clothes give me rashes?

674
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,840
What do I usually wear?

675
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,440
Girls have delicate skin.

676
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,110
You usually wear

677
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,400
soft fabric for your

678
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,000
close-fitting undergarments,

679
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,920
but we lost our luggage

680
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,150
on the way to the capital.

681
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,470
You had no choice

682
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,760
but to wear mine.

683
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,150
These are fine.

684
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,280
I can wear them.

685
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,240
Nonsense.

686
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,590
You've always been ticklish.

687
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,030
You must've endured

688
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,190
this for so long.

689
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,150
What kind of person is he?

690
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,000
You mean Chang?

691
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,840
He's quite aloof.

692
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,230
Sometimes he's nice to me,

693
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,590
but sometimes,

694
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,030
he seems reluctant.

695
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,840
Actually, he is

696
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,030
cold outside, warm inside.

697
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,110
Sometimes, he says one thing
but means another.

698
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,670
You'll see once you

699
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,600
know him better.

700
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,630
Don't catch a cold.

701
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,200
Does it hurt?

702
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,400
I'll apply the ointment.

703
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,550
They say

704
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,320
this ointment

705
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,800
works wonders on rashes.

706
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,630
A few uses, and it'll clear up.

707
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:27,950
Hang in there.

708
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,880
During the journey,

709
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,190
you've spent so much on me.

710
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,640
Thank you.

711
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
No need to thank me.

712
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,480
We're family,

713
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,190
silly girl.

714
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,240
Does it hurt?

715
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,760
It'll be over soon.

716
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,780
(Zhao's Tailor Shop)

717
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,880
What are we doing here?

718
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,710
May I help you?

719
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,800
Just let me know.

720
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,400
Pick out an outfit for her.

721
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,070
We have many styles of ready-made clothing.

722
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,880
Miss, what do you usually prefer?

723
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:32,910
Just tell me.

724
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,230
Get her an undergarment,

725
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,480
something soft

726
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,320
and comfortable.

727
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,630
A close-fitting one?

728
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,360
You're blushing.

729
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,480
Your rash slowed us down.

730
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,960
Lady, you're really lucky.

731
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,550
Your husband is considerate.
Others would be jealous...

732
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,480
I'm her elder brother.

733
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,870
My apologies.

734
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,760
So you two are siblings.

735
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:05,990
This way, please.

736
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,070
This way, please.

737
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,760
Come.

738
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,200
I'll take this one.

739
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,150
Lady, you have fine taste.

740
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,320
This sky-blue silk lining

741
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,480
is truly exquisite,

742
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,510
very popular with the ladies.

743
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,240
How much is it?

744
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,960
We're fair with our customers.

745
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,710
Quality speaks for itself.

746
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,590
Normally, it's two taels of silver.

747
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,590
But since the lady is so pretty,

748
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,360
let's say one tael and five qian.

749
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,630
Stop fooling him with fancy words.

750
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,590
This so-called silk

751
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,630
is clearly blended with ramie.

752
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,880
Cotton cloth goes for a few dozen wen

753
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,960
per three chi.

754
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,590
Ramie's even cheaper.

755
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,630
I'll give you 600 wen for this one,

756
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,640
not a wen more.

757
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,640
Six...

758
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,070
Never mind.

759
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,710
600 wen it is.

760
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:02,910
It's yours.

761
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,880
Add a matching dress.

762
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,030
Got it.

763
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,120
I don't want it.

764
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,800
You saved this money yourself.

765
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,120
Be good. You must buy it.

766
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,390
No.

767
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,960
(Zhao's Tailor Shop)
Feeling better now?

768
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,030
We're settling in the capital.

769
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,190
Everything costs money,

770
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,360
even keeping up with others.

771
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,400
Metropolitan Exam is in spring.

772
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,670
You should focus on your studies.

773
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,030
Our family only spends, but has no income.

774
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,550
How long will our money last?

775
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,000
I won't let you and Mother suffer.

776
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:41,440
Spend where it matters,

777
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,640
don't be stingy.

778
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,000
We must prioritize what matters.

779
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,960
The clothes at the shop are

780
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,480
expensive to make and overpriced.

781
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,280
Once we're in the capital,

782
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,800
I can make clothes myself.

783
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,640
That's much cheaper.

784
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,630
Didn't expect you to be so thrifty.

785
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,000
Is that strange?

786
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,550
It's getting colder.

787
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,760
Put this on to keep warm.

788
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:32,960
I don't need this.

789
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,110
You should put this on.

790
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:35,710
You can't catch a cold.

791
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:37,960
Let's share.

792
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,430
Alright, let's share.

793
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:40,760
Here, you put it on.

794
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:42,800
What if you catch a cold?

795
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,400
You just got better, right?

796
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,160
Let's share.

797
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,280
What's wrong?

798
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:08,430
What's wrong?

799
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,190
The axle is cracked.

800
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,230
There might be a storm tonight.

801
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,470
We can't camp out.

802
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,440
There's some light.

803
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,440
Should we go check?

804
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:33,260
(Yunlai Inn)

805
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,280
What happened here?

806
00:45:58,990 --> 00:45:59,860
Chang,

807
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,320
maybe we should leave.

808
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,360
These are scattered makeup items for women

809
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,710
and scratch marks from fingernails.

810
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,720
Is this a scam?

811
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,480
If it were, they wouldn't

812
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:12,840
be acting at the entrance.

813
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,280
Seems like bandits struck.

814
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,800
There must be women trapped inside.

815
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,550
Several carriages are here,

816
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,280
but only one horse in the stable.

817
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,400
The bandits may have left.

818
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,200
Mother, Mingshu,

819
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:29,590
wait in the carriage.

820
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,680
I'll go check inside.

821
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,280
I'll come get you if it's safe.

822
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,510
But you're alone...

823
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:34,350
I'll go with you.

824
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
So many people have died.

825
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,160
Be careful.

826
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,060
- Miss, where are you going?
- Help!

827
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,030
Help!

828
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,460
