Chang.

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,560
What is it?

31
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,430
I heard that a very famous

32
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,160
shadow puppeteer came to the capital.

33
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,510
They say he can control

34
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,560
an army of a million
with just his hands.

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
It was really hard for me
to get two seats.

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,470
(Play & Music)
Come watch with me.

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,840
I have to study tomorrow.

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,440
You go by yourself.

Only by balancing work and rest

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,280
can you be twice as effective.

42
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,670
Come on, just accompany me once.

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,160
I'll wait for you.

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,320
Where are you taking me?

45

47
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,400
I grew up with you as childhood friends,

48
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,040
but misunderstandings drove us apart,

49
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:19,620
and I hurt your heart
without even realizing it.

50
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,790
Go.

51
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,430
There's no fate between us.

Let's not see each other again.

53
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,750
But fate had other plans.

The complicated emotions

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,080
do not exist anymore.

56
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,630
Now we call each other
brother and sister.

with deep affection.

we have feelings like
brother and sister,

68
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,400
but love between a man and a woman,

69
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,280

I foolishly gave away our past,

75
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,080
missed the treasure before me,

76
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,430
and severed our fate again and again.

77
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,070

(You can't drag Chang down anymore.)

98
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,490
(And you must never turn back.)

99
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,740
What is she doing?

100
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,020

105
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,350
stop doing these pointless things.

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,520
We can't go back.

107
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,110
There's no possibility left.

108
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,760
So the girl just leaves like that?

109
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,680
You...

110
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,070
Are you alright?

111
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,830
It's nothing.

112
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,600
Letting her vent is a good thing.

113

114

Mingshu,

115
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,680
the way you looked at the shadow play,

116
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,390
you were clearly moved and happy.

117
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,350
Why won't you admit it?

118
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,720
It's just a play. Why take it seriously?

119
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,520
Mingshu,

120
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,110
what happened?

121
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,120
You tell her.

122
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,280
The emperor

123
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,600
has bestowed a marriage

124
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,470
between you and my cousin.

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,880
What?

126
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,670
Me and Qingzhao? How?

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,040
Don't panic.

128
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,960
There must be some misunderstanding.

129
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,870
I'll talk to my parents, see if

130
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,910
they can ask the emperor
to withdraw the decree.

131
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,960
It's not that simple.

132
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,000
The...

133
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,070
The imperial edict has been issued.

134
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,000
(Why would he grant this marriage now?)

00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,670
(No,)

136
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,400
(this can't go on.)

137
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,310
(I need to cut this off cleanly.)

138
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,960
(I must leave.)

139
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,840
Mingshu,

140
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,520
what do you think

141
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,040
about this arranged marriage?

142
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,310
I won't go through with it.

143
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,280
Please help me deal with it.

00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,430
what exactly are you trying to do?

147
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,910
I know about the arranged marriage now.

148
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,480
Mingshu,

149
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,910
let's leave everything behind.

150
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,910
Let's take Mother

151
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,550
and go somewhere no one can find us.

152
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,310
Whether by sea

153
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,710
or into the mountains,

154
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,520
we'll leave Jianglin,

155
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,550
leave the capital.

156
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,430
Leave?

157
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,520
You think leaving means
we can do whatever we want?

158
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,120
Do you know the consequences
of defying an imperial decree?

159
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,910
Compared to that,

160
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,790
watching you marry someone else
is even more unbearable.

161
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,640
Do you understand?

162
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,790
Calm down.

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,880

164
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,710
Prince Yu hasn't been punished,

165
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,670
the new reforms haven't been enacted.

166
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,310
Are you really content with this?

167
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,070
What about all your past ambitions?

168
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,120
My marriage with Song Qingzhao

169
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,480
has nothing to do with you.
Stay out of it.

170
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,720
I don't believe it.

171
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't believe you feel nothing
for me anymore.

172
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,910
You put on that shadow play,

173
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,060
thinking it would touch me?

174
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,480
How laughable.

from your indifference,

178
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,480
you made me relive it again.

Greetings, Aunt.

240
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,150
Qingzhao,

241
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,750
you didn't expect me

242
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,760
to appear in your own home, did you?

243
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,550
When I heard you were here,

244
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,910
I made a point of coming.

245
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,910
Now that the imperial edict
has been issued,

246
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,910
I can't wait to discuss

247
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,200
the wedding date

248
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,310
with your mother.

249
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,240
Well?

250
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,520
You've gotten what you wished for.

251
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,880
Aren't you happy?

252
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,310
Why are you just standing there?

253
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,430
Come, sit.

254
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,390
What are you doing?

255
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,270
Aunt,

256
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,270
I know the family hopes

257
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,070
I can settle down soon.

258
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,080
But I think there's been
a misunderstanding

259
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,360
regarding this imperial marriage.

260
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,910
Lady Mingshu already
has someone she loves.

261
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,760
I beg you to speak to His Majesty

262
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,970
and ask him to withdraw the edict.

263
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,080
That day,

264
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,790
your mother clearly said

265
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
she'd help you find a bride

266
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,520
once you came of age.

267
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,120
That's why His Majesty decided
to reward you with this match.

268
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,070
How could it be a misunderstanding?

269
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,120
I'm to blame for not clarifying in time

270
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,950
and making Mother mistake
my relationship with Mingshu.

271
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,000
I do have feelings for Lady Mingshu,

272
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,120
but it's one-sided.

273
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,310
We simply aren't fated to be.

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,950
Qingzhao,

275
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,760
you must understand,

276
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,000
a ruler's word is no joke.

277
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,070
An imperial edict cannot be withdrawn
so easily.

278
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,840
Besides,

279
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,790
you are no ordinary man.

280
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,550
Your family background
speaks for itself.

281
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,080
Such grace and refinement,

282
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,310
elegance and talent,

283
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,950
how many like you exist
in all the capital?

284
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,400
There are countless young ladies
vying for your favor.

285
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,120
How could it possibly be just
"one-sided"?

286
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,950
You flatter me, Aunt.

287
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,520
But everyone has their own heart.

288
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,360
Lady Mingshu has no feelings for me.

289
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,550
Please help dissolve this engagement.

290
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,950
When it comes to someone you love,

291
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,150
you're really willing

292
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,710
to just stand by
and watch her marry another?

293
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,480
When did my proud,

294
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,120
headstrong nephew

295
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,670
become so hesitant and soft?

296
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,550
Aunt,

297
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,160
I admit I don't want to give up,
but more than that,

298
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,750
I don't want to make the woman I love

299
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,790
feel torn or burdened.

300
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,400
Please, grant me this.

301
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,550
I don't believe it.

302
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,190
With someone like you before her,

303
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,120
how could she not see your worth?

304
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,910
Nothing has been finalized yet.

305
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,520
This is your last chance.

306
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,520
You must think carefully.

307
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,480
If you don't want

308
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,590
a lifetime of regret,

309
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,550
then fight for her.

310
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,380
It doesn't matter who she loves now.

311
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,550
Also,

312
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,760
everything you just said,

313
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,550
I'll pretend I never heard it.

314
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,790
I won't tell your mother, either.

315
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,670
What's done is done.

316
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,160
Let's not

317
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,110
speak of it again.

for some time now.

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,310
Did you bring your household records?

321
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,310
This is my proof of registration
from Jianglin.

322
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,600

Qingzhao,

336
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,000
please try this.

337
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,520
- Mingshu.
- Qingzhao.

338
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,920
You go first.

339
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,520
About the imperial marriage,

340
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,350
I still can't accept it.

341
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,790
I'm sorry for the trouble

342
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,870
and confusion I've caused you recently.

343
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,080
Mingshu,

344
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,110
the marriage decree
may be a misunderstanding,

345
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,720
but I must ask,

346
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,070
are you and Lu Chang
really not possible?

347
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,150
If that's truly the case,

348
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,520
could you consider giving me a chance?

349
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,480
My feelings for you have never changed.

350
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,760
Today,

351
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,590
I even talked to my aunt.

352
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,240
She said there's no way

353
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,520
His Majesty will withdraw the decree.

354
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,670
Mingshu,

355
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,200
will you give me a chance?

356
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,310
I promise I'll make you happy.

357
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,280
Qingzhao,

358
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,390
I sincerely hope

359
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,350
you'll soon meet a woman

360
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,150
with whom you can spend your life.

361
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,280
As for the imperial marriage,

362
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,520
don't act rashly and anger His Majesty.

363
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,490
We'll think of another way.

364
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,590
But my decision is made,

365
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,550
please, say no more.

366
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,710
Mingshu,

367
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,550
why did you only just return?

368
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,560
Mother.

369
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,520
Chang has already told me.

370
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,000
This was what I had been
worried about before.

371
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,480
Though it saddens me,

372
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,520
I respect your decision.

373
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,310
Here is one thousand taels,

374
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,480
a share of the shop's profits.

375
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,310
Please take it.

376
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,750
You need money to run the family.

377
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,920
I can't take this, Mingshu.

378
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,760
You have such a big shop to manage.

379
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,720
Hualang Pavilion is already covered.

380
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,150
This is just a portion for the family.

381
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,950
Besides,

382
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,920
I've made up my mind.

383
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,600
Since

384
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,070
Uncle Wei is also here today,

385
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,080
Mother,

386
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,520
why not

387
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,180
let Marshal Wei bear witness?

388
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,310
Today, I'll serve you tea
and officially recognize you

389
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,200
as my mother.

390
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,910
Mingshu...

391
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,390
I've thought it through.

392
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,440
I have no family left.

393
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,760
Meeting you and Lu Chang

394
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,830
is Heaven's final mercy to me.

395
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,390
You

396
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,800
and Chang

397
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,920
you're my last remaining kin.

398
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,440
Mother, please

399
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,350
accept this tea.

400
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,800
Mingshu,

401
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,720
once I drink this tea,

402
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,390
I will

403
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,390
officially recognize you as my daughter.

404
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,150
I won't allow it.

405
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,960
I don't agree.

406
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,960
I don't understand why.

407
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,440
Ever since you saved me

408
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,040
and brought me to the capital,

409
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,440
we've lived as brother and sister.

410
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,550
Isn't this just

411
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,030
making it official?

412
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,040
What's wrong with that?

413
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,040
We'll discuss this later.

414
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,720
Why wait?

415
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,550
Isn't today the perfect day?

416
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,550
Do you want me to explain my reasons

417
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,200
in front of our elders again?

418
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,190
No need.

419
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,960
If you don't agree, fine.

420
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,760
I'll never recognize you as my sister,

421
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,240
because I only want to marry you.

422
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,440
Too late.

423
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,830
If you

424
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,110
had said that last year,

425
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,960
how happy I would have been.

426
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,040
How happy my father would've been.

427
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,240
But now,

428
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,200
I sincerely and wholeheartedly

429
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,680
wish to call Mother my mother,

430
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,550
and call you my brother.

431
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,040
Isn't this what you've always wanted?

432
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,110
Now it fulfills your wish

433
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,240
and mine too.

434
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,960
Isn't that the best outcome
for everyone?

435
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,800
Come with me.

436
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,470
Chang!

437
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,910
Lu Chang!

438
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,110
Let's put our situation

439
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,070
aside for now.

440
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,760
First tell me,

441
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,550
what exactly do you want to do?

442
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,990
Lu Chang,

443
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,040
I want to leave.

444
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,830
Where to? I'll go with you.

445
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,350
Just give me a few days

446
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,240
to hand over my official duties.

447
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,280
No need.

448
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,040
I'll go on my own.

449
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,040
Where exactly are you going?

450
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,830
My father and mother

451
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,090
lie unvisited in Jianglin.

452
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,640
How lonely must they be?

453
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,670
I'm going back to Jianglin.

454
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,760
You're going back to Jianglin?

455
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,320
Then

456
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,040
give me some time.

457
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,040
I'll request a transfer from Prince Rui

458
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,480
to be reassigned to Jianglin.

459
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,960
How long will I have to wait?

460
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,520
A year?

461
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,520
Two years?

462
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,920
But I don't want to wait.

463
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,480
Not even a moment.

464
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,200
Then let's leave now.

465
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,080
No need.

466
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,870
Lord Lu,

467
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,830
I know what's in your heart.

468
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,570
But ever since that day in Jianglin,

469
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,550
you've no longer had a place in mine.

470
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,110
Don't delude yourself.

471
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,960
I will never marry you.

472
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,280
If you're willing,

473
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,280
I can still regard you
as an elder brother.

474
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,350
But if not,

475
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,520
then let it be like that day,

476
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,680
our farewell permanent,

477
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,760
our lives forever strangers.

478
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,960
If that's your will,

479
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,550
I have no choice.

480
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,760
But the one who brought you
to the capital

481
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,680
will also be the one

482
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,030
to escort you safely back to Jianglin.

483
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,240
I said I don't need you to accompany me.

484
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,480
This is not up for discussion.

485
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,550
From this day on,

486
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,100
I'll watch over you every moment.

487
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,530
Or I'll have someone else do it.

488
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,550
If you want to go out, fine,

489
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,720
but notify me first.

490
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,270
Lu Chang, are you out of your mind?

491
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,720
I am. Completely.

492
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,140
(Top Scholar Residence)

493
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,440
Come, come!

494
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,320
Hurry, hurry!

495
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,920
(Shuyue Pavilion)

496
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,780
Come on.

497
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,640
Come.

498
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,320
Mr. Ying.

499
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,710
Mingshu,

500
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,160
Lu Chang told me to watch you.

501
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,070
You can't go out.

502
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,920
He did say that.

503
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,070
But he also said

504
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,110
if I want to go out, I can,

505
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,150
as long as I let him know.

506
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,320
Please enjoy the meal.

507
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,870
Let's eat first.

508
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,680
Then we'll go stroll around
the Bianqiao Night Market.

509
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,000
I've forgotten the last time we went.

510
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,920
I miss it.

511
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,040
Wen'an brought me this place once.

512
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,960
Their fish, paired
with chrysanthemum wine,

513
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,110
is absolutely exquisite.

514
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,150
You're bound to like it.

515
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,680
Unfortunately,

516
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,520
I'm still in mourning.

517
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,520
I can't drink wine with you,

518
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,480
only this plum juice for now.

519
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,960
Are you trying to get me drunk

520
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,310
so you can run away?

521
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,830
Are you afraid?

522
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,110
If you're scared, don't drink.

523
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,280
This perch is especially fresh.

524
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,800
Try it.

525
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,990
It's delicious.

526
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,950
Lu Chang,

527
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,760
did you really never like me before?

528
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,760
Back then,

529
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,240
my focus was entirely
on the imperial exams.

530
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,920
Later, I was determined
to clear my mentor's name.

531
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,920
I had no room for romance.

532
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,110
Do you remember

533
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,550
before you went away to study,

534
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,310
you helped pick up
the earring I dropped?

535
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,590
There was clearly joy in your eyes.

536
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,000
How could someone

537
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,790
not even know if they
liked someone or not?

538
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,160
So you actually disliked me back then?

539
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,040
No,

540
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,520
I didn't dislike you.

541
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,150
Your...

542
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,670
Your family, at the time,

543
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,520
wasn't only supporting me,

544
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,590
there were other scholars, too.

545
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,790
I was just one of them.

546
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,070
Don't tell me

547
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,150
you were jealous of them?

548
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,590
That you cared about me?

549
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,280
Maybe you're right.

550
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,440
Maybe I did care about you then,

551
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,350
I just didn't realize it.

552
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,050
Lu Chang,

553
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,960
today I'll use

554
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,000
this plum juice in place of wine,

555
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,760
to toast you.

556
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,520
Thank you

557
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,090
for saving my life that day.

558
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:38,940
Thank you

559
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,880
for risking everything

560
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,590
to bring me to the capital.

561
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,710
I'm not finished.

562
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,290
Lu Chang,

563
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,850
thank you for watching over me,

564
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,590
for never leaving my side.

565
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,760
Thank you

566
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,110
for risking your career and future

567
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,390
to avenge the Jian family.

568
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,920
This cup

569
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,720
is for the ten years of feelings
between us,

570
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,960
and for

571
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,240
the one year of sibling affection.

572
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,390
The wine

573
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,200
originally symbolizes husband and wife,

574
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,350
two becoming one,

575
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,390
never parting.

576
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,800
But now,

577
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:00,150
let us break with that tradition,

578
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,920
let this be a wine of farewell.

579
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,880
Mingshu,

580
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,880
this wine...

581
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,960
In hindsight, it was good.

582
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,440
Had you accepted me then,

583
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,280
if you had been in Jianglin at the time,

584
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,650
you would've suffered that calamity too.

585
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,150
Mingshu.

586
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,670
Mingshu.

587
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,200
Lu Chang,

588
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,720
I'm sorry.

589
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,790
I wish you had never saved me

590
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,040
and we had never met.

591
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,880
Mingshu,

592
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,680
don't go alone.

593
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,910
I'm begging you.

594
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,690
Please.

595
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,880

She's been gone several hours already.

652

(Zhaowen Study)

660
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,590
Mr. Cui,

661
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,900
a young lady surnamed Jian
delivered a letter,

662
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,590
saying it was of utmost importance,

663
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,710
and asked me to ensure it

664
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,980
reached the person in charge.

665
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,860
(Petition to His Majesty –
Humbly submitted by Jian Mingshu)

666
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,670
A woman surnamed Jian?

667
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,440
I Jian Mingshu,

668
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,670
originally from Jianglin,

669
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,320
resided with the Lu family
in the capital.

670
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,230
To protect myself, I used
the name Lu Mingshu,

671
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,740
but I share no actual ties
with the Lu family.

672
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,670
I am deeply grateful for Your Majesty's
grace in bestowing marriage,

673
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,840
but being in the mourning period,
I cannot wed.

674
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,520
I fear disgracing Your Majesty's favor.

675
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,070
The fault lies with me alone,

676
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,480
and has nothing to do with
the Lu or Song families.

677
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,240
(Jian Mingshu.)
May Your Majesty see the truth.

678
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,070
This Jian Mingshu

679
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,400
is so bold!

680
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,630
She dares to defy a royal decree.

681
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,510
It's also due to my aunt's negligence,

682
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,920
matchmaking without fully

683
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,070
understanding the situation.

684
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,070
Jian Mingshu and Lu Chang
are the true pair.

685
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,550
Qingzhao

686
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,520
is merely longing in silence.

687
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,630
And that young lady,

688
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,520
she turns down someone
as outstanding as Qingzhao?

689
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,960
What's she aiming for?
Marrying a celestial being?

690
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,590
But what's the use

691
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,630
of saying all this now?

692
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,150
Fortunately, Mr. Cui was cautious

693
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,630
and intercepted the letter.

694
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,880
Had it reached His Majesty,

695
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,960
she'd surely

696
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,920
be sentenced to death.

697
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,070
Where is

698
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,750
this Jian girl now?

699
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,590
Lu Chang left a note for me,

700
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,480
saying Mingshu's gone,

701
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,230
and he's gone to Jianglin to find her.

702
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,440
If you want to save her life,

703
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,800
then find her quickly.

704
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,920
But remember,

705
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,110
don't alarm the Emperor.

706
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,070
As for the marriage,

707
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,230
delay it as long as possible.

708
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,390
Understood.

709
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,360
Ms. Li,

710
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,800
I heard that

711
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,000
you can help me

712
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,400
become a maid

713
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,960
in the Lin household.

714
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,820
Of course.

715
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,440
I've been entrusted by the Lin family

716
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,710
to personally select their maids.

717
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,630
If not me,

718
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,040
no one else can help you.

719
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,800
Then what are the requirements?

720
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,440
Since you're new here,

721
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,980
I'll give you a special price,

722
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,860
just ten taels of silver.

723
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,960
Ten taels?

724
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,190
But I only

725
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,630
have five.

726
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,800
You're a lone girl

727
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,630
out in the world, life's not easy.

728
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,510
It's not much,

729
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,230
but I've got a kind heart,

730
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,710
so I won't make a fuss about it.

731
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,750
Then I thank you, Ms. Li.

732
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,270
When can I start working
at the Lin residence?

733
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,070
Well,

734
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,590
be patient, girl.

735
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,670
Three days at most,

736
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,920
just wait for my message.

737
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,680
Ms. Li.

738
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,110
Be patient, don't rush!

739
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,320
Wait for my word!

740
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
I've finally found you!

741
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,520
You heartless old hag!

742
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,360
You took five taels of silver from me,
guaranteed me

743
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,880
a maid position in the Lin household.

744
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,110
That money went right into your pocket.

745
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,880
And now you're saying
it's not going to happen?

746
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,800
What are you yelling about?

747
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:59,550
Plenty of girls want to work
for the Lin family.

748
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,230
Of course they only take
the most capable ones.

749
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,480
Every one of those they chose

750
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,740
is better than you,

751
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,110
and gave more money too.

752
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,630
Why should they pick you?

753
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,800
So you're a swindler!

754
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,070
You've already scammed

755
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,440
several young women!

756
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,270
If it's not going to happen,

757
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,550
then give the money back!

758
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,720
Give it back!

759
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,720
You...

760
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,750
Are you telling the truth?

761
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,070
Of course I am!

762
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,360
She's a con artist!

763
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,270
Give back my five taels of silver!

764
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,150
If you keep causing trouble,

765
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,630
I'll drag you before the authorities!

766
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,400
Are you giving it back or not?!

767
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,630
Fine! Fine! I'll return it!

768
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,840
Where are you going?

769
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,920
Give her money back too.

770
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,920
You are helping her?

771
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,070
Of course.

772
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,000
How unlucky!

773
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,070
You're the unlucky one.

774
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,110
Thank you, miss.

775
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,230
We're both women,

776
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,150
no need to thank me.
