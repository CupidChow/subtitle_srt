but it was all lies.

31
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,880
Did you lie to me?

36
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,590
were likely spread

and regret it forever.

45
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,190

relationship with Mingshu?

00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,120
You know

54
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,670
I've always had feelings for her.

55
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,950
Now that she's learned her true identity,

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,510
I can no longer treat her as a sister.

57
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,280
What about her feelings for you?

58
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,430
How do you know her heart leans toward you

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,840
A young man as refined as Qingzhao

63
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,680
was rejected by Mingshu.

64
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,280
What is she thinking?

00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,120
Are you saying Mingshu

66
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,120
rejected Song Qingzhao?

67
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,630
What?

71
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
I've noticed

72
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,480
that her attitude toward you

73
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,720
has changed.

74
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,960
I know feelings

75
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,470
can't be controlled.

76
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,350
She wouldn't be able to

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,160
hide her feelings for you.

78
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,430
But if she ever

79
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,640
regains her memory,

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,960
recalls how you rejected her before,

81
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,110
and distances herself from you,

82
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,110
could you bear it?

83
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,960
I wronged her before.

84
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,160

85
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,310

86
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,310
I told you

87
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,230
that I hoped you'd be together,

88
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,040
but you were

89
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,640

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,240
Music floats, stirring hidden love.

194
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,670
This one is harder.

195
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,550
Let me think.

196
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,430
"Is".

197
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,070
The last one.

198
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,360
(A Chinese character)
You have a woman as companion.

199
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,160
I can't solve it.

200
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,310
It's your turn.

201
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,360
The last character

202
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,080
is "yours".

203
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,120
Mingshu,

204
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,950
my heart is yours.

205
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,790
Then,

206
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,710
what about that Jianglin lady engaged to you?

207
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,320
How can you pledge yourself to her

208
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,430
while professing love to me?

209
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,710
Isn't this unfaithful?

210
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,950
With your cleverness,

211
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,510
haven't you guessed

212
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,910
who the Jianglin lady is?

213
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,550
I refuse to guess.

214
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,880

Go to her room and check.

261
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,400
Wake her up.

262
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,600
Go.

263
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,480
I'll go right away.

264
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,790
Mingshu, are you awake?

265
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,280
I'm coming in.

266
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,160
You did it on purpose.

267
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,350
You're so mean.

268
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,440
Then why didn't you open your eyes earlier?

269
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,840
You...

270
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:25,950
I...

271
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,310
All right, I'll stop teasing you.

275
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,440
Get out now.

276
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,670
Don't let Mother

277
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,870
find out about us for now.

278
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,230
Why?

279
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,590
She'll be thrilled if she finds out.

280
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,110

right, Buddy?

00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,000
Work is important,

289
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,030

You're right, Mother.

293
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,480
Stop smirking.

294
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,550
Look at your

295
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,430
dark circles.

296
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,110
Didn't you sleep well either?

297
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,150
So obvious?

eat more.

What's wrong?

302
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,110
I bit my tongue.

303
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,310
Bit your tongue?

304
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,550
Be careful. Eat slowly.

Leave them.

310
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,120
Yes.

311

Mr. Lu

314
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,350
has visited countless times,

315
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,000
yet this was his first glance

316
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,550
at our jewelry.

317
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,360
This

318
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,920
is the Li Family's custom bridal jewelry?

319
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,000
So Mr. Lu is interested

320
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,790
in bridal jewelry?

321
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,590
Does he have a fiancée now?

322
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,000
How come I didn't know?

323
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,440
Well...

324
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
Are you hiding something from me?

325
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,150
Come on, say it!

326
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,040
Well...

327
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,590
Last night,

328
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,680
Lu Chang confessed his feelings

329
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,480
and I accepted.

330
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,430
Really?

331
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,350
It's finally settled!

332
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,790
Our efforts weren't wasted.

333
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,110
Wen'an must hear this.

334
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,270
Lunch is on me.

335
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,400
We're feasting today!

336
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,280
Sure.

337
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,630
Mr. Lu.

338
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,440
Congratulations.

339
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,150
Persistence pays off at last.

340
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,840
This...

341
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,550
Is this the one I fancied before?

342
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,880
I've coveted it for ages

343
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,110
but couldn't bring myself to buy it.

344
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,520
You're giving it to me?

345
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,940
Without your help,

346
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,790
I'd never have

347
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,110
made those lanterns so quickly.

348
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,550
What's between us

349
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,790
needs no formalities.

350
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,590
I'll gladly accept it.

351
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
Honestly,

352
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,830
now that you've

353
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,390
confessed your feelings for each other,

354
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,070
you should strike while the iron is hot

355
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,590
and marry her quickly.

356
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,880
May your hearts beat as one

357
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,240
and your love endure.

358
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,160
May each dawn find your bond

359
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,110
sweeter than nectar.

360
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,510
Enough, enough!

361
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,360
Cheers.

362
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,760
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

363
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,080
Its Lu Wan'er.

364
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,390
She's been famous recently.

365
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,550
Suddenly, she's become

366
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,590
the capital's rising star overnight.

367
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,760
How did this happen?

368
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,350
It's like

369
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,830
a storybook tale.

370
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,000
At her first banquet with Lady Lu,

371
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,790
the old lady in the Residence of Marquis

372
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,240
collapsed suddenly

373
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,680
out of some unknown illness.

374
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,750
In a hurry,

375
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,350
Lu Wan'er claimed to know medical skills

376
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,590
and stepped forward to treat her.

377
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,630
She managed to revive her on the spot.

378
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,600
True.

379
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,830
The old lady thus

380
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,240
spoke highly of her.

381
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,070
Every notable in the capital

382
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,390
sings her praises, too.

383
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,200
By contrast with Third Lady of Lu,

384
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,440
she's gained

385
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,000
a firm foothold

386
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
among the noble ladies

387
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,240
and her reputation's soared.

388
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,640
It sounds like a legend.

389
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,880
Incredible.

390
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,520
The more incredible thing is yet to come.

391
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
The old lady

392
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,510
is no ordinary woman.

393
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,550
She is Consort Chen's birth mother.

394
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,640
For this reason,

395
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,960
Consort Chen summoned her to the palace.

396
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,110
Judging by her smug glow,

397
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,040
she must've come back from the palace.

398
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,390
She really had a stroke of luck.

399
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,130
I heard from Third Lady of Lu

400
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,000
that Lu Wan'er

401
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,200
was raised by some rural physician.

402
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,020
But now, she's navigating

403
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,270
the capital's elite circles with ease,

404
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,720
thriving,

405
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,590
and impressive.

406
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,520
Exactly.

407
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,400
She is far more scheming

408
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,440
than Third Lady of Lu.

409
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,550
Minister Lu must be overjoyed

410
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,830
to gain such a socially

411
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,350
adept daughter overnight.

412
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,030
My father says

413
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,350
he's been

414
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,150
glowing with pride lately.

415
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,150
Father,

416
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,440
Consort Chen was most gracious.

417
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,200
(Grand Ambitions)
She had a talk with me

418
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,150
and bestowed a lot of jewelry on me.

419
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,520
Moreover,

420
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,760
I even had the honor to meet the Emperor.

421
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,000
You met His Majesty?

422
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,150
What did he say?

423
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,720
He praised my grace and compassion,

424
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,760
calling me a "healer's heart"

425
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,040
worthy of this era.

426
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,390
Did he really say that?

427
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,120
Father, as you oversee

428
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,240
the construction of the ceremony venue,

429
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,310
I wish to contribute

430
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,680
in your name

431
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,390
by distributing porridge to the refugees.

432
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,350
What do you think?

433
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,110
I'm glad that you have such thoughts.

434
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,520
Do as you suggest.

435
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,040
Thank you, Father.

436
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,830
If there's nothing else,

437
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,390
I'll take my leave.

438
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,430
Go ahead.

439
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,720
Good.

440
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,680
Lady Wan'er has been missing for so long.

441
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,520
Her return is rather suspicious.

442
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:31,110
Master, you should be cautious.

443
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,000
I understand what you're saying.

444
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,390
Returning at this moment,

445
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,720
she must've been sent

446
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,200
by either faction.

447
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,590
But if she proves useful,

448
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,550
she's my good daughter.

449
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,720
With her shrewdness,

450
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,000
perhaps we needn't rush

451
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,590
to swear loyalty to Prince Rui.

452
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,710
Regarding

453
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,720
her marriage alliance with Lu Chang,

454
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,390
since he resists,

455
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,310
just leave him be.

456
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,000
Should Wan'er

457
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,760
secure His Majesty's favor,

458
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,590
our family

459
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,630
might survive

460
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,510
the case of Su Changhua

461
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,200
unscathed.

462
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,430
You're here.

463
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,110
Last time I was here,

464
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,830
I'd just learned Mingshu's true origins.

465
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,000
We made a gentleman's agreement,

466
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,830
but in an instant,

467
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,830
you broke it first.

468
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,630
Mr. Song,

469
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,110
regarding this,

470
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,240
- I know...
- You think I came to confront you?

471
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,880
Lu Chang,

472
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,200
do you remember what you said?

473
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,150
Whatever you can do for Mingshu,

474
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,120
I can do, too.

475
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,000
I merely arrived a step behind.

476
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,760
Since Mingshu has chosen you,

477
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,200
from now on, I shall be her friend

478
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,590
and brother.

479
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,390
I've long meant to say this to you.

480
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,440
If you let her suffer even slightly,

481
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,760
I'll make you regret it.

482
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,440
You're

483
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
both good souls.

484
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,110
Thank you.

485
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,040
Mrs. Li.

486
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,040
Mrs. Li.

487
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,380
(Hualang Pavilion)
Mingshu.

488
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,590
Mingshu.

489
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,360
Qingzhao.

490
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,150
You've been drinking?

491
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,760
Mingshu,

492
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,280
look at me.

493
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,320
Look at me.

494
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,520
Tell me,

495
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,480
what makes me inferior to Lu Chang?

496
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,880
What are you saying, Qingzhao?

497
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,110
You're great, no comparison needed.

498
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,150
You're lying!

499
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,520
If you truly thought I was great,

500
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,630
why deny me even the slightest chance?

501
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,550
Just tell me,

502
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,000
did your heart ever stir for me?

503
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,790
Even for a moment?

504
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,670
Qingzhao,

505
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,680
in my eyes,

506
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,790
you're perfect.

507
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,440
Having you as my friend

508
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,350
is a blessing.

509
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,550
But I'm with Lu Chang now.

510
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,110
You should move on.

511
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,200
Why isn't it me?

512
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,680
Whatever he can do for you,

513
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,920
I can do, too.

514
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
- Qingzhao.
- Why isn't it me?

515
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,470
Qingzhao!

516
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,480
Why isn't it me?

517
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,360
Qingzhao.

518
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,600
Qingzhao.

519
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,200
Qingzhao, stop this.

520
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,040
Qingzhao, let go of Mingshu.

521
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,070
Mingshu, I'm sorry.

522
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,680
We were drinking at the tavern.

523
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,350
I turned my back for a moment,

524
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,000
and he slipped away to find you.

525
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,640
Qingzhao, you're drunk.

526
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,550
Come home with me.

527
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,720
Why isn't it me?

528
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,600
Wen'an.

529
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,830
Take good care of him.

530
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,080
Sure.

531
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,920
- Mingshu.
- Easy now. Come on.

532
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,300
(Supreme Court)

533
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,840
Sir.

534
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,540
(Supreme Court)

535
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,740
(Cao Hai)

536
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,880
Reviewer Lu, I'm Cao Hai,

537
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,550
Deputy Commander of Jianglin Garrison.

538
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,680
The criminals involved in Gao Shicai's case

539
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,870
have been transferred to the prison here.

540
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,760
This document is for your custody.

541
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,200
Thank you, General Cao.

542
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,760
You're welcome, Reviewer Lu.

543
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,040
Given our shared regional ties,

544
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,310
if you need anything in the future,

545
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,280
I'll spare no effort.

546
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,000
My gratitude, General Cao.

547
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,630
Farewell.

548
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,680
Place this in the study.

549
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,710
Yes, Master.

550
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,860
(Wei Mansion)

551
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,760
Madam Zeng.

552
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,460
(Wei Mansion)

553
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,110
Mr. Wei, why are you here?

554
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,480
We'll be neighbors from now on.

555
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,360
Are you saying,

556
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,920
you've moved here?

557
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,830
I've wanted a new house for long.

558
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,150
Never thought I'd end up so close to you.

559
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,600
Yes.

560
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,320
Well...

561
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,870
I should go home cook.

562
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,840
Sure.

563
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,420
(Top Scholar Residence)

564
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,470
Mother,

565
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,040
in this vast capital,

566
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,200
why would Uncle Wei

567
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,000
move so close to us?

568
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,200
Silly child.

569
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,590
How should I

570
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,630
know his reasons?

571
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,680
You know what,

572
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
you're starting to tease your mother now.

573
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,280
Careful, or you won't get dinner tonight.

574
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,880
Anything but that.

575
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,000
I can't do without dinner, Mother!

576
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,000
Dinner will be ready soon.

577
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,760
Buddy.

578
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,390
What do you think?

579
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,720
As I told you

580
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,920
at the old house,

581
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,640
if Mother feel content

582
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,920
and is happy every day,

583
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,830
I support her choices unconditionally.

584
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,790
I knew you'd agree!

585
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,790
- Madam, please enter.
- Please.

586
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,580
(Hualang Pavilion)

587
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,590
On your way here,

588
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,480
did you see the Lu Family's Porridge Shed?

589
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,350
Yes, crowds gathered.

590
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,790
I thought something had happened.

591
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,750
Turns out they built a relief shed

592
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,760
for the refugees.

593
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,110
You didn't hear.

594
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,640
Before Lu Wan'er distributed the porridge,

595
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,150
she hired monks for blessings.

596
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,270
Many noble ladies

597
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,680
have joined her charity circle.

598
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,550
Since when do good deeds

599
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,200
require such fanfare?

600
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,960
In my opinion,

601
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,000
she's clearly staging a spectacle

602
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,070
to polish her reputation.

603
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,790
Wouldn't onlookers

604
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,400
overwhelm the shed?

605
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,110
Then few refugees

606
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,480
can get the porridge

607
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,590
or real help.

608
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,240
Instead of idle talk,

609
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,640
we might as well think

610
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,160
about how to help those refugees.

611
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,040
Then,

612
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,790
what can we do?

613
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,830
To ensure their livelihood,

614
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,230
we must look beyond mere handouts.

615
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,110
Mingshu.

616
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,590
Qingzhao.

617
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,820
Mingshu is right.

618
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,380
Porridge feeds them today, not tomorrow.

619
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,940
To solve the problem at its root,

620
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,260
we need to teach them survival skills.

621
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,860
Many women excel at crafts.

622
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,820
Let's teach them to make

623
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,620
Blessing Ceremony items

624
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,020
like sachets

625
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,340
and lanterns

626
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,540
to make money.

627
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,420
This way, they can learn a skill

628
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,340
and make money,

629
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,060
then reinvest the profits into further aid.

630
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,380
That sounds like a good idea.

631
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,220
Later,

632
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,460
I'll propose this to His Highness.

633
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,290
Qingzhao,

634
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,220
are you alright?

635
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,940
Forgive me.

636
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,690
I was drunk and lost my composure that day.

637
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,180
Did I startle you?

638
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,180
No.

639
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,740
Mingshu,

640
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,260
you might laugh,

641
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,060
but my life has been my father's design.

642
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,540
Loving you was

643
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,660
my only act of defiance.

644
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,260
Though the result failed me,

645
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,180
I don't regret it.

646
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,740
Even now, I cannot erase you from my heart.

647
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,700
But I don't want to burden you

648
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,980
or lose your friendship.

649
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,340
Qingzhao,

650
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,380
we've

651
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,300
been through a lot together.

652
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,380
Every time I was in danger,

653
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,740
you stepped ahead

654
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,980
without hesitation.

655
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,460
Your loyalty

656
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,700
is extremely

657
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,460
precious

658
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,100
and worth cherishing.

659
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,300
No matter what,

660
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,180
in my heart,

661
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,560
you'll always

662
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,220
be my most trusted friend.

663
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,940
Then we'll still be friends.

664
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,620
Should Lu Chang

665
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,420
ever wrong you,

666
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,780
feel free to come to me.

667
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,380
I'll stand up for you.

668
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,820
You said it yourself.

669
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,020
Don't go back on your word.

670
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,220
On my honor.

671
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,820
(Shi'an Hall)

672
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,980
There's wasteland near the capital.

673
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,740
The court

674
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,740
contemplates reclamation.

675
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,620
We can

676
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,780
take advantage of this.

677
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,340
How exactly?

678
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,500
Assign refugees to reclaim the land.

679
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,500
Those meeting quotas

680
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,180
retain 10% of cleared land

681
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,340
for private cultivation.

682
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,220
What do you think?

683
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,700
Self-sufficiency through labor.

684
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,940
It sounds like a good idea.

685
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,020
I'll petition His Majesty tomorrow.

686
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,460
In this regard,

687
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,540
Mingshu's sharp mind astounds me.

688
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,980
When we proposed aiding the displaced,

689
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
her mind leaped

690
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,700
to crafting trinkets for marketing.

691
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,420
Why can't I think of it?

692
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,980
Who said that?

693
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,380
Every time I have a problem,

694
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,510
you give me strategic counsel.

695
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,580
Having you as my consort

696
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,980
makes me feel at ease.

697
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,790
Burdened with great responsibility,

698
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,940
Your Highness's every word and deed

699
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,620
shifts thousands of lives.

700
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,260
As your consort,

701
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,380
I should be a capable assistant

702
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,660
and work together with you

703
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,180
on causes beneficial to the people.

704
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,420
I'm blessed

705
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,380
to have a consort like you.

706
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,980
(Hualang Pavilion)

707
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,810
Look at my needlework.

708
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,760
Lovely.

709
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,610
Right?

710
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,530
Her Highness is here.

711
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,020
Your Highness.

712
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,900
You've been working hard.

713
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,820
We just made these.

714
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,700
Have a taste.

715
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,580
- Here.
- Thanks.

716
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,340
Isn't this nice?

717
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,940
It's pretty.

718
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,300
Come.

719
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,460
Here.

720
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,340
Have a look.

721
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,970
Prime vegetables, fresh and tender.

722
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,590
Pick freely.

723
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,540
Don't choose lotus roots like this.

724
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,420
Avoid the small ones.

725
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,740
Select those like this.

726
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,540
Note the large pores

727
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,620
and rounded form?

728
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,020
- Such lotus roots taste sweetest.
- I see.

729
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,580
These lotus roots

730
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,540
are my finest,

731
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,140
crisp and succulent.

732
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,420
Here.

733
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,500
All right.

734
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,660
Take care, you two.

735
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,700
Allow me to help.

736
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,060
Thanks.

737
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,820
Thanks for today, Madam Zeng.

738
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,660
(Everlasting Prosperity)

739
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,580
(Everlasting Prosperity)

740
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,340
Greetings, Your Highness.

741
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,060
Your Highness, you summoned me?

742
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,460
Have you

743
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,300
heard of Consort Rui's

744
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,740
relief efforts

745
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,500
through Hualang Pavilion?

746
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,700
(Everlasting Prosperity)

747
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,580
I want to know

748
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,220
your thoughts on this matter.

749
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,220
I know what to do.

750
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,780
I trust no one else

751
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,620
with this task but you.

752
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,380
I'll take my leave.

753
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:03,140
(Everlasting Prosperity)

754
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,700
Has Your Highness

755
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,300
truly lowered your guard against her?

756
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,100
That depends on whether

757
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,300
she's lowered hers against me.

758
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,660
(One rises as the other falls.)

759
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,020
(If Prince Rui's influence wanes,)

760
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,100
(Prince Yu's rises.)

761
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,900
(How could I boost my enemy's momentum?)

762
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,660
Shall we strike?

763
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,300
Pull your punches.

764
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,700
Don't make it a real blow.

765
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,780
Are you done?

766
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,770
Almost done.

767
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,820
Fire!

768
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,220
Hurry! Move!

769
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,200
Put out the fire!

770
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,380
Put it out!

771
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,620
Where is the water?

772
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,420
Someone help!

773
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,660
Put out the fire!

774
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,580
Just smoke.

775
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,900
It'll be fine.

776
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,520
Come and put out the fire!

777
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,620
Leave us.

778
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,700
If you had handled it properly,

779
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,380
you wouldn't have suffered.

780
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,540
My incompetence

781
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,380
warrants punishment.

782
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,170
I intended to launch a fire attack

783
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,180
while they were off guard.

784
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,900
Had the fire gotten out of control

785
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,300
and displaced the refugees,

786
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,620
Prince Rui would've borne the blame.

787
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,020
Nevertheless,

788
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,180
unexpected exposure

789
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,420
forced our retreat.

790
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,820
Su Tangli,

791
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,060
I know you've always

792
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,620
been cautious.

793
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,020
What caused this lapse?

794
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,820
Your Highness,

795
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,180
