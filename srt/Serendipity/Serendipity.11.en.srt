That's the treasure of the shop.

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,920
- Put it here.
- Okay.

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,200
Put it somewhere visible.

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,860
Later, we can arrange a circle
around it.

33
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,480
This...

34
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,550
This can go there.

35
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,430
This...

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,600
Lady Mingshu.

37
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,350
Mr. Song.

38
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,860
(Star Mark)

39
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,780
Today is the opening
of Hualang Pavilion.

40
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,280
I specially acquired
a feng shui stone.

41
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,920
Where to place it?

42
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,120
This is Master Cui Li's work.

43
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,400
It's hard to obtain.

44
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,200
Thank you, Mr. Song.

45
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,590
- Mingshu.
- Buddy.

46
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,000
I brought you a feng shui stone.

47
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,270
Where to place it?

48
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,910
Sister, this is Master Cui Li's work.

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,150
He's very famous.

50
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,960
Master Cui...

51
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,400
has so many works.

52
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,030
How did you obtain this, Mr. Lu?

53
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,710
Master Cui gifted it to me.

54
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,680
Didn't you solve

55
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,270
the "flowing water on stone" puzzle
for him?

56
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,660
That's why he gave it to you, right?

57
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,680
So you're also well-versed

58
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,280
in mechanical devices.

59
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,360
I'm impressed.

60
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,960
But where should

61
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,680
these two stones go?

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,150
Why not display both?

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Two feng shui stones together?

64
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,680
That's against tradition.

65
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,080
My Mount Tai stone

66
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,030
symbolizes "reaching the summit"

67
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,240
for prosperous business.

68
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,120
Mr. Song, your kindness is rare.

69
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,470
But Mingshu's zodiac, monkey,

70
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,880
conflicts with earth elements.

71
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,560
It needs gold integration.

72
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,030
This gold-inlaid jade piece

73
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,270
suits her better.

74
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,400
Are there such rules?

75
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,150
Naturally, it's up to Mingshu.

76
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,400
I'll leave the placement

77
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,800
to her.

78
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,280
Mr. Song, you have a goodwill.

79
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
Let's put

80
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,590
Buddy's stone in the shop.

81
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,000
As for this one,

82
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,190
it can be placed on my dressing table.

83
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,310
Yeah, good idea.

84
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,520
Both satisfied.

85
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,640
Here.

86
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,750
Let me arrange it.

87
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,710
Does the zodiac, monkey,
truly clash with stone?

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,260
My... my father was born at that time.

89
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,630
Why haven't I heard of it?

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,150
Go bask in the sun.

91
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,630
Come and see!

92
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,700
- So many people!
- So lively!

Ladies and gentlemen,

101
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,040
our Hualang Pavilion specializes

102
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,510
in goods for women.

103
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,360
It also serves as a women's hall.

104
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,000
That is, a place for gatherings

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,160
and conversations.

106
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,600
Here, women can find a space
beyond their households.

107
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,000
Regardless of status,

108
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,750
all women may become friends here,

109
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,390
share lives

110
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,160

our jewelry isn't just novel

124
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,160
in design and variety.

125
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,480
What's unique is

126
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,360
that each piece

127
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,750
can be tailored

128
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,560

00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,120
in designing and crafting
your own adornments.

131
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,000
It's like owning

132
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,920
a unique, glittering star.

133
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,160

Hence the name Star Mark.

The Taoyi Pavilion isn't just for tea.

- Feel free to explore first.
- That's great.

160
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,240
Rest here later for tea and snacks.

Lady, your taste is exceptional.

166
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,190
This is Xiang embroidery.

167
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,750
Its layered stitching is unique.

168
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,000
See how this butterfly

169
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,870
seems ready to fly?

170
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,000
Madam Zeng is amazing.

171
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,510
In needlework,

172
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,600
my mother rivals even the masters

173
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,510
in the capital.

174
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,120
I'll head upstairs to help.

175
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,670
Lady,

176
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,510
shall I explain the symbolism?

177
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,530
Yes! We can design it ourselves.

178
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,760
It's so beautiful.

179
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,510
(Mingshu also favors bamboo.)

180
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,870
Unbending yet graceful.

181
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,480
So vivid.

182
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,630
This is Lady Mingshu's
new embroidery pattern.

183
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,230
Embroidery pattern?

184
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,910
Mr. Song.

185
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,080
Mingshu,

186
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,680
you've worked hard for the opening.

187
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,900
Mingshu asked me
to try this pastry.

188
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,780
It tastes really good.

189
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,710
Have some.

190
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,310
Do you fancy Mingshu?

191
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,710
She's my sister.

192
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,270
Is your heart unsettled?

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,840
Listen, you...

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,670
Though the story
of childhood sweetheart was fake,

195
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,720
that gentleman who touched you

196
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,390
harbors deep affection for you.

197
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,120
That was acting.

198
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,150
Don't take it seriously.

199
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,200
Even in pretense,

200
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,870
emotions may be real.

201
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,630
It's all fake.

202
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,550
Lady Yuanying, drop this topic.

203
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,200
Mingshu!

204
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,600
Come and help upstairs!

205
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,960
We're swamped!

206
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,800
Coming!

207
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,090
(Hualang Pavilion)

208
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,820
- The jewelry I bought is beautiful.
- Safe travels.

209
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,030
- Let me see.
- The owner says it's unique.

210
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,200
Second Lady Lin,

211
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,720
welcome!

212
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,850
I'm overwhelmed by choices.

213
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,510
What brings you here today?

214
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,840
So Jian Mingshu truly came
to the capital.

215
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,910
That Lu Chang

216
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,600
deceived us with his trick

217
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
of disguising her as his sister.

218
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,630
Infuriating!

219
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,630
What should we do?

220
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,270
Eradicate them.

221
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,860
So pretty.

222
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,960
Taoyi Pavilion's sour plum soup.

223
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,040
Taste it.

224
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,840
Thanks, Buddy.

225
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,630
Lady Lu,

226
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,390
what's the story behind this hairpin?

227
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,440
Lady, I...

228
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,000
Have a rest. I'll go.

229
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,390
This Sparrows on Auspicious Clouds
gold hairpin

230
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,510
uses filigree craftsmanship.

231
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,510
Twin sparrows stand tall

232
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,510
atop clouds,

233
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,510
symbolizing soaring ambition.

234
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,150
It's perfect

235
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,870
for your noble elegance.

236
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,270
With such praise,

237
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,670
how could I not buy it?

238
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,360
Mr. Song, you're impressive.

239
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,510
I listened to your explanations

240
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,550
and learnt on the spot.

241
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,590
Have I made any errors?

242
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,240
Sir, help me choose a bracelet.

243
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,910
Sir, which necklace suits me?

244
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,320
Look.

245
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,280
This one.

246
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,630
So talented.

247
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,670
Of noble birth, yet humble.

248
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,630
And most importantly,

249
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,360
he has peerless looks.

250
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,670
How can anyone be so flawless?

251
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,790
You ladies have excellent taste.

252
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,720
Sister,

253
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,320
turn around.

254
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,150
Weren't you describing your own brother?

255
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,080
My brother is indeed splendid.

256
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,910
Those he esteems

257
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,390
are no ordinary folk.

258
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll get back to work.

259
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,720
Mingshu seems to be avoiding me.

260
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,150
In this game,

261
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,520
Mr. Song even sacrifices his charm.

262
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,720
You lost fairly.

263
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,650
Hold steady. Don't fall.

264
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,150
Zhen, you're now riding
a small wooden horse.

265
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,170
Where's Liu Yuanying?

266
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,340
When grow up, you can ride big horses
like your father!

267
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,510
Here.

268
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,740
But be careful.

269
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,200
Mother, this is so much fun.

270
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,040
Slow down.

271
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,030
Don't worry.

272
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,870
Slow down.

273
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,240
When can we have time

274
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,320
to shop?

275
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,720
Mother, play with me!

276
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,360
Mother, this...

277
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,790
Ladies, why not shop first?

278
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,230
I'll take care of them.

279
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,260
- That's great.
- Stay here.

280
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,510
- Be good.
- I'll be back soon.

281
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,550
Wait for me.

282
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,350
Sir, thank you.

283
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,600
Mother!

284
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,630
I don't want to be here.

285
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,910
Let Mother shop.

286
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,960
I'll play with you, okay?

287
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,440
Where's Mother?

288
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,360
Mother!

289
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,510
I'll play with you.

290
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,200
- Mother!
- All right!

291
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,510
I'll play with you, okay?

292
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,240
No! I want Mother!

293
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,550
Mother!

294
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,840
Why did you leave?

295
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,080
What a profound meaning.

296
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,120
Then I'll take this.

297
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,240
Sir, I'll go check out.

298
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,510
Sir, check my bracelet.

299
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,720
I think both styles complement you.

300
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,760
No! I want Mother!

301
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
Stop crying. I'll play with you.

302
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,320
Okay?

303
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,720
Lady, help yourself.

304
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,750
Okay.

305
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,360
Esteemed guest,

306
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,550
how may I assist?

307
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,320
I want to customize a hibiscus hairpin.

308
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,750
Would Lady Mingshu

309
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,960
accept my order?

310
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,550
I'll ensure ample materials.

311
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,080
Let's draft the design upstairs.

312
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,970
I want one.

313
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,950
Give me one!

314
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,750
First, we do this.

315
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,840
Watch closely.

316
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,870
Amazing!

317
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,870
Whoever solves this puzzle

318
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,240
gets a pastry, okay?

319
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,080
- Okay!
- Okay!

320
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,080
Caught a chubby hand.

321
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,910
No eating yet.

322
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,270
Finish first.

323
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,670
It's him again.

324
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,670

The bamboo?

353
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,790
Your embroidery had bamboo.

354
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,670
On the opening day,

355
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,750
I noticed your elegant bamboo design

356
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,720
and stitched it here.

357
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,950
Lady Mingshu,

358
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,000
are you okay?

359
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,680
Why didn't I realize it was you?

360
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,160
So the man in my dreams

361
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,960
is Song Qingzhao?

362
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,350
I mistook it.

363
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,350
Excellent.

364
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,480
Mr. Lu.

365
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,830
You admired bamboo,

366
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,960
so I sewed it

367
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,350
on your clothes.

368
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,310
Was this merely

369
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,510
my wishful thinking?

370
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,560
Mr. Lu,

371
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,750
is something wrong?

372
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,720
My apologies.

373
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,030
Mingshu!

374
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,110
Are you okay?

375
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,830
Are you ill?

376
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,480
No...

377
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,110
Then come out quickly.

378
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,550
There are guests out there.

379
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,880
Don't be rude.

380
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,200
Coming soon.

381
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,060
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

382
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,920
Come on, kids.

383
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,320
Eat while it's warm.

384
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,350
Thanks, Madam Zeng.

385
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,430
- Have a seat.
- Good morning!

386
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,760
- Morning, Madam Zeng.
- Morning.

387
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,720
Morning, Mr. Song.

388
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,910
Morning, Mr. Ying.

389
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,870
Morning.

390
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,390
Mr. Song.

391
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,070
It's fine. Don't stand on ceremony.

392
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,910
Sit down...

393
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,950
Eat!

394
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,680
Madam Zeng's buns are divine.

395
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,350
Mingshu!

396
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,440
It's breakfast, Mingshu.

397
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,270
Coming, Mother!

398
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Mr. Ying,

399
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,510
can you switch seats with me?

400
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,920
I want to sit by Qingzhao.

401
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,720
What did you call me?

402
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,000
After all this time,

403
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,200
Mr. Song

404
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,590
sounds distant.

405
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,630
Sister Mingshu,

406
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,000
what's wrong with your voice?

407
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,350
Are you sick?

408
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,160
It's as soft as a kitten's.

409
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,350
Fine.

410
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,790
I'll call you Mingshu too.

411
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,110
What happened?

412
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,830
Mr. Song, you came early this morning.

413
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,270
What's the urgency?

414
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,950
Mr. Lu,

415
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,000
the triennial

416
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,920
capital Wine Tasting
approaches in a few days.

417
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,640
All spring exam candidates

418
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,550
will attend

419
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,920
to drink and compose poetry.

420
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,790
It's also an auspicious sign
for success.

421
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,070
Many elites will observe.

422
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,750
With your talent,

423
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,790
you'll surely shine.

424
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,880
Don't miss it.

425
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,720
Sounds like mere revelry.

426
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,920
I've loathed crowds since childhood.

427
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,110
I'll pass.

428
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,950
Qingzhao,

429
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,480
I'm interested.

430
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,320
Take me there.

431
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,430
Sure, yeah.

432
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,270
I love bustle!

433
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,910
You must bring me.

434
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,340
How can I go if you won't take me?

435
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,350
Go.

436
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,520
Go there.

437
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,520
Buddy,

438
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,160
Lady Yuanying mentioned

439
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,240
that Jian Jinhai of Jian's Gold Shop

440
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,480
visited her father.

441
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,030
Could this be a clue?

442
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,790
I've already investigated this.

443
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,150
It doesn't work.

444
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,680
But Jian Jinhai might know more.

445
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,520
Sister Mingshu,

446
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,110
follow your brother.

447
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,840
I'm done eating.

448
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,240
Take your time.

449
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,920
What's wrong with him?

450
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,500
Well, Master Jian

451
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,440
has already passed away.

452
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,200
Mr. Song has left.

453
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,430
Good.

454
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,000
You dislike Mingshu being with Mr. Song.

455
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,110
How did you know?

456
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,950
You...

457
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,830
You've carved "dislike"

458
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,640
on your face.

459
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,440
The Song Family

460
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,270
would deeply vet our lineage

461
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,350
if marriage arose.

462
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,310
Mingshu's secret

463
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,480
would surface.

464
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,110
Is that all?

465
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,750
Or is it because you can't let her go?

466
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,440
I'm just reminding you.

467
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,440
You chose

468
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,640
to make her your sister

469
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,480
for protection.

470
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,200
If she learns

471
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,510
of your unwanted feelings

472
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,790
and doubts her identity,

473
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,510
how will you explain?

474
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,110
Mingshu has lost her family.

475
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,030
She's a poor kid.

476
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,350
As you can see,

477
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,720
she's having a great time now.

478
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,400
Meeting new friends

479
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,310
and having passion.

480
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,030
I hope

481
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,160
whatever you decide,

482
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,000
don't hurt her,

483
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,800
okay?

484
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,400
Rest assured, Mother.

485
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,720
I know what to do.

486
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,190
Sister Mingshu.

487
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,870
What?

488
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,110
You seem normal now.

489
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,480
Why act coy

490
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,320
around Song Qingzhao?

491
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,550
I think I like him.

492
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,480
How is that possible?

493
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
That bashfulness wasn't you.

494
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,550
If love stifles your true self,

495
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,640
what's the point?

496
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,000
Come here, listen.

497
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,350
You must guard your heart

498
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,350
until after your brother's
spring exam success.

499
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,550
Then, as an official's kin,

500
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,350
you'll have better prospects
of marriage.

501
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,750
Trust me.

502
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,920
I won't lie.

503
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,590
You're right.

504
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,270
Love should be free and genuine.

505
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,630
Sister Mingshu,

506
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,160
focus on the latter point!

507
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,430
No...

508
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,750
(Perhaps if you forget the past,)

509
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,830
(you'll find lasting happiness.)

510
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,590
(This Forgetfulness Box is for you.)

511
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,750
(May it erase your sorrow and hatred.)

512
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,240
(Bestow eternal joy on you.)

513
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,270
Flirting again!

514
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,960
How can a guardian

515
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,350
obsess over romance?

516
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,070
A true man shouldn't be love-bound.

517
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,510
I'm sure you can sever attachments

518
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,480
and fulfill your duty.

519
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,150
Isn't it?

520
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,110
Yes. Teachable youth.

521
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,040
Go.

522
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,560
Guard well.

523
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,440
Slept soundly.

524
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,440
Buddy isn't studying in the yard.

525
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,030
Still abed?

526
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,280
Buddy!

527
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,830
Why aren't you up...?

528
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,070
I return to the academy.

529
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,550
Take care of Mother and yourself.

530
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,030
The dressing box
holds heirlooms for women.

531
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Keep them safe.

532
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,790
What an exquisite box.

533
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,720
This is forget-me-not?

534
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,110
So familiar.

535
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,240
Thanks for your hard work.

536
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,940
(Renhe Winery)
I'll buy you drinks later.

537
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,480
Since Mr. Lu trusts us,

538
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,400
we'll protect his family.

539
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,040
Thank you very much.

540
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,240
Authorities patrol closely.

541
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,680
Lay low.

542
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Boss, understood.

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,180
are the great aversions
in the human heart.

572
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,590
Therefore, desire and aversion

573
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,550
form the fundamental axes
of the mind.

574
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,700
(Book of Rites)
People remain hidden

575
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,830
and can't be fully fathomed.

576
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,130
Both virtue and vice dwell in the heart,

577
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,680
unseen in outward appearance.

578
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,750
To comprehensively understand this,

579
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,750
what other method exists
beyond ritual propriety?

580
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,620
In ancient times, Zu Ti rose
at the cockcrow to practice swordplay.

581
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,790
Today, Lu Chang recites classics
by moonlight.

582
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,480
Such diligence

583
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,820
shall surely yield
great achievements in time.

584
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,790
Heaven manifests its yang essence
through the sun and stars.

585
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,440
(Book of Rites)
Earth manifests its yin essence through...

586
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,980
(Huaixiu Pavilion)

587
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Shujun,

588
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,400
though this marriage to Prince Rui
is political,

589
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,310
I still hope

590
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,680
you might live like ordinary women.

591
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,270
Be in harmony with your husband

592
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,590
and share deep affection.

593
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,790
Mother, rest assured.

594
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,310
I'll surely find happiness.

595
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,240
But you must understand

596
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,740
that the marriage alliance

597
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,510
differs from ordinary unions.

598
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,310
Constraints and grievances
are inevitable.

599
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,160
If I can no longer stay by your side

600
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,240
to look after you,

601
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,160
you must take good care of yourself.

602
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,830
Avoid provoking conflicts,

603
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,640
yet never retreat from challenges.

604
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,440
The intricacies of these matters

605
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,440
require your own discernment.

606
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,310
I shall remember

607
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,640
your teachings, Mother.

608
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,240
Alright,

609
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,790
the time has come.

610
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:58,980
(Joy)

611
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,670
Father and Mother, please take care.

612
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,190
Don't worry about me.

613
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,740
(Joy)

614
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,670
Let me

615
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,230
remind you.

616
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,320
Wherever you may go

617
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,510
hereafter,

618
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,870
always stand tall

619
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,510
without fear

620
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
or worry.

621
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,000
Our parental hearts

622
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,320
shall ever support you

623
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,880
from behind.

Consort, Prince Rui approaches.

636
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,880
Quick! Sit properly.

637
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,760
Probably patrolling guards.

638
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,510
Prince Rui remains in his study?

639
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,960
I'll investigate.

640
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,670
The lamp still burns
in Prince Rui's study.

641
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,800
Consort,

642
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,760
would he truly not come?

643
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,710
This is your wedding night.

644
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,470
I'll wait for one incense stick's time.

645
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,840
If he fails to appear,

646
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,920
I'll summon him myself.

647
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,480
You'd go yourself?

648
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,920
Do you think there are no palace spies
watching this house?

649
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,360
On his wedding night,

650
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,400
he must stay in the chamber.

651
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,070
After tonight,

652
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,120
I'd prefer him not to come.

653
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:32,510
Your Highness, the Hai hour will pass.
[*Hai hour: from 21:00 to 23:00]

654
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,670
You should proceed
to the bridal chamber.

655
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,790
Regarding this marriage alliance,

656
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,440
given her previous scandals,

657
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,230
I've no intention of forgiveness.

658
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Let her stew awhile.

659
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,710
Avoiding the bridal chamber

660
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,190
will displease Her Highness.

661
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,510
Nagging.

662
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,670
He's coming!

663
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,030
Truly approaching this time.

664
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,070
Really?

665
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,910
Yeah.

666
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,550
Lady, no, Consort.

667
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,110
Quickly! The fan.

668
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:25,950
Hurry!

669
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,200
The robes!

670
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,440
Why do I

671
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,400
feel nervous now?

672
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,550
Perhaps

673
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,030
drink some wine for courage?

674
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,960
Fetch it swiftly!

675
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,240
Hurry up!

676
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,760
Okay, I'll be right there.

677
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,950
Here.

678
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,630
Prince Rui arrives!

679
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,880
Prince Rui.

680
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,070
Nervous?

681
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,000
Please retrieve another cup.

682
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,760
This cross-cupped wine

683
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,480
requires mutual exchange
between spouses.

684
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,630
It seems you couldn't wait

685
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,710
and drank alone.

686
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,120
Very well.

687
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,890
Since you disregard etiquette,

688
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,190
I needn't observe

689
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
the fan-removal ritual.

690
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,000
If Your Highness insists,

691
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,280
I'll obey.

692
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,320
The Zi hour approaches.
[*Zi hour: from 23:00 to 01:00]

693
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,590
Should we retire

694
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,590
at this auspicious time?

695
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,550
We agreed

696
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,230
before marriage.

697
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,760
The marriage alliance

698
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,800
involves no affection.

699
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,920
My presence tonight

700
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,510
is merely a formality.

701
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,350
I shall

702
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,910
stay here

703
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,590
tonight.

704
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,160
Consort,

705
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,070
do as you please.

706
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,320
Really?

707
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,800
I'll remember your words.

708
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,150
There's a saying, "Once spoken,
four horses can't retrieve."

709
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,550
I trust Your Highness won't recant.

710
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,510
Of course not.

711
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:01,480
I'll obey.

712
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,360
I shall retire first.

713
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,130
Your Highness,
please blow out the candles.

714
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,000
(I coldly reject her like this.)

715
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,150
(Yet she offers no protest)

716
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,000
