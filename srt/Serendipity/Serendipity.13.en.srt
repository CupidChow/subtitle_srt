More dishes?

29
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,430
Mingshu,

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,480
all the food is here.

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,000
That's a lot.

32
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,430
I asked the chef to

33
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,430
make their specialties.

34
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,870
Try the lamb.

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,240
Here you are.

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,560
And this bun.

37
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,280
It tastes better
with vinegar.

38
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,630
Mingshu, you alright?

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,510
Water please.

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,520
Water?

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,640
Mr. Song,

42
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,680
are you there?

43
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,470
It's Mr. Lu.

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,120
Hide yourself.

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,080
Hurry.

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,080
- Mr. Song?
- Coming.

47
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,990
Mr. Song,

48
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,550
is everything okay?

49
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,470
Yeah.

50
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,150
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,560
The door needs fixing.

52
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,240
I'll have it repaired.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,840
By the way,

54
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,960
I didn't see you
at dinner.

55
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,520
Are you feeling sick?

56
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,800
So abundant.

57
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,000
You have a good appetite.

58
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm good.

59
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,080
I just splurge on food
occasionally.

60
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,470
Don't worry about me.

61
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,150
Why are you alone?

62
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,310
Where's Shishu?

63
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,270
Uh,

64
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,590
he's out.

65
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,080
Actually, I have a question.

66
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,190
On the wine party,

67
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,800
why did Mingshu...

68
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,000
Just a small favor.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,190
Don't mention it.

70
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,710
Have you eaten yet?

71
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,000
Would you like to
dine with me?

72
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,430
Sure.

73
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
But I guess you've had

74
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,560
dinner since it's late.

75
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,870
You must be busy
with study.

76
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,080
I'd better let you go.

77
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,150
See you then.

78
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,870
See you.

79
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,080
Mingshu.

80
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,320
You okay?

81
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,260
(Shi'an Hall)

82
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,390
How come it's silent

83
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,510
in Prince Rui's room?

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,510
Stop peeking.

85
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,920
He said

86
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,000
he wouldn't come again.

87
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,630
This room

88
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,920
should be decorated

89
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,240
as the way

90
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,080
in Yin Residence.

91
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,630
It's my house.

92
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,630
Just do
what works for me.

93
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,950
Shall I bring all

94
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,790
your paintings?

95
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
Of course.

96
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,390
And my calligraphy.

97
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,800
Don't forget the boxes

98
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,640
I usually use.

99
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,830
I'll pack
this place full.

100
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,870
What about
Prince Rui's stuff?

101
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,440
Find a box

102
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,440
to pack it up.

103
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,160
Send the box
to his study.

104
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,310
Then I won't run into him

105
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,360
all the time.

106
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,960
Okay.

107
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,030
Your Highness,

108
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,190
Her Highness should
be asleep.

109
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,720
Since ancient times,

110
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,160
women prioritize
their husbands.

111
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,510
Her Highness should
have asked

112
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,480
if you'd go to her room

113
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,390
before going to bed.

114
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,630
(The Book of Songs)

115
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,830
I told her our marriage

116
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,360
wasn't based on love.

117
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,920
And I have nothing
to do with her.

118
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,270
But women should feel

119
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,870
upset to hear that.

120
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,750
She doesn't seem so.

121
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,080
Moreover, Your Highness,

122
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,510
you wanted to

123
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,600
leave her hanging.

124
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,270
But she reacts like that.

125
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,110
Well...

126
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,510
That's good.

127
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Although we're married,

128
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,560
(The Book of Songs)
my life

129
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,120
hasn't changed a bit.

130
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,870
What do you think
of my appearance?

131
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,390
Your Highness, you have
flawless features.

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,840
Have I been popular

133
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,150
with women

134
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,630
these years?

135
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,630
No doubt.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,630
But Her Highness
doesn't care about this.

137
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,790
Mingshu,

138
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,800
you're outgoing

139
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,070
and resolutely decisive.

140
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Your family must have
pampered you

141
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,630
so that you always
act without restraint.

142
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,040
I envy you.

143
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,600
I've lost my memory

144
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,190
but you're right.

145
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,600
My mother and buddy

146
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,070
love me.

147
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,320
What about you?

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,830
Your family is wealthy.

149
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,750
You life must be
easy and happy.

150
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,600
My father has been
strict with me.

151
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,000
He's arranged everything
for me.

152
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,560
I've never finished a thing

153
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
at my will.

154
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,630
That explains why

155
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,870
I always overthink

156
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,000
before I act.

157
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,430
I can't be as spontaneous
as you.

158
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,390
So I envy you a lot.

159
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,790
Mingshu?

160
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,390
Why must Your Majesty
speak of profit?

161
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,150
There's benevolence
and righteousness.

162
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,680
The king asked,

163
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,480
"How can my state
be benefited?"

164
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,840
The officials asked,

165
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,240
"How can my family
be benefited?"

166
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,750
Scholars and
common folks asked,

167
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,000
"How can I myself
be benefited?"

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,080
(Education Without Bias)
State falls when all scramble for gain.

169
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,480
Regicide in a state
with ten thousand chariots

170
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,880
is committed by thousand-chariot families.

171
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,790
Regicide in a state with a thousand chariots

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,670
Qingzhao and Lu Chang

173
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,600
are both promising talents.

174
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,550
Not few,
yet never enough.

175
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,680
Already the fourth watch?

176
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,920
Yes, Your Highness.

177
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Time for court.

178
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,080
Here's the fresh
well water,

179
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,600
just as
Your Highness request.

180
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,280
Get changed.

181
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,910
Let me help.

182
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,230
You don't have to

183
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,350
do this for me.

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,320
My servants can do that.

185
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,030
When my dad goes
to court,

186
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,910
my mum helps him
get changed.

187
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,440
I am now your consort.

188
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,720
I should help you

189
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,240
get changed.

190
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,840
Official robes
aren't easy to wear.

191
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,440
Please grant me
some patience.

192
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,910
Since you know that,

193
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,270
don't force yourself

194
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,630
if you don't know how.

195
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm done.

196
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,360
I'm sleepy.

197
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,440
Let's go back.

198
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,390
Okay.

199
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,560
Tell me.

200
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,840
Did she do that

201
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,390
to change my mind?

202
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,800
I don't dare
to comment.

203
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,840
This is an order.

204
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,670
I don't think

205
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,550
Her Highness meant

206
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,960
to fawn on you.

207
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,270
She seemed to be

208
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,080
performing a task.

209
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,230
Nonsense.

210
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,200
Qingzhao?

211
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,390
Qingzhao,

212
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,630
you went out this early?

213
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,360
I went for exercise.

214
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,800
Mingshu,

215
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,510
I should go clean up.

216
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,270
Time for the academy.

217
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,910
Does Shishu

218
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,390
usually do this for you?

219
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm your page boy now,

220
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,870
let me do this.

221
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,200
Thanks.

222
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,560
You're welcome.

223
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
(It's worth enduring)

224
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,080
(the cold all night.)

225
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,360
You don't find
Xie Xi suspicious?

226
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,040
No.

227
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,720
We go nowhere else

228
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,960
except the academy,

229
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,670
the class, the canteen

230
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,840
and the library.

231
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,030
We can't miss a lady here

232
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,750
if there's one.

233
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,840
But you've kept

234
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,320
a lady here

235
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,360
who's combing for you.

236
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,320
But no one caught me.

237
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,630
So you

238
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,000
can't jump to conclusion

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,360
before knowing the truth.

240
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,590
It hurts?

241
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,510
No.

242
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,390
Sorry.

243
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,080
I'm a terrible page boy.

244
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,800
I think

245
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,320
it looks good.

246
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,870
Pretty good.

247
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,320
It's very

248
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,960
distinctive.

249
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,390
That's it.

250
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,120
You'll go

251
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,320
to the class like that?

252
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,350
Why not?

253
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,680
Sure.

254
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,150
It seems
Shishu is quite sick.

255
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,200
Your hair looks improper.

256
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,200
What's improper?

257
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,480
I like it a lot.

258
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,030
Fine.

259
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,200
Mr. Song,

260
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,040
you look

261
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,550
quite unique today.

262
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,320
Mr. Song,

263
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,080
is Shishu still sick?

264
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,750
Yes.

265
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,390
No clues in the academy.

266
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,910
And I can't find

267
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,750
Xie Xi anywhere.

268
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,550
Where can I find
the clues?

269
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,510
Who is it?

270
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,270
Mingshu, it's me.

271
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,230
I got a clue.

272
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,120
Xie Xi told his page boy

273
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,360
he'd go meet a friend.

274
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,630
With too many
people around,

275
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,910
he can't meet
anyone here.

276
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,550
But it's different
outside.

277
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,870
Did he say where?

278
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,600
By Yongqing River.

279
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,440
Yongqing River?

280
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,510
Who's is it
by Xie Xi?

281
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,160
Too far away.

282
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,270
But it should be a girl.

283
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,510
I can't hear

284
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,840
their conversation.

285
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,390
They're so mysterious.

286
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,510
Something must be wrong.

287
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,040
- They're gone.
- Let's go, Mr. Song.

288
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,140
(Songling)

289
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,280
Take a look at this.

290
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,590
This is

291
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,220
(Songling)

292
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,880
the access card
of Songling.

293
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,310
(Investigation of Principles)
It isn't the student's card.

294
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,270
It must belong to
the girl.

295
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,830
Probably

296
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,070
she hides in the academy.

297
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
We don't know

298
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,110
who the girl is

299
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,350
but we finally have
some clues.

300
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,350
What's wrong?

301
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,590
Nothing.

302
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,110
Mingshu.

303
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,590
I hear Buddy call me.

304
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,590
Mr. Lu.

305
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,720
Mr. Lu, calm down.

306
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,870
Mingshu.

307
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,950
Buddy.

308
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,270
Why are you here?

309
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,830
To visit you.

310
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,800
You believe that?

311
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,000
Let's go.

312
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,910
Mingshu.

313
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,300
(Investigation of Principles)

314
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,080
I...

315
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,830
Lu Mingshu,

316
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,510
you should know what happened
to Yin Shujun.

317
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,070
If this is let out,

318
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,750
how can you survive
in the capital?

319
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,880
Mr. Lu,

320
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,030
you should blame me.

321
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,350
You want others
to know it?

322
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,750
Get out of here.

323
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,350
Qingzhao, you should go.

324
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,400
I'll explain
to buddy.

325
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,590
Okay.

326
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,880
Whenever you need me.

327
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,680
You take me wrong.

328
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,200
I hid in the academy
in order to

329
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,590
investigate Xie Xi.

330
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,240
As for Mr. Song,

331
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,750
I adhered to
gender propriety.

332
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,590
We slept in
separate beds

333
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,920
and never
crossed boundaries.

334
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,430
Mr. Wensheng.

335
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,910
That's not proper either.

336
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,720
Why not find me

337
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,200
but Song Qingzhao
for help?

338
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,560
I...

339
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,270
That's because
Shishu is sick.

340
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,790
I wanna help.

341
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,310
Don't lie.

342
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,590
People here are
all male.

343
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,880
You can't stay.

344
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,030
Pack your stuff
and I'll send you home.

345
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,160
I promised Wen'an.

346
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,030
I'll stay for observation

347
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,030
no matter what.

348
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,270
If you don't let me,

349
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,880
I'll find another way.

350
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,830
You can stay,

351
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,310
but be my page boy.

352
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,920
Stay away
from Song Qingzhao.

353
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,020
(New Dawn)

354
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,830
Why are you
walking about?

355
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,070
I'm so worried
about them.

356
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,030
They should

357
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,720
be asleep.

358
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,350
What are you doing?

359
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,750
You don't have
a daybed here

360
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,680
so I sleep on the floor
and you, the bed.

361
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,640
No objection.

362
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,480
That's it.

363
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,480
What are you doing?

364
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,240
I'm fine sleeping
on the floor.

365
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,510
You sleep here.

366
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,840
I have a place to go.

367
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,760
Buddy,

368
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,070
where are you going?

369
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,760
Mr. Lu,

370
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,030
I didn't
sleep in the room

371
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,200
for I found it
unsuitable.

372
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,630
Mr. Lu,

373
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,870
you're not mad?

374
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,280
Just this once.

375
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,640
I've made some food.

376
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,080
Eat it while it's hot.

377
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,640
Thank you.

378
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,960
Mr. Lu, come on in.

379
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,550
I made these dumplings

380
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,790
by myself.

381
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,550
You've got to have a try.

382
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,480
Since you made them,

383
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,110
I've got to have a try.

384
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,000
How come they're sour?

385
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,680
I stuffed

386
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,750
bamboo shoots in them.

387
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,520
What?

388
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,000
They don't agree
with you?

389
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,440
Mingshu

390
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,350
loves them a lot.

391
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,920
Since you made them,

392
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,440
I've got to eat them.

393
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,080
One more.

394
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,030
I appreciate
your kindness

395
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,960
but I have
an upset stomach.

396
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,430
Mr. Song,

397
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,070
I don't mean to
pick on you.

398
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,880
I just want you to know

399
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,400
I cherish Mingshu most.

400
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,200
As her brother,

401
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,590
I can't let
anyone hurt her.

402
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,270
Gossip is dreadful.

403
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,750
You'd better adhere to
gender propriety.

404
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,760
Mr. Lu,

405
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,000
I just wanna
help Mingshu.

406
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,590
I won't go against
gender propriety

407
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,160
to harm her reputation.

408
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,960
I believe you.

409
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,240
But you should see
the negative side

410
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,070
and not to take

411
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,350
advantage of her

412
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,790
and let her act recklessly.

413
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,350
I'll keep it in mind,

414
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,920
Mr. Lu.

415
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,680
Then I'll
stay here tonight.

416
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,240
Okay.

417
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,110
My stomach
is still upset.

418
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,540
(Mingli Hall)

419
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,390
Mr. Lu,

420
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,630
it's just

421
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,750
a habit.

422
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,680
Don't take me wrong.

423
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,240
Song Qingzhao,
you really didn't

424
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,350
go back to your room
the night before?

425
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,750
I swear

426
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,880
I really didn't go back

427
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,030
until the morning.

428
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,630
What?

429
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,030
A scion of a noble family

430
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,720
can't even

431
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,920
put up his hair
with his page boy?

432
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,640
Thanks, Mr. Lu.

433
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,440
Who helped you yesterday?

434
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,070
Did Mingshu do that?

435
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,120
- Mr. Song.
- Mr. Yang.

436
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,440
I guess your page boy
has recovered.

437
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,270
Your hair
is proper today.

438
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Thanks.

439
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,350
The northeast lies a pool,

440
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,960
and the west,
a flower bed.

441
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,030
A forest this way.

442
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,870
What are you doing?

443
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,070
I went around

444
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,270
when you had classes.

445
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,590
I painted out a map

446
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,640
of the academy

447
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,750
to analyze if Xie Xi

448
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,070
would go to the backyard.

449
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,320
Listen to this.

450
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,880
All the students
are men.

451
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,070
The servants
perform chores.

452
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,160
They all live
in the backyard.

453
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,680
Is there a chance
the girl

454
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,000
I saw
lives in the backyard?

455
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,400
Even so,

456
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,400
what will Wen'an do?

457
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,070
What will she do
to the girl?

458
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,920
You wanna seek
for the truth

459
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,920
out of good intentions

460
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,440
but things are not
that simple

461
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,720
as you think.

462
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,400
Marriage is significant
to girls.

463
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,790
Anyways, Wen'an
has a right to know

464
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,350
the true nature of
her future husband.

465
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,920
Since she's doubtful,

466
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,400
we have to
find out the truth.

467
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,720
If I'm the one who cares

468
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,750
about the character
of my husband,

469
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,680
will you say those words?

470
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,870
Fine.

471
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,640
You win.

472
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,670
But certainly,

473
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,720
this won't happen to you.

474
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,880
I guess I'm too hungry.

475
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,070
I have the result

476
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,270
of the investigation.

477
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,350
The page boy who's actually a woman
in disguise

478
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,030
is Lu Chang's sister,

479
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,150
Lu Mingshu.

480
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,720
Lu Mingshu,

481
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,030
Lu Chang's sister?

482
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,440
She's also Yin Shujun's

483
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,590
new friend.

484
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,480
Someone saw Mingshu

485
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,030
walk out of the room of

486
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,870
County Princess of Wen'an.

487
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,840
After that,

488
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,880
she sneaked into
the academy.

489
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,670
I'm worried

490
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,510
the county princess sent her

491
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,830
to investigate us.

492
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,830
It's not the first time.

493
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,270
A little girl

494
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,510
won't be able to
find anything.

495
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,640
Don't take it lightly.

496
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,590
She's not simple
since she

497
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,160
stalked you
to the academy.

498
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,870
Truly.

499
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,000
We can't just sit
and wait.

500
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,880
How do you

501
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,030
I want hand-made noodles?

502
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,350
How would I not know

503
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,510
what you like?

504
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,830
If I have Mother's...

505
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,310
Sugar garlic?

506
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,110
Is it sugar garlic?

507
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,960
Dug in
before they go soggy.

508
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,160
Thank you, Buddy.

509
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,840
I've been thinking

510
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,750
to go around
in the backyard

511
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,920
after the meal.

512
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,590
Servants and maids

513
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,240
love gossiping.

514
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,960
The backyard is

515
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,240
the best place to probe.

516
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,150
Okay.

517
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,240
Take your time.

518
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,320
Madam Lin,

519
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,200
these are

520
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,040
my master's dirty clothes.

521
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,170
Thank you.

522
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,110
Put them there.

523
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,110
This is for you.
Please take it.

524
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,070
Mr. Xie is very generous

525
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,070
to us.

526
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,920
This is what I should do.

527
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,640
I'll wash them later.

528
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,920
Okay, thank you.

529
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,430
You're welcome.

530
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,200
It's a lot.

531
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,070
(No letters here.)

532
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,510
Put your clothes there.

533
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,910
Madam Lin,

534
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,440
do masters come to

535
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,280
the backyard?

536
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,270
If they do,

537
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,640
they don't need
page boys.

538
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,240
What a stupid question!

539
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,040
Who?

540
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,240
Who's so unethical?

541
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,550
Who did it?

542
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,190
- The clothes are dirty.
- Don't run.

543
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,800
Buddy,

544
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,270
the water is dirty.

545
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,350
I feel sick.

546
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,310
Can I take a bath here?

547
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,960
How did you get this?

548
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,000
I'll tell you later.

549
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,790
Okay.
Let me get you water.

550
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,160
Bite, bite.

551
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,000
Bite it.

552
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,440
Bite.

553
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,640
See? Brilliant.

554
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,480
It's dead.

555
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,920
Lu Chang picked

556
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,440
Changsheng for me.

557
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,030
It's invincible.

558
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,680
Fine. Don't be mad.

559
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,710
Oh, right,

560
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,480
your ancestral merit
inheritance was denied.

561
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,070
You've got to take
the imperial examination.

562
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,280
Well,

563
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,590
you can't defeat me

564
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,960
in exams or entertainment.

565
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,920
You're good at nothing

566
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,510
but bullying Zhang Song

567
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,030
- Right, Zhang Song?
- Yeah, right.

568
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,680
(Zhang Song)
This is all beside the point.

569
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,310
Except Weilie,

570
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,720
I have Feihu.

571
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,640
They're all invincible.

572
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,670
Would you like a fight?

573
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,240
Where's Feihu?

574
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,670
Young Master Lu,

575
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,030
I don't have it.

576
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,960
Did you steal it?

577
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,440
You must have stolen it

578
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,400
since you think
you can't win.

579
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,590
Nonsense.

580
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,030
I don't think
you have it.

581
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,790
I did see

582
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,070
someone shift behind

583
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,510
Young Master Lu

584
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
before going that way.

585
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,440
Who's that?

586
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,030
Heading to
the South Wing Room.

587
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,870
Go get him.

588
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,480
Go, Zhang Song.

589
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,920
- Stop looking, go.
-Okay.

590
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,760
I'll go.

591
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,560
Hurry.

592
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,440
Come on.

593
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,240
Don't always
blame on others.

594
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,510
You have Feihu?

595
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,790
That's totally an excuse.

596
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,640
Go search

597
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,310
all over these rooms.

598
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,590
I paid a lot

599
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,590
on Feihu.

600
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,350
Lu Chang?

601
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,150
Mingshu?

602
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,180
(Education Without Bias)

603
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,680
I got it.

604
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,240
He holds grudges
against me

605
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,110
so he stole Feihu.

606
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,590
You search other rooms.

607
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,000
I'll go search
Lu Chang's myself.

608
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,400
- Go.
- Go.

609
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,240
Go.

610
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,400
(Modest Gentleman)

611
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,240
Open the door!

612
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,430
Lu Wencai!

613
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,310
Where's my cricket?
I want it back.

614
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,350
What cricket?

615
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,030
I'm going to
take a bath.

616
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,640
You stole it.

617
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,750
I'll go find it.

618
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,350
Then you can't deny it.
Get away.

619
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,640
Let go of me.

620
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,480
Lu Wencai,

621
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,920
don't forget the rules.

622
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,640
All students here

623
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,270
can't break in
others' rooms.

624
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,550
Violators will
be punished.

625
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,070
Is it necessary
to hit me?

626
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,680
Did you hide my cricket

627
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,830
in your tub?

628
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,110
I didn't do that.

629
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,920
Is this your cricket?

630
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,080
Master,

631
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,750
I found Feihu outside.

632
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,320
Get out.

633
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,760
Just wait and see.

634
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,000
(New Dawn)
You found it so late

635
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,070
that I got punched.

636
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,310
You broke in my room

637
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,830
before knowing the truth.

638
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,190
Master.

639
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,880
I'll go find Yang Zishu.

640
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,080
Let's go.

641
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,310
(Luckily they
didn't see Mingshu)

642
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,000
Mingshu,

643
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,000
come on.

644
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,110
You alright?

645
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,720
You alright?

646
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,630
Buddy, you should go out.

647
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,840
I need to get changed.

648
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,440
Okay.

649
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,880
(It's okay.)

650
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,320
(I got nervous
because he)

651
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,510
(suddenly got
close to me.)

652
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,440
I heard Lu Wencai wanted

653
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,840
to search Lu Chang's room

654
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,440
but found nothing.

655
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,720
Is it true?

656
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,000
That's true.

657
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
By the way,

658
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,710
who was so unethical

659
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,140
to say Lu Chang stole

660
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,300
Lu Wencai's cricket?

661
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,070
That's why the bossy guy

662
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,280
made the scene.

663
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,230
Well,

664
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,070
I know it.

665
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,590
You don't know much.

666
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,800
Let me tell you

667
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,320
the whole story.

668
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,020
(Education Without Bias)

669
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,030
Someone set you up

670
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,870
with the cricket.

671
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,280
Even Lu Wencai was

672
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,280
taken advantage of

673
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,320
to reveal
Mingshu's status

674
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,840
and kick her out.

675
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,120
This started

676
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,880
when she was splashed.

677
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,960
I was too busy with study

678
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,920
to care about
these things

679
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,230
so that the weasels

680
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,240
wiggled their way in.

681
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,960
Who could it be?

682
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,800
Xie Xi.

683
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,230
I guess

684
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,800
he knows Mingshu is here.

685
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,880
You've raised
his vigilance.

686
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,480
Maybe other people

687
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,760
have monitored Mingshu.

688
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,230
But we don't know who.

689
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,360
Xie Xi wants to
kick me out.

690
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,760
He failed this time.

691
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,590
He won't spare me
next time.

692
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,550
Mingshu,

693
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,360
let's meet
Shanzhang tomorrow.

694
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,230
They failed to
find Lu Mingshu.

695
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,630
Lu Wencai failed.

696
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,710
Song Qinghzhao found

697
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,110
the cricket outside.

698
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,870
I guess

699
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,840
I've looked down

700
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,360
on the siblings.

701
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,480
So what should

702
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,160
we do next?

703
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,320
Anyways,

704
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,670
we must kick
Mingshu out.

705
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,230
I'm Lu Mingshu.

706
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,630
Nice to meet you, Madam He.

707
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,880
Lu Chang, this is?

708
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,030
Madam He,

709
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,070
Shanzhang told me

710
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,090
Prince Yu, Prince Rui and Director
of the Imperial Secretariat

711
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,440
will come to the academy

712
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,670
to inspect
the spring exam.

713
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,190
But we don't have

714
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,190
enough handymen.

715
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,280
My sister happened

716
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,550
to come to

717
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,710
bring me clothes.

718
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,630
If you don't mind,

719
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,920
she can stay

720
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,870
to help.

721
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,670
(Madam He)
Lu Chang,

722
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,440
you rarely smile and talk.

723
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,280
I thought you were
a cool person.

724
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,440
Unexpectedly,

725
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,550
you're so warmhearted.

726
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,960
But we have
heavy workload.

727
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,360
I'm not sure if Lady Lu

728
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,800
can handle it.

729
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,840
Madam He,

730
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,360
I appreciate it

731
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,110
that you and Shanzhang
have taken

732
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,190
care of my brother.

733
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,440
I'd be happy if I can be

734
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,070
of little help.

735
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,110
You're a smart girl.

736
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,030
I can't bear to
see you do hard chores.

737
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,320
Well,

738
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,070
maybe you can stay
in the backyard

739
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,150
and do some
simple chores.

740
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,320
Sure.

741
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,280
Thank you, Madam He.

742
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,070
Thank you, Madam He.

743
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,640
Mingshu,

744
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,960
it's great you can

745
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,880
stay in the academy.

746
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,240
Truly.

747
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,000
I can observe Xie Xi

748
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,480
in the backyard openly.

749
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,880
But you two should

750
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,400
keep an eye on him
in the academy.

751
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,670
No kidding?

752
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,870
Mr. Lu,

753
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,280
since Xie Xi knows
Mingshu's identity,

754
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,840
you shouldn't
investigate him.

755
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
Let me take care of it.

756
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,280
That's great.

757
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,030
Thank you, Qingzhao.

758
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,360
We should take it easy.

759
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,840
Now that
Xie Xi knows Mingshu

760
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,760
will stay in the academy,

761
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,150
they'll lose composure.

762
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,440
We just need to
wait and see.

763
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,440
You're so composed,
Mr. Lu.

764
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,420
(Shi'an Hall)

765
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,190
The prince has
been indifferent

766
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,920
to the consort.

767
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,280
I heard...

768
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,230
Why marry her then?

769
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,720
Your Highness,

770
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,800
the servants

771
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,180
gossiped about you.

772
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,670
What did they say?

773
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,550
Your Highness doesn't
go to my room?

774
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,630
I'm lazy

775
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,920
and sleep till late?

776
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,480
How do you think

777
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,230
they should be punished?

778
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,550
I have experiences in

779
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,840
dealing with gossipers.

780
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,230
Can't wait
to put them to use.

781
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,720
Come over.

782
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,230
You tell them...

783
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,320
Who is

784
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,190
in charge of the food?

785
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,510
Me.

786
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,880
You, come over.

787
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,150
Lady Shuangyan, what can
I do for you?

788
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,400
Her Highness
has been weak.

789
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,880
She needs
dietary supplements.

790
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,710
Please tell me
what supplements

791
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,360
Her Highness needs.

792
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,320
Her Highness
was just married.

793
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,360
What do you think?

794
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,360
But you shouldn't

795
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,920
tell others about it.

796
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,710
Don't worry.
My lips are sealed.

797
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,960
- Back to your work.
- Okay.

798
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,480
I'm full of juicy stories.

799
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,110
Stop gossiping.

800
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,000
(What does she mean?)

801
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,400
I'm exhausted.

802
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,070
Madam, have some water.

803
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,400
Finally I get to have it.

804
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,190
My mouth is so dry.

805
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,110
What happened?

806
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,920
Some bonsais
were delivered here.

807
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
But the number
doesn't match.

808
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,630
They remain outside

809
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,630
and can't be warehoused.

810
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,960
I have to go check them.

811
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,440
I'm so sick of

812
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
(Package from Huangji Florist)
all this stuff

813
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,190
bothering me nonstop.

814
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,880
The total number
is correct.

815
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,280
What's wrong

816
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,030
is the number
of these 2 bonsais.

817
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,510
Maybe these 2 names

818
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,840
were swapped.

819
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,920
(Wangji Florist)

820
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,020
(purchased 10 pine bonsais)
Come on.

821
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,590
Good girl.

822
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,480
Attagirl.

823
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,800
I should thank Lady He.

824
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,070
You've helped a lot.

825
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,510
There are no

826
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,840
other young ladies

827
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,190
to help you here?

828
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,670
People here who can read

829
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,400
are all male.

830
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,920
We can't afford to hire

831
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,920
educated people.

832
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,280
The only one
that can help

833
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,840
is Tang Sheng.

834
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,320
The boy

835
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,280
can read and count

836
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,320
but he is

837
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,590
extremely tight-lipped.

838
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,110
He rarely talks.

839
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,150
Who is Tang Sheng?

840
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,230
I haven't seen him

841
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,320
ever since I came.

842
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,400
He usually
handles bookkeeping

843
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,190
and does some chores

844
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,360
in the room.

845
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,510
He rarely goes out.

846
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,230
Naturally, you never
see him.

847
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,430
What a coincidence!

848
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,920
That's Tang Sheng.

849
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,510
Tang Sheng.

850
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,030
I'm Mingshu.
I'm new here.

851
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,030
