1
00:00:01,508 --> 00:00:04,408
(Sang Won asked to talk to Ji Won, whom he was curious about.)

2
00:00:04,508 --> 00:00:06,947
(Judging by how bothered I was, )

3
00:00:06,948 --> 00:00:08,447
(I thought it'd be best...)

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,878
(to ask about your feelings.)

5
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:13,817
(I've wanted to get to know you better...)

6
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:15,888
(and to talk to you more.)

7
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:19,758
(Ji Won is now as curious about Sang Won.)

8
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:22,027
(That night)

9
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:24,828
(A chat between the two, with Ye Eun in the middle)

10
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,327
- You don't have it? - No, I have it.

11
00:00:26,328 --> 00:00:27,797
(Me too.)

12
00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:28,968
You know what it is, right?

13
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:33,738
(The two keep talking despite Ye Eun's interruptions.)

14
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,678
Does it disappear?

15
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,007
(Changing the topic)

16
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:41,178
(Right, we need to do that.)

17
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:44,348
(Bewildered)

18
00:00:44,618 --> 00:00:48,418
(Ye Eun takes Sang Won inside.)

19
00:00:49,388 --> 00:00:52,788
(A strange air between the older women regarding Sang Won)

20
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,328
(After the chaotic night)

21
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:57,057
(Memory Location Date)

22
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:59,697
(Put an old photo of yourself in the drawer...)

23
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:02,128
(of the younger man you want to go on a date with.)

24
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:06,468
(Bon Hee chose Mu Jin.)

25
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:10,177
(Chosen by two older women were Sang Won...)

26
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:13,448
(and Sang Hyeon.)

27
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:17,747
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin have a date at an art museum.)

28
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:21,048
(I've never had couple's rings before.)

29
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:23,618
(Why didn't you have one until now?)

30
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,658
(I wanted to get one when I got married.)

31
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,558
(So Hyun and Sang Hyeon have a date at an amusement park.)

32
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:35,568
(So Hyun keeps getting close to Sang Hyeon.)

33
00:01:36,098 --> 00:01:38,838
(So Hyun flirts with her older-woman charm.)

34
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:41,367
(I would've had fun there no matter whom I was with.)

35
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:45,137
(The place made me feel like I was in a relationship.)

36
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:48,948
(Ji Won and Sang Won have a date at Mount Nam.)

37
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,848
(Don't think you're not splendid now.)

38
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,818
(You're shining brightly now.)

39
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:56,958
(Impressed)

40
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,027
(Ji Won's feelings toward Sang Won grow bigger.)

41
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:01,657
(Was each of you allowed to put in only one photo?)

42
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:02,687
(Or several photos?)

43
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:03,757
(Only one photo.)

44
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:04,758
- Really? - Yes.

45
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,228
(Did you have one photo in your drawer?)

46
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:10,467
(There were two photos in my drawer.)

47
00:02:10,768 --> 00:02:11,837
(Who do you think the other one was?)

48
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:13,268
(I think it was Ye Eun.)

49
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:16,067
(I didn't ask him who it was, )

50
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:17,508
(but I knew it was her.)

51
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:20,447
(As her feelings have grown, Ji Won is bothered by Ye Eun.)

52
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:23,018
(And Ye Eun is waiting for Sang Won.)

53
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:26,488
(To whom will Sang Won's feelings go to?)

54
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,248
We're getting too emotionally invested here...

55
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:30,987
- every week. - Yes, we are.

56
00:02:30,988 --> 00:02:32,157
What's going on?

57
00:02:32,158 --> 00:02:34,587
Unexpected people are falling for each other.

58
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,797
- I know, right? - I'm relieved that So Hyun...

59
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:39,157
is making a move on Sang Hyeon passionately.

60
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,797
I hope things go well between the two.

61
00:02:41,798 --> 00:02:44,667
But I also wonder when Sang Hyeon will express...

62
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:46,297
- his feelings properly. - Same.

63
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:48,838
Right? It's kind of...

64
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:51,407
No matter who it is,

65
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:53,377
I want Sang Hyeon...

66
00:02:53,378 --> 00:02:56,107
to approach someone boldly.

67
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:59,888
By the way, Director Park...

68
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,318
- That's hilarious. - Why does he make me laugh?

69
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:04,757
Modifiers like straggler and no-vote guy...

70
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:06,427
always followed him around.

71
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:10,598
But now, he's a younger man being loved by two older women.

72
00:03:11,328 --> 00:03:14,227
Now then, Ji Won and Sang Won went on their date.

73
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,097
He still has a second date left.

74
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:18,938
- That's right. - Let's check out who his date is.

75
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,778
She's sitting on that bench like a painting.

76
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,538
Who is it?

77
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:32,448
(The older woman waiting for the younger man on a green lawn)

78
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,417
(And the younger man approaches.)

79
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:36,657
Sang Won?

80
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:40,788
(Sang Won)

81
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:46,998
Did I keep you waiting?

82
00:03:48,398 --> 00:03:54,407
(The 2nd photo among the 2 in Sang Won's drawer)

83
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:57,037
(Ye Eun)

84
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:58,578
It's Ye Eun.

85
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:02,578
Today, I planned...

86
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:07,317
to go to Seoul Arts High School, where I graduated.

87
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:08,318
(Ye Eun's memory location is Seoul Arts High School.)

88
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,258
To me, it's a meaningful place.

89
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:13,388
And I thought I should visit it...

90
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:18,228
with someone I have feelings for.

91
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:21,297
I kept you waiting, didn't I?

92
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:22,767
(Nodding)

93
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:23,798
Oh, dear.

94
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:25,598
You're on the lawn.

95
00:04:26,238 --> 00:04:27,638
Didn’t any mosquitoes bite you?

96
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:29,238
No.

97
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:31,407
Is this you?

98
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:32,678
Yes, did you find me?

99
00:04:33,748 --> 00:04:35,947
It was easy because I only had to find the one...

100
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:37,148
with the smallest head.

101
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,918
He's right.

102
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:42,948
- Yes, her head is tiny. - How pretty.

103
00:04:43,588 --> 00:04:45,268
- Let's look around. - Can we tour around?

104
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,487
- Shall we go? - Yes.

105
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:47,757
- Good. - Unless you graduate...

106
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:49,238
from that school, you wouldn't visit.

107
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:51,198
What?

108
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,898
I didn't know arts high schools had a sports field.

109
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:55,628
- We have one. - Do you have P.E.?

110
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,298
Yes, we do.

111
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,238
- You do? - It's one of the subjects.

112
00:05:00,138 --> 00:05:01,708
The school is huge.

113
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,178
It's like a college campus.

114
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:07,777
(Looking around)

115
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:09,554
They must be looking for something to sit on.

116
00:05:09,578 --> 00:05:10,848
There aren't any clean spots.

117
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:13,917
Is this okay? How about we try over there?

118
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:15,688
It looks the cleanest. Let me have a look.

119
00:05:16,788 --> 00:05:18,218
This seems the cleanest.

120
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,527
(Brushing off)

121
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:22,688
- Oh, my. - This should do.

122
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:24,828
Thanks.

123
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:26,398
Let's take a seat.

124
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:30,038
This seems like the cleanest spot.

125
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:32,938
It's nice how Sang Won is dusting off the stair.

126
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,337
And I just had to wear white pants.

127
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:36,678
Exactly. But your outfit...

128
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:38,638
looks like an invited professor.

129
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:42,908
- You know... How do I put it? - Do I look weird?

130
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,324
- How do I put it? - Do I look weird?

131
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:47,888
No, it's not weird. I swear it's not.

132
00:05:48,188 --> 00:05:51,387
- It's a very elegant outfit. - Is it a very elegant outfit?

133
00:05:51,388 --> 00:05:52,558
- Yes. - I see.

134
00:05:52,758 --> 00:05:54,358
How did you feel after being chosen?

135
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:58,098
I was happy and grateful, of course.

136
00:05:59,628 --> 00:06:01,367
Honestly,

137
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:03,468
little did I imagine I'd go on two dates.

138
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:06,368
That's why... Did you know I'd go on two dates?

139
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:12,678
I hoped you wouldn't.

140
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:16,548
I heard you had to put it in the drawer inside in person.

141
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:18,548
And so...

142
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:24,288
You would've guessed so since I was late.

143
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:28,158
I knew. I waited knowing about it.

144
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:30,958
I waited despite knowing it.

145
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,398
- What a lovely reaction. - I see.

146
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:37,097
My apologies for making you wait.

147
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:38,897
- Gosh, no. - I'm sorry.

148
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,638
- I... - Especially when I'm not special.

149
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:44,338
Don't you think Ye Eun has changed?

150
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:47,478
Ye Eun has always wanted Sang Won.

151
00:06:48,578 --> 00:06:51,278
(A little while later in Yeon House)

152
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:54,348
Where did you go, Ji Won?

153
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:56,218
Mount Nam.

154
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:57,658
It was really nice.

155
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,487
- I had fun too. - It looked like it.

156
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,158
I heard stories from Sang Won.

157
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:08,298
(Reading the room)

158
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,097
Did you not talk with Sang Won?

159
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,408
Like...

160
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,008
how Sang Won studied?

161
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:17,778
- How Sang Won studied? - Yes.

162
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:21,048
I didn't ask him detailed questions.

163
00:07:22,248 --> 00:07:24,477
But I could tell the kind of life...

164
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,988
he lived through one answer from him.

165
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:32,088
(Smiling)

166
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:34,488
(Smiling)

167
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,397
(A tense standoff between the two older women...)

168
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:41,468
(who have gone on a date with Sang Won)

169
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:47,867
(Will Ye Eun be able to win Sang Won's heart on this date?)

170
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,938
Did you eat?

171
00:07:50,308 --> 00:07:52,038
Near the school...

172
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:54,148
What was it?

173
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,148
I went there almost every day when attending...

174
00:07:57,178 --> 00:07:59,747
- Seoul Arts High School. - Your favorite place?

175
00:07:59,748 --> 00:08:02,988
Yes, it's a restaurant right below the dance studio.

176
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,858
How about we check out the place?

177
00:08:06,058 --> 00:08:07,228
I'm in.

178
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,387
Let's visit your nostalgic restaurant.

179
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,757
I have a feeling it'd be snack bar food.

180
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:12,597
- How did you know? - If it's your nostalgic food.

181
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:13,728
I'm surprised.

182
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:19,368
(The sun has set.)

183
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,907
- Oh, my. - My gosh.

184
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:23,107
- Director Park. - Is this the place?

185
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,337
- That was unexpected. - This is...

186
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,977
- the place. - Being thoughtful...

187
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:27,608
- Okay. - is second nature to Sang Won.

188
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:30,078
Right.

189
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,677
- So he's actually like that. - Hi.

190
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,116
Hi.

191
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:35,386
(Ye Eun's Seoul Arts High School era favorite place with Sang Won)

192
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:36,818
It's giving off high school vibes.

193
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:39,717
Look around closely, and I'm sure you'll find one.

194
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:41,988
Ye Eun must also find it new.

195
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:43,927
When was the last time you came here?

196
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:45,448
You haven't been here in years, right?

197
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:47,598
It's my first time after graduating.

198
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:51,138
I wanted to drop by when I visited my school before,

199
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:52,938
but it was closed then.

200
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:56,538
It was a bummer I couldn't eat, but I'm glad I can today.

201
00:08:57,508 --> 00:09:00,007
I'm getting excited. I haven't had snack bar food...

202
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:01,477
in such a long time.

203
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:02,478
(Really?)

204
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:05,318
I'm not someone who loves tteokbokki.

205
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:07,188
I try to avoid it because I know it's good.

206
00:09:07,688 --> 00:09:09,168
As you know, the seasoning is strong.

207
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:12,058
You worked out like crazy yesterday.

208
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:13,858
Three minutes?

209
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:17,798
- Literally three minutes. - But I was genuinely surprised.

210
00:09:18,128 --> 00:09:20,097
Really? All the men and women...

211
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:21,328
are saying that to me.

212
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:22,898
You did well.

213
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:24,297
She must've fallen for him.

214
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:25,738
It was unexpected from him.

215
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:27,437
He had the best posture.

216
00:09:27,438 --> 00:09:31,677
His chest was open, which was quite a shocker.

217
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:32,908
Yes, he had the best posture.

218
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:35,147
- Three, four, five, - You never know what'll happen.

219
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:36,277
- six... - Who knew Ye Eun...

220
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:37,447
would fall for that?

221
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:38,548
Nobody foresaw it.

222
00:09:39,318 --> 00:09:41,687
- Was I not that bad? - It wasn't "not that bad."

223
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:43,388
Is that so? I'm glad.

224
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:47,788
You kept saying, "I can't do it." But when you did the pull-up,

225
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,427
you had amazing posture.

226
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:52,628
I was right next to the fitness equipment.

227
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,468
"For real?" That was the first surprise.

228
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,398
You were good.

229
00:09:57,668 --> 00:09:59,988
- You were even good at sit-ups. - She has fallen for him.

230
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:02,467
The push-ups really surprised me.

231
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,378
- She has fallen head over heels. - Totally.

232
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:08,008
Until now, Sang Won has been underrated.

233
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:09,377
- He's been underrated. - "Underrated?"

234
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:11,618
She's right. Sang Won is an extraordinary person.

235
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,748
Everyone was going all out, so I got absorbed...

236
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:16,688
- Here's your order. - Thank you.

237
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:18,558
- Thank you. - It looks good.

238
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,657
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

239
00:10:20,658 --> 00:10:21,938
- Thank you. - It's on the side.

240
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:24,457
Should I dish some out?

241
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,228
No, we can just...

242
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:28,427
I haven't used the chopsticks yet.

243
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,268
(Dishing some food for Ye Eun)

244
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:32,637
- We could've just dug in. - What?

245
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:34,137
(Feeling shy)

246
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:35,767
We'll probably end up like that...

247
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:36,808
- over time. - True.

248
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:38,737
- Here. - Thanks.

249
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:39,808
Of course.

250
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:42,208
I thought you wouldn't like snack bar food...

251
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:44,248
since you'd have to watch what you eat.

252
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:45,977
You liked it when you were a student.

253
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,617
(Eating)

254
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:48,988
I'm a big eater.

255
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,828
There's no end to taking care of my body.

256
00:10:54,928 --> 00:10:55,958
It's good.

257
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,458
- Right? - High school girls...

258
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:00,398
must love this place.

259
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:03,098
I bet they wouldn't want school food.

260
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:05,668
Delicious.

261
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:09,768
Since we're at my old school...

262
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:15,448
The reason I chose this place was that...

263
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:17,778
I almost couldn't attend this school.

264
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,187
Why? Because of financial reasons?

265
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:21,248
Yes, financial reasons.

266
00:11:21,718 --> 00:11:23,958
At the time,

267
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:28,158
our family went through a very hard time.

268
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:33,358
So, they told me that I couldn't...

269
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:34,768
do ballet anymore.

270
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:39,768
We started living in a container home...

271
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:42,068
with 1 room and 1 bathroom.

272
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:44,808
I used to cry every night...

273
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,448
in the bathroom with the water running.

274
00:11:47,648 --> 00:11:49,648
But I guess they heard that.

275
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:50,748
Your parents heard that?

276
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:51,878
(Nodding)

277
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:56,318
After some time, she said to me,

278
00:11:57,488 --> 00:12:00,458
"Ye Eun, I'll figure out a way to fix this."

279
00:12:02,058 --> 00:12:03,528
"I'll find a way,"

280
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:09,198
"so go to the arts high school and keep doing ballet."

281
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:12,438
That's why... You know,

282
00:12:14,738 --> 00:12:16,498
until I joined the Korean National Ballet...

283
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:20,138
and became the principal dancer,

284
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,178
a lot had happened.

285
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:28,618
But what drove me and motivated me...

286
00:12:28,718 --> 00:12:30,558
the most was...

287
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:34,388
the fact that my mom did her best to support me...

288
00:12:35,228 --> 00:12:36,488
in pursuing my dream.

289
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:42,468
You could say it was the most critical period.

290
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:45,498
And she supported you during that.

291
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:49,438
I believe I have come this far,

292
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,078
all thanks to her.

293
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:56,048
That's why I picked this as my memorable place.

294
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,918
To tell you about myself,

295
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,388
I had to tell you this story as well.

296
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:09,228
It must have been difficult...

297
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:11,598
to bring it up.

298
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:14,628
Thanks for telling me.

299
00:13:16,998 --> 00:13:18,268
I also want to know about you.

300
00:13:22,808 --> 00:13:24,908
I was mostly influenced by my parents.

301
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,488
My father is a doctor, actually.

302
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:29,507
I grew up watching that,

303
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,247
and my parents obviously believed it was a nice job,

304
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:35,188
so I've had this vague dream since my childhood.

305
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:39,557
Then, I went to medical school and communicated...

306
00:13:39,558 --> 00:13:40,998
with all the professors and seniors,

307
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,888
and I realized how cool being a doctor was.

308
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:46,898
I was thankful that I made the decision to follow this path.

309
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:50,667
And it suits me. That's all.

310
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:52,937
- They're having serious chats. - Yes.

311
00:13:52,938 --> 00:13:54,008
This is nice.

312
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:55,138
That's cool.

313
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,177
We all have different talents,

314
00:13:58,178 --> 00:13:59,977
and we chose different paths to show for it.

315
00:13:59,978 --> 00:14:02,078
(They got to know each other better.)

316
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:05,448
There's something that can liven up the mood.

317
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,024
How about a bite of spicy stir-fried pork with rice?

318
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,048
(You're unbelievable.)

319
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,048
Is it too...

320
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:11,457
(That was clever.)

321
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,788
- Sang Won is clever. - He is.

322
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:14,928
- He's delightful. - Yes.

323
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:16,258
(That wasn't so bad.)

324
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:19,657
- It got too depressed, didn't it? - No, I loved it.

325
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,067
But it looked like you were feeling bad.

326
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,398
I was worried things were getting too serious.

327
00:14:23,798 --> 00:14:26,137
- I wanted you to tell me... - Right.

328
00:14:26,138 --> 00:14:27,468
Comfortably.

329
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,607
I was only trying to brighten up the mood.

330
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:32,777
You don't need to worry...

331
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:34,377
about bringing the mood down.

332
00:14:34,378 --> 00:14:36,347
But I believed...

333
00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:39,347
that talking about these would help us...

334
00:14:39,348 --> 00:14:41,148
feel more intimate.

335
00:14:42,588 --> 00:14:45,588
It's not something you tell everyone about.

336
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:48,988
From my point of view,

337
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:54,168
you may seem shallow on the outside...

338
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:57,568
Or you pretend to be shallow.

339
00:14:58,138 --> 00:15:01,438
But I thought that you were serious and thoughtful.

340
00:15:02,408 --> 00:15:05,138
I'm thankful that you acknowledge it.

341
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,477
Ye Eun seems more at ease now.

342
00:15:08,478 --> 00:15:11,218
(They feel more comfortable than on their first date.)

343
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,248
(Staring)

344
00:15:15,988 --> 00:15:17,668
You want to come back for more, don't you?

345
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:19,788
I'm sorry,

346
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:22,088
but you said this was...

347
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,327
your first time coming here after your graduation.

348
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:25,328
(Giggling)

349
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,198
I wouldn't be able to tell how long it's been for you,

350
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:30,697
but if it took you this long to come back...

351
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:31,797
Will you come back another time?

352
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:35,238
(Asking again)

353
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:38,337
(Nodding)

354
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,408
If I get a chance.

355
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,348
If I get a chance. But...

356
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,348
I don't think you'll come back here.

357
00:15:45,348 --> 00:15:46,477
Will you come if I ask?

358
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,887
(Nodding)

359
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:49,048
Of course.

360
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:51,457
(They promise to come back.)

361
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,578
But it even took you all this time to come back here.

362
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,558
- How about, "We'll come back?" - I like it.

363
00:15:57,758 --> 00:15:58,758
(Yenie and Wonie will come back!)

364
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:02,327
(Ye Eun wishes to go on another date with him.)

365
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,137
I hope I come back to Mount Nam soon.

366
00:16:04,138 --> 00:16:05,568
Will you come with me?

367
00:16:05,768 --> 00:16:07,407
- Obviously. We're coming together. - Really?

368
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:09,084
(Ji Won also wishes to go on another date with him.)

369
00:16:09,108 --> 00:16:11,277
I was curious to know...

370
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,407
who I could talk to easily...

371
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:15,508
and communicate well with.

372
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,418
I'm glad I realized who it was.

373
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:20,587
Oh, he realized?

374
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,047
Who is it? I'm so curious.

375
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,157
- So am I. - Who's the girl?

376
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:25,658
(Who is Sang Won more interested in?)

377
00:16:26,588 --> 00:16:28,657
Did you go with Ji Won, then?

378
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:29,687
No.

379
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,457
I drove from the Yeon House to Seoul all by myself...

380
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,598
and drove here from Seoul.

381
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:38,297
Does that mean I'm the only one who was in your car?

382
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,868
Yes, I meant it when I said that you were the only one.

383
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:43,268
Did you fasten your seatbelt?

384
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:44,677
- Yes. - That was quick.

385
00:16:44,678 --> 00:16:47,777
- Is it that meaningful? - It is my habit.

386
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:49,308
She's just glad.

387
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,848
It's not like she sat on his lap. It was the passenger seat.

388
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:54,387
Did another woman sit...

389
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,148
in his passenger seat or not?

390
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,617
- Right. - That's very meaningful.

391
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:59,887
- It is. - Not unless you sit on his lap.

392
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,128
It's very significant.

393
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:05,027
In the interview, Sang Won said that he realized...

394
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:07,797
who he was more interested in.

395
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:09,597
But he never told us who it was.

396
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:11,967
Right. Please tell us.

397
00:17:11,968 --> 00:17:13,196
Who do you think it is?

398
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,907
He sounded confident that he realized.

399
00:17:15,438 --> 00:17:17,406
- I say it's Ji Won. - Ji Won?

400
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:19,008
- Ji Won. - Ji Won?

401
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:20,907
I think it's Ye Eun.

402
00:17:21,278 --> 00:17:23,676
Okay. We have one vote each.

403
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:24,877
I also think it's Ji Won.

404
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,117
I also think it's Ji Won.

405
00:17:27,117 --> 00:17:28,347
I'm the only one who thinks it's Ye Eun?

406
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,847
(Ji Won: 3, Ye Eun: 1)

407
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,887
Maybe it's because he's tired, but compared to the date...

408
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:34,958
with Ji Won, his mood seemed down.

409
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:38,297
When he was with Ji Won, it looked like...

410
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:40,727
- he was only listening... - Was he?

411
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:42,667
To Ji Won's story, and the date ended.

412
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:43,668
That's also true.

413
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:46,397
- But with Ye Eun, - He never told her about himself.

414
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,614
He got to tell her about himself.

415
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:49,737
That might have changed things for him.

416
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:51,277
- You have a point. - Yes.

417
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,654
(He told Ye Eun about himself for the first time.)

418
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:53,977
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin return to the Yeon House after the date.)

419
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:55,248
Bon Hee and Mu Jin.

420
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,617
(Looking around)

421
00:17:59,618 --> 00:18:01,318
Do you have water in your car?

422
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:02,718
I don't.

423
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:07,057
(It looks like she's coughing due to a cold.)

424
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:08,558
She's coming down with a cold.

425
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:11,398
- Your throat hurts, doesn't it? - I'm coughing because it itches.

426
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,098
(She can't seem to stop coughing.)

427
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,448
Should I turn off the air-conditioner?

428
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,298
(Nodding)

429
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:21,968
Don't you feel hot?

430
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,008
I'm fine.

431
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:26,008
Let's turn it back on when it feels hot.

432
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:30,648
By the way,

433
00:18:32,218 --> 00:18:36,248
how would you feel if a younger guy called you "noona?"

434
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:41,087
(You don't like it when a guy calls you "noona?")

435
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:43,688
(I prefer it when he calls me by my name.)

436
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:46,098
(Your hands are pretty.)

437
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,128
(So are yours, noona.)

438
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:53,438
(The word "noona" gave her a reality check.)

439
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,607
Mu Jin was worried about that too.

440
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:58,507
- Right. - He read her face.

441
00:18:58,508 --> 00:18:59,838
He did.

442
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:04,518
"Noona?" That's why it felt weird when you said it to me.

443
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:06,848
But I wouldn't mind it now.

444
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,488
I never liked the idea...

445
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:13,718
of calling you by your name...

446
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:17,158
just to seem manly.

447
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,228
But that doesn't mean I'd keep calling you "noona."

448
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:24,268
I thought I called you that...

449
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:25,768
only when it felt natural.

450
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:29,368
You said that you've dated a younger guy before.

451
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:33,408
But he never called me "noona" at the time.

452
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:37,308
When I started dating older women,

453
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:41,048
I never once called them "noona."

454
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,157
I usually called them by their names...

455
00:19:46,158 --> 00:19:47,528
or called them "honey."

456
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,528
- "Honey?" - Yes.

457
00:19:49,628 --> 00:19:50,798
I've never said that before.

458
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,328
- Seriously? - I never...

459
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:56,228
But it feels natural to me.

460
00:19:56,968 --> 00:19:58,798
Not that I'd use it right away.

461
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:01,667
Oh, I see.

462
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,838
I mostly called them by their names or "honey."

463
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,307
(Thinking)

464
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:07,377
(Laughing)

465
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:09,008
I guess it's cringeworthy to you.

466
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:10,408
"Honey."

467
00:20:12,618 --> 00:20:14,317
I never even imagined saying it.

468
00:20:14,318 --> 00:20:15,747
- Really? - Yes.

469
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:16,988
(Unexpected)

470
00:20:17,418 --> 00:20:20,417
She might find it awkward since she's never said it.

471
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:22,124
(They have different views about pet names.)

472
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:24,686
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin arrive at the Yeon House.)

473
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:28,355
- I think I hear people. - They're having a chat.

474
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,450
They're outside.

475
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,624
(Hi!)

476
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,155
That's so cute!

477
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:35,436
Look at those matching outfits.

478
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:36,466
What's that?

479
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:38,907
- You guys look so cute together. - Do we?

480
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:41,277
How was the date?

481
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,537
Good.

482
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:46,047
- Did you guys have fun? - How was it?

483
00:20:46,107 --> 00:20:47,747
We had so much fun, didn't we?

484
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:48,947
Sure.

485
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:51,187
- The four of us. - What?

486
00:20:51,787 --> 00:20:53,086
- It was a double date. - Yes.

487
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:54,116
- A double date. - Seriously?

488
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:55,456
Yes, we just came back from a double date.

489
00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:56,686
We went to an amusement park...

490
00:20:56,687 --> 00:20:58,157
- and went to Mount Nam. - Right.

491
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,977
- You're lying. - What does that even mean?

492
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:04,866
You two must have been together all day.

493
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:05,867
- What did you do? - Where did you go?

494
00:21:05,868 --> 00:21:07,096
- We went to Chuncheon. - Chuncheon!

495
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:08,867
- Really? - And we visited a gallery.

496
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,066
- That sounds nice. - An art gallery.

497
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:12,807
(Jealous)

498
00:21:13,977 --> 00:21:15,537
Oh, and we made rings today.

499
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:18,847
- Look at that! - What?

500
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,276
- What? - What?

501
00:21:20,277 --> 00:21:21,576
Is this your first day as a couple?

502
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:22,846
(Grinning)

503
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:23,847
Yes.

504
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:25,516
- What? - Look at him!

505
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,517
(Shy)

506
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,186
You look so happy.

507
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:29,916
But I sweated so much...

508
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:31,926
- because of this cardigan. - It could be engraved...

509
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:33,897
- Show us! - by spinning it.

510
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:35,296
- It's pretty. - That sounds nice.

511
00:21:35,297 --> 00:21:36,703
- That's nice. - You're a cute couple.

512
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:39,127
When is your wedding?

513
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,667
Stop it.

514
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:42,736
You're making me want to punch you again.

515
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:44,437
(Pondering)

516
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,036
He's imagining it.

517
00:21:46,037 --> 00:21:47,336
(Nodding)

518
00:21:47,337 --> 00:21:48,507
(Laughing)

519
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,277
- You're so cheeky. - He is.

520
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:54,117
Okay.

521
00:21:54,277 --> 00:21:56,246
(Eating)

522
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:59,486
(Yeon House)

523
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:00,516
Good work today.

524
00:22:00,517 --> 00:22:02,917
Good work. Thank you for waiting all that time.

525
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:05,727
They're all outside.

526
00:22:08,097 --> 00:22:09,957
We're back.

527
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:13,067
- Hi. - Hi.

528
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:14,797
How was the date?

529
00:22:16,197 --> 00:22:18,567
(It's a secret.)

530
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:21,737
- Ji Won was watching. - Yes.

531
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:27,517
- Hello. - Hello.

532
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:28,817
How was the date?

533
00:22:29,277 --> 00:22:30,787
Yes. I stayed confident.

534
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:34,157
- See you soon. - See you.

535
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:36,587
Oh, boy.

536
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:38,556
(Impressed)

537
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,787
Two dates?

538
00:22:41,657 --> 00:22:43,456
I drove for too long today.

539
00:22:43,457 --> 00:22:44,567
Sang Won!

540
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:45,967
What?

541
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,367
So, you went on two dates?

542
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,737
- Oh, you're back. - Yes. I'm exhausted.

543
00:22:56,637 --> 00:22:58,647
I heard a rumor that you went on two dates today.

544
00:22:59,407 --> 00:23:00,947
Everyone knows.

545
00:23:01,477 --> 00:23:02,617
That's hilarious.

546
00:23:02,817 --> 00:23:04,516
It hits harder...

547
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:05,916
- because he once got zero votes... - Right.

548
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,556
And had to stay at home.

549
00:23:07,557 --> 00:23:08,917
He missed two dates in a row.

550
00:23:10,317 --> 00:23:11,787
Who were your dates?

551
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:14,357
- Ji Won and Ye Eun. - How was it?

552
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:17,497
Well,

553
00:23:18,827 --> 00:23:20,127
I guess it was fun.

554
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:23,637
It was a good chance to make up my mind.

555
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,036
It helped me make a decision.

556
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,307
- I still can't tell who it is. - I wonder who.

557
00:23:27,777 --> 00:23:29,276
- What happened today? - What?

558
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:30,607
Why were you at home?

559
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,307
Ji Yung picked me.

560
00:23:33,507 --> 00:23:35,347
- Ji Yung? - Yes, I heard.

561
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,617
I never expected that for Sang Hyeon.

562
00:23:40,247 --> 00:23:42,956
I was expecting him to go on a date with either of the two.

563
00:23:42,957 --> 00:23:44,426
(Bon Hee or So Hyun)

564
00:23:44,427 --> 00:23:47,197
I never thought he'd be chosen by both of them.

565
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,856
Hyeon Jun is upset.

566
00:23:49,857 --> 00:23:51,327
You probably never saw it coming.

567
00:23:51,627 --> 00:23:53,296
Well, I knew she had the right...

568
00:23:53,297 --> 00:23:55,337
- Right. Obviously. - to get to know others.

569
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:57,467
Why are you so cool about it?

570
00:23:57,607 --> 00:23:59,267
Well, there's nothing I can do about it.

571
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:05,907
For the first time ever, I believe you.

572
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,346
- What do you mean? - You said that you weren't sure...

573
00:24:07,347 --> 00:24:08,793
- about how Yeong Gyeong felt. - Yes.

574
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:11,986
I used to think that you were saying that to be humble.

575
00:24:11,987 --> 00:24:13,317
No, I honestly wasn't sure.

576
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:16,717
I talked to Ye Eun a lot, even on our way back home.

577
00:24:17,387 --> 00:24:20,857
Apparently, Yeong Gyeong never thought about it that way.

578
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:22,556
She never knew you were only going for her.

579
00:24:22,557 --> 00:24:23,557
- Me? - Yes.

580
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:25,297
She didn't know I was only after her?

581
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:28,966
I heard that and realized why you said it was complicated.

582
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,266
- I don't know anything. - You really couldn't...

583
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:31,607
figure her out.

584
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:36,877
(Was Yeong Gyeong actually clueless about how Hyeon Jun felt?)

585
00:24:37,407 --> 00:24:39,906
(While Hyeon Jun waits at home...)

586
00:24:39,907 --> 00:24:40,977
It's Yeong Gyeong.

587
00:24:42,577 --> 00:24:44,916
She's dressed really young tonight.

588
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,917
(Who did she choose for the Memory Location Date?)

589
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:48,387
(Hurrying)

590
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:54,526
(The younger guy who came to her)

591
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:59,127
(Sang Hyeon)

592
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:01,737
(Smiling brightly)

593
00:25:02,997 --> 00:25:08,776
(The 2nd of the 2 photos in Sang Hyeon's drawer)

594
00:25:08,777 --> 00:25:10,646
(Yeong Gyeong)

595
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:11,677
I'm sorry I'm late.

596
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:13,577
Hi.

597
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:15,076
Hi.

598
00:25:15,077 --> 00:25:16,947
(Shy)

599
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:18,847
Do you know where we are?

600
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:21,016
Yes. It's Korea University.

601
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:22,186
(Yeong Gyeong's memorable place, Korea University)

602
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,386
- You're right. - Why are you impressed?

603
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:24,756
It's obviously Korea University.

604
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:28,956
I was actually a student ambassador during my time here.

605
00:25:28,957 --> 00:25:31,226
- Did you see the photo? - Yes.

606
00:25:31,227 --> 00:25:33,226
- Did you? - I did.

607
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:34,237
That's the one.

608
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,266
- It makes so much sense. - Because she was so pretty.

609
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:37,436
It's very convincing, right?

610
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:39,313
(She used to be one of the student ambassadors.)

611
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,807
- That's why... - Is this you?

612
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,906
- That's why... - Is this you?

613
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:43,947
It is.

614
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,146
- That's me. - I've been trying...

615
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:47,176
- to find you. - Oh, my gosh.

616
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:50,476
It felt very strange, in fact.

617
00:25:50,477 --> 00:25:52,687
We dropped the honorifics today,

618
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:55,517
and it felt more intimate.

619
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:58,227
I wanted to...

620
00:25:58,527 --> 00:26:01,957
tell you more about myself today,

621
00:26:02,597 --> 00:26:05,666
so I invited you to the place of my memory.

622
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:08,436
And it's where I spent my entire youth,

623
00:26:08,437 --> 00:26:10,137
Korea University.

624
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:12,867
- Did you write a script? - No.

625
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:14,136
Did you write it ahead of time?

626
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:16,577
Reminiscing on my student ambassador days,

627
00:26:16,837 --> 00:26:18,776
I'll show you around campus.

628
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,247
Really? Right now?

629
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,187
We're going on a night walk.

630
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,847
- Good. I love that. - Do you?

631
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:29,456
- Shall we? - Let's go.

632
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:30,586
(Yeong Gyeong's Memory Location Date)

633
00:26:30,587 --> 00:26:31,707
(A tour of Korea University)

634
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:34,396
It's pretty.

635
00:26:34,397 --> 00:26:36,197
- It's nice overall. - Right?

636
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:38,127
It's beautiful.

637
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,767
- Why don't I take a photo? - Sure.

638
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:43,536
Like this?

639
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:45,736
(He takes a photo of Yeong Gyeong.)

640
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:46,737
All right.

641
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:48,977
(Clicking)

642
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:53,877
- Do you want some more? - No.

643
00:26:54,277 --> 00:26:55,917
I prefer taking photos together.

644
00:26:57,647 --> 00:26:59,417
- Let's take one together. - Sure.

645
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:07,026
(At Yeong Gyeong's place of memory, )

646
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:11,327
(Sang Hyeon is there this time.)

647
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:13,767
You're very good at facial expressions.

648
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:15,696
My face is cramping up.

649
00:27:15,697 --> 00:27:16,697
(A little embarrassed)

650
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:18,107
It's a good photo.

651
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:21,107
- Should we sit there for a moment? - Should we?

652
00:27:24,047 --> 00:27:25,677
I needed a break.

653
00:27:26,307 --> 00:27:28,617
It's been so hectic since morning.

654
00:27:29,117 --> 00:27:30,417
Did you have fun?

655
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,157
- Well... - Is going on two dates fun?

656
00:27:35,317 --> 00:27:36,616
"Going on two dates."

657
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:38,757
It's not that easy. I'm exhausted.

658
00:27:38,927 --> 00:27:40,756
I tried to show you that I was interested, though.

659
00:27:40,757 --> 00:27:42,757
- Did you? - Didn't I?

660
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:45,797
You did.

661
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:47,597
You were also nice to me.

662
00:27:49,397 --> 00:27:53,307
(She gave him a lip balm.)

663
00:27:54,137 --> 00:27:56,006
Yeong Gyeong gave it to me as a gift.

664
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,676
- I told her last time... - Why would you brag about it...

665
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:58,777
in front of me?

666
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,376
- Exactly. - Sorry about that.

667
00:28:01,377 --> 00:28:02,377
(Sorry about that.)

668
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:05,687
I'm actually wearing it right now.

669
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:11,027
Did you apply it and go on a date with another girl?

670
00:28:12,187 --> 00:28:13,187
(Startled)

671
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:18,267
Your words are pretty aggressive.

672
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,127
(Laughing)

673
00:28:20,697 --> 00:28:22,736
Did you have dinner?

674
00:28:22,737 --> 00:28:24,407
No, not yet.

675
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:27,007
Still? Aren't you hungry?

676
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,876
Did you have dinner with her too?

677
00:28:28,877 --> 00:28:30,376
No, I didn't.

678
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,176
- I didn't. - Are you sure?

679
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,046
"Did you have dinner with her too?"

680
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,276
He can't look her in the eyes again.

681
00:28:35,277 --> 00:28:36,616
I didn't have dinner yet.

682
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:38,447
(This is their second date.)

683
00:28:38,747 --> 00:28:40,617
I've been...

684
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:43,286
meaning to ask you.

685
00:28:43,287 --> 00:28:44,287
Okay.

686
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:48,227
On our first date, I got the impression...

687
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,996
that you only saw me...

688
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,097
as a nice, younger guy.

689
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:55,636
What are you talking about?

690
00:28:55,637 --> 00:28:58,037
Her eyes were filled with love.

691
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:02,336
(You're supposed to tuck it into your collar.)

692
00:29:02,337 --> 00:29:03,607
(This is how you do it?)

693
00:29:04,147 --> 00:29:06,276
(Finding him cute)

694
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,947
I get why he thought so, though.

695
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:12,387
The way she stared at him felt like,

696
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:15,317
"Look at you eating!"

697
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,726
But she was genuinely interested in him.

698
00:29:18,727 --> 00:29:20,797
(When she showed her interest in him, )

699
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:28,997
(he felt that she only saw him as her little brother.)

700
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:33,267
Right now, as I'm sitting here,

701
00:29:33,907 --> 00:29:35,207
from my point of view...

702
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:39,707
(Curious)

703
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:46,087
I guess I should say that I'm puzzled.

704
00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:49,617
- Really? - Yes.

705
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:52,427
Can I assume...

706
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:53,657
Yes.

707
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:58,067
That you like me?

708
00:30:05,467 --> 00:30:08,207
I'm not sure how you feel.

709
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:12,207
Because he thought that she was into Hyeon Jun.

710
00:30:13,147 --> 00:30:14,176
- That too. - Maybe he did.

711
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:17,647
Also, she never directly showed that she liked him.

712
00:30:17,947 --> 00:30:19,687
Even though they went on a date,

713
00:30:20,187 --> 00:30:22,386
how Yeong Gyeong felt about Sang Hyeon...

714
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,387
wasn't conveyed toward Sang Hyeon at all.

715
00:30:24,487 --> 00:30:25,886
He's confused right now.

716
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:28,056
Sang Hyeon seems to be the type that can't keep his options open...

717
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:31,567
but that focuses only on one person at a time.

718
00:30:31,867 --> 00:30:34,736
So since the two of them showed their interest in him,

719
00:30:34,737 --> 00:30:37,196
he probably wanted to be sure about his feelings,

720
00:30:37,197 --> 00:30:39,266
which I think is why he asked that question.

721
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:40,907
(It seems so.)

722
00:30:42,037 --> 00:30:44,907
So I'm not sure about how you really feel.

723
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:51,417
To tell you the truth...

724
00:30:52,347 --> 00:30:54,457
I asked you out on a date...

725
00:30:54,757 --> 00:30:58,486
because I wanted to know how we feel about each other.

726
00:30:58,487 --> 00:30:59,487
I understand.

727
00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:01,928
Because I wanted to find out more about your honest feelings.

728
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:08,237
Also, on our first date,

729
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:10,697
I was a little nervous.

730
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:13,166
- I became much more comfortable... - You were nervous.

731
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,437
Around you than before.

732
00:31:16,077 --> 00:31:19,446
Even so, I wanted to talk more to you.

733
00:31:19,447 --> 00:31:20,646
- Really? - That's the reason.

734
00:31:20,647 --> 00:31:23,277
With me, what you see is what you get.

735
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:26,217
So it won't make any difference.

736
00:31:26,447 --> 00:31:28,157
(Realizing)

737
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:34,397
(Yeong Gyeong chose Sang Hyeon as a dating partner twice in a row.)

738
00:31:35,357 --> 00:31:36,696
That's understandable.

739
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:38,266
(Yeong Gyeong and Sang Hyeon head back to Yeon House after the date.)

740
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:40,443
There must be someone who has sent you Love QR messages...

741
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:43,097
or someone you've been sending Love QR messages to.

742
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:45,437
That's right. There is.

743
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:48,677
- But I'm really curious about it. - Right.

744
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:53,907
Even when I receive a message, I don't know who sent it.

745
00:31:54,277 --> 00:31:56,847
Can you guess who that could be?

746
00:31:58,587 --> 00:32:01,417
- First, Hyeon Jun. - Hyeon Jun?

747
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:04,927
He's been making it clear that he was interested in me...

748
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:09,497
since the first day we met. So I guess it could be him.

749
00:32:10,427 --> 00:32:13,527
I can't guess the other one. Could it be Golden Retriever? No?

750
00:32:14,437 --> 00:32:15,537
- Me? - Yes.

751
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:16,877
- He seems very surprised. - Me?

752
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,537
Yes. You haven't sent me any?

753
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:23,077
I... Well... Actually, I've never sent you any messages.

754
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:25,477
Really? You've never sent me any messages?

755
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,576
- No. - Is that true?

756
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:28,577
Yes.

757
00:32:29,277 --> 00:32:30,576
(Realizing)

758
00:32:30,577 --> 00:32:31,687
Not even once?

759
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:33,287
No.

760
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:36,086
- Really? - She thought he had sent it to her.

761
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,416
Oh, boy. I feel bad for her.

762
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:40,187
Then who is it? I'm shocked.

763
00:32:41,397 --> 00:32:42,526
She was mistaken.

764
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:43,656
(She thought he had sent her a Love QR message.)

765
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:44,767
You're embarrassed, right?

766
00:32:45,127 --> 00:32:47,797
That's not it. I mean, yes, I'm a little embarrassed.

767
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:50,636
I'm so curious. Here's why.

768
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:53,667
There's someone who chose me.

769
00:32:53,907 --> 00:32:56,906
And I want to talk to him at least once.

770
00:32:56,907 --> 00:32:59,207
Oh, I see. Is that how it all happened today?

771
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:02,577
You chose me because you got the wrong idea?

772
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,217
Yes.

773
00:33:04,247 --> 00:33:05,786
- Really? - That's right.

774
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:07,246
You should go on another date.

775
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:08,357
Are you serious?

776
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:12,256
This is why it was unexpected. I told you I was surprised.

777
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:15,227
Oh, that's why you said that.

778
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,266
That you were surprised by my choice.

779
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:20,226
(Yeong Gyeong now knows the truth. How will her feelings change?)

780
00:33:20,227 --> 00:33:22,897
Yeong Gyeong must be taken aback...

781
00:33:23,297 --> 00:33:25,206
because she thought it was Sang Hyeon who sent the message...

782
00:33:25,207 --> 00:33:27,166
- when it was actually Ji Yung. - That's understandable.

783
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:29,476
And that was why she wanted to talk more to Sang Hyeon...

784
00:33:29,477 --> 00:33:30,783
and decided to go on a date with him.

785
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:32,446
But then she found out it wasn't Sang Hyeon,

786
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:34,347
and it was someone else who sent the message.

787
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:38,686
I wonder if it changed her feelings.

788
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:41,287
I think her feelings for him have reduced.

789
00:33:41,517 --> 00:33:43,457
I'm pretty sure she's very disappointed.

790
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:49,327
(Mu Jin was resting after the date with Bon Hee.)

791
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:52,897
I wonder if Mu Jin feels at ease now.

792
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:54,636
- He seems to feel at ease. - Very much so.

793
00:33:54,637 --> 00:33:55,997
(Spraying)

794
00:33:58,707 --> 00:34:02,807
(He applies cologne and oral spray.)

795
00:34:04,447 --> 00:34:07,177
(Checking his appearance)

796
00:34:09,677 --> 00:34:11,047
Look how light-footed he seems.

797
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:14,717
(Mu Jin heads to the girls' room.)

798
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:19,186
(He runs into So Hyun who happens to be in the living room.)

799
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:20,255
- What's up? - I came for no reason.

800
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:21,427
- For no reason? - Yes.

801
00:34:21,657 --> 00:34:22,896
For no reason?

802
00:34:22,897 --> 00:34:24,096
- For no reason. - Really?

803
00:34:24,097 --> 00:34:25,565
- You wanted to rest here? - Yes.

804
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:26,967
- Oh, really? - Yes.

805
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:29,636
- I really came for no reason. - You did?

806
00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:30,795
Because you wanted to be alone?

807
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:32,476
No, I was wondering where the others were.

808
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:34,407
They gathered in that room.

809
00:34:35,036 --> 00:34:37,676
- I don't want to go in there. - Okay.

810
00:34:37,677 --> 00:34:39,422
- You can't go in there? - No, I mean, the girls...

811
00:34:39,447 --> 00:34:42,547
- Why are you being like this? - What does it mean?

812
00:34:42,677 --> 00:34:44,016
I understand.

813
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:46,417
You can't go in there.

814
00:34:46,847 --> 00:34:48,985
This is my first time talking to you alone.

815
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,087
- I know, right? - Yes.

816
00:34:53,087 --> 00:34:56,297
(So Hyun's first day at Yeon House)

817
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,067
(Glancing)

818
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:02,697
The one I was most curious about except for Sang Hyeon was Mu Jin.

819
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:06,807
Have you talked to the others a lot?

820
00:35:08,077 --> 00:35:10,007
As for 1-on-1 conversations...

821
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:13,377
I went on a date with Ji Yung yesterday.

822
00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:15,747
And today, I went on a date...

823
00:35:16,577 --> 00:35:17,577
with Sang Hyeon.

824
00:35:17,578 --> 00:35:19,846
But I haven't gotten a chance...

825
00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:23,017
to talk to the other three 1-on-1.

826
00:35:23,317 --> 00:35:24,677
Right. You got no chance to do so.

827
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:28,057
I was curious because you said you were a model.

828
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,573
- I was curious about your work. - You're very interested in fashion.

829
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:33,926
Yes, I really love fashion.

830
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:35,397
I saw your shoes. They were nice.

831
00:35:35,797 --> 00:35:38,636
The ones you wore yesterday for the game.

832
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:39,637
- Did you see those? - Yes.

833
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,836
- "Did you see those?" - "That model is hard to get."

834
00:35:41,837 --> 00:35:43,053
I was thinking that while looking at them.

835
00:35:43,077 --> 00:35:45,646
So Hyun shows interest in Mu Jin.

836
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:46,676
She doesn't seem uninterested in him.

837
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,177
Do you think that job suits you?

838
00:35:49,177 --> 00:35:51,886
- My job... - Do you like your job?

839
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:53,116
I think I like my job.

840
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,117
- Really? - Yes.

841
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:55,786
Of course, I get stressed out...

842
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:57,687
because I want to do well.

843
00:35:58,787 --> 00:36:00,127
But...

844
00:36:01,857 --> 00:36:04,397
I think I continued my career because it was enjoyable.

845
00:36:05,027 --> 00:36:06,566
I'm jealous.

846
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:08,197
- What do you mean? - I'm jealous...

847
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,896
that you have a job that you love.

848
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:13,206
- Considering everything about you, - Yes?

849
00:36:13,207 --> 00:36:14,837
I find it so cool about you.

850
00:36:16,777 --> 00:36:19,007
I wanted to get married early.

851
00:36:19,747 --> 00:36:21,546
In order to get married early,

852
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:24,147
- I tried to get a stable job. - I see.

853
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:26,217
I started my career earlier than others.

854
00:36:27,717 --> 00:36:29,857
- And my job... - Yes?

855
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:31,787
It has good work-life balance.

856
00:36:34,697 --> 00:36:37,427
- I get a lot of personal time... - I'm jealous of that kind of job.

857
00:36:38,227 --> 00:36:42,297
So I'm not exactly unhappy with my job.

858
00:36:43,937 --> 00:36:46,107
But when I see those who do what they love...

859
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:48,977
- You mean, as a job? - Yes.

860
00:36:49,037 --> 00:36:50,476
The two of them are very different, indeed.

861
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:52,807
I believe you have to be lucky to get a job you love.

862
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:55,117
- I also think I'm lucky. - Right.

863
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,616
Lately, I've been thinking a lot about it.

864
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,386
Being a public servant...

865
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,886
is the exact opposite of being a fashion model.

866
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:05,787
Thank you for sharing this with me.

867
00:37:05,987 --> 00:37:08,097
I felt very comfortable while talking to her.

868
00:37:08,597 --> 00:37:11,597
I saw the down-to-earth side of her as we talked.

869
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,597
I found her so cool.

870
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:16,937
So I got more curious about her.

871
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:20,437
I think I felt that way.

872
00:37:21,537 --> 00:37:24,677
On the day when So Hyun moved to Yeon House,

873
00:37:25,207 --> 00:37:27,977
she said she was curious about Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon.

874
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:31,247
And she and Mu Jin met in the living room...

875
00:37:31,747 --> 00:37:32,846
when no one else was there.

876
00:37:32,847 --> 00:37:34,616
Right. Both of them like fashion.

877
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:36,986
- They share some interests. - She did her best in a short time.

878
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:38,456
- In that darkness. - Right.

879
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:41,457
First, she sat next to him on that small sofa.

880
00:37:41,957 --> 00:37:45,266
She also tried hard to find shared interests.

881
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:46,696
- That's right. - She did everything she could.

882
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:47,996
She did everything she could.

883
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:49,666
You know, it's quite common...

884
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:53,366
for two people with opposite careers to meet and make a cute couple.

885
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:54,776
Such couples are really...

886
00:37:54,777 --> 00:37:55,976
- There's nothing... - There's a song about it.

887
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:57,176
"The Reason Why Opposites Attract."

888
00:37:57,177 --> 00:37:59,677
Exactly. It happens.

889
00:38:01,477 --> 00:38:04,887
(Bon Hee is fixing her hair alone in her room.)

890
00:38:05,987 --> 00:38:09,257
(Coming in quietly)

891
00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:11,977
I can't get out of the room because they are talking.

892
00:38:12,587 --> 00:38:13,756
I left them alone too.

893
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:16,227
We can have a chat. I was bored.

894
00:38:17,057 --> 00:38:19,567
Oh, no. She knows they're talking out in the living room?

895
00:38:20,597 --> 00:38:22,837
Do you mind me fixing my hair while talking to you?

896
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:25,137
(Nodding)

897
00:38:26,307 --> 00:38:27,337
The thing is...

898
00:38:27,937 --> 00:38:29,006
What... Go ahead.

899
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,546
I don't remember how to date a man.

900
00:38:31,547 --> 00:38:33,176
- Hold on a second. - That's sad.

901
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:36,247
You can go on. The topic sounded so profound.

902
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:37,877
(Sighing)

903
00:38:38,587 --> 00:38:40,187
- Are you talking about Sang Won? - Yes.

904
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:43,887
Why? Earlier... What's going on between you two?

905
00:38:44,587 --> 00:38:45,627
It's just...

906
00:38:47,587 --> 00:38:50,897
(After the date with Sang Won, Ji Won became worried.)

907
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:54,197
I think I should get to know him better...

908
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:58,207
and then make up my mind, but it's difficult.

909
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:00,966
I don't know what to talk about with him.

910
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:02,247
What about talking about outfit?

911
00:39:03,837 --> 00:39:06,247
- I'm good with words when relaxed. - Exactly.

912
00:39:07,047 --> 00:39:09,193
- I definitely know that. - But when I'm with someone I like,

913
00:39:09,217 --> 00:39:10,516
I can't talk.

914
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:11,886
- That's a given. I also... - I feel so nervous.

915
00:39:11,887 --> 00:39:13,487
- We... - My heart races...

916
00:39:13,947 --> 00:39:15,067
You know what I mean, right?

917
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:17,917
I just can't talk. I've become a fool.

918
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:20,587
But that's also who you are.

919
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:23,056
I surprised myself when I got so nervous after a long time.

920
00:39:23,057 --> 00:39:24,196
- Really? - Yes.

921
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:26,827
It's because Mu Jin and I...

922
00:39:27,127 --> 00:39:29,466
I felt something today that I hadn't felt before.

923
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,307
- What is it? - We had to speak casually.

924
00:39:33,107 --> 00:39:35,636
Mu Jin jokingly addressed me as an older woman a few times,

925
00:39:35,637 --> 00:39:37,607
and I got a reality check.

926
00:39:38,847 --> 00:39:40,407
- Because of what he called you? - Yes.

927
00:39:40,477 --> 00:39:42,917
I mean, I have a brother who's 11 years younger than me.

928
00:39:43,477 --> 00:39:45,687
If Mu Jin is 11 or 12 years younger than me,

929
00:39:46,247 --> 00:39:48,887
I wonder if I'd be okay with it.

930
00:39:49,457 --> 00:39:51,627
I thought about it even when I was on a date.

931
00:39:53,587 --> 00:39:55,426
We're old enough to know...

932
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:57,357
that marriage is more than...

933
00:39:57,627 --> 00:40:00,297
just a union of two people in love.

934
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:03,497
I consider marriage whenever I date someone.

935
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:06,266
I'm the type that wouldn't even start dating...

936
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:08,777
if the relationship has no marriage potential.

937
00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:11,407
That worries me now.

938
00:40:12,107 --> 00:40:13,547
I won't let him know though.

939
00:40:15,277 --> 00:40:17,376
Bon Hee seems to have decided to join the show...

940
00:40:17,377 --> 00:40:19,246
- to find someone to marry. - Right.

941
00:40:19,247 --> 00:40:20,793
(While enjoying the date, both of them were contemplating.)

942
00:40:20,817 --> 00:40:23,887
If you meet someone without knowing his age,

943
00:40:23,957 --> 00:40:25,856
and he turns out to be around the same age...

944
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:28,427
as your brother who's 11 years younger than you,

945
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:30,127
how would you feel?

946
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,896
Would that change your heart?

947
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:34,226
- No way. - It wouldn't change your heart?

948
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:35,237
I'd be grateful.

949
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,337
I was kidding. An 11-year age difference...

950
00:40:39,507 --> 00:40:42,336
could weigh on my mind a little bit.

951
00:40:42,337 --> 00:40:43,337
It could?

952
00:40:43,637 --> 00:40:48,046
Yes. Because from my perspective,

953
00:40:48,047 --> 00:40:49,376
a man who's 11 years younger than me...

954
00:40:49,377 --> 00:40:50,676
would feel like my own child...

955
00:40:50,677 --> 00:40:52,316
- or my youngest brother. - My point exactly.

956
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:54,623
Imagine that a man you like is your little brother's friend.

957
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:56,657
That would change your perception of that man.

958
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,756
- It'd feel strange all of a sudden. - Right.

959
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,456
- It would worry me, indeed. - It must be hard for Bon Hee...

960
00:41:01,457 --> 00:41:03,533
- If he's around my brother's age... - I think I'd become a bit timid.

961
00:41:03,557 --> 00:41:05,196
I wonder how things will go between them.

962
00:41:05,197 --> 00:41:06,197
(That's possible.)

963
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:09,896
Come here. Let's sit over there for a while.

964
00:41:09,897 --> 00:41:10,897
The weather is nice.

965
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:15,236
(Sighing)

966
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:16,477
I have so much on my mind.

967
00:41:17,707 --> 00:41:18,707
Why?

968
00:41:19,907 --> 00:41:21,617
I'll be honest with you, Hyeon Jun.

969
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:23,317
To be honest,

970
00:41:24,947 --> 00:41:29,857
I think today's date was perfect for me.

971
00:41:30,757 --> 00:41:33,226
It's because I got a chance to compare those two.

972
00:41:33,227 --> 00:41:34,256
That's true.

973
00:41:34,257 --> 00:41:36,057
- Right. - So who is it?

974
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,697
Here's what I realized after that.

975
00:41:38,627 --> 00:41:41,427
I was more comfortable speaking casually to Ye Eun.

976
00:41:41,897 --> 00:41:44,297
But the one whom I hit it off well with...

977
00:41:44,907 --> 00:41:45,907
was Ji Won, clearly.

978
00:41:45,908 --> 00:41:47,588
I felt more energetic when I was with her.

979
00:41:49,337 --> 00:41:50,876
(Sighing)

980
00:41:50,877 --> 00:41:55,147
But I feel a little bad about it.

981
00:41:57,577 --> 00:41:59,247
You can just follow your heart.

982
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,356
(Sang Won still has a lot on his mind.)

983
00:42:02,357 --> 00:42:05,157
It seems that he's still unsure about his feelings for them.

984
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:07,786
(Right then, the last couple comes back home.)

985
00:42:07,787 --> 00:42:11,997
(Yeong Gyeong and Sang Hyeon)

986
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:13,297
It's like...

987
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:15,767
(Surprised)

988
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:16,897
You're late.

989
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:18,507
We're very late.

990
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:20,537
We went far away from here.

991
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:24,006
My gosh. She goes in without even looking at him.

992
00:42:24,007 --> 00:42:25,546
They're going inside the house.

993
00:42:25,547 --> 00:42:26,806
Let's change into comfortable clothes first.

994
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:27,977
Okay. Sounds good.

995
00:42:29,817 --> 00:42:31,887
I feel so sorry for Hyeon Jun.

996
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:39,887
(Knocking on the door)

997
00:42:39,887 --> 00:42:40,887
Come in.

998
00:42:42,597 --> 00:42:44,596
- Come on in. - I'm here to chat.

999
00:42:44,597 --> 00:42:46,077
- I'm glad you're here. - Come on in.

1000
00:42:46,727 --> 00:42:48,636
They all gathered.

1001
00:42:48,637 --> 00:42:50,196
- I'll apply some too. - This is from Tamburins.

1002
00:42:50,197 --> 00:42:51,643
- Where did you go? - Can I sit here?

1003
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:54,107
- I went to Korea University... - It's a really good product.

1004
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:56,377
Where I did my bachelor's degree.

1005
00:42:57,177 --> 00:42:59,047
This is only the beginning.

1006
00:42:59,147 --> 00:43:01,846
- You seem happy. - Indeed.

1007
00:43:01,847 --> 00:43:05,087
That's not the case. I'm shocked, actually.

1008
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:06,447
- Why? - Really?

1009
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,117
So here's what happened.

1010
00:43:08,757 --> 00:43:10,986
- It's interesting. - What happened?

1011
00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:13,686
I thought he was the one who chose me.

1012
00:43:13,687 --> 00:43:17,026
That's why I picked him as my dating partner...

1013
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,597
so that I could talk more to him.

1014
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:20,996
I was sure that it was him who chose me,

1015
00:43:20,997 --> 00:43:22,277
but it turned out it wasn't him.

1016
00:43:22,797 --> 00:43:24,566
It turned out that way.

1017
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:26,136
So I was confused.

1018
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:29,177
I wanted to talk more to him...

1019
00:43:29,377 --> 00:43:31,407
because I thought he was interested in me.

1020
00:43:32,007 --> 00:43:33,447
But it wasn't the case.

1021
00:43:33,547 --> 00:43:34,646
Oh, really?

1022
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:36,276
- So I... Sorry? - Why didn't you know?

1023
00:43:36,277 --> 00:43:38,116
- Why didn't you know? - One of the two men...

1024
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:40,616
shows interest in me so clearly.

1025
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:42,386
Some guys send mixed signals.

1026
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:44,786
There was this guy who sent me mixed signals,

1027
00:43:44,787 --> 00:43:46,757
and I got the wrong idea.

1028
00:43:47,387 --> 00:43:49,056
- You're so cute. - I totally misunderstood him.

1029
00:43:49,057 --> 00:43:50,057
Goodness, you.

1030
00:43:50,058 --> 00:43:52,796
- Yeong Gyeong, you're so cute. - Indeed.

1031
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,127
I'm embarrassed.

1032
00:43:54,527 --> 00:43:56,567
Let's gather around and have a chat among the guys.

1033
00:43:56,597 --> 00:43:57,937
We really should do that.

1034
00:43:59,867 --> 00:44:02,277
Sang Hyeon, you were the biggest variable.

1035
00:44:02,377 --> 00:44:03,857
Exactly. I didn't expect that either.

1036
00:44:04,337 --> 00:44:06,547
I couldn't even imagine...

1037
00:44:06,907 --> 00:44:08,946
that someone like So Hyun would think highly of me.

1038
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:10,376
- No way. - Really?

1039
00:44:10,377 --> 00:44:11,517
This is how I feel.

1040
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:14,287
So Hyun said she liked a man like whole chicken soup...

1041
00:44:14,387 --> 00:44:15,817
when we were talking about it.

1042
00:44:16,517 --> 00:44:19,156
(Whole chicken soup: A man who's stable yet less proactive)

1043
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:23,057
(Buldak: A man who's unstable yet very proactive)

1044
00:44:23,557 --> 00:44:25,917
(So Hyun said she preferred a man like whole chicken soup.)

1045
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:27,497
And in my opinion,

1046
00:44:27,997 --> 00:44:31,367
the person who fits the description the most...

1047
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:33,507
- is you. - Actually, I was thinking,

1048
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:35,777
"Could it be me?" I was thinking that while eating.

1049
00:44:35,877 --> 00:44:37,913
No matter how much I think about it... You know it.

1050
00:44:37,937 --> 00:44:41,406
She said that she wasn't interested in me because of my appearance,

1051
00:44:41,407 --> 00:44:42,976
but she liked me after talking to me.

1052
00:44:42,977 --> 00:44:44,076
That's what I just thought.

1053
00:44:44,077 --> 00:44:47,587
She wouldn't care so much about a man's appearance.

1054
00:44:48,117 --> 00:44:50,916
I mean, she's a model, so she probably sees so many handsome men.

1055
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:52,286
That's right. I totally agree.

1056
00:44:52,287 --> 00:44:53,727
- Right. - I thought a lot about it.

1057
00:44:53,787 --> 00:44:54,827
I feel daunted.

1058
00:44:55,297 --> 00:44:56,817
It's natural for you to feel that way.

1059
00:44:57,257 --> 00:44:59,927
There's no reason for you to feel daunted...

1060
00:45:00,327 --> 00:45:02,797
because she sees male models in a professional context.

1061
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,067
You have a different career.

1062
00:45:07,507 --> 00:45:09,277
(Sighing)

1063
00:45:09,477 --> 00:45:11,006
Why is he so confused?

1064
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:13,346
(After the date with So Hyun, his mind became complicated.)

1065
00:45:13,347 --> 00:45:15,067
I like her because she's different from me.

1066
00:45:15,577 --> 00:45:17,577
But the difference between us...

1067
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:20,516
kind of makes me feel...

1068
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,487
that there's a wall between us.

1069
00:45:25,257 --> 00:45:26,886
I'm not sure if it's okay to say this,

1070
00:45:26,887 --> 00:45:30,857
but I think of her as a celebrity.

1071
00:45:31,797 --> 00:45:33,426
Her life has been different from mine.

1072
00:45:33,427 --> 00:45:37,697
And I'm old-fashioned and stubborn.

1073
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:43,276
(Right then, Ji Yung joins them.)

1074
00:45:43,277 --> 00:45:44,937
That's exactly what I was talking about.

1075
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,046
When we go on a date,

1076
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:50,876
- we don't get enough time... - What a shame.

1077
00:45:50,877 --> 00:45:52,886
I was so sad it was over.

1078
00:45:52,887 --> 00:45:54,593
(Ji Yung was curious about the date between So Hyun and Sang Hyeon.)

1079
00:45:54,617 --> 00:45:56,786
Here's what we were just talking about.

1080
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,726
When I was on a date with So Hyun, I realized...

1081
00:45:58,727 --> 00:46:01,387
that the more I get to know her,

1082
00:46:02,757 --> 00:46:04,957
the thicker the wall between us gets.

1083
00:46:05,527 --> 00:46:07,897
I feel like I'm not good enough for her.

1084
00:46:07,997 --> 00:46:11,096
Of course, I know you wouldn't care about things like that.

1085
00:46:11,097 --> 00:46:14,607
But I care when I can see it.

1086
00:46:15,337 --> 00:46:17,076
Also, the more I talk to her,

1087
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:19,347
the more of small differences I find between us.

1088
00:46:19,547 --> 00:46:23,446
But fortunately, we went to an amusement park.

1089
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:27,717
If we went to a cafe or somewhere we could talk a lot,

1090
00:46:28,247 --> 00:46:30,086
things would rather have gone bad between us.

1091
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:32,186
I think that because realizing those differences...

1092
00:46:32,187 --> 00:46:34,287
would deepen the relationship.

1093
00:46:34,827 --> 00:46:36,496
That's why I really enjoyed the date.

1094
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:38,126
The date at the amusement park made me so happy.

1095
00:46:38,127 --> 00:46:40,627
We could just enjoy ourselves and laugh, showing each other...

1096
00:46:41,797 --> 00:46:43,496
only the positive sides of ourselves.

1097
00:46:43,497 --> 00:46:46,537
But the date ended so early.

1098
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:49,677
I didn't have enough time to try anything.

1099
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:51,947
I was so sad about that.

1100
00:46:52,047 --> 00:46:55,817
I thought I had the chance to break the wall between us.

1101
00:46:56,917 --> 00:47:01,087
(Ji Yung was listening to Sang Hyeon without saying anything.)

1102
00:47:01,587 --> 00:47:02,816
(Smiling)

1103
00:47:02,817 --> 00:47:06,086
- About So Hyun... - Yes, tell us.

1104
00:47:06,087 --> 00:47:09,357
I think I've figure out what kind of person she is.

1105
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,867
So Hyun and I are the same type.

1106
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:15,797
(She cracks up.)

1107
00:47:18,437 --> 00:47:19,437
Oh, no.

1108
00:47:19,667 --> 00:47:22,507
Ji Yung totally got the wrong idea.

1109
00:47:23,377 --> 00:47:25,807
So Hyun and I are the same type.

1110
00:47:26,347 --> 00:47:28,976
She's been living in a similar environment to me.

1111
00:47:28,977 --> 00:47:31,353
Fashion models and athletes live similar lives in some ways.

1112
00:47:31,377 --> 00:47:34,647
We share similar life experiences.

1113
00:47:35,047 --> 00:47:36,887
She and I have so much in common...

1114
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,157
that it gives me goosebumps.

1115
00:47:38,257 --> 00:47:40,857
That's true. But he's wrong about everything else.

1116
00:47:42,557 --> 00:47:46,127
The similarities between you and her make you attracted to her.

1117
00:47:46,227 --> 00:47:47,366
(Nodding)

1118
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:49,197
The similarities made me attracted to her.

1119
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:54,513
It's true that Sang Hyeon is the opposite of her.

1120
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:55,606
Oh, boy.

1121
00:47:55,607 --> 00:47:57,287
He says Sang Hyeon is the opposite of her.

1122
00:47:59,147 --> 00:48:00,246
This is so hilarious.

1123
00:48:00,247 --> 00:48:03,076
(The two men, who are opposites, are both interested in So Hyun.)

1124
00:48:03,077 --> 00:48:04,377
Oh, my goodness.

1125
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:07,297
- This is driving me crazy. - I'm glad Ji Yung joined the show.

1126
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:09,647
- I feel bad for Ji Yung. - I'm glad he did.

1127
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,326
- It was a really good idea. - Oh, gosh.

1128
00:48:12,327 --> 00:48:14,486
This is a chance for him to see his true self.

1129
00:48:14,487 --> 00:48:15,926
(He's hilarious.)

1130
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:17,096
How else could he do so?

1131
00:48:17,097 --> 00:48:20,466
I mean, I find Ji Yung innocent and cute.

1132
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:23,596
He looks like a younger man who's deeply in love.

1133
00:48:23,597 --> 00:48:26,236
- And I like that about him. - That's true. I agree.

1134
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:30,836
But the fact that he completely failed to read So Hyun...

1135
00:48:30,837 --> 00:48:34,107
when he went on a date with her dumbfounded me.

1136
00:48:34,747 --> 00:48:36,227
(So Hyun and Ji Yung's glamping date)

1137
00:48:36,777 --> 00:48:40,386
(Ji Yung was so happy that he felt like it was his birthday.)

1138
00:48:40,387 --> 00:48:41,586
(Calm)

1139
00:48:41,587 --> 00:48:43,457
(It even felt like your birthday?)

1140
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,387
(Do you like a muscular man?)

1141
00:48:46,587 --> 00:48:50,557
(I prefer a man with lean muscles.)

1142
00:48:51,027 --> 00:48:54,297
He felt like a little brother who was similar to me.

1143
00:48:55,537 --> 00:48:56,867
I rather think...

1144
00:48:58,597 --> 00:49:01,066
that Ji Yung is a simple man.

1145
00:49:01,067 --> 00:49:03,536
- He's innocent. - Yes. He's pure-hearted.

1146
00:49:03,537 --> 00:49:05,506
- That's right. - He doesn't calculate.

1147
00:49:05,507 --> 00:49:07,827
He's not complicated. He was like, "I've figured her out."

1148
00:49:08,277 --> 00:49:09,876
"So Hyun and I are the same type."

1149
00:49:09,877 --> 00:49:11,076
(He simply follows his instincts.)

1150
00:49:11,077 --> 00:49:12,917
He's so cute.

1151
00:49:13,147 --> 00:49:15,046
While watching Sang Hyeon, Sang Won, and Ji Yung,

1152
00:49:15,047 --> 00:49:16,787
I felt like I was watching a sitcom.

1153
00:49:17,857 --> 00:49:19,186
The three of them...

1154
00:49:19,187 --> 00:49:20,256
- What's funny is... - They're so funny.

1155
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:21,556
That they're talking without listening to one another.

1156
00:49:21,557 --> 00:49:22,596
It's so funny.

1157
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:24,003
They have no intention of listening to one another.

1158
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:25,696
They're not having a conversation.

1159
00:49:25,697 --> 00:49:27,266
- They're doing a monologue. - They're so cute.

1160
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:28,697
"Here's what I think."

1161
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:30,296
"I thought about it, and..."

1162
00:49:30,297 --> 00:49:32,037
- "We're the same type." - Exactly.

1163
00:49:32,907 --> 00:49:35,376
(The three girls are still talking.)

1164
00:49:35,377 --> 00:49:37,936
I looked around the school after a long time.

1165
00:49:37,937 --> 00:49:40,277
We even looked around the schoolyard too.

1166
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:44,077
Also, right near the dance studio,

1167
00:49:44,277 --> 00:49:45,747
there's a restaurant.

1168
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,617
We ate there.

1169
00:49:49,217 --> 00:49:51,657
Sang Won and I kept saying, "It's so good."

1170
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:53,357
"It's really tasty."

1171
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,697
We kept saying that while eating.

1172
00:49:56,197 --> 00:49:57,227
That's nice.

1173
00:49:58,227 --> 00:49:59,467
- It must've been fun. - Yes.

1174
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,113
- Ji Won, where did you go? - At that hour...

1175
00:50:02,137 --> 00:50:04,367
Seoul Tower. It was so nice.

1176
00:50:08,067 --> 00:50:11,136
Oh, right. Did you guys hang a padlock or not?

1177
00:50:11,137 --> 00:50:12,337
- Oh, my. - She's checking it.

1178
00:50:12,407 --> 00:50:13,947
- We didn't. - Why not?

1179
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:16,777
- We didn't do that. - Doesn't everyone do that?

1180
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:19,847
Seoul Tower is all about the love lock.

1181
00:50:20,187 --> 00:50:21,246
We didn't do it.

1182
00:50:21,247 --> 00:50:22,717
(She's sorry.)

1183
00:50:22,817 --> 00:50:26,256
We wrote on the wall there.

1184
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:28,087
The wall is filled with writings.

1185
00:50:30,257 --> 00:50:31,827
Sang Won and I wrote on it.

1186
00:50:31,997 --> 00:50:33,027
Did you really?

1187
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:35,296
- At the restaurant? - "We will be back."

1188
00:50:35,297 --> 00:50:39,467
(We will be back.)

1189
00:50:41,237 --> 00:50:42,237
That's nice.

1190
00:50:42,238 --> 00:50:43,436
(Envious, uncomfortable)

1191
00:50:43,437 --> 00:50:44,637
That must've been fun.

1192
00:50:45,177 --> 00:50:46,507
We made memories.

1193
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:48,706
Sang Won drove his car.

1194
00:50:48,707 --> 00:50:49,777
- Right. - Right.

1195
00:50:50,317 --> 00:50:52,886
She's getting awkward. She can't control it.

1196
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:55,587
I can see that Ji Won is forcing herself to smile.

1197
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:57,957
It was fun.

1198
00:50:58,657 --> 00:51:00,587
I got to hear Sang Won's story.

1199
00:51:02,297 --> 00:51:04,926
- Bon Hee is conscious of them. - Oh, dear.

1200
00:51:04,927 --> 00:51:07,197
She knows what's going on.

1201
00:51:08,397 --> 00:51:11,436
Did you not talk to Sang Won?

1202
00:51:11,437 --> 00:51:12,807
How he...

1203
00:51:14,367 --> 00:51:15,537
studied?

1204
00:51:15,677 --> 00:51:16,836
How Sang Won studied?

1205
00:51:16,837 --> 00:51:20,647
He seems to have lived a proper, textbook life.

1206
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,746
When I heard him talk,

1207
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,647
I realized he was a very smart person.

1208
00:51:25,317 --> 00:51:27,486
- He's smart. - He told her about his family too.

1209
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:29,917
Right. They had a deep conversation.

1210
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:33,827
I didn't ask him for the details,

1211
00:51:35,087 --> 00:51:36,226
but when I heard his answer to a question,

1212
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:40,827
I could see how he's lived his life.

1213
00:51:42,237 --> 00:51:44,897
(Smiling)

1214
00:51:45,967 --> 00:51:47,336
(Smilnig back)

1215
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,976
It's the vibe we've never seen before.

1216
00:51:49,977 --> 00:51:52,306
(The two older women who went on a date with Sang Won...)

1217
00:51:52,307 --> 00:51:53,707
(have a tense standoff.)

1218
00:51:54,777 --> 00:51:56,297
They should turn off the boiler there.

1219
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,276
- Right. They should. - It's heated up.

1220
00:51:58,277 --> 00:52:00,416
That was scary.

1221
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,416
- Yes. It was tense. - These two are...

1222
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:03,977
(The atmosphere was tense in the room.)

1223
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:07,327
(Meanwhile, Yeong Gyeong asked Hyeon Jun to talk.)

1224
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:09,926
- There's nobody here. - They are going to talk more.

1225
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:13,027
There might be bugs outside.

1226
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:14,967
Then let's talk here.

1227
00:52:15,767 --> 00:52:17,667
There might be bugs, right?

1228
00:52:19,107 --> 00:52:20,807
Oh, dear. Look at those heavy footsteps.

1229
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:24,237
What is it?

1230
00:52:24,377 --> 00:52:26,406
I've just come to talk.

1231
00:52:26,407 --> 00:52:30,347
- Right. - To talk about my honest feelings.

1232
00:52:31,677 --> 00:52:33,016
Did you enjoy the date?

1233
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:34,046
(Laughing)

1234
00:52:34,047 --> 00:52:35,716
I am asking because I'm curious.

1235
00:52:35,717 --> 00:52:37,057
It's just that...

1236
00:52:38,317 --> 00:52:40,026
You look uncomfortable.

1237
00:52:40,027 --> 00:52:41,687
- Me? - Yes.

1238
00:52:42,157 --> 00:52:43,197
I am not.

1239
00:52:43,657 --> 00:52:45,327
- You're not? - I'm not uncomfortable.

1240
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:47,696
I was just sorry...

1241
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,866
that we didn't get to go on a date.

1242
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:52,736
I thought it was a shame.

1243
00:52:52,737 --> 00:52:54,937
- And... - Right.

1244
00:52:55,907 --> 00:52:58,137
I heard you had no idea.

1245
00:52:58,637 --> 00:53:00,846
- Had no idea? - You had no idea...

1246
00:53:00,847 --> 00:53:03,747
that I was expressing my interest by doing things for you.

1247
00:53:05,217 --> 00:53:06,516
I knew, but I didn't know.

1248
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:07,887
It's like this. I was eating it,

1249
00:53:08,817 --> 00:53:12,087
but others were eating it too.

1250
00:53:15,027 --> 00:53:17,657
- Because it wasn't just for you. - Right.

1251
00:53:17,997 --> 00:53:20,027
But if you think about it,

1252
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:24,037
everything I've done was for you.

1253
00:53:24,737 --> 00:53:25,866
- Really? - Yes.

1254
00:53:25,867 --> 00:53:27,806
(Yeong Gyeong pretends she didn't know his feelings.)

1255
00:53:27,807 --> 00:53:29,206
I'm the type of person...

1256
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:32,677
who struggles to express it with words.

1257
00:53:33,407 --> 00:53:35,147
This was my way of expressing.

1258
00:53:35,577 --> 00:53:37,216
They are very similar.

1259
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:39,046
He approached her in a way that is not too aggressive.

1260
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:41,087
They both express their feelings in their own ways.

1261
00:53:43,057 --> 00:53:44,356
That felt good.

1262
00:53:44,357 --> 00:53:47,356
(As soon as their conversation ends, Sang Won comes in.)

1263
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:48,357
(Stopping)

1264
00:53:48,627 --> 00:53:50,096
I feel like I shouldn't be here.

1265
00:53:50,097 --> 00:53:51,896
- No, you can. - No, you can.

1266
00:53:51,897 --> 00:53:53,097
That's what I wanted to hear.

1267
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:54,696
That was it.

1268
00:53:54,697 --> 00:53:56,997
- You wanted us to stop you. - Well, I wouldn't say that.

1269
00:53:58,237 --> 00:53:59,637
It looked fun.

1270
00:54:00,207 --> 00:54:01,536
Why is he sitting there?

1271
00:54:01,537 --> 00:54:03,097
You're here to have fun by watching us.

1272
00:54:03,937 --> 00:54:05,377
How was today?

1273
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:09,416
It was a good day. I got to make up my mind.

1274
00:54:09,417 --> 00:54:11,547
- Again? - I was very unsure before today.

1275
00:54:12,017 --> 00:54:13,847
What's wrong with him?

1276
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:16,586
- He's unbelievable. - Two ladies...

1277
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:19,057
are struggling in the room because of him.

1278
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:21,787
(Looking)

1279
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:24,856
(Does he have some secret he wants to share?)

1280
00:54:24,857 --> 00:54:25,967
He's locking the door.

1281
00:54:26,267 --> 00:54:28,196
(Locking the door)

1282
00:54:28,197 --> 00:54:29,267
Look at him.

1283
00:54:32,097 --> 00:54:33,606
(He's excited, isn't he?)

1284
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:35,136
(Sang Won locks Ji Won's room to tighten the security.)

1285
00:54:35,137 --> 00:54:36,477
That's hilarious.

1286
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,477
Have you heard...

1287
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:41,146
- She has not... - What is it?

1288
00:54:41,147 --> 00:54:43,076
Talked to the ladies.

1289
00:54:43,077 --> 00:54:44,417
She doesn't know anything.

1290
00:54:45,347 --> 00:54:47,017
(What is it?)

1291
00:54:48,687 --> 00:54:50,886
I didn't get any votes at first,

1292
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:54,957
but I suddenly got two, so I'm grateful.

1293
00:54:55,627 --> 00:54:57,497
Today, there was...

1294
00:54:58,627 --> 00:55:00,097
someone I had in mind,

1295
00:55:00,827 --> 00:55:02,627
and there was someone I talked to previously.

1296
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,966
I got to go on a date with them both.

1297
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:06,337
(It was Ye Eun and Ji Won.)

1298
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:08,007
I had been very confused,

1299
00:55:09,377 --> 00:55:11,606
but now I know who I'm more drawn to.

1300
00:55:11,607 --> 00:55:12,876
- Right. - So who is it?

1301
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:13,877
(Right.)

1302
00:55:14,207 --> 00:55:17,176
I was able to become more certain...

1303
00:55:17,177 --> 00:55:19,517
about my choice.

1304
00:55:20,247 --> 00:55:21,546
You still have no idea who I am talking about, do you?

1305
00:55:21,547 --> 00:55:22,987
- You don't, do you? - I don't know.

1306
00:55:23,517 --> 00:55:24,917
- I don't. - I will never tell you.

1307
00:55:25,317 --> 00:55:26,686
- He's excited. - Even if you say more,

1308
00:55:26,687 --> 00:55:28,957
I still won't know anyway.

1309
00:55:29,327 --> 00:55:31,097
I can tell you. Who cares?

1310
00:55:31,627 --> 00:55:32,997
Then tell me.

1311
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:36,337
- He's going to tell her. - I will keep your secret.

1312
00:55:38,567 --> 00:55:39,666
(Ye Eun comes in, and they instantly become quiet.)

1313
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:41,066
That was so close.

1314
00:55:41,067 --> 00:55:43,007
I know. What a timing.

1315
00:55:43,107 --> 00:55:45,037
(Frozen)

1316
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:48,547
(Sighing)

1317
00:55:49,117 --> 00:55:50,947
(Now tell me.)

1318
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:53,987
Their energies are similar, you know.

1319
00:55:54,247 --> 00:55:55,957
They are quite similar.

1320
00:55:57,057 --> 00:55:59,456
- That's why it's hard. - Right.

1321
00:55:59,457 --> 00:56:00,787
(You are puzzled.)

1322
00:56:01,427 --> 00:56:04,727
(Ye Eun comes out of the room again.)

1323
00:56:05,427 --> 00:56:07,867
Even if our conversation gets stuck, it doesn't feel awkward.

1324
00:56:10,897 --> 00:56:12,437
- Ye Eun is coming. - Quiet.

1325
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:16,177
(Opening)

1326
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:17,536
(Stopping)

1327
00:56:17,537 --> 00:56:18,736
This pistachio is good.

1328
00:56:18,737 --> 00:56:19,877
(Stopping)

1329
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:22,547
- He's unbelievable. - This pistachio is good.

1330
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:24,577
Hello.

1331
00:56:25,147 --> 00:56:26,287
Hello.

1332
00:56:28,447 --> 00:56:29,657
What are you doing here?

1333
00:56:29,857 --> 00:56:31,287
- We are just... - Talking?

1334
00:56:32,687 --> 00:56:34,157
Cheering.

1335
00:56:35,227 --> 00:56:37,127
- You can come. - We were cheering for him.

1336
00:56:37,857 --> 00:56:38,897
Thank you.

1337
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:41,026
(Ye Eun goes to Sang Won...)

1338
00:56:41,027 --> 00:56:42,166
Wait.

1339
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:43,336
(and sits next to him.)

1340
00:56:43,337 --> 00:56:44,796
It doesn't look easy.

1341
00:56:44,797 --> 00:56:47,637
(Ye Eun goes to Sang Won and sits next to him.)

1342
00:56:49,307 --> 00:56:51,937
(Awkward)

1343
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:54,907
(They are quiet.)

1344
00:56:55,677 --> 00:56:56,947
This pistachio is good.

1345
00:56:57,777 --> 00:56:58,847
Is it good?

1346
00:56:59,447 --> 00:57:00,586
It's sweet.

1347
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:03,417
(It gets awkward, and they just eat pistachio.)

1348
00:57:04,017 --> 00:57:05,217
I have a question for you.

1349
00:57:06,087 --> 00:57:07,427
Why did you not know about it?

1350
00:57:08,687 --> 00:57:10,857
- You mean everything? - I mean everything.

1351
00:57:12,057 --> 00:57:14,527
I thought you weren't talking to each other.

1352
00:57:14,797 --> 00:57:16,796
But at some point, I realized...

1353
00:57:16,797 --> 00:57:18,697
- I was wrong. - Everything had changed.

1354
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:21,367
I started it.

1355
00:57:21,837 --> 00:57:25,307
I was the first one to ask in front of people.

1356
00:57:25,437 --> 00:57:27,117
- You asked to have a conversation? - Yes.

1357
00:57:27,947 --> 00:57:31,176
I was the first one to go and ask to talk.

1358
00:57:31,177 --> 00:57:32,687
I started that trend.

1359
00:57:32,947 --> 00:57:35,046
Nobody else did it before I did.

1360
00:57:35,047 --> 00:57:38,257
(Nobody else did it before I did.)

1361
00:57:38,557 --> 00:57:42,227
Yesterday, Bon Hee and Mu Jin were talking outside.

1362
00:57:42,727 --> 00:57:44,396
And it was really fun for me.

1363
00:57:44,397 --> 00:57:46,426
- Because it was my 1st time. - It was your 1st time.

1364
00:57:46,427 --> 00:57:49,437
Hyeon Jun doesn't enjoy being in a big group.

1365
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:51,496
- Right. - It's hard to talk to everyone.

1366
00:57:51,497 --> 00:57:52,506
Right.

1367
00:57:52,507 --> 00:57:54,366
It's fun when it's a small group of 3 or 4.

1368
00:57:54,367 --> 00:57:55,667
How about you, Sang Won?

1369
00:57:56,207 --> 00:57:57,807
- It's fun... - How about you, Sang Won?

1370
00:58:01,347 --> 00:58:03,023
Do you like it when you're in a big group?

1371
00:58:03,047 --> 00:58:04,216
A big group is good,

1372
00:58:04,217 --> 00:58:06,057
and a smaller group is good too. But I just...

1373
00:58:07,187 --> 00:58:08,746
- I just... - Oh, dear.

1374
00:58:08,747 --> 00:58:10,887
- "I just..." - He's stuck.

1375
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:13,457
Do you not like talking to someone in private?

1376
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,277
That's not what I meant. It's just that...

1377
00:58:17,897 --> 00:58:19,567
You might have a different preference.

1378
00:58:20,567 --> 00:58:24,436
Right. It depends on the circumstances and timing.

1379
00:58:24,437 --> 00:58:25,437
Right.

1380
00:58:25,438 --> 00:58:29,207
You're the type who gets conscious about what's going on.

1381
00:58:29,737 --> 00:58:30,906
I just...

1382
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:32,646
(Ye Eun wants him to approach her, )

1383
00:58:32,647 --> 00:58:33,676
I...

1384
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,977
(and Sang Won hesitates.)

1385
00:58:39,177 --> 00:58:40,847
I am very frustrated.

1386
00:58:41,847 --> 00:58:43,257
But nothing is going to change...

1387
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:46,757
by pressuring him.

1388
00:58:49,027 --> 00:58:50,056
I'm frustrated.

1389
00:58:50,057 --> 00:58:51,577
(All she can do is wait for Sang Won.)

1390
00:58:51,697 --> 00:58:52,996
I am very frustrated.

1391
00:58:52,997 --> 00:58:57,737
(Feeling frustrated, Ye Eun leaves.)

1392
00:58:59,467 --> 00:59:02,067
I think Sang Won hates being in a serious situation.

1393
00:59:02,607 --> 00:59:05,237
There are men who hates it by nature.

1394
00:59:05,607 --> 00:59:08,106
There are people who feel very awkward...

1395
00:59:08,107 --> 00:59:10,047
and embarrassed in a serious situation.

1396
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:11,717
They are drifting apart.

1397
00:59:14,647 --> 00:59:16,687
Continue where you left off.

1398
00:59:17,357 --> 00:59:19,427
I was flustered actually.

1399
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:20,557
Right.

1400
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:22,656
(Curious)

1401
00:59:22,657 --> 00:59:25,997
I was chosen by Ye Eun and Ji Won.

1402
00:59:26,927 --> 00:59:28,067
Ye Eun...

1403
00:59:29,997 --> 00:59:32,397
spoke with more clarity.

1404
00:59:32,807 --> 00:59:35,237
So I need to speak with the same level of clarity.

1405
00:59:35,667 --> 00:59:38,377
She was pestering me to talk just now.

1406
00:59:39,037 --> 00:59:41,577
She was asking if I didn't want to talk to her in private.

1407
00:59:41,607 --> 00:59:43,616
It's because I am not approaching her aggressively.

1408
00:59:43,617 --> 00:59:45,047
Right.

1409
00:59:46,147 --> 00:59:47,147
It's like,

1410
00:59:48,347 --> 00:59:50,516
"Everyone else is doing it. Why aren't you doing it?"

1411
00:59:50,517 --> 00:59:51,956
But I can't do that easily.

1412
00:59:51,957 --> 00:59:54,557
- He feels pressured. - Some time has passed,

1413
00:59:55,657 --> 00:59:57,897
and I think Ji Won and I are a good match.

1414
00:59:58,157 --> 01:00:01,696
I have a hard time sharing my feelings to Ye Eun honestly.

1415
01:00:01,697 --> 01:00:03,296
- Right. - I'm careful.

1416
01:00:03,297 --> 01:00:05,466
Ye Eun expressed her feelings to me,

1417
01:00:05,467 --> 01:00:09,337
so it's funny for me to push her away.

1418
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:12,177
The expression "push her away" is funny too.

1419
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:14,177
That's why...

1420
01:00:14,707 --> 01:00:15,707
It's hard to be honest.

1421
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:17,753
(Sang Won is struggling to talk to her with honesty.)

1422
01:00:17,777 --> 01:00:21,717
(Between Ye Eun and Ji Won, Sang Won feels frustrated.)

1423
01:00:22,017 --> 01:00:26,157
(In the 1st floor living room, they are eating night snacks.)

1424
01:00:26,187 --> 01:00:27,756
- Did you enjoy it? - We are eating dumplings.

1425
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:29,086
We finished this already.

1426
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:30,397
- Did you really? - Yes.

1427
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,097
Was it good?

1428
01:00:32,457 --> 01:00:33,867
The dumplings are good.

1429
01:00:35,267 --> 01:00:39,197
So Hyeon Jun decided to settle on the first floor.

1430
01:00:39,707 --> 01:00:41,737
Why did you cook that?

1431
01:00:42,707 --> 01:00:45,006
- That looks so good. - Ji Yung is so simple-minded.

1432
01:00:45,007 --> 01:00:46,307
Where's Yeong Gyeong?

1433
01:00:46,547 --> 01:00:48,876
She's upstairs, talking to Sang Won.

1434
01:00:48,877 --> 01:00:49,977
Is he?

1435
01:00:52,717 --> 01:00:54,817
It's very quiet today.

1436
01:00:55,747 --> 01:00:58,387
I think today, people are choosing to talk...

1437
01:00:59,257 --> 01:01:00,956
in private, rather than talking in a big group.

1438
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:02,796
- Is that it? - Is today a cheat day?

1439
01:01:02,797 --> 01:01:04,727
(This looks so good.)

1440
01:01:05,927 --> 01:01:08,726
The ballerina is binge-eating!

1441
01:01:08,727 --> 01:01:10,567
- What's going on? - It's the stress.

1442
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:11,936
- It is the stress.. - She's stressed.

1443
01:01:11,937 --> 01:01:12,937
(Stress makes Ye Eun...)

1444
01:01:12,938 --> 01:01:16,807
(and Ji Yung binge eat.)

1445
01:01:17,677 --> 01:01:22,147
(After relieving stress, Ji Yung leaves.)

1446
01:01:22,777 --> 01:01:24,476
(Ye Eun and Ji Won...)

1447
01:01:24,477 --> 01:01:26,846
(are left.)

1448
01:01:26,847 --> 01:01:28,947
Is it Ji Won and Ye Eun?

1449
01:01:29,557 --> 01:01:31,017
It's them again.

1450
01:01:31,817 --> 01:01:32,956
Oh, dear.

1451
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:34,087
(Hesitating)

1452
01:01:34,187 --> 01:01:35,357
- Oh, no. - Oh, dear.

1453
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:38,797
What is it?

1454
01:01:38,812 --> 01:01:41,481
(Ye Eun and Ji Won are left.)

1455
01:01:41,482 --> 01:01:43,622
Is it Ji Won and Ye Eun?

1456
01:01:44,222 --> 01:01:45,622
It's them again.

1457
01:01:46,552 --> 01:01:47,651
Oh, dear.

1458
01:01:47,652 --> 01:01:48,861
(Hesitating)

1459
01:01:48,862 --> 01:01:50,122
- Oh, no. - Oh, dear.

1460
01:01:51,962 --> 01:01:53,392
What is it?

1461
01:01:54,932 --> 01:01:56,802
How was today's date?

1462
01:01:58,562 --> 01:01:59,731
(They talk about each other's date.)

1463
01:01:59,732 --> 01:02:01,072
Are they talking about it again?

1464
01:02:07,572 --> 01:02:08,742
My gosh.

1465
01:02:13,882 --> 01:02:15,082
It was fun.

1466
01:02:15,782 --> 01:02:16,952
How was your date?

1467
01:02:19,122 --> 01:02:20,922
- I had fun too. - How was Sang Won?

1468
01:02:24,062 --> 01:02:25,191
What do you think of Sang Won?

1469
01:02:25,192 --> 01:02:26,472
(What do you think of Sang Won?)

1470
01:02:26,632 --> 01:02:30,232
I think he tries to lead the conversation.

1471
01:02:36,072 --> 01:02:37,202
What is it?

1472
01:02:42,112 --> 01:02:43,912
(Hesitating)

1473
01:02:44,182 --> 01:02:47,081
- I want to... - You want to get to know him more?

1474
01:02:47,082 --> 01:02:48,722
I want to get to know him better.

1475
01:02:52,492 --> 01:02:56,162
You don't care for Ji Yung, right?

1476
01:02:56,422 --> 01:02:57,862
(Nodding)

1477
01:02:59,562 --> 01:03:00,932
So it's Sang Won.

1478
01:03:03,902 --> 01:03:05,932
(Nodding)

1479
01:03:07,202 --> 01:03:12,371
(Ye Eun confirms that Ji Won has feelings for Sang Won.)

1480
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:13,671
- Goodness. - It's suffocating.

1481
01:03:13,672 --> 01:03:14,772
This is crazy.

1482
01:03:16,812 --> 01:03:18,411
Ji Won already asked...

1483
01:03:18,412 --> 01:03:20,752
how their date went and heard everything.

1484
01:03:21,012 --> 01:03:22,652
Now that they are alone,

1485
01:03:22,852 --> 01:03:25,422
she asked Ye Eun the question all over again.

1486
01:03:25,892 --> 01:03:28,321
When there was Bon Hee, and the three of them talked,

1487
01:03:28,322 --> 01:03:31,722
she heard that they talked about the things she didn't know about.

1488
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:35,501
"What if their date went better than our date?"

1489
01:03:35,502 --> 01:03:36,731
She must be worried about that.

1490
01:03:36,732 --> 01:03:40,201
She must've also wanted...

1491
01:03:40,202 --> 01:03:41,372
to compare their dates.

1492
01:03:41,602 --> 01:03:44,872
Ji Won used to say she had feelings for Ji Yung.

1493
01:03:44,972 --> 01:03:46,911
Ye Eun could feel confused.

1494
01:03:46,912 --> 01:03:49,182
Ye Won consistently said she had feelings for Sang Won.

1495
01:03:49,612 --> 01:03:52,112
But Ji Won voted for him too.

1496
01:03:52,452 --> 01:03:53,852
That's why there's that tension.

1497
01:03:54,112 --> 01:03:55,998
I think the girls need to talk to each other and resolve it.

1498
01:03:56,022 --> 01:03:57,721
- It got all tangled up. - It's all tangled up.

1499
01:03:57,722 --> 01:03:59,821
The girls need to talk.

1500
01:03:59,822 --> 01:04:02,761
Honestly, if I was...

1501
01:04:02,762 --> 01:04:04,521
one of the older women,

1502
01:04:04,522 --> 01:04:06,732
and I was in that situation like two of them...

1503
01:04:07,262 --> 01:04:10,201
"I used to be interested in Ji Yung,"

1504
01:04:10,202 --> 01:04:12,702
"but I am now interested in Sang Won." I wouldn't say it.

1505
01:04:13,532 --> 01:04:14,802
Why would I?

1506
01:04:15,032 --> 01:04:18,042
You're here to find love,

1507
01:04:18,242 --> 01:04:20,071
not to make friends.

1508
01:04:20,072 --> 01:04:21,911
That's your first motive.

1509
01:04:21,912 --> 01:04:24,241
Of course, it's fine if you don't say that.

1510
01:04:24,242 --> 01:04:26,852
But after talking so much about myself,

1511
01:04:26,982 --> 01:04:28,351
it would be nice if you talked about yourself...

1512
01:04:28,352 --> 01:04:29,682
- a little too. - No, thanks.

1513
01:04:29,752 --> 01:04:30,951
That's what you do.

1514
01:04:30,952 --> 01:04:31,952
(Hurt)

1515
01:04:31,953 --> 01:04:33,152
That's what you do.

1516
01:04:33,552 --> 01:04:35,421
We are not a good match.

1517
01:04:35,422 --> 01:04:37,692
(Sick of it)

1518
01:04:38,217 --> 01:04:41,047
(After the tense night, morning comes.)

1519
01:04:48,227 --> 01:04:51,497
(Waiting for coffee, Sang Hyeon cleans the kitchen.)

1520
01:04:54,927 --> 01:04:59,506
(So Hyun comes to the kitchen just in time.)

1521
01:04:59,507 --> 01:05:00,837
- Good morning. - Hi.

1522
01:05:01,637 --> 01:05:04,177
(Smiling)

1523
01:05:04,537 --> 01:05:05,577
What are you doing?

1524
01:05:06,107 --> 01:05:09,477
I came down for some coffee, so I made coffee.

1525
01:05:10,317 --> 01:05:11,877
You drink coffee.

1526
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:14,717
Do you drink it every morning?

1527
01:05:14,817 --> 01:05:17,117
I struggled a lot yesterday,

1528
01:05:18,217 --> 01:05:20,487
so I thought I should drink a lot of coffee today.

1529
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,457
My face got swollen too.

1530
01:05:24,857 --> 01:05:26,527
Is it swollen? Why is it swollen?

1531
01:05:26,697 --> 01:05:28,327
- Did you cry? - No, I didn't.

1532
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:37,407
(The two start the morning with giggles.)

1533
01:05:37,937 --> 01:05:40,547
(Bon Hee and So Hyun's room)

1534
01:05:41,077 --> 01:05:43,877
I am very curious about what we will do today.

1535
01:05:47,587 --> 01:05:50,016
I went to heat up something in the morning.

1536
01:05:50,017 --> 01:05:52,786
Sang Hyeon was doing something,

1537
01:05:52,787 --> 01:05:54,427
and he didn't look good.

1538
01:05:54,587 --> 01:05:55,856
Did he look bad?

1539
01:05:55,857 --> 01:05:57,597
He said his face is swollen.

1540
01:05:58,967 --> 01:06:01,127
He must be younger than me. Why is he so weak?

1541
01:06:01,567 --> 01:06:02,767
Right.

1542
01:06:03,497 --> 01:06:05,266
It's just that So Hyun is in good shape.

1543
01:06:05,267 --> 01:06:07,207
(So Hyun is bothered by Sang Hyeon.)

1544
01:06:09,077 --> 01:06:10,907
(Yawning)

1545
01:06:12,407 --> 01:06:14,346
It's tiring to go on two dates in a day.

1546
01:06:14,347 --> 01:06:16,117
(Sang Hyeon looks unusually tired.)

1547
01:06:16,877 --> 01:06:19,417
She's getting a vitamin drink for him.

1548
01:06:19,717 --> 01:06:21,816
- Goodness. - She's worried about him.

1549
01:06:21,817 --> 01:06:24,486
That's the charm of an older woman.

1550
01:06:24,487 --> 01:06:26,047
(So Hyun gets a bagful of supplements.)

1551
01:06:26,557 --> 01:06:27,987
You are pretty.

1552
01:06:30,197 --> 01:06:33,267
(So Hyun goes around looking for Sang Hyeon.)

1553
01:06:33,297 --> 01:06:35,066
(She desperately looks for Sang Hyeon.)

1554
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:36,767
(Peeking)

1555
01:06:38,967 --> 01:06:40,567
(She finds Sang Hyeon.)

1556
01:06:42,037 --> 01:06:43,137
Where is she going?

1557
01:06:44,377 --> 01:06:47,347
(She sees Sang Hyeon and goes downstairs.)

1558
01:06:49,317 --> 01:06:51,877
(Awkward)

1559
01:06:54,517 --> 01:06:56,817
I went to give him a vitamin.

1560
01:06:57,057 --> 01:06:59,427
But all the guys were there, so I just came back.

1561
01:06:59,927 --> 01:07:02,056
A vitamin? What vitamin?

1562
01:07:02,057 --> 01:07:04,957
I saw Sang Hyeon in the morning, and he looked really tired.

1563
01:07:05,767 --> 01:07:08,566
I went upstairs, and everyone was there.

1564
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:11,096
They were all there, so I saw him and came back down.

1565
01:07:11,097 --> 01:07:13,406
It's embarrassing to give him something when everyone is there.

1566
01:07:13,407 --> 01:07:14,936
- Right. - Of course.

1567
01:07:14,937 --> 01:07:16,706
- Did you just come down? - I just came down.

1568
01:07:16,707 --> 01:07:18,476
- You didn't give it to him? - I will give it to him later.

1569
01:07:18,477 --> 01:07:19,977
It's nice that you're caring for him.

1570
01:07:20,347 --> 01:07:23,217
She should give it to him when they are alone.

1571
01:07:23,417 --> 01:07:24,446
(He agrees.)

1572
01:07:24,447 --> 01:07:26,816
Someone else might be interested in me, you know.

1573
01:07:26,817 --> 01:07:29,317
- You don't need to show it. - Right.

1574
01:07:30,257 --> 01:07:32,786
- I love how proactive she is. - I know.

1575
01:07:32,787 --> 01:07:34,487
- Right. - It's amazing, isn't it?

1576
01:07:34,587 --> 01:07:37,026
Nobody else has done it.

1577
01:07:37,027 --> 01:07:39,466
- Only she does it. - Right. But she doesn't overdo it.

1578
01:07:39,467 --> 01:07:41,796
- Yes. - That's a huge plus.

1579
01:07:41,797 --> 01:07:42,937
She's so cheerful.

1580
01:07:44,297 --> 01:07:46,667
- Yesterday, - Yes?

1581
01:07:47,307 --> 01:07:49,207
Did you talk to Hyeon Jun well?

1582
01:07:49,577 --> 01:07:52,407
Right. Well.

1583
01:07:53,307 --> 01:07:55,107
I felt sorry.

1584
01:07:55,677 --> 01:07:56,716
Why?

1585
01:07:56,717 --> 01:07:59,017
He was like a small pigeon...

1586
01:08:00,317 --> 01:08:02,487
- that got his heart broken. - A pigeon?

1587
01:08:02,587 --> 01:08:05,016
- Pigeon? - I don't know how to describe him.

1588
01:08:05,017 --> 01:08:07,457
- He was like this. - He looked weak.

1589
01:08:08,687 --> 01:08:10,527
I asked him to talk.

1590
01:08:11,697 --> 01:08:13,567
And he was all depressed?

1591
01:08:14,127 --> 01:08:17,996
It was very clear...

1592
01:08:17,997 --> 01:08:19,767
that his feelings were hurt.

1593
01:08:20,067 --> 01:08:22,506
Did you talk to him well?

1594
01:08:25,577 --> 01:08:30,746
After hearing what he had to say, I was going to talk.

1595
01:08:30,747 --> 01:08:32,046
But Sang Won came.

1596
01:08:33,417 --> 01:08:35,317
We had fun talking together,

1597
01:08:35,587 --> 01:08:37,716
but Hyeon Jun might still...

1598
01:08:37,716 --> 01:08:39,957
feel uncertain.

1599
01:08:40,426 --> 01:08:42,796
I didn't get to tell him my side of the story.

1600
01:08:44,796 --> 01:08:49,095
How was it with Sang Won? After talking to him?

1601
01:08:49,096 --> 01:08:50,296
Well,

1602
01:08:51,497 --> 01:08:53,167
to be honest...

1603
01:08:53,636 --> 01:08:57,136
He's fun to me.

1604
01:08:58,136 --> 01:09:00,607
He's really fun. We are a great match.

1605
01:09:01,147 --> 01:09:03,676
- Honestly, in here... - She likes being with Sang Won.

1606
01:09:05,817 --> 01:09:08,517
In here, he's the only one I am interested in.

1607
01:09:09,987 --> 01:09:13,055
- She's leaning towards him. - He's the only one...

1608
01:09:13,057 --> 01:09:14,187
I'm interested in.

1609
01:09:14,926 --> 01:09:15,957
I love how clear she is.

1610
01:09:16,296 --> 01:09:21,026
I actually expressed how I feel about Sang Won...

1611
01:09:21,027 --> 01:09:23,367
in the most blatant way possible.

1612
01:09:27,407 --> 01:09:29,837
If I put it honestly,

1613
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:34,776
I've done as much as I could,

1614
01:09:34,777 --> 01:09:36,747
but compared to that, he literally...

1615
01:09:36,947 --> 01:09:38,577
doesn't even budge an inch.

1616
01:09:39,386 --> 01:09:40,747
He doesn't even move.

1617
01:09:41,987 --> 01:09:44,057
I haven't said a lot,

1618
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:46,555
but he seems to be a lot more cautious than I thought,

1619
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,636
and he seems to think about things a lot to himself.

1620
01:09:49,426 --> 01:09:53,997
But from my perspective, how I feel on the inside is...

1621
01:09:54,627 --> 01:09:56,996
that I'm frustrated and disappointed...

1622
01:09:56,997 --> 01:09:59,506
that he doesn't make any moves.

1623
01:09:59,507 --> 01:10:00,867
Right, she could feel that way.

1624
01:10:01,137 --> 01:10:05,137
So, I prefer it when someone is clever and clear.

1625
01:10:05,637 --> 01:10:08,047
- And proactive. - Of course, that's a must.

1626
01:10:08,147 --> 01:10:09,417
I think...

1627
01:10:09,517 --> 01:10:13,016
yesterday's approach was a little too strong, in my opinion.

1628
01:10:13,017 --> 01:10:14,886
- Like saying, "Why won't you talk?" - I know...

1629
01:10:14,887 --> 01:10:15,887
I speak quite directly.

1630
01:10:15,888 --> 01:10:17,187
That's what you said.

1631
01:10:18,857 --> 01:10:21,526
Maybe, if you were to approach him in a way...

1632
01:10:21,527 --> 01:10:22,527
that made him feel more comfortable...

1633
01:10:22,528 --> 01:10:25,556
I think it would be better if you could seep in.

1634
01:10:25,557 --> 01:10:26,666
I thought that to myself.

1635
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:28,027
How should I do that?

1636
01:10:28,097 --> 01:10:30,737
So, if you really want to talk to him,

1637
01:10:30,837 --> 01:10:33,306
rather than asking him, "Why won't you talk to me?"

1638
01:10:33,307 --> 01:10:37,407
You could kind of go like, "Shall we talk for a bit later?"

1639
01:10:37,507 --> 01:10:39,606
"Or not, if you don't want to. Shall we talk for a bit?"

1640
01:10:39,607 --> 01:10:41,167
Something like that. It's a bit more...

1641
01:10:42,177 --> 01:10:44,276
- Gosh, how nice of Yeong Gyeong. - I know.

1642
01:10:44,277 --> 01:10:45,946
- This kind of advice is great. - Right.

1643
01:10:45,947 --> 01:10:46,947
Totally.

1644
01:10:48,147 --> 01:10:50,287
Just expressing yourself in a softer way.

1645
01:10:50,387 --> 01:10:51,387
- "Shall we?" - The way I speak?

1646
01:10:51,388 --> 01:10:53,527
Yes. "Want to do something?" "Shall we?"

1647
01:10:53,627 --> 01:10:55,726
I thought it might be good to do that.

1648
01:10:55,727 --> 01:10:57,456
So, just soften it up a little.

1649
01:10:57,457 --> 01:11:00,797
Honestly, from my perspective, I've expressed myself so much.

1650
01:11:01,127 --> 01:11:02,887
- I've already done so much. - That's right.

1651
01:11:03,067 --> 01:11:06,067
And in this situation, Ji Won appeared.

1652
01:11:07,207 --> 01:11:08,367
So, from my point of view,

1653
01:11:09,237 --> 01:11:11,577
I don't feel all that great, if I'm to be honest.

1654
01:11:11,977 --> 01:11:13,006
It would bother her.

1655
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:14,007
- Right. - Of course it would.

1656
01:11:14,008 --> 01:11:16,947
But yesterday, he went on a date with Ji Won.

1657
01:11:17,677 --> 01:11:19,287
So, I didn't feel so good.

1658
01:11:19,947 --> 01:11:22,046
- Then... - Knock-knock.

1659
01:11:22,047 --> 01:11:23,757
(Frozen)

1660
01:11:24,357 --> 01:11:26,426
Gosh, why do I get so many spam messages?

1661
01:11:26,427 --> 01:11:28,127
Gosh, I was so startled.

1662
01:11:28,227 --> 01:11:29,227
What's this?

1663
01:11:29,957 --> 01:11:32,356
Gosh, I was so startled just now.

1664
01:11:32,357 --> 01:11:33,366
Me too.

1665
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:34,967
(Ji Won appeared at an unexpected time.)

1666
01:11:35,427 --> 01:11:37,967
(Frozen)

1667
01:11:38,737 --> 01:11:41,106
(Right then, Ji Won came over to Yeong Gyeong and Ye Eun's room.)

1668
01:11:41,107 --> 01:11:42,367
- Spam? - Yes.

1669
01:11:43,837 --> 01:11:46,406
- Maybe... - I get so many spam calls.

1670
01:11:46,407 --> 01:11:48,606
You have a number that someone else used to use.

1671
01:11:48,607 --> 01:11:49,616
- Something like that. - Is that what it is?

1672
01:11:49,617 --> 01:11:51,316
Isn't there a spam thing?

1673
01:11:51,317 --> 01:11:53,146
(The conversation stopped with Ji Won's appearance.)

1674
01:11:53,147 --> 01:11:55,646
- Spam... - Oh, no. How uncomfortable.

1675
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,957
(The conversation stopped with Ji Won's appearance.)

1676
01:11:58,657 --> 01:12:00,627
My hair is a huge mess right now.

1677
01:12:05,597 --> 01:12:07,166
(Tutting)

1678
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,167
(Sighing)

1679
01:12:08,168 --> 01:12:09,397
Oh, no. She's just sighing.

1680
01:12:09,667 --> 01:12:11,097
Let's do that.

1681
01:12:15,107 --> 01:12:17,577
Oh, yes. Ji Won appeared.

1682
01:12:17,907 --> 01:12:20,376
But here,

1683
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:24,277
about wanting to get to know someone...

1684
01:12:25,117 --> 01:12:27,116
It's not like I can ask, "Why do you want to..."

1685
01:12:27,117 --> 01:12:29,086
- "get to know him all of a sudden?" - Right.

1686
01:12:29,087 --> 01:12:30,656
- That's true. - That's right.

1687
01:12:30,657 --> 01:12:35,087
Things were fine until Ji Won showed up.

1688
01:12:36,457 --> 01:12:40,627
Anyway, we do like the same person.

1689
01:12:42,797 --> 01:12:45,237
I can relate to her worries, but at the same time,

1690
01:12:46,807 --> 01:12:48,567
she's a friendly rival too.

1691
01:12:51,637 --> 01:12:54,546
Yes. I guess that's it.

1692
01:12:54,547 --> 01:12:56,476
(Ji Won's feelings have become clear amid the competition.)

1693
01:12:56,477 --> 01:12:57,477
Yes.

1694
01:12:58,577 --> 01:13:02,816
(Ye Eun and Ji Won have started their competition in earnest.)

1695
01:13:02,817 --> 01:13:04,316
- My gosh. - What are we going to do?

1696
01:13:04,317 --> 01:13:07,427
It was so scary at the end. I was so startled.

1697
01:13:07,827 --> 01:13:08,827
Knock-knock.

1698
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:11,256
Gosh, that's fierce.

1699
01:13:11,257 --> 01:13:14,766
Yes. I mean, all of a sudden,

1700
01:13:14,767 --> 01:13:17,836
a near-destructive love triangle has been formed.

1701
01:13:17,837 --> 01:13:19,436
(A destructive love triangle)

1702
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:22,066
"Things were going well with Sang Won."

1703
01:13:22,067 --> 01:13:23,376
The way she said that...

1704
01:13:23,377 --> 01:13:25,007
- Do you mean Ye Eun? - Yes.

1705
01:13:25,107 --> 01:13:26,853
- That was her nuance. - She didn't have any competitors.

1706
01:13:26,877 --> 01:13:29,006
Right. She didn't have any competitors,

1707
01:13:29,007 --> 01:13:32,317
but Sang Won wasn't into her that much, to be honest.

1708
01:13:32,417 --> 01:13:36,457
But unexpectedly, Ye Eun can be innocent.

1709
01:13:36,557 --> 01:13:38,157
I think that wasabi...

1710
01:13:38,617 --> 01:13:42,327
somehow made her think, "He's still interested in me."

1711
01:13:43,027 --> 01:13:44,356
- Don't you think so? The wasabi... - The fact that...

1712
01:13:44,357 --> 01:13:45,726
- Right. - he brought wasabi was that big?

1713
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,626
- The wasabi. Yes. - No way. Because of that one thing?

1714
01:13:47,627 --> 01:13:49,126
Well, she was really happy at the time.

1715
01:13:49,127 --> 01:13:50,196
(Is that right?)

1716
01:13:50,197 --> 01:13:53,807
Sang Won is... We're rooting for him. We did.

1717
01:13:53,907 --> 01:13:55,167
- Right. - Of course.

1718
01:13:55,737 --> 01:13:58,907
But on Noona is a Woman to Me, I didn't think...

1719
01:13:59,947 --> 01:14:01,747
he would become such a central figure.

1720
01:14:02,307 --> 01:14:03,993
I never thought he'd be in the spotlight so much.

1721
01:14:04,017 --> 01:14:06,363
- He has become the main character. - Right now, the women are...

1722
01:14:06,387 --> 01:14:07,723
- Because of Director Park, - Yes.

1723
01:14:07,747 --> 01:14:08,946
I didn't think...

1724
01:14:08,947 --> 01:14:11,286
- That's right. - that the women would have...

1725
01:14:11,287 --> 01:14:12,856
- such a hard time. Sorry. - This is so funny.

1726
01:14:12,857 --> 01:14:14,257
I'm sorry, Director. I didn't know.

1727
01:14:15,287 --> 01:14:16,657
Oh, I got something.

1728
01:14:17,997 --> 01:14:19,726
- Of course... - We got something.

1729
01:14:19,727 --> 01:14:22,226
(On a tense morning, they get a text alarm.)

1730
01:14:22,227 --> 01:14:24,766
- "Today, you will have..." - "Over or Below Zero?"

1731
01:14:24,767 --> 01:14:25,797
What's this?

1732
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:28,306
- "Over or Below Zero?" - "Over or Below Zero?"

1733
01:14:28,307 --> 01:14:29,753
(Today, you will have Over or Below Zero Dates. Enter the Secret Room.)

1734
01:14:29,777 --> 01:14:33,046
Oh, we'll have an Over or Below Zero Date.

1735
01:14:33,047 --> 01:14:35,206
- Over or Below Zero? - No one is able to guess.

1736
01:14:35,207 --> 01:14:38,116
(In the Secret Room, )

1737
01:14:38,117 --> 01:14:41,117
(a mysterious box has appeared.)

1738
01:14:42,087 --> 01:14:43,856
(Pick only one piece of paper.)

1739
01:14:43,857 --> 01:14:45,737
(Over Zero: Water sports, Below Zero: Ice rink)

1740
01:14:45,957 --> 01:14:50,897
(A random group date based on the result of a draw)

1741
01:14:51,427 --> 01:14:53,797
I wanted to go on a date with Bon Hee.

1742
01:14:54,127 --> 01:14:57,297
I wanted to go with Sang Hyeon.

1743
01:14:57,537 --> 01:15:00,266
The people I go with matter a lot.

1744
01:15:00,267 --> 01:15:02,007
I think I was nervous the whole time.

1745
01:15:02,337 --> 01:15:06,147
Obviously, I want to go with Sang Won.

1746
01:15:06,247 --> 01:15:08,906
I didn't mind either location.

1747
01:15:08,907 --> 01:15:12,047
I just wanted to be in the same place as Sang Won.

1748
01:15:12,747 --> 01:15:15,186
Oh, there are slips of paper with Over or Below Zero on them.

1749
01:15:15,187 --> 01:15:17,756
- Then, that's just random. - It is.

1750
01:15:17,757 --> 01:15:19,156
They must be split into two groups.

1751
01:15:19,157 --> 01:15:25,426
(Who will go with whom on the 5-on-5 group dates?)

1752
01:15:25,427 --> 01:15:26,926
It's their first time going on group dates.

1753
01:15:26,927 --> 01:15:27,927
This sounds like so much fun.

1754
01:15:27,928 --> 01:15:31,297
I'm sure there must be awkward and uncomfortable relationships too.

1755
01:15:31,397 --> 01:15:34,267
If they end up going together, I'm curious what might happen.

1756
01:15:34,367 --> 01:15:37,277
The older women and younger men are actually kind of...

1757
01:15:38,207 --> 01:15:39,547
in a huge mess.

1758
01:15:39,947 --> 01:15:42,717
So, no matter how they get split up,

1759
01:15:43,117 --> 01:15:45,947
one of the teams will definitely be a huge mess.

1760
01:15:46,187 --> 01:15:48,187
So I'm looking forward to it.

1761
01:15:49,187 --> 01:15:50,886
One team will be very entertaining.

1762
01:15:50,887 --> 01:15:52,217
(Looking forward to it a lot)

1763
01:15:52,687 --> 01:15:53,927
I should take this.

1764
01:15:55,527 --> 01:15:58,627
Thick socks.

1765
01:15:58,897 --> 01:16:00,196
Thick ones... Thicker than these?

1766
01:16:00,197 --> 01:16:03,266
- Because skates are very stiff. - Skates?

1767
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:04,536
They must be in Below Zero.

1768
01:16:04,537 --> 01:16:06,166
(So Hyun and Bon Hee both chose Below Zero.)

1769
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:07,837
Is anyone going to do water sports?

1770
01:16:08,267 --> 01:16:09,406
Water sports.

1771
01:16:09,407 --> 01:16:10,876
- Is anyone doing water sports? - She's like, "This way."

1772
01:16:10,877 --> 01:16:12,947
- No one? Water sports? - Who's doing water sports?

1773
01:16:14,177 --> 01:16:16,076
I'm going to the ice rink.

1774
01:16:16,077 --> 01:16:18,047
Are you ice too? Water?

1775
01:16:18,477 --> 01:16:19,486
(Nodding)

1776
01:16:19,487 --> 01:16:21,347
So, 2 for ice, 3 for water.

1777
01:16:23,587 --> 01:16:26,327
Does anyone have sunscreen? I didn't bring any.

1778
01:16:26,427 --> 01:16:28,157
Sunscreen? I have brightening cream.

1779
01:16:29,227 --> 01:16:31,456
- What happened? - The same team!

1780
01:16:31,457 --> 01:16:33,426
- Really? - Ye Eun and Ji Won! The same team!

1781
01:16:33,427 --> 01:16:35,167
- Oh, no! - Look at Ji Won's face!

1782
01:16:35,267 --> 01:16:36,467
Oh, no!

1783
01:16:37,137 --> 01:16:39,567
- The ice rink. - Are you ice too? Water?

1784
01:16:40,237 --> 01:16:41,237
I just got goosebumps.

1785
01:16:41,238 --> 01:16:42,567
So, 2 for ice, 3 for water.

1786
01:16:43,037 --> 01:16:44,737
This is the actual situation.

1787
01:16:45,007 --> 01:16:47,947
Does anyone have sunscreen? I didn't bring any.

1788
01:16:49,477 --> 01:16:51,516
We have to see who the men are.

1789
01:16:51,517 --> 01:16:53,546
I'm happy. Hey, you're here.

1790
01:16:53,547 --> 01:16:55,116
- Hello. - Hang on.

1791
01:16:55,117 --> 01:16:56,616
You're all dressed so differently.

1792
01:16:56,617 --> 01:16:58,156
Who's doing water sports?

1793
01:16:58,157 --> 01:16:59,357
- Water sports? - That's me.

1794
01:16:59,457 --> 01:17:00,937
Are you two going to do water sports?

1795
01:17:01,627 --> 01:17:02,627
Water sports?

1796
01:17:02,628 --> 01:17:04,096
(Yeong Gyeong and Hyeon Jun got matched for the Over Zero Date.)

1797
01:17:04,097 --> 01:17:05,857
- Oh, they end up like this? - Water sports?

1798
01:17:05,997 --> 01:17:07,957
- The lucky ones end up together. - Water sports?

1799
01:17:08,927 --> 01:17:11,197
Water sports? Are you two going to do water sports?

1800
01:17:11,997 --> 01:17:15,107
- Oh, have a good time. - Is he not?

1801
01:17:15,207 --> 01:17:16,677
- Oh, really? - No.

1802
01:17:16,777 --> 01:17:18,577
- Really? - It was just a random draw.

1803
01:17:18,837 --> 01:17:20,477
- That's a shame. - Is it the two of you?

1804
01:17:20,577 --> 01:17:21,577
Sang Won.

1805
01:17:21,578 --> 01:17:23,017
- No. - Are there three?

1806
01:17:23,917 --> 01:17:28,747
Actually, from the beginning all the way until now,

1807
01:17:29,147 --> 01:17:33,727
ever since I went on the date with Sang Won where we made makgeolli,

1808
01:17:34,087 --> 01:17:36,926
I've been wanting to...

1809
01:17:36,927 --> 01:17:40,127
go on a date with Sang Won.

1810
01:17:40,397 --> 01:17:43,196
The timing was really disappointing.

1811
01:17:43,197 --> 01:17:44,866
- Gosh, Ye Eun must feel so... - Have you...

1812
01:17:44,867 --> 01:17:46,313
- I feel bad for her. - all been to a barge?

1813
01:17:46,337 --> 01:17:47,806
Who else is going to the barge?

1814
01:17:47,807 --> 01:17:49,207
For the men, it's me and Hyeon Jun.

1815
01:17:49,777 --> 01:17:50,936
- The two of you? - Yes.

1816
01:17:50,937 --> 01:17:51,937
Date again?

1817
01:17:51,938 --> 01:17:54,377
How could just those two women be on the same team?

1818
01:17:55,047 --> 01:17:58,746
It was the two men I saw yesterday who were home alone.

1819
01:17:58,747 --> 01:18:01,447
Then, I found out that the rest were on Team Below Zero.

1820
01:18:02,247 --> 01:18:05,416
"Shoot, I want to go to Below Zero too."

1821
01:18:05,417 --> 01:18:07,097
- That's what I kept thinking. - Oh, dear.

1822
01:18:07,427 --> 01:18:09,257
By the way, I didn't have a choice.

1823
01:18:09,657 --> 01:18:11,497
I was the last to go in,

1824
01:18:11,597 --> 01:18:13,597
so I just took the one that was left.

1825
01:18:14,267 --> 01:18:15,666
- I didn't choose this. - We'll be back.

1826
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:16,796
- We'll let you know. - Have fun.

1827
01:18:16,797 --> 01:18:19,336
For real. I wanted to pick Below Zero.

1828
01:18:19,337 --> 01:18:20,606
- But I got Over Zero. - I might catch the flu.

1829
01:18:20,607 --> 01:18:21,843
- I'm disappointed. - I don't know.

1830
01:18:21,867 --> 01:18:25,376
Gosh, but she just expressed herself really honestly.

1831
01:18:25,377 --> 01:18:27,476
Shoot, that sounds like fun.

1832
01:18:27,477 --> 01:18:28,506
- Good luck. - This is my first time at a barge.

1833
01:18:28,507 --> 01:18:30,077
But today, it kind of...

1834
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:31,547
Let's go, everyone.

1835
01:18:31,877 --> 01:18:34,186
- Have fun, guys. Bye! - See you later.

1836
01:18:34,187 --> 01:18:35,616
Have fun. Bye.

1837
01:18:35,617 --> 01:18:37,016
- We'll have a good time. - Bye.

1838
01:18:37,017 --> 01:18:38,057
That sounds like fun.

1839
01:18:39,287 --> 01:18:41,026
- Mu Jin, Bon Hee, - Bon Hee.

1840
01:18:41,027 --> 01:18:43,427
Sang Hyeon, Sang Won, and So Hyun?

1841
01:18:43,697 --> 01:18:45,596
So Hyun. That's right.

1842
01:18:45,597 --> 01:18:47,277
(What changes will the group dates bring?)

1843
01:18:47,367 --> 01:18:49,697
(Finally, the Over or Below Zero Dates begin.)

1844
01:18:50,197 --> 01:18:53,566
(Ji Won and Ye Eun's uncomfortable silence...)

1845
01:18:53,567 --> 01:18:55,767
(from a date without Sang Won)

1846
01:18:56,307 --> 01:18:58,177
(Let's go!)

1847
01:18:58,837 --> 01:19:00,346
(I'm so happy today.)

1848
01:19:00,347 --> 01:19:01,977
(Really?)

1849
01:19:03,017 --> 01:19:05,346
(Those who are happy on their date...)

1850
01:19:05,347 --> 01:19:08,347
(and two people who feel uncomfortable on their date)

1851
01:19:11,857 --> 01:19:15,026
(Meanwhile, how is Team Below Zero doing?)

1852
01:19:15,027 --> 01:19:17,927
(After only being on 1-on-1 dates, a group date is fun.)

1853
01:19:19,297 --> 01:19:20,897
(So Hyun had a big fall.)

1854
01:19:21,397 --> 01:19:23,636
(Are you okay?)

1855
01:19:23,637 --> 01:19:25,897
(I think I was kind of disappointed in Sang Hyeon.)

1856
01:19:26,607 --> 01:19:28,407
(I'll hold your hand from now on.)

1857
01:19:28,637 --> 01:19:30,607
(I wish time would go slowly from now on.)

1858
01:19:31,407 --> 01:19:33,977
(A new excitement blossomed on the random group date.)

1859
01:19:34,977 --> 01:19:35,977
(So, )

1860
01:19:35,978 --> 01:19:38,477
(there was something I wanted to say earlier.)

1861
01:19:38,977 --> 01:19:40,016
(I wanted to...)

1862
01:19:40,017 --> 01:19:41,987
(talk more with Mu Jin.)

1863
01:19:42,517 --> 01:19:43,887
I could just talk to him.

1864
01:19:44,287 --> 01:19:45,786
(Mu Jin's feelings are important, )

1865
01:19:45,787 --> 01:19:46,957
(but so are your feelings.)

1866
01:19:47,057 --> 01:19:48,726
(I don't think it's right not to talk to him...)

1867
01:19:48,727 --> 01:19:50,756
(because I'm trying to tiptoe around.)

1868
01:19:50,757 --> 01:19:52,726
(Anyway, you might feel bothered, )

1869
01:19:52,727 --> 01:19:54,196
(but you told me that you don't mind.)

1870
01:19:54,197 --> 01:19:55,326
(How could I not feel bothered?)

1871
01:19:55,327 --> 01:19:57,067
(Of course, I mind.)

1872
01:19:59,397 --> 01:20:01,666
(And finally, the moment...)

1873
01:20:01,667 --> 01:20:04,407
(that they must face each other's age has come.)

1874
01:20:05,207 --> 01:20:08,646
(I was born...)

1875
01:20:08,647 --> 01:20:09,747
(in the year...)

1876
01:20:10,317 --> 01:20:13,517
(19xx)

1877
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:18,356
(The older women face the reality they had forgotten about.)

1878
01:20:18,357 --> 01:20:21,227
(I was...)

1879
01:20:22,057 --> 01:20:23,126
(After hearing their ages, )

1880
01:20:23,127 --> 01:20:25,927
(I don't think I was able to hide my facial expression.)

1881
01:20:26,027 --> 01:20:27,266
He must have a lot on his mind.

1882
01:20:27,267 --> 01:20:29,627
(The wall of age has come to Yeon House.)

1883
01:20:31,397 --> 01:20:35,007
(What changes will come to Yeon House after the age reveal?)
