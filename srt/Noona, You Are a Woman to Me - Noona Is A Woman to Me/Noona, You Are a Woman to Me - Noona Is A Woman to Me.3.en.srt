1
00:00:00,102 --> 00:00:01,802
(The second day at Yeon House)

2
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:02,902
(5-Minute Time Attack Date)

3
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:05,142
(The men have to ask for a date within 5 minutes.)

4
00:00:05,942 --> 00:00:07,542
(They get up right away.)

5
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:11,141
(Mu Jin, who got up first, chose...)

6
00:00:11,142 --> 00:00:13,512
(Bon Hee.)

7
00:00:13,782 --> 00:00:15,681
(How about a date with me...)

8
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,782
(today?)

9
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:19,152
(Okay.)

10
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:20,851
(The first date began with the younger men...)

11
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:22,722
(asking the women out.)

12
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:24,822
(Bus date: Mu Jin and Bon Hee)

13
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:27,161
(What was my first impression?)

14
00:00:27,162 --> 00:00:29,332
(You were pretty.)

15
00:00:29,802 --> 00:00:32,901
(Moments filled with excitement like in a movie)

16
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:34,201
(Makgeolli workshop date: Sang Won and Ye Eun)

17
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:36,542
(My interest in Sang Won has increased.)

18
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:38,602
(It made my heart flutter.)

19
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,142
(They seem a lot closer now.)

20
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,041
(Dinner date: Hyeon Jun and Yeong Gyeong)

21
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,082
(I deboned this nicely. Would you like some?)

22
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,211
(Thank you.)

23
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:49,251
(It's beautiful behind you.)

24
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:52,792
(I've always wanted to go on a date like this.)

25
00:00:53,092 --> 00:00:54,852
(But after a short moment of excitement...)

26
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:57,322
(How many more people do you want to get to know?)

27
00:00:58,422 --> 00:00:59,431
(One.)

28
00:00:59,432 --> 00:01:00,891
(Thinking)

29
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:05,061
(But getting to know...)

30
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:06,302
(Honestly, I'm not too sure.)

31
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:10,871
(It didn't make me happy.)

32
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:14,312
(I couldn't hide my expression, which put me in an awkward spot.)

33
00:01:15,712 --> 00:01:16,982
(I don't know.)

34
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:20,751
(How did the first date with mixed feelings end?)

35
00:01:20,752 --> 00:01:21,851
What's nice about our show,

36
00:01:21,852 --> 00:01:23,751
Noona is A Woman to Me,

37
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:26,091
- is that everything moves fast. - Yes.

38
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:27,998
- That's why... - It's easy to get immersed in it.

39
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:29,292
- Yes. - Totally.

40
00:01:29,362 --> 00:01:30,562
When Sang Won...

41
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:33,262
was asked if he was interested in anyone else,

42
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:35,702
his answer was very honest.

43
00:01:35,902 --> 00:01:37,661
Rather than getting caught, being honest is better.

44
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,832
Being honest is,

45
00:01:40,102 --> 00:01:42,272
in the end, really cool and better.

46
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:46,341
But he was spending time with Ye Eun.

47
00:01:46,342 --> 00:01:48,111
- He should've focused on her. - It was...

48
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:49,611
He shouldn't have said that.

49
00:01:49,612 --> 00:01:51,111
He spoke too soon.

50
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:52,312
(He shouldn't have said that!)

51
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:57,782
(Sang Won and Ye Eun return after their date.)

52
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,291
(The atmosphere turned cold after the date.)

53
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:03,621
- Ye Eun... - Oh, no.

54
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:06,862
- went straight to the kitchen. - Straight there.

55
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:12,202
(Ye Eun returned to her room first.)

56
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:15,001
(Sighing)

57
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,142
She's sighing.

58
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:20,841
(Heading to Ji Won and Bon Hee's room after getting changed)

59
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:23,212
(Trudging)

60
00:02:25,582 --> 00:02:27,882
- Yes? - Pardon me.

61
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:31,952
- We were just chatting. - Come in.

62
00:02:33,222 --> 00:02:36,361
Both of you said you could see their feelings.

63
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:37,521
But how did you know?

64
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:40,191
You can tell who's interested in whom, right?

65
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:42,461
They look at the person they're interested in...

66
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,701
- and take care of them. - Yes.

67
00:02:44,702 --> 00:02:46,782
From that, I realize who they may have feelings for.

68
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:49,241
Do you catch that in the women's and guys' gazes?

69
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:50,602
- Yes. - Is that so?

70
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,372
Maybe I'm just slow-witted.

71
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:56,142
- We're quite similar. - Right?

72
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,441
- But... - You can kind of feel it.

73
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:58,442
- You can? - Yes.

74
00:02:58,443 --> 00:02:59,852
But I have no clue.

75
00:03:00,852 --> 00:03:02,211
- Sang Won? - Yes.

76
00:03:02,212 --> 00:03:03,882
- I don't get him. - Me neither.

77
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:05,321
Sang Won is a mystery.

78
00:03:05,322 --> 00:03:07,421
Sang Won rarely expresses his feelings.

79
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:08,422
Exactly.

80
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,062
It's just a personal opinion, but I think...

81
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:15,062
we're still in the stage of getting to know each other.

82
00:03:15,902 --> 00:03:18,801
If I were to behave rashly,

83
00:03:18,802 --> 00:03:21,372
it might burden the other person.

84
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,942
Pressing forward too one-sidedly...

85
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,911
is something to be careful about.

86
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:28,341
(Sang Won is careful about being certain.)

87
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,512
What was Sang Won like when you two talked?

88
00:03:36,452 --> 00:03:37,952
To be honest,

89
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:40,891
I'm not sure.

90
00:03:40,892 --> 00:03:43,622
(To be honest, I'm not sure.)

91
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:47,562
(Ye Eun feels as much frustration as the depth of her growing feelings.)

92
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,432
It could've been a letdown.

93
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:52,262
This is bad.

94
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:58,371
(Sang Won returns to the men's room.)

95
00:03:58,372 --> 00:03:59,372
What?

96
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,042
What?

97
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,211
For real?

98
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:09,092
(A new bed has been placed next to Sang Won's.)

99
00:04:09,622 --> 00:04:11,681
(There were only 2 beds.)

100
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:15,322
(Now there's another one.)

101
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:18,262
That's true. There's another bed now.

102
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:20,732
(Looking happy)

103
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:26,071
(Staring)

104
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:27,172
Seriously?

105
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:28,772
(Surprised)

106
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:30,372
What now? Hold on.

107
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:31,602
He's dumbstruck.

108
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:33,571
What do we do? Hey.

109
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:34,612
Did you see it?

110
00:04:35,472 --> 00:04:36,682
Another guy is coming.

111
00:04:37,312 --> 00:04:38,782
The sight of it was surprising.

112
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,282
One more guy must be coming.

113
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:42,252
It's the catfish.

114
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:44,651
Look at his reaction.

115
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,322
This will make it more interesting.

116
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:48,021
He's always relaxed.

117
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,762
- He's enjoying it. - For sure.

118
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:52,462
(Sang Hyeon doesn't know anything yet.)

119
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:55,931
(Surprised)

120
00:04:55,932 --> 00:04:57,261
- Hey. - When did you get back?

121
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:58,332
- Just now. - Just now?

122
00:04:58,532 --> 00:04:59,632
Did you see it?

123
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:03,142
(He stops in front of the unfamiliar bed.)

124
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:05,812
I just got back and was shocked.

125
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:08,372
It's the catfish.

126
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,281
- The catfish. - How cute.

127
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:13,481
- This is wild. - I'm scared of the catfish.

128
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:16,522
(The younger men are uneasy because of the new male participant.)

129
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,051
(Yeong Gyeong and Hyeon Jun run into each other in the kitchen.)

130
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,622
One more guy will come.

131
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:22,692
What?

132
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,391
We've got another bed.

133
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:26,632
- Unbelievable. For real? - Yes.

134
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:31,732
Didn't we have spicy catfish stew today?

135
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:35,001
(Was it a tailored menu?)

136
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,541
- The menu. - Right.

137
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,601
Yeong Gyeong is quite cute.

138
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:39,802
To think she has such a charm.

139
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:44,411
(Yeong Gyeong heads to Bon Hee and Ji Won's room with the news.)

140
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:46,681
- Yes? - She's going to deliver the news.

141
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:47,911
Look who is happy.

142
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:49,622
I just heard some interesting news.

143
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:53,422
There's another bed in the men's room.

144
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:54,922
Really?

145
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,492
I bet today's event will be...

146
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:59,492
(Is today's event about a new younger man?)

147
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:02,262
- How exciting. - It's a big event.

148
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,102
She's like a pigeon.

149
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:08,902
- Knock, knock. - Knock, knock.

150
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,602
The guys have another bed.

151
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:14,771
- Really? - What?

152
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:17,142
- Really? - Isn't it shocking?

153
00:06:18,282 --> 00:06:19,851
- Have you heard? - What?

154
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:21,711
That the guys have another bed.

155
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:23,752
- No. - One new bed has been added.

156
00:06:24,022 --> 00:06:25,892
A new guy must be coming.

157
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,452
Oh, my gosh.

158
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:32,022
If this is how he's going to join,

159
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,862
don't you think he'll be an energetic guy?

160
00:06:36,732 --> 00:06:40,332
I hope he has a good build.

161
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,172
Who will it be?

162
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:48,612
I'm curious.

163
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:53,112
What kind of an image do we not have?

164
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:56,452
Someone wearing glasses who is good at studying?

165
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:02,152
(Getting ready for a guy who wears glasses and is good at studying)

166
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:05,792
(An image of a guy wearing glasses and good at studying)

167
00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:09,131
(Nervous and keeping in check, the younger men have become busy.)

168
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:11,561
- The older women are excited, - Yes.

169
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:14,171
While the younger men are worried.

170
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:15,872
- They must be nervous. - It's different.

171
00:07:16,742 --> 00:07:19,872
(Meanwhile, )

172
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,211
(a car enters Yeon House.)

173
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:22,372
Here he comes.

174
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:24,682
He's coming.

175
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:31,852
Gosh.

176
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:36,591
(Yeon House)

177
00:07:36,592 --> 00:07:38,091
(With a tough-looking car, )

178
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:39,191
(the new younger man arrives.)

179
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,332
- He must have a big build. - Even his car...

180
00:07:41,832 --> 00:07:43,661
- looks sturdy. - An off-road car.

181
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:44,932
Yes, off-road.

182
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,342
He's tall. What?

183
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,551
He's tall.

184
00:08:00,552 --> 00:08:03,321
(Broad shoulders)

185
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:04,981
What's with his shoulders? They are thick.

186
00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:06,891
It's not wide, but thick front to back.

187
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:07,952
(I love it.)

188
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:12,462
(The new younger man is coming!)

189
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,562
I was thinking of an image we didn't have.

190
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,562
Someone who is energetic and kind of...

191
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:20,702
A real teto-guy?

192
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:22,572
Someone muscular.

193
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:25,972
(I'm excited.)

194
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,042
I really want to see how the women will react.

195
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:34,912
(Is the new younger man an energetic and muscular teto-guy?)

196
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,391
(The new younger man is standing in front of the door.)

197
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:41,821
I'm certain he's an athlete.

198
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:42,921
- Yes, an athlete. - Totally.

199
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,062
- Right? - Yes.

200
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:45,992
(Tapping)

201
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,962
Are you nervous?

202
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:49,162
- Me? - Yes.

203
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,632
Your finger keeps...

204
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,572
(Embarrassed and nervous)

205
00:08:58,642 --> 00:09:00,841
I wonder what kind of role...

206
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:02,341
he'll play in the current situation.

207
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,111
- Me too. - He's giving off a different vibe.

208
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:05,632
- A completely different one. - Right?

209
00:09:07,282 --> 00:09:08,282
(Curious)

210
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:11,551
(Pursing his lips)

211
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:15,522
(There's only silence in Yeon House.)

212
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,272
Oh, no.

213
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:30,171
He went inside.

214
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:32,442
(The new younger man has entered Yeon House.)

215
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,941
(A strange nervousness before meeting the new participant)

216
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,012
Hi.

217
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:38,912
Hi.

218
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:41,462
- Oh, my gosh. - He's coming in like this?

219
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,652
- Hi. - Hi.

220
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:45,552
- Hi. - Hi.

221
00:09:46,622 --> 00:09:47,622
(Laughing)

222
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:58,662
- Hi. - Hi.

223
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:01,231
(A completely new type of younger man)

224
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:02,572
He has smooth skin.

225
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:04,902
He's cute.

226
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:06,742
He's right up the older women's alley.

227
00:10:09,882 --> 00:10:11,011
I can't help but smile.

228
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,012
(Flipping her hair)

229
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:13,651
(She also flips her hair.)

230
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:14,751
(The older women's eyes are fixed on the new man.)

231
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:16,651
When women flip their hair, it means...

232
00:10:16,652 --> 00:10:18,212
- they're interested in the guy. - Yes.

233
00:10:18,622 --> 00:10:20,452
(Flipping lightly)

234
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:22,762
- Hi. He has a great body. - Hi.

235
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:32,061
Take a seat wherever you want.

236
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:33,172
Where can I...

237
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:37,342
How about we take a seat like this?

238
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:39,202
- I'll sit here. - Okay.

239
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:41,771
(They finally meet...)

240
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:45,642
(the new younger man.)

241
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:48,551
- Nice to meet you. - Hi.

242
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:49,582
Hi.

243
00:10:51,622 --> 00:10:52,652
Teto-guy.

244
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:56,162
The moment he came, he made a strong impression.

245
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:00,932
He's very manly.

246
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:03,462
He definitely looks tough on the outside.

247
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:07,332
But we'll see if he's tender on the inside.

248
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:13,471
(And...)

249
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,712
(1 person in particular seems to be glowing.)

250
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:18,642
What's your ideal type?

251
00:11:18,782 --> 00:11:20,412
I like teto-guys.

252
00:11:20,982 --> 00:11:22,652
I like teto-guys.

253
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:26,222
(Teto-guys, Ji Won's unwavering ideal type)

254
00:11:28,952 --> 00:11:31,521
I said that a guy with a good, bulky build...

255
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:33,892
would be the new guy.

256
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:36,232
And I was right.

257
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:39,231
- What's your name? - Right.

258
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,972
My name is Yang Ji Yung.

259
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,972
- Ji Yung? - Yes.

260
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,272
(Nodding)

261
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:48,442
(Smiling)

262
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,282
A real teto-guy came.

263
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,752
For real, just like we expected.

264
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:56,622
Did you make guesses?

265
00:11:56,822 --> 00:11:58,882
He's a teto-guy even to the guys.

266
00:11:59,322 --> 00:12:01,092
A completely different style from me.

267
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:05,392
He gave off a very manly vibe.

268
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:11,132
I thought he would come off as a very charming guy to the women.

269
00:12:12,102 --> 00:12:14,302
(Relaxed)

270
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,472
You must work out.

271
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:19,512
Exercising is my hobby,

272
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,112
so I do a handful of sports.

273
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:23,181
If he's that big despite it being a hobby...

274
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:24,182
(Agreeing)

275
00:12:24,183 --> 00:12:25,312
I know, right?

276
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:28,312
There are fitness equipment pieces outside.

277
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,982
But I don't think anyone is using them.

278
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:33,622
But I don't think anyone is using them.

279
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:35,251
- Sang Hyeon. - Sang Hyeon.

280
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:38,161
- Did you work out? - Yes, I did.

281
00:12:38,162 --> 00:12:39,631
- In secret? - Yes, in secret.

282
00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:40,891
- That's right. - Oh, dear.

283
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,532
- I had no idea. - No, but I...

284
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:44,262
(Slightly embarrassed)

285
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:48,072
(He's been building his testosterone in secret.)

286
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,101
(A shy teto-guy)

287
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,502
Do you like working out?

288
00:12:51,942 --> 00:12:53,612
I do.

289
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:57,212
Do you not work out? Do you not like it?

290
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:58,582
I will exercise now.

291
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:00,112
I'd better start from now on.

292
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:03,152
I should.

293
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:09,192
I got the feeling that everyone there was nice.

294
00:13:09,692 --> 00:13:13,192
But none of the women gave off a definite older vibe.

295
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:15,192
Did everyone become close?

296
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:17,601
Compared to yesterday...

297
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:19,532
When did you move in yesterday?

298
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:22,272
It's been about 24 hours since we met.

299
00:13:22,772 --> 00:13:23,871
About 24 hours.

300
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:25,472
(Well, that's not bad.)

301
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:28,442
(Glancing)

302
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,342
What's your ideal type of woman?

303
00:13:32,882 --> 00:13:34,282
- My ideal type? - Yes.

304
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:36,982
Appearance-wise,

305
00:13:38,122 --> 00:13:40,222
I like a woman with simple features.

306
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:42,751
Simple is tough.

307
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:44,022
(Simple features?)

308
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:48,132
- What about her personality? - Personality-wise...

309
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:52,402
Someone who is proud of her job.

310
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,372
(Smiling)

311
00:13:55,472 --> 00:13:56,942
(Glancing)

312
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,242
The atmosphere is nerve-racking.

313
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:02,911
Before he arrived, the atmosphere felt relaxing.

314
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:05,881
But now, it's strange.

315
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:08,212
(The atmosphere changed with Ji Yung's arrival.)

316
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:09,721
- But listen. - Yes?

317
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:13,321
When a new person arrives after everyone has already become friends,

318
00:14:13,322 --> 00:14:16,251
- they become hesitant. - Of course.

319
00:14:16,252 --> 00:14:19,021
Ji Yung is facing eight people,

320
00:14:19,022 --> 00:14:20,431
and they've already become close.

321
00:14:20,432 --> 00:14:23,701
Despite coming later, he's leading the conversation.

322
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:26,102
That shows he's not your average guy.

323
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,012
- He's a real guy. - He's not your average guy.

324
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:36,272
(A text message has arrived at Yeon House.)

325
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:38,341
(What is it?)

326
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:39,712
They've got a text message.

327
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:41,582
What does it say?

328
00:14:42,652 --> 00:14:48,752
(Tonight, reveal your job.)

329
00:14:49,052 --> 00:14:50,222
(Surprised)

330
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:51,722
Finally.

331
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,461
Their jobs.

332
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:54,561
(Finally revealing their jobs)

333
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:55,562
In just two days?

334
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:57,963
- Revealing our jobs right away? - We're to reveal our jobs.

335
00:14:58,202 --> 00:14:59,332
Finally.

336
00:14:59,502 --> 00:15:01,902
I didn't expect us to reveal it this fast.

337
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:03,402
Like seriously?

338
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:07,212
I have no idea what the guys do for a living.

339
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:08,542
Me neither.

340
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:12,082
Either way, I'm sure everyone has a job.

341
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:13,912
I'm curious.

342
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:17,851
(What if they're all incredibly competent people, )

343
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:21,021
(such as lawyers?)

344
00:15:21,022 --> 00:15:22,622
(I wonder what they do for a living.)

345
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:25,062
I think you're in a creative field.

346
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:27,892
I think he's a YouTuber.

347
00:15:28,532 --> 00:15:29,831
(There were many guesses about their jobs.)

348
00:15:29,832 --> 00:15:31,162
A literal creator.

349
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:34,102
(As a new younger man joins them, )

350
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:36,172
- As soon as he arrived. - You're right.

351
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:41,372
(they reveal their jobs.)

352
00:15:42,112 --> 00:15:44,011
It's called the Job Box.

353
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:45,188
(There are hints in the Job Box.)

354
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:46,342
Should I open one?

355
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:49,311
- I'm getting nervous. - Right?

356
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:51,282
- My heart is racing. - So is mine.

357
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:54,191
- I'm nervous for the first time. - We're starting right away?

358
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:55,192
Just like that?

359
00:15:56,192 --> 00:15:59,262
(They'll reveal their jobs by opening the Box.)

360
00:15:59,832 --> 00:16:02,762
(Curious)

361
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:05,361
(What's the first item?)

362
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:06,362
What's that?

363
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,031
- What is it? - What's that?

364
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:09,402
(What is that?)

365
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:10,902
- What's that? - What is that?

366
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:14,811
(What could it be?)

367
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:16,512
- It's... - A film?

368
00:16:17,382 --> 00:16:18,642
An instant film.

369
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:20,882
Is it related to cinema?

370
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,521
A film?

371
00:16:23,522 --> 00:16:24,802
(Could it be related to cinema?)

372
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:27,622
(His lips twitch.)

373
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:31,092
Is Mu Jin smiling? No?

374
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:33,892
Or is it yours?

375
00:16:35,392 --> 00:16:38,202
I don't even know what that is. What is that?

376
00:16:39,502 --> 00:16:41,002
- A film? - Is it a CD?

377
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,471
(Everyone's getting curious.)

378
00:16:43,472 --> 00:16:44,472
Maybe it's...

379
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:46,042
Is it him?

380
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:48,511
(Sang Hyeon bursts into laughter.)

381
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:50,312
- Maybe it's... - That...

382
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:51,482
Is it Sang Hyeon's?

383
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:53,751
- Maybe it's... - That...

384
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:54,782
Is it Sang Hyeon's?

385
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:56,582
- Is it yours? - Yes.

386
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,682
Seriously?

387
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,951
(The first item belongs to Sang Hyeon.)

388
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,092
I'll tell you what this is.

389
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:04,322
It's a tape.

390
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:05,561
A tape.

391
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:06,562
(It was a tape.)

392
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,562
A videotape?

393
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:11,362
I work at a securities company...

394
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:14,871
as a database administrator.

395
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:18,472
Simply put, I'm an IT engineer.

396
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:20,142
(Intrigued)

397
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:23,541
I said that you looked like an IT guy.

398
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,281
It suits you, though.

399
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:26,442
(Shy)

400
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,622
(The symbol and hub of finance in South Korea)

401
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,222
I'm an IT engineer at a securities firm in Yeouido.

402
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:39,022
My job is to operate and manage key in-house data.

403
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:42,832
I've been interested in IT ever since I was little.

404
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:47,172
And I wanted to handle particularly financial data.

405
00:17:47,402 --> 00:17:50,202
That's how I ended up at a securities firm.

406
00:17:50,772 --> 00:17:53,001
This was the nerd we were looking for!

407
00:17:53,002 --> 00:17:54,611
(Kim Sang Hyeon, an IT engineer at a securities firm)

408
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:56,172
He's a brainiac.

409
00:17:56,372 --> 00:17:58,312
(Shy)

410
00:17:58,412 --> 00:17:59,681
(Amazed)

411
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:01,012
(Exclaiming)

412
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:06,382
This is a tape that can hold 12 terabytes.

413
00:18:06,992 --> 00:18:09,622
- So... - That's a lot, isn't it?

414
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,292
If something were to happen to it...

415
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,962
Then, I'd be in huge trouble.

416
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:16,162
I don't even want to picture it.

417
00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:18,902
That's why he was so meticulous.

418
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:24,942
I correctly guessed his job.

419
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:30,611
(I think you work at a startup or run an IT firm.)

420
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:32,342
That's fascinating. How did she guess that?

421
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:37,322
"Were my feelings right?"

422
00:18:37,922 --> 00:18:40,022
I got more curious about him.

423
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:42,122
I want to talk to him more.

424
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:44,991
She's more interested now.

425
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:47,468
(Will the older women have changed their minds after his job reveal?)

426
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:51,432
(Who will reveal their job next?)

427
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:53,231
A pair of sunglasses.

428
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,131
(A random pair of sunglasses)

429
00:18:55,132 --> 00:18:56,202
What's this for?

430
00:18:57,472 --> 00:18:59,172
I think it belongs to a designer.

431
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:03,312
(A designer?)

432
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,411
(Curious)

433
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:08,652
(Whose is it?)

434
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:10,552
I feel like it's Sang Won's.

435
00:19:11,122 --> 00:19:13,022
- Yes, I agree. - Yes.

436
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,891
Those are sports goggles.

437
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:17,262
I feel like it's Sang Won's.

438
00:19:17,762 --> 00:19:18,822
Yes, it's mine.

439
00:19:20,462 --> 00:19:21,632
But...

440
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,132
I don't think you can guess from this. Do you want to try?

441
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,372
Maybe he's a track-and-field athlete.

442
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:29,702
A dermatologist?

443
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,472
- It's for when he uses lasers? - Yes.

444
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:34,711
Or he could be a PE teacher.

445
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:37,342
Or he's a welder.

446
00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:39,612
I'll guess. A runner.

447
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:42,311
(He definitely looks like a runner.)

448
00:19:42,312 --> 00:19:43,472
Do I look like a good runner?

449
00:19:43,952 --> 00:19:45,552
(Joking)

450
00:19:46,122 --> 00:19:48,352
- Maybe a figure skater? - Right.

451
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:50,222
Are you an optician?

452
00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:53,291
I have a feeling he uses lasers.

453
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,892
Are you in the semiconductor industry?

454
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:56,232
It's close.

455
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:59,101
Maybe he deals with electric circuits.

456
00:19:59,102 --> 00:20:00,372
He needs those for the sparks.

457
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,772
As you said, I handle lasers...

458
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:07,112
and various pieces of equipment.

459
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:09,632
I'm a doctor working at an aesthetic clinic.

460
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:13,242
- Seul Hye! - Yes!

461
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:14,752
(Amazed)

462
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:16,281
Give her a prize.

463
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:17,421
(How on earth did she guess that?)

464
00:20:17,422 --> 00:20:19,481
Why did you just shout, "Yes?"

465
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:22,152
- I did something right, at least. - She's done something.

466
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,722
I'm a doctor working at an aesthetic clinic.

467
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:28,392
- What? - You're a doctor?

468
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,531
(Genuinely surprised)

469
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:32,532
A dermatologist?

470
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,232
Excuse me?

471
00:20:35,472 --> 00:20:37,601
(Is this really happening?)

472
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,241
You're a dermatologist?

473
00:20:39,242 --> 00:20:40,371
(No one can believe what they heard.)

474
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,271
- Are you serious? - Yes.

475
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:43,712
(Sang Won's job surprised everyone.)

476
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:46,712
I'm a doctor working at an aesthetic clinic,

477
00:20:47,152 --> 00:20:48,682
Park Sang Won.

478
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:50,721
He has great skin.

479
00:20:50,722 --> 00:20:52,321
- He's the director? - What?

480
00:20:52,322 --> 00:20:53,322
Director.

481
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:56,391
(He works at an aesthetic clinic and handles overall treatments.)

482
00:20:56,392 --> 00:20:57,762
He looks cool all of a sudden.

483
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:02,091
I also perform injection procedures, such as pigmentation treatments,

484
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:03,802
lifting, and fillers.

485
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:08,772
I'm proud of what I do...

486
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:10,702
when they're happy with the result.

487
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:13,072
That's a big surprise.

488
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:15,711
(Park Sang Won)

489
00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:16,981
It suits him.

490
00:21:16,982 --> 00:21:18,182
(A dermatologist)

491
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:20,881
He wouldn't be that young, then.

492
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:23,182
(Playful Sang Won had a surprising job.)

493
00:21:23,552 --> 00:21:25,322
(Impressed)

494
00:21:25,382 --> 00:21:26,722
That's amazing.

495
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,021
It is a surprise.

496
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:30,962
No one guessed it correctly.

497
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:34,461
I thought his job would require...

498
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:36,832
an outgoing personality.

499
00:21:37,732 --> 00:21:40,672
I was really surprised when he said he was a doctor.

500
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,252
His job was the biggest surprise.

501
00:21:43,742 --> 00:21:47,541
(Another person surprised by his job)

502
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:49,142
I was so startled.

503
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:52,012
All my guesses were wrong.

504
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,112
I said he was a YouTuber.

505
00:21:57,552 --> 00:21:59,222
(Embarrassed)

506
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:01,721
(Back to being calm)

507
00:22:01,722 --> 00:22:06,362
Yes. I never imagined him to be a doctor.

508
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:08,092
That's cool.

509
00:22:10,702 --> 00:22:12,061
(No one expected him to be a doctor.)

510
00:22:12,062 --> 00:22:13,161
So, he's a doctor.

511
00:22:13,162 --> 00:22:15,402
(No one expected him to be a doctor.)

512
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:17,071
(Two younger men have revealed their jobs.)

513
00:22:17,072 --> 00:22:18,242
Pick one.

514
00:22:19,942 --> 00:22:20,942
Is it for shooting?

515
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:24,911
Or not. I wonder what this is.

516
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:27,081
(A mysterious pair of goggles came out of the Box.)

517
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:28,582
There are many glasses.

518
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,822
There really are.

519
00:22:31,122 --> 00:22:32,722
Is it for making something?

520
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:34,091
Glasses...

521
00:22:34,092 --> 00:22:36,651
- for crafting jewelry. - It's for making jewelry.

522
00:22:36,652 --> 00:22:37,662
Is it?

523
00:22:37,762 --> 00:22:38,922
A craftworker?

524
00:22:39,222 --> 00:22:41,091
I bet it's one of these two.

525
00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:43,032
- Maybe Hyeon Jun. - Yes, one of these two.

526
00:22:43,732 --> 00:22:44,802
It's mine.

527
00:22:47,502 --> 00:22:48,572
Is she a researcher?

528
00:22:49,572 --> 00:22:53,572
I'd say it's similar to jewelry.

529
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,212
I like making pretty things.

530
00:22:58,142 --> 00:22:59,412
In the beauty industry?

531
00:23:00,652 --> 00:23:01,712
What is it?

532
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:06,322
It's what I use when I treat patients.

533
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:10,561
I make people's smiles prettier.

534
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:11,662
I'm a dentist.

535
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,432
She's also...

536
00:23:15,232 --> 00:23:16,792
So she was a dentist.

537
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:20,572
There are two doctors already?

538
00:23:21,872 --> 00:23:24,271
I'll visit them. I'll stop by the aesthetic clinic,

539
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:25,641
- then the dental clinic. - I'll go too.

540
00:23:25,642 --> 00:23:26,772
(I'll see you there.)

541
00:23:29,212 --> 00:23:33,951
Hello, I run a dental clinic in Gangnam.

542
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:36,082
I'm Kim Yeong Gyeong, a dentist.

543
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,821
I first entered Korea University's...

544
00:23:37,822 --> 00:23:40,251
Department of English Language and Literature.

545
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,792
Then, I went on to pursue a master's degree...

546
00:23:43,892 --> 00:23:46,822
in Communication at Seoul National University.

547
00:23:47,262 --> 00:23:50,931
During a spontaneous medical volunteer trip,

548
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:52,862
I was deeply moved by the experience,

549
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:57,172
which inspired me to study hard to enter dental school...

550
00:23:57,372 --> 00:23:59,301
and eventually become a dentist.

551
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:00,541
That's so cool.

552
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,042
- Goodness. - That's so cool.

553
00:24:03,112 --> 00:24:05,042
- That's admirable. - Indeed.

554
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:07,112
I bet she didn't have any time to date guys.

555
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,052
Everyone's so...

556
00:24:12,882 --> 00:24:14,022
It suits her.

557
00:24:15,692 --> 00:24:18,762
We have a dentist and a dermatologist.

558
00:24:18,962 --> 00:24:20,531
I have two doctors sitting next to me.

559
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:22,331
Seriously. Two doctors in front of me.

560
00:24:22,332 --> 00:24:24,561
(The two doctors sat next to Hyeon Jun by chance.)

561
00:24:24,562 --> 00:24:25,732
This is a rare experience.

562
00:24:26,202 --> 00:24:29,302
(Who will reveal their job next?)

563
00:24:29,832 --> 00:24:30,842
(Curious)

564
00:24:32,142 --> 00:24:33,371
(Amazed)

565
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,972
(Exclaiming)

566
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:37,981
Whose item is it?

567
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:39,512
(What?)

568
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,712
(What are they looking at?)

569
00:24:43,922 --> 00:24:45,551
(A flowerpot)

570
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:47,552
A flowerpot? A professional gardener?

571
00:24:52,062 --> 00:24:53,592
I can't even guess.

572
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:55,731
It was Mu Jin's?

573
00:24:55,732 --> 00:24:56,852
(The pot belongs to Mu Jin.)

574
00:24:57,302 --> 00:24:59,901
(Mu Jin and a flowerpot?)

575
00:24:59,902 --> 00:25:01,532
That's related to his job?

576
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:03,972
What do you think my job is?

577
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:05,842
A florist.

578
00:25:06,502 --> 00:25:07,971
A florist.

579
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:09,048
(A job related to flowerpots?)

580
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:10,072
A florist?

581
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:12,442
Or you run a botanical garden.

582
00:25:13,752 --> 00:25:14,881
That's too hard to guess.

583
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:15,911
(No one can guess it.)

584
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:17,822
I'm most curious about that one.

585
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,921
(No one seems to be able to guess it.)

586
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:22,952
What is it?

587
00:25:23,252 --> 00:25:24,392
(Hesitating)

588
00:25:24,492 --> 00:25:26,922
I'm a public servant.

589
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:28,561
What?

590
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:29,991
(A public servant?)

591
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:31,601
That's a huge plot twist.

592
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:33,802
I never expected him to be a public servant.

593
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,872
I'm a public servant.

594
00:25:37,072 --> 00:25:39,742
(What?)

595
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,611
(Amazed)

596
00:25:44,612 --> 00:25:46,882
How is that related to the flowerpot?

597
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,152
How are they connected?

598
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:53,081
I work in the field of forestry and green space management,

599
00:25:53,082 --> 00:25:54,422
so I brought a tree.

600
00:25:55,252 --> 00:25:57,422
(Fascinated)

601
00:25:57,992 --> 00:26:01,292
(No one guessed Mu Jin's job would be a public servant.)

602
00:26:03,702 --> 00:26:07,432
I currently work at the Environmental Forest Office.

603
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:09,872
I'm mainly responsible...

604
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:12,901
for handling permits required for developing mountainous areas,

605
00:26:12,902 --> 00:26:14,411
such as housing sites, campgrounds,

606
00:26:14,412 --> 00:26:16,172
and golf courses.

607
00:26:16,972 --> 00:26:20,751
And I supervise and manage those construction sites.

608
00:26:20,752 --> 00:26:23,052
(He also supervises the construction sites.)

609
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,181
Mu Jin's job is also surprising.

610
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:26,451
All their jobs are surprising.

611
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:27,521
That was so unexpected.

612
00:26:27,522 --> 00:26:29,591
- I wasn't expecting any of them. - Me neither.

613
00:26:29,592 --> 00:26:30,821
(Kim Mu Jin, a public servant)

614
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,462
He must be so popular.

615
00:26:36,432 --> 00:26:38,502
(Shy)

616
00:26:41,972 --> 00:26:43,672
I would never have guessed that.

617
00:26:43,842 --> 00:26:44,972
That was a surprise.

618
00:26:45,202 --> 00:26:46,918
- I couldn't imagine. - It was the biggest surprise.

619
00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:48,512
It really was.

620
00:26:49,112 --> 00:26:51,512
I used to think that I had good intuition,

621
00:26:51,712 --> 00:26:52,882
so it surprised me.

622
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,912
I could never figure out...

623
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,652
what his job would be.

624
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,291
I want to get to know more...

625
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:06,662
about the person rather than his job.

626
00:27:06,862 --> 00:27:08,832
So, that didn't really bother me.

627
00:27:09,592 --> 00:27:10,601
Yes.

628
00:27:10,602 --> 00:27:12,432
(He became the surprise of Yeon House.)

629
00:27:13,062 --> 00:27:14,301
(Amazed)

630
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:16,731
(Who does the fifth Job Box belong to?)

631
00:27:16,732 --> 00:27:18,202
It's very unique.

632
00:27:18,742 --> 00:27:20,271
I have no clue.

633
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:21,942
(A wooden doll?)

634
00:27:22,772 --> 00:27:24,281
What are they? Wooden dolls?

635
00:27:24,282 --> 00:27:25,481
(The wooden dolls keep coming.)

636
00:27:25,482 --> 00:27:29,281
They must make craftwork.

637
00:27:29,282 --> 00:27:30,481
(And a wooden black swan?)

638
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,752
Like dolls?

639
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:34,692
Are they an artist?

640
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:36,291
I'm dying to know.

641
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:37,522
(An artist who makes dolls?)

642
00:27:38,262 --> 00:27:39,262
(Grinning)

643
00:27:39,263 --> 00:27:40,832
(Putting on poker face)

644
00:27:41,432 --> 00:27:42,461
(Her eyes are fixed on someone.)

645
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:43,532
I have a guess.

646
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:45,332
A nutcracker.

647
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:47,002
(Turning)

648
00:27:47,172 --> 00:27:48,471
That's mine.

649
00:27:48,472 --> 00:27:50,941
(It was Ye Eun's Box.)

650
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:51,972
Yes.

651
00:27:53,442 --> 00:27:55,211
- "The Swan Lake." - "The Swan Lake."

652
00:27:55,212 --> 00:27:56,541
- "The Nutcracker." - "The Nutcracker."

653
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,042
- Oh, I see. - "Black Swan."

654
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:02,852
I'm a principal dancer...

655
00:28:03,412 --> 00:28:06,652
at the Korean National Ballet.

656
00:28:07,022 --> 00:28:08,792
That's my job.

657
00:28:09,322 --> 00:28:12,492
Everyone's so highly accomplished.

658
00:28:13,322 --> 00:28:14,862
Goodness.

659
00:28:16,192 --> 00:28:17,562
- She's so... - That's so cool.

660
00:28:18,862 --> 00:28:20,801
I'm the principal dancer...

661
00:28:20,802 --> 00:28:23,471
at the Korean National Ballet,

662
00:28:23,472 --> 00:28:25,541
who plays the lead role.

663
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:26,601
(The pinnacle of a ballet career)

664
00:28:26,602 --> 00:28:27,871
- And she's... - That gives me chills.

665
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,112
And she's the principal dancer.

666
00:28:30,112 --> 00:28:32,512
"The Nutcracker," "La Bayadere,"

667
00:28:33,682 --> 00:28:35,452
"Don Quixote," "Giselle..."

668
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,381
I've been in many pieces.

669
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,382
(She was in "The Nutcracker," "La Bayadere," "Don Quixote,")
("Giselle," and "Black Swan.")

670
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:40,422
That's impressive.

671
00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:43,962
I started doing ballet when I was five.

672
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:46,992
I attended Yewon School, Seoul Arts High School,

673
00:28:47,332 --> 00:28:48,932
and Korea National University of Arts.

674
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:53,662
And I won the Prima Ballerina Award in 2019.

675
00:28:58,442 --> 00:29:00,042
Ballet is my whole life.

676
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,671
That's why she couldn't afford...

677
00:29:03,672 --> 00:29:05,281
- to date guys. - Right.

678
00:29:05,282 --> 00:29:06,412
(Park Ye Eun, a ballerina)

679
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:08,652
(Shy)

680
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:09,982
It suits her.

681
00:29:10,152 --> 00:29:12,081
Being a principal dancer is tough.

682
00:29:12,082 --> 00:29:13,151
I know.

683
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:14,752
It suits her so well.

684
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:17,421
That's impressive.

685
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,061
(Still shy)

686
00:29:19,062 --> 00:29:20,761
(The item in the next Job Box)

687
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:21,762
(Exclaiming)

688
00:29:21,763 --> 00:29:22,831
Is that a Japanese knife?

689
00:29:22,832 --> 00:29:24,131
- A knife that's actually used. - Is it a sashimi knife?

690
00:29:24,132 --> 00:29:25,302
(It's a knife?)

691
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,162
- A chef? - A cook.

692
00:29:27,372 --> 00:29:28,971
This one must be a chef.

693
00:29:28,972 --> 00:29:30,302
(Are they a chef?)

694
00:29:31,072 --> 00:29:32,702
(Grinning)

695
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:34,541
(Turning his head)

696
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:35,912
I think it's Hyeon Jun's.

697
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:38,142
I agree.

698
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:40,142
It's mine.

699
00:29:40,682 --> 00:29:41,782
I knew it.

700
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:43,552
We guessed it correctly, didn't we?

701
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,922
I'm currently...

702
00:29:46,682 --> 00:29:50,592
expanding my business into the restaurant industry.

703
00:29:54,132 --> 00:29:56,492
I run a fusion bar, an izakaya,

704
00:29:56,632 --> 00:29:59,402
and a fusion Korean-style pub.

705
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,072
I'm also investing in shared venues...

706
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:05,742
and expanding my business.

707
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:10,882
(Kim Hyeon Jun)

708
00:30:13,742 --> 00:30:16,852
This is a knife that I use...

709
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:18,522
to trim and skin fish.

710
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:20,522
I brought it to cook for you.

711
00:30:21,752 --> 00:30:23,251
- Yes. - We'll be able to...

712
00:30:23,252 --> 00:30:24,592
eat delicious food.

713
00:30:25,592 --> 00:30:27,732
It was really surprising.

714
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:30,861
(Her guess on their first date was...)

715
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:34,101
(that he was a gym owner.)

716
00:30:34,102 --> 00:30:38,872
It was a job that I had never seen coming.

717
00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:41,942
I can't cook at all,

718
00:30:43,772 --> 00:30:45,081
so he looked cool.

719
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:49,482
(He looked cool.)

720
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:51,551
(There are three people's jobs left to be revealed.)

721
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:53,922
(Ji Won, Bon Hee, and Ji Yung)

722
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,651
(A miniature model of a hanok?)

723
00:30:56,652 --> 00:30:57,792
A miniature model?

724
00:30:58,422 --> 00:30:59,522
Architecture?

725
00:30:59,822 --> 00:31:01,592
- Architect. - Architect.

726
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:04,302
There's a photo inside.

727
00:31:07,102 --> 00:31:08,371
(She looks at someone.)

728
00:31:08,372 --> 00:31:09,731
- There's a photo. - There's a photo.

729
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:10,971
It's too obvious.

730
00:31:10,972 --> 00:31:12,542
(Everyone naturally looks at someone.)

731
00:31:12,942 --> 00:31:14,572
They're mine.

732
00:31:16,112 --> 00:31:18,182
I have two jobs.

733
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:20,341
I got my license...

734
00:31:20,342 --> 00:31:23,412
and am currently preparing to be a co-pilot.

735
00:31:23,552 --> 00:31:25,122
(Really?)

736
00:31:25,322 --> 00:31:26,552
While I'm doing that,

737
00:31:27,122 --> 00:31:30,391
I'm running a hanok-style accommodation.

738
00:31:30,392 --> 00:31:31,522
What?

739
00:31:32,462 --> 00:31:36,192
I used to work as a flight attendant in Korea.

740
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:40,972
I thought about what I could do to improve,

741
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,642
so I went to the US and got a pilot license.

742
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:45,941
That's admirable.

743
00:31:45,942 --> 00:31:46,971
It's so cool.

744
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,771
I'm currently studying...

745
00:31:48,772 --> 00:31:50,311
to get a job as a co-pilot.

746
00:31:50,312 --> 00:31:52,032
(She's studying to be a co-pilot in Korea.)

747
00:31:52,812 --> 00:31:55,682
I also run a hanok-style accommodation.

748
00:31:57,012 --> 00:31:59,122
I absolutely love that place.

749
00:31:59,722 --> 00:32:03,151
I put a lot of love into building that.

750
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:04,792
(She works as hard on it as she studies.)

751
00:32:05,062 --> 00:32:06,421
(Park Ji Won)

752
00:32:06,422 --> 00:32:07,991
They're all so impressive.

753
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,532
(Owner of a hanok-style accommodation)

754
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,462
- Thank you. - That's cool.

755
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:17,441
Call me if you ever want to visit.

756
00:32:17,442 --> 00:32:18,741
- I... - How lovely.

757
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:21,912
Always organize the place nicely,

758
00:32:22,172 --> 00:32:25,042
so you'll feel the warmth when you're there.

759
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:26,382
I want to visit.

760
00:32:28,552 --> 00:32:30,512
I'm more curious about people...

761
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,702
who have jobs that are different from mine.

762
00:32:33,782 --> 00:32:36,821
It fascinated me that she switched careers,

763
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:39,491
and I reckoned I could learn from her.

764
00:32:39,492 --> 00:32:42,892
It was a different type of respect.

765
00:32:43,692 --> 00:32:45,801
I want to get to know her better.

766
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:47,001
(After the job reveal, )

767
00:32:47,002 --> 00:32:50,502
(did Sang Won become interested in Ji Won?)

768
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,872
I think I know whose this is.

769
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:54,612
What?

770
00:32:55,742 --> 00:32:56,742
(A ball?)
(Glancing)

771
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:59,063
(They naturally look at one guy.)

772
00:33:00,282 --> 00:33:01,412
What on earth is that?

773
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:03,882
- "What on earth is that?" - What is that?

774
00:33:04,122 --> 00:33:05,352
I'm not so sure.

775
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,852
- It can't be anyone else. - Right.

776
00:33:09,492 --> 00:33:11,322
I'm a professional rugby player...

777
00:33:11,762 --> 00:33:13,792
in Korea.

778
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:19,162
I've always loved working out.

779
00:33:19,532 --> 00:33:21,301
I went to college...

780
00:33:21,302 --> 00:33:23,202
as a rugby player.

781
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:27,472
I'm currently a professional rugby player.

782
00:33:27,612 --> 00:33:28,642
He's a pro.

783
00:33:29,812 --> 00:33:32,882
My position is called the flanker.

784
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,781
It requires not only strength...

785
00:33:35,782 --> 00:33:38,122
but also speed.

786
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:40,991
(Yang Ji Yung, a pro rugby player)

787
00:33:40,992 --> 00:33:42,851
You can play rugby...

788
00:33:42,852 --> 00:33:44,922
only if you're strong and fast.

789
00:33:45,492 --> 00:33:46,562
Thank you.

790
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:49,731
That's amazing.

791
00:33:49,732 --> 00:33:52,231
Throwing an oval-shaped ball is...

792
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:53,752
different from throwing a regular one.

793
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:55,071
That's true.

794
00:33:55,072 --> 00:33:56,531
- Don't you use both hands? - Yes.

795
00:33:56,532 --> 00:33:58,072
- You're right. Both hands. - Right?

796
00:33:58,842 --> 00:34:01,041
I want to know how rugby is different...

797
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:02,642
- from American football. - Oh, right.

798
00:34:03,012 --> 00:34:06,342
The biggest difference is that you play football with pads on.

799
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:08,382
Rugby has no pads at all.

800
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:10,051
- Really? - Just our mouthguards.

801
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:12,012
Other than that, we play without protective pads.

802
00:34:12,252 --> 00:34:14,322
- Do you use different balls? - Yes.

803
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:17,322
A rugby ball is bigger than a football ball.

804
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:21,392
He looked like a good guy,

805
00:34:21,832 --> 00:34:23,561
and he was confident.

806
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:27,262
So, I want to find out what kind of person he is.

807
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:30,802
She's instinctively drawn to him.

808
00:34:33,842 --> 00:34:35,942
Now, the long-awaited participant.

809
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:38,942
- I'm so curious. - So am I.

810
00:34:39,282 --> 00:34:40,342
I wonder what she does.

811
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:43,182
(A poster for a drama?)

812
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:44,252
What?

813
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,021
(What?)

814
00:34:46,022 --> 00:34:47,051
I know what that is.

815
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:48,151
That's your job?

816
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,368
(Her job is related to the show "Youth of May?")

817
00:34:49,392 --> 00:34:50,621
Are you a writer?

818
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:51,992
A screenwriter? An actress?

819
00:34:52,262 --> 00:34:53,462
A stylist?

820
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,002
I'm a photographer.

821
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:04,342
That's the photo I took for the poster.

822
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:06,072
Oh, right.

823
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:08,311
(Glancing)

824
00:35:08,312 --> 00:35:10,812
(How does she look when she's working?)

825
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:13,182
I never imagined it.

826
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:15,382
My gosh. I had no idea she was a photographer.

827
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:18,722
I run a photo studio.

828
00:35:21,692 --> 00:35:24,012
I take photos for fashion magazines and fashion lookbooks.

829
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:27,521
I also make drama posters and take profile photos...

830
00:35:27,522 --> 00:35:28,892
of actors and models.

831
00:35:32,202 --> 00:35:33,731
As for drama posters,

832
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:36,031
the poster of "Youth of May" was my first work,

833
00:35:36,032 --> 00:35:38,872
and since then, I've been making various types of drama posters.

834
00:35:38,942 --> 00:35:40,272
Really?

835
00:35:42,012 --> 00:35:43,242
It's just so hard to believe.

836
00:35:43,972 --> 00:35:45,412
Everyone's occupation is unexpected.

837
00:35:45,912 --> 00:35:46,982
She's so cool.

838
00:35:47,652 --> 00:35:49,082
(Shy)

839
00:35:51,422 --> 00:35:52,422
That's cool.

840
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,491
My, that's really cool.

841
00:35:55,492 --> 00:35:57,722
She really is an attractive person.

842
00:35:58,562 --> 00:35:59,562
Sang Hyeon...

843
00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:03,191
She took photos of me...

844
00:36:03,192 --> 00:36:06,232
and said that she liked to take photos.

845
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:11,742
I found it great that she's making money...

846
00:36:11,972 --> 00:36:13,601
from what she likes.

847
00:36:13,602 --> 00:36:16,572
(I found it great.)

848
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:18,881
Everyone's job is fascinating.

849
00:36:18,882 --> 00:36:21,551
Everyone has a cool job.

850
00:36:21,552 --> 00:36:23,192
(They've all revealed their occupations.)

851
00:36:23,952 --> 00:36:27,991
(Did it change the feelings...)

852
00:36:27,992 --> 00:36:29,451
(of the older women and the younger men?)

853
00:36:29,452 --> 00:36:30,692
I wonder how things will go.

854
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,362
This is fun.

855
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:38,732
I think the women were a little bit worried...

856
00:36:39,062 --> 00:36:42,201
about the guys' career statuses.

857
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:44,972
- "What if they're students?" - That's what worried them.

858
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:48,071
But we have a doctor, a civil servant, and so on.

859
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,142
They're amazing.

860
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:54,181
Will knowing one another's job affect the relationships...

861
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:56,412
between the women and the guys? What do you think?

862
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:57,751
- I think it will. - Definitely.

863
00:36:57,752 --> 00:36:58,851
- Definitely? - Yes, definitely.

864
00:36:58,852 --> 00:36:59,951
- I think it'll have an influence. - Right.

865
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:02,251
Until now, there seemed to be romance between the couples...

866
00:37:02,252 --> 00:37:03,622
who spent time together.

867
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,661
But Yeong Gyeong said...

868
00:37:05,662 --> 00:37:07,732
she wanted to talk more with Sang Hyeon.

869
00:37:07,832 --> 00:37:10,591
And Sang Won found Bon Hee and Ji Won...

870
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:13,402
great and respectable. Based on what they said,

871
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:15,501
I think that revealing their jobs could change...

872
00:37:15,502 --> 00:37:17,232
some of the relationships.

873
00:37:17,272 --> 00:37:18,342
- I agree. - Right.

874
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:20,441
This might sound snobbish,

875
00:37:20,442 --> 00:37:22,941
but when Sang Won said he was a dermatologist,

876
00:37:22,942 --> 00:37:24,682
he suddenly looked more handsome.

877
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,581
It's a natural reaction.

878
00:37:26,582 --> 00:37:27,911
- I felt the same way. - I saw "Director" on his badge...

879
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,581
- and thought he was so cool. - To be honest, I felt the same way.

880
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:31,451
- Right? - Becoming a director is not easy.

881
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:32,922
- Exactly. - He's competent.

882
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:42,332
(After the occupation revelation, Ji Yung receives a message.)

883
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:45,932
(You can take someone out on a late-night date.)

884
00:37:46,232 --> 00:37:47,831
(Ask the older woman you like out on a date.)

885
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,471
- A late-night date? - He just got here.

886
00:37:50,472 --> 00:37:52,218
- I wonder whom he'll pick. - Where will they go at this hour?

887
00:37:52,242 --> 00:37:54,242
(Glancing)

888
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:58,082
It looks like I have to choose one person to go on a date with me.

889
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,888
- He'll go on a date right away? - I'm getting nervous.

890
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,082
Really? Just like this?

891
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:05,422
- The time has come. - My gosh.

892
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:10,022
(Pressing his lips together)

893
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:12,592
(Glancing)

894
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,992
(Looking nervously)

895
00:38:16,132 --> 00:38:20,832
(There's a subtle tension in the air for a moment.)

896
00:38:21,072 --> 00:38:22,101
(Whom will Ji Yung ask out on a date?)

897
00:38:22,102 --> 00:38:23,602
I'm so curious who he will choose.

898
00:38:24,672 --> 00:38:26,672
I want to talk to Ji Yung.

899
00:38:29,212 --> 00:38:30,241
(Nervous)

900
00:38:30,242 --> 00:38:31,442
They must be so nervous.

901
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:41,222
(Which of the older women does Ji Yung want to go out with?)

902
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:43,422
I will...

903
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,571
(Whom will Ji Yung ask out on a date?)

904
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,071
I'm so curious who he will choose.

905
00:38:46,813 --> 00:38:48,753
I want to talk to Ji Yung.

906
00:38:51,353 --> 00:38:52,382
(Nervous)

907
00:38:52,383 --> 00:38:53,553
They must be so nervous.

908
00:38:57,263 --> 00:39:03,263
(Which of the older women does Ji Yung want to go out with?)

909
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:05,463
I will...

910
00:39:06,703 --> 00:39:07,703
I will...

911
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:13,473
take Ms. Gu Bon Hee out on a date.

912
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:16,643
(Ji Yung chose Bon Hee.)

913
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:19,083
- Have a good time with him. - I will.

914
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,823
(Looking at Mu Jin nervously)

915
00:39:25,653 --> 00:39:28,592
(Mu Jin became quiet.)

916
00:39:28,593 --> 00:39:29,893
This is bad.

917
00:39:36,093 --> 00:39:38,133
Sang Hyeon is pressing his lips together.

918
00:39:39,863 --> 00:39:41,133
She doesn't look happy.

919
00:39:43,743 --> 00:39:45,773
It bothers me a little bit, to be honest.

920
00:39:48,773 --> 00:39:51,912
Honestly, I'm trying not to let the others know,

921
00:39:51,913 --> 00:39:54,113
but I do feel jealous.

922
00:39:54,153 --> 00:39:55,913
Seeing the man who newly joined us...

923
00:39:56,453 --> 00:39:58,293
take Bon Hee out on a date as soon as he came,

924
00:39:59,223 --> 00:40:02,452
I thought I should do something to win her heart.

925
00:40:02,453 --> 00:40:04,293
And that made me think of her even more.

926
00:40:05,323 --> 00:40:08,693
I think my feelings for her are growing.

927
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:13,902
- I'll go get my bag and come down. - Okay.

928
00:40:13,903 --> 00:40:16,143
(What change will Ji Yung's choice bring to Yeon House?)

929
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:17,443
This is so fun to watch.

930
00:40:18,073 --> 00:40:20,273
Can you give us some popcorn?

931
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,712
I want to have some snacks while watching it.

932
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:24,382
If you receive that kind of message,

933
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:26,882
would you ask her out in a private place?

934
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,112
Or would you just say it in front of everyone?

935
00:40:29,113 --> 00:40:30,523
Exactly. It's hard to answer.

936
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,183
I would need about two hours.

937
00:40:33,753 --> 00:40:34,792
- What? - What would you do in two hours?

938
00:40:34,793 --> 00:40:36,499
- You need time to think? - He asked what you would do.

939
00:40:36,523 --> 00:40:38,022
"What would you do in two hours?"

940
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:39,762
I would need everyone else to leave.

941
00:40:39,763 --> 00:40:41,192
(He needs time to wait until the others leave.)

942
00:40:41,193 --> 00:40:42,732
That would help me relieve nervousness.

943
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:43,979
(He also needs time to get ready mentally.)

944
00:40:44,003 --> 00:40:46,284
When I'm ready, I'd carry her over my shoulder and leave.

945
00:40:46,803 --> 00:40:49,003
(I'm dumbfounded.)

946
00:40:49,173 --> 00:40:52,873
If I were him... Since I'm going out on a late-night date,

947
00:40:53,043 --> 00:40:55,372
I'd choose someone quickly and leave to save time.

948
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:56,543
(Oh, my. I knew it!)

949
00:40:56,843 --> 00:40:58,983
(SOOBIN is tender outside, but tough inside.)

950
00:40:59,643 --> 00:41:02,653
(As Ji Yung chose her, Bon Hee prepares for the date.)

951
00:41:04,383 --> 00:41:06,123
Bon Hee.

952
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:09,523
- I'll get going. - Have a good time.

953
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:11,643
- I'm sure it'll be fun. - Right.

954
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:13,693
(Jealous)

955
00:41:14,663 --> 00:41:17,302
Mu Jin seemed upset for some reason.

956
00:41:17,303 --> 00:41:18,732
- Right now? - Earlier...

957
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:20,373
when Ji Yung asked you out.

958
00:41:20,703 --> 00:41:22,202
- Did you see his facial expression? - Am I the only one who felt that?

959
00:41:22,203 --> 00:41:23,842
- I saw him from the side... - How did you see his face?

960
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:24,883
I looked at him like this.

961
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:28,473
When Ji Yung chose you, I turned around to see his face.

962
00:41:29,273 --> 00:41:30,343
Like this.

963
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:32,883
Good luck.

964
00:41:33,143 --> 00:41:34,782
- I'll get going. - Have fun.

965
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,313
- Okay. I'll be off now. - Okay.

966
00:41:45,793 --> 00:41:46,963
Ji Won seemed...

967
00:41:47,493 --> 00:41:50,263
to be interested in Ji Yung, but she spoke so cheerfully.

968
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,032
- You know, she told Bon Hee... - Right.

969
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:54,202
- how Mu Jin seemed upset. - Exactly.

970
00:41:54,203 --> 00:41:56,172
- I wonder what that means. - They must be close.

971
00:41:56,173 --> 00:41:57,372
She wanted to tell Bon Hee in a subtle way,

972
00:41:57,373 --> 00:42:00,273
"You haven't forgotten Mu Jin, have you?"

973
00:42:01,073 --> 00:42:03,142
What she said had this kind of nuance subtly.

974
00:42:03,143 --> 00:42:04,942
If that's the case, it means...

975
00:42:04,943 --> 00:42:08,052
she said that to Bon Hee to sabotage their date.

976
00:42:08,053 --> 00:42:09,682
- It's sort of a strategy. - I wouldn't...

977
00:42:09,683 --> 00:42:11,782
I wouldn't say she tried to sabotage their date.

978
00:42:11,783 --> 00:42:15,022
- I don't know. - She couldn't help being jealous.

979
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:18,123
So she wanted to know if Bon Hee was happy about it...

980
00:42:18,293 --> 00:42:20,763
or didn't care so much that she had been chosen.

981
00:42:20,863 --> 00:42:22,692
She tried to see what was going on.

982
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:24,709
(Did Ji Won say it intentionally as she was interested in Ji Yung?)

983
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:25,733
(Meanwhile, in the guys' room)

984
00:42:25,734 --> 00:42:27,134
You should get changed and go down.

985
00:42:27,173 --> 00:42:29,009
She must be waiting for you on the third floor.

986
00:42:29,033 --> 00:42:30,033
- Really? - Yes.

987
00:42:30,034 --> 00:42:32,303
- Then I'll get going. - Okay.

988
00:42:32,403 --> 00:42:34,673
- Have a great time. - I'll see you guys later.

989
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:38,913
- Okay. - It was cut nicely.

990
00:42:39,213 --> 00:42:40,242
- Come in. - Come in.

991
00:42:40,243 --> 00:42:41,252
(Ji Yung came to pick up Bon Hee.)

992
00:42:41,253 --> 00:42:42,453
I'll be off.

993
00:42:42,553 --> 00:42:43,783
Have fun.

994
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:48,052
- You must be tired. - I'm fine.

995
00:42:48,053 --> 00:42:50,762
- Are you? - She must be taken aback.

996
00:42:50,763 --> 00:42:53,222
Only a few hours after Ji Yung came to the house,

997
00:42:53,223 --> 00:42:55,532
he chose her based on his first impression of her.

998
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:57,109
(Bon Hee and Ji Yung are going out on a late-night date.)

999
00:42:57,133 --> 00:42:59,133
- Aren't you cold? Are you? - No, I'm fine.

1000
00:42:59,763 --> 00:43:01,233
The weather became cool.

1001
00:43:01,473 --> 00:43:02,473
It's really nice.

1002
00:43:03,103 --> 00:43:05,773
(With a refreshing autumn breeze, they go on a late-night date.)

1003
00:43:05,843 --> 00:43:06,943
- Shall we go now? - Yes.

1004
00:43:10,273 --> 00:43:13,543
- Your car suits you too. - Really?

1005
00:43:18,123 --> 00:43:19,353
(Glancing)

1006
00:43:20,423 --> 00:43:21,622
Have you ever heard...

1007
00:43:21,623 --> 00:43:22,852
- a name called "Ji Yung?" - It's my first time.

1008
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:24,339
- You've never heard of the name? - No.

1009
00:43:24,363 --> 00:43:25,892
I don't think I've ever heard the name...

1010
00:43:25,893 --> 00:43:27,463
- "Bon Hee." Yes. - Is that so?

1011
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,432
There's an easy way to remember my name.

1012
00:43:30,433 --> 00:43:31,673
Oh, what is it? Please tell me.

1013
00:43:33,003 --> 00:43:34,133
Globe-Bon Hee.

1014
00:43:34,633 --> 00:43:35,633
(Laughing)

1015
00:43:35,634 --> 00:43:37,634
- I see. "Globe-Bon Hee." - What-To-Watch-Bon Hee.

1016
00:43:37,903 --> 00:43:39,743
My friends gave me those nicknames.

1017
00:43:40,303 --> 00:43:43,542
Could you tell that I was an athlete when you first saw me?

1018
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:46,382
I thought I was good at guessing.

1019
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:47,913
- But I couldn't guess. - Right.

1020
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,912
But I had no idea you could be a rugby player.

1021
00:43:49,913 --> 00:43:51,622
Right. That's natural.

1022
00:43:51,623 --> 00:43:52,753
It's an unfamiliar sport.

1023
00:43:53,783 --> 00:43:55,153
It's really fun.

1024
00:43:55,353 --> 00:43:56,823
I want to see you play rugby.

1025
00:43:57,463 --> 00:43:59,963
I brought a rugby ball. I'll show you how to play rugby.

1026
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:01,933
- Really? - Yes.

1027
00:44:02,463 --> 00:44:03,492
Sounds great.

1028
00:44:03,493 --> 00:44:05,533
(They even planned their second date so naturally?)

1029
00:44:05,903 --> 00:44:07,733
(Hesitating)

1030
00:44:09,873 --> 00:44:11,442
When you first came,

1031
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:13,913
did you see anyone who suited your preferences?

1032
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:16,413
- When I first came? - Yes. Or...

1033
00:44:17,383 --> 00:44:20,583
Before that, what's your ideal type?

1034
00:44:20,713 --> 00:44:23,453
He's trying to get to know her. He needs to catch up.

1035
00:44:23,553 --> 00:44:26,053
I like a man who is caring...

1036
00:44:26,553 --> 00:44:28,293
and has a sense of responsibility.

1037
00:44:30,623 --> 00:44:32,762
And I like a man who likes linen.

1038
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:35,492
- Sorry? - Linen. It's a type of fabric.

1039
00:44:35,493 --> 00:44:37,462
- Oh, I see. You mean, clothes? - Yes.

1040
00:44:37,463 --> 00:44:39,933
Right. When I choose what to wear,

1041
00:44:40,403 --> 00:44:42,633
I choose linen clothes very often.

1042
00:44:43,373 --> 00:44:44,373
(He flirts with her unexpectedly while talking about linen.)
Oh, really?

1043
00:44:46,673 --> 00:44:47,673
(Chuckling)

1044
00:44:47,873 --> 00:44:49,643
That's cute. I like it when a man does that.

1045
00:44:49,913 --> 00:44:52,442
- That can be an icebreaker. - That's not good.

1046
00:44:52,443 --> 00:44:54,813
Dad jokes work in that phase.

1047
00:44:54,913 --> 00:44:56,952
Seul Hye, do you find his comment boring and predictable?

1048
00:44:56,953 --> 00:44:58,822
- I really like it. - I like it too.

1049
00:44:58,823 --> 00:45:00,282
- It lightened the mood. - I really like it. Exactly.

1050
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:01,423
Are they in Dongdaemun?

1051
00:45:02,753 --> 00:45:04,723
What are you talking about?

1052
00:45:05,123 --> 00:45:08,062
That's cute. He's such a muscular man,

1053
00:45:08,063 --> 00:45:10,833
- but he makes a cute joke. - Right. That was a cute joke.

1054
00:45:11,203 --> 00:45:13,683
It's not easy to make such a joke when you first meet a woman.

1055
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:17,642
You met all four guys yesterday.

1056
00:45:17,643 --> 00:45:18,643
Yes.

1057
00:45:18,903 --> 00:45:21,243
Did you find any of them attractive?

1058
00:45:21,613 --> 00:45:22,613
Yes.

1059
00:45:23,113 --> 00:45:25,242
(Surprised)

1060
00:45:25,243 --> 00:45:28,013
Did he seem the most warm-hearted and caring?

1061
00:45:29,413 --> 00:45:31,983
I think he's quite attentive.

1062
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:34,693
I'm not attentive.

1063
00:45:36,393 --> 00:45:39,563
But I'm caring. Very much so.

1064
00:45:40,323 --> 00:45:41,663
Although I look like this...

1065
00:45:42,793 --> 00:45:44,153
What's wrong with your appearance?

1066
00:45:44,763 --> 00:45:48,072
You mean, you look manly? Is that what you mean?

1067
00:45:48,073 --> 00:45:49,073
(Nodding)

1068
00:45:49,733 --> 00:45:52,473
Isn't a person with unexpected charms more attractive?

1069
00:45:53,973 --> 00:45:55,613
He's very manly,

1070
00:45:55,713 --> 00:45:58,343
and at the same time, I see playfulness in his eyes.

1071
00:45:58,983 --> 00:46:00,042
- We're here. - Really?

1072
00:46:00,043 --> 00:46:02,443
(They arrived at the destination for their late-night date!)

1073
00:46:03,483 --> 00:46:04,623
- Shall we go? - Okay.

1074
00:46:10,553 --> 00:46:11,923
(Impressed)

1075
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:16,392
(A fire gazing cafe where you can enjoy camping vibes)

1076
00:46:16,393 --> 00:46:17,632
It's atmospheric.

1077
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:20,363
(A fire gazing cafe where you can enjoy camping vibes)

1078
00:46:23,403 --> 00:46:25,103
(Amazed)

1079
00:46:26,973 --> 00:46:28,043
Isn't it too hot?

1080
00:46:28,343 --> 00:46:29,512
- It's warm. - Is it?

1081
00:46:29,513 --> 00:46:30,943
- It's perfect. - Is it?

1082
00:46:32,213 --> 00:46:34,093
I didn't know there was such a place like this.

1083
00:46:34,183 --> 00:46:35,783
(Fascinated)

1084
00:46:35,853 --> 00:46:37,823
I really like to sit by a campfire.

1085
00:46:39,823 --> 00:46:40,893
It's romantic.

1086
00:46:41,223 --> 00:46:42,423
Look at the moon.

1087
00:46:45,123 --> 00:46:46,363
It's so bright.

1088
00:46:47,193 --> 00:46:49,163
The weather is really nice today.

1089
00:46:50,903 --> 00:46:55,333
Was there a particular reason you picked me?

1090
00:46:57,673 --> 00:46:59,873
You seemed to respond actively to what the others said.

1091
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:02,013
And I liked your voice.

1092
00:47:02,573 --> 00:47:04,543
That's why I chose you.

1093
00:47:05,043 --> 00:47:07,483
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

1094
00:47:07,913 --> 00:47:08,913
(Chuckling)

1095
00:47:14,253 --> 00:47:17,222
By the way, you have such good skin.

1096
00:47:17,223 --> 00:47:18,262
- Does it look good? - Yes.

1097
00:47:18,263 --> 00:47:21,533
- Really? - You didn't seem much older...

1098
00:47:23,263 --> 00:47:25,139
- I don't look much older than you? - You didn't seem that way.

1099
00:47:25,163 --> 00:47:26,532
That's the most common pickup line.

1100
00:47:26,533 --> 00:47:27,603
(Shy)

1101
00:47:28,803 --> 00:47:31,173
I think it's because we dress well and are good at makeup.

1102
00:47:31,573 --> 00:47:33,973
I try my best to make myself look good every day.

1103
00:47:37,343 --> 00:47:39,823
I don't know how old you are, but I know I'm younger than you.

1104
00:47:39,883 --> 00:47:43,113
Have you ever dated a younger man before?

1105
00:47:45,423 --> 00:47:46,883
- Once. - Once?

1106
00:47:48,153 --> 00:47:52,263
How many relationships have you been in before?

1107
00:47:52,363 --> 00:47:53,422
How many relationships have I been in?

1108
00:47:53,423 --> 00:47:54,583
(She's slightly taken aback.)

1109
00:47:58,733 --> 00:48:00,363
I don't have much dating experience.

1110
00:48:00,803 --> 00:48:02,573
Is it because of work?

1111
00:48:03,373 --> 00:48:05,973
I haven't dated in a very long time...

1112
00:48:06,673 --> 00:48:08,433
since I started my career as a photographer.

1113
00:48:09,013 --> 00:48:11,383
I haven't dated anyone in 4 or 5 years.

1114
00:48:13,713 --> 00:48:16,983
- Why do you think... - Yes?

1115
00:48:17,253 --> 00:48:20,653
Ji Yung asked her about her dating experience?

1116
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:23,793
Wouldn't you be purely curious about it?

1117
00:48:23,893 --> 00:48:27,463
I'd ask her how many relationships she's been in also.

1118
00:48:27,563 --> 00:48:29,039
Why would you be purely curious about that?

1119
00:48:29,063 --> 00:48:33,262
I think it could help me guess her age.

1120
00:48:33,263 --> 00:48:35,602
(That makes sense.)

1121
00:48:35,603 --> 00:48:37,172
So it's to gather information?

1122
00:48:37,173 --> 00:48:38,173
You're right.

1123
00:48:38,174 --> 00:48:39,372
Right. I think SOOBIN is right.

1124
00:48:39,373 --> 00:48:40,402
(I think he has a point.)

1125
00:48:40,403 --> 00:48:43,913
I didn't think there could be such a specific intention.

1126
00:48:44,283 --> 00:48:46,883
(But that may not be the case.)

1127
00:48:47,413 --> 00:48:49,853
Before you start a relationship with a guy,

1128
00:48:50,383 --> 00:48:52,063
do you take time to get to know him? Or...

1129
00:48:52,423 --> 00:48:55,293
Yes, I do. I spend a lot of time getting to know him.

1130
00:48:56,123 --> 00:48:58,463
- You spend a lot of time? - Yes.

1131
00:48:58,723 --> 00:48:59,862
(Thinking)

1132
00:48:59,863 --> 00:49:01,192
I would talk to him on the phone...

1133
00:49:01,193 --> 00:49:05,263
and go out on dates with him before starting a relationship.

1134
00:49:06,103 --> 00:49:08,603
I met them for quite long before starting to date them.

1135
00:49:09,003 --> 00:49:10,003
Until now?

1136
00:49:10,233 --> 00:49:12,619
So she spends much time with a guy before starting a relationship.

1137
00:49:12,643 --> 00:49:13,743
I'm the opposite of you.

1138
00:49:15,013 --> 00:49:16,013
- I see. - I tend to...

1139
00:49:18,283 --> 00:49:21,413
I've been this way until now.

1140
00:49:23,653 --> 00:49:25,853
I always fell for someone...

1141
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:30,653
after talking to her for a while and started dating her.

1142
00:49:31,223 --> 00:49:32,263
Until now.

1143
00:49:32,793 --> 00:49:35,692
Are you a straightforward type, or do you take time...

1144
00:49:35,693 --> 00:49:38,502
- I think I'm straightforward. - I see.

1145
00:49:38,503 --> 00:49:40,032
- You express your feelings. - Yes.

1146
00:49:40,033 --> 00:49:42,473
(Bon Hee and Ji Yung have completely opposite dating styles.)

1147
00:49:43,003 --> 00:49:44,703
(She nods without saying anything.)

1148
00:49:45,143 --> 00:49:46,973
I think I know why it takes me so much time.

1149
00:49:47,403 --> 00:49:49,113
It's hard for me to meet a guy.

1150
00:49:49,613 --> 00:49:50,613
You mean, dating a guy?

1151
00:49:51,543 --> 00:49:52,912
It's so hard for me to start a relationship.

1152
00:49:52,913 --> 00:49:54,329
(Bon Hee finds it hard to start love.)

1153
00:49:54,353 --> 00:49:56,273
My chances of developing feelings for someone...

1154
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:59,322
is almost the same as my chances of winning a lottery.

1155
00:49:59,323 --> 00:50:00,683
- Really? - That's how I feel now.

1156
00:50:03,653 --> 00:50:04,892
(At the same time, Yeon House)

1157
00:50:04,893 --> 00:50:07,193
I wonder how the rest are doing at the house.

1158
00:50:07,663 --> 00:50:08,663
(Sighing)

1159
00:50:09,933 --> 00:50:13,233
(Mu Jin is left alone in the room.)

1160
00:50:14,573 --> 00:50:18,373
(Thinking)

1161
00:50:22,013 --> 00:50:23,272
He doesn't look happy.

1162
00:50:23,273 --> 00:50:25,233
(He's pacing back and forth with a worried face.)

1163
00:50:26,883 --> 00:50:29,483
(Thinking)

1164
00:50:32,683 --> 00:50:34,053
(Sighing)

1165
00:50:37,223 --> 00:50:38,663
(Sighing)

1166
00:50:38,723 --> 00:50:40,592
(Mu Jin watches out the window waiting for someone?)

1167
00:50:40,593 --> 00:50:42,493
Oh, no. I feel bad for Mu Jin.

1168
00:50:45,403 --> 00:50:46,403
I'll do it.

1169
00:50:46,404 --> 00:50:48,172
(Meanwhile, Sang Won and Hyeon Jun are in the kitchen.)

1170
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:49,449
You're going to make fried rice for us.

1171
00:50:49,473 --> 00:50:52,872
Shall I make fried rice? I was going to make stir-fried mushrooms.

1172
00:50:52,873 --> 00:50:54,793
That sounds great. I'll stay and watch you cook.

1173
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,843
He's a chef.

1174
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:59,083
Now that everyone knows his job, he can show off his cooking skills.

1175
00:50:59,343 --> 00:51:01,252
The others will see how charming he is.

1176
00:51:01,253 --> 00:51:02,253
(Impressed)

1177
00:51:03,253 --> 00:51:05,153
- Shall I call everyone here? - No.

1178
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,922
- I'll tell them to come down. - No, don't do that.

1179
00:51:06,923 --> 00:51:07,923
Please wait.

1180
00:51:07,924 --> 00:51:09,229
(I'll watch him cook with everyone since it's cool.)

1181
00:51:09,253 --> 00:51:11,193
(Rushing)

1182
00:51:15,463 --> 00:51:16,932
(He stops.)

1183
00:51:16,933 --> 00:51:18,262
- Oh, boy. - Why?

1184
00:51:18,263 --> 00:51:19,263
(Turning)

1185
00:51:20,063 --> 00:51:21,672
(They tiptoe around each other.)

1186
00:51:21,673 --> 00:51:24,373
Do you want to go and take a look?

1187
00:51:24,743 --> 00:51:25,743
He spoke to her.

1188
00:51:25,744 --> 00:51:28,242
What do you say? Hyeon Jun is cooking for us.

1189
00:51:28,243 --> 00:51:30,203
- He's cooking now. - He mustered up his courage.

1190
00:51:30,373 --> 00:51:32,093
- He's cooking for us. - What is he making?

1191
00:51:32,383 --> 00:51:34,283
Stir-fried mushrooms and meat.

1192
00:51:35,213 --> 00:51:36,252
He already started cooking.

1193
00:51:36,253 --> 00:51:39,483
(Ye Eun follows Sang Won upon hearing the news.)

1194
00:51:43,323 --> 00:51:44,323
I did it.

1195
00:51:47,123 --> 00:51:48,733
Please sit. Let's watch him comfortably.

1196
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:50,863
He's doing well.

1197
00:51:51,103 --> 00:51:54,773
(Ye Eun laughs again.)

1198
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:57,703
(Cutting)

1199
00:51:58,673 --> 00:52:00,643
- He uses a knife differently. - Exactly.

1200
00:52:02,613 --> 00:52:05,082
- Thank goodness I'm not cooking. - Do you want to see me use a knife?

1201
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:06,083
Exactly.

1202
00:52:06,443 --> 00:52:08,323
You acted like a surgeon when you were with me.

1203
00:52:08,713 --> 00:52:10,153
Right? It's okay.

1204
00:52:10,953 --> 00:52:13,623
(They had a date at the makgeolli-making workshop.)

1205
00:52:14,123 --> 00:52:15,123
(Scalpel, please.)

1206
00:52:15,124 --> 00:52:16,523
(Chuckling)

1207
00:52:16,623 --> 00:52:17,922
(Are you really a doctor?)

1208
00:52:17,923 --> 00:52:19,622
It turned out that he was the one who was a doctor.

1209
00:52:19,623 --> 00:52:20,963
- Right. - That's right.

1210
00:52:23,193 --> 00:52:25,932
- It's okay. I also... - I'm sorry.

1211
00:52:25,933 --> 00:52:27,602
- I also... Don't be. - I apologize.

1212
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:30,302
I bragged to the chef that I made good suyuk.

1213
00:52:30,303 --> 00:52:33,603
Ye Eun gave him a light physical touch again.

1214
00:52:34,203 --> 00:52:35,943
She touched his knee.

1215
00:52:36,043 --> 00:52:38,842
- She must be feeling better now. - They get along well again.

1216
00:52:38,843 --> 00:52:40,683
- Right. - They're relaxed with each other.

1217
00:52:40,743 --> 00:52:41,782
Scalpel, please.

1218
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:44,383
(Ye Eun must be feeling better now. She keeps laughing.)

1219
00:52:44,723 --> 00:52:47,452
(Right then, Mu Jin appears while they're laughing.)

1220
00:52:47,453 --> 00:52:49,023
I almost made a big mistake.

1221
00:52:49,323 --> 00:52:50,952
I noticed it because you moved your hand downward.

1222
00:52:50,953 --> 00:52:54,362
(He still seems troubled.)

1223
00:52:54,363 --> 00:52:56,892
(Thinking hard)

1224
00:52:56,893 --> 00:52:59,633
I wonder if Bon Hee and Ji Yung...

1225
00:52:59,903 --> 00:53:01,803
will eat something before coming back.

1226
00:53:02,603 --> 00:53:04,473
- They must be eating now. - Probably.

1227
00:53:05,273 --> 00:53:07,833
I'm sure they're doing something other than just taking a drive.

1228
00:53:09,613 --> 00:53:11,512
I think they went to a cafe that opens until late.

1229
00:53:11,513 --> 00:53:12,713
Like a 24-hour cafe?

1230
00:53:14,143 --> 00:53:15,503
I think they went to a large cafe.

1231
00:53:16,453 --> 00:53:19,582
- He can hear their conversation. - There are many cafes around here.

1232
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,222
- But he can't join them. - I wonder where they went.

1233
00:53:21,223 --> 00:53:22,923
- He can't respond either. - Oh, no.

1234
00:53:23,123 --> 00:53:25,923
Mu Jin must be frustrated now.

1235
00:53:27,723 --> 00:53:28,793
Shall we take it upstairs?

1236
00:53:29,563 --> 00:53:30,863
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

1237
00:53:32,633 --> 00:53:35,233
(The stir-fried mushrooms and meat that Hyeon Jun made)

1238
00:53:36,233 --> 00:53:37,233
(Munching)

1239
00:53:37,943 --> 00:53:39,943
- I think that's right. - This is really good.

1240
00:53:40,373 --> 00:53:41,733
- I think it was there. - Amazing.

1241
00:53:42,673 --> 00:53:43,943
You can't say it's not good.

1242
00:53:44,043 --> 00:53:45,543
What did you put in here?

1243
00:53:46,013 --> 00:53:49,213
I put in oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sugar.

1244
00:53:49,483 --> 00:53:51,523
- It's way better than the stew. - He helped me.

1245
00:53:51,883 --> 00:53:54,323
(Smiling from ear to ear)

1246
00:53:54,893 --> 00:53:56,892
- I'm relieved you all like it. - I'm so happy.

1247
00:53:56,893 --> 00:53:57,893
This is really tasty.
- Indeed. - I mean it.

1248
00:53:59,123 --> 00:54:00,263
Can we have some more?

1249
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:01,632
Sure. I can make some more.

1250
00:54:01,633 --> 00:54:03,292
- Please make some more. - Please do.

1251
00:54:03,293 --> 00:54:05,602
- I'll make some for them too. - It's really good.

1252
00:54:05,603 --> 00:54:07,283
So that they can try it when they're back.

1253
00:54:08,503 --> 00:54:10,403
I wonder how far they went.

1254
00:54:12,173 --> 00:54:13,473
- I'm curious. - I'm curious.

1255
00:54:14,613 --> 00:54:16,872
- It's late, so... - The roads would be empty,

1256
00:54:16,873 --> 00:54:18,512
so they might have gone far.

1257
00:54:18,513 --> 00:54:20,433
- To see the night view. - The roads were empty.

1258
00:54:20,513 --> 00:54:22,289
- The night view... - Why is Mu Jin so quiet?

1259
00:54:22,313 --> 00:54:23,912
He hasn't said a word.

1260
00:54:23,913 --> 00:54:25,323
He's gone quiet.

1261
00:54:25,423 --> 00:54:27,323
They must have gone quite far.

1262
00:54:28,753 --> 00:54:30,022
(Moving his fingers)

1263
00:54:30,023 --> 00:54:31,263
Mu Jin is shaken.

1264
00:54:31,793 --> 00:54:33,023
Mu Jin is shaken.

1265
00:54:33,823 --> 00:54:35,792
- Sang Hyeon too? - He's quiet too.

1266
00:54:35,793 --> 00:54:37,832
(They can't stop thinking about Bon Hee or Ji Yung.)

1267
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,273
I can just say it and get yelled at.

1268
00:54:39,463 --> 00:54:40,702
I'm used to getting yelled at.

1269
00:54:40,703 --> 00:54:41,902
(Some are happy, )

1270
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,933
I get yelled at all the time.

1271
00:54:44,543 --> 00:54:45,642
So funny.

1272
00:54:45,643 --> 00:54:47,873
(and others are heavy-hearted.)

1273
00:54:53,943 --> 00:54:59,283
(Bon Hee and Ji Yung return from the date.)

1274
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:02,123
- Well done. - Well done.

1275
00:55:02,953 --> 00:55:05,293
- I had a lot of fun today. - I will see you tomorrow.

1276
00:55:09,893 --> 00:55:11,203
You're all here.

1277
00:55:11,403 --> 00:55:12,532
Right.

1278
00:55:12,533 --> 00:55:14,003
Right, it's...

1279
00:55:14,133 --> 00:55:15,403
You're all here.

1280
00:55:15,733 --> 00:55:16,833
Come join us.

1281
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:18,372
We've been waiting for you.

1282
00:55:18,373 --> 00:55:19,543
Were you?

1283
00:55:19,943 --> 00:55:21,103
Look at him.

1284
00:55:24,143 --> 00:55:25,743
- Oh, dear. - Poor Mu Jin.

1285
00:55:25,883 --> 00:55:27,582
- He was waiting. - Look at him smiling.

1286
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:29,212
- Oh, dear. - Look at his arms.

1287
00:55:29,213 --> 00:55:30,512
He's comforting himself.

1288
00:55:30,513 --> 00:55:32,283
- Oh, dear. - "You're okay now."

1289
00:55:33,323 --> 00:55:34,352
"You're okay."

1290
00:55:34,353 --> 00:55:35,552
(Bon Hee is here.)

1291
00:55:35,553 --> 00:55:37,233
- He's transparent. - He's staring at her.

1292
00:55:37,693 --> 00:55:38,963
Did you cook?

1293
00:55:38,993 --> 00:55:41,063
- We used up everything. - Stir-fried noodles?

1294
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:42,593
Stir-fried noodles and...

1295
00:55:43,063 --> 00:55:44,532
- What should we call it? - Meat.

1296
00:55:44,533 --> 00:55:45,763
Stir-fried meat.

1297
00:55:47,203 --> 00:55:49,273
- How was it? Where did you go? - How was it?

1298
00:55:50,273 --> 00:55:51,972
- We went to a cafe. - Did you eat anything?

1299
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,803
There was a cafe open this late?

1300
00:55:54,273 --> 00:55:56,554
We went to a cafe where you can watch the fire and relax.

1301
00:55:57,273 --> 00:55:59,282
(Impressed)

1302
00:55:59,283 --> 00:56:01,682
- They got us a cake, but we... - He's staring at her eyes.

1303
00:56:01,683 --> 00:56:03,353
(Mu Jin's gaze is fixed on Bon Hee.)

1304
00:56:03,483 --> 00:56:04,582
Do you want to eat something?

1305
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:07,122
- I think she will eat. - But he must be the one starving.

1306
00:56:07,123 --> 00:56:09,252
- Right. Ji Yung must be hungry. - He's an athlete, after all.

1307
00:56:09,253 --> 00:56:10,292
I'm okay.

1308
00:56:10,293 --> 00:56:12,093
- You're not hungry? - I'm okay.

1309
00:56:14,693 --> 00:56:16,193
Let's go watch the dinner show.

1310
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:17,933
- Why? - He's really cool.

1311
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:19,733
(Peeking)

1312
00:56:20,203 --> 00:56:21,332
Hello.

1313
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:22,672
- You must be hungry. - I will cook for you.

1314
00:56:22,673 --> 00:56:23,673
Really?

1315
00:56:23,803 --> 00:56:25,002
- Then... - Sounds great.

1316
00:56:25,003 --> 00:56:26,872
Should we buy some coffee?

1317
00:56:26,873 --> 00:56:28,912
- Here? - Come on.

1318
00:56:28,913 --> 00:56:30,813
(Staring)

1319
00:56:32,343 --> 00:56:37,713
(Mu Jin watches Ji Yung and Bon Hee.)

1320
00:56:38,423 --> 00:56:39,922
- It's been a while since... - Wouldn't they have it?

1321
00:56:39,923 --> 00:56:42,023
- Like this. - Right, like that?

1322
00:56:43,993 --> 00:56:46,193
- Where is he going? - I am going to the bathroom.

1323
00:56:46,723 --> 00:56:47,893
I'm sorry.

1324
00:56:50,263 --> 00:56:53,402
(After seeing the two, Mu Jin leaves.)

1325
00:56:53,403 --> 00:56:54,873
Oh, dear.

1326
00:56:55,773 --> 00:56:57,813
He's not going to the bathroom. He's avoiding them.

1327
00:57:00,243 --> 00:57:01,842
Oh, no. He's sighing.

1328
00:57:01,843 --> 00:57:03,283
(Mu Jin tries to calm his emotions.)

1329
00:57:05,183 --> 00:57:07,682
It's only been two days, but we got really close, didn't we?

1330
00:57:07,683 --> 00:57:09,183
Totally. We did.

1331
00:57:09,653 --> 00:57:10,912
It might be good that you came today.

1332
00:57:10,913 --> 00:57:12,382
- Right. - Is it better?

1333
00:57:12,383 --> 00:57:13,822
It would've been bad if you came tomorrow.

1334
00:57:13,823 --> 00:57:16,622
If you came tomorrow, we would've been much closer.

1335
00:57:16,623 --> 00:57:18,422
- We are... - Are you okay?

1336
00:57:18,423 --> 00:57:19,663
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

1337
00:57:19,823 --> 00:57:20,823
- This... - Did I do it?

1338
00:57:20,824 --> 00:57:22,162
- Be careful. - Did I do it?

1339
00:57:22,163 --> 00:57:23,262
- It turns really easily. - Yes.

1340
00:57:23,263 --> 00:57:24,802
- Sang Won. - Did I do it? Really?

1341
00:57:24,803 --> 00:57:25,803
- No. - Really?

1342
00:57:26,233 --> 00:57:27,503
Do you want this?

1343
00:57:28,303 --> 00:57:30,003
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

1344
00:57:30,433 --> 00:57:31,943
- You... - Come on up.

1345
00:57:33,003 --> 00:57:34,402
- There you go. - Sang Won.

1346
00:57:34,403 --> 00:57:35,473
I'm sorry.

1347
00:57:36,073 --> 00:57:38,083
Let's push it back.

1348
00:57:38,813 --> 00:57:40,643
Mu Jin is back.

1349
00:57:41,183 --> 00:57:43,352
- I will sit here. - He's sitting next to her.

1350
00:57:43,353 --> 00:57:44,983
(He sits on the sofa next to Bon Hee.)

1351
00:57:45,123 --> 00:57:46,283
(Peeking)

1352
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,563
(He stares at the phone for no reason.)

1353
00:57:53,923 --> 00:57:54,932
(Peeking)

1354
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:56,593
- Are you taking a selfie? - No.

1355
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:00,002
- Why are you sitting there? - What?

1356
00:58:00,003 --> 00:58:01,263
Why are you sitting there?

1357
00:58:01,473 --> 00:58:03,473
- Should I come down? - Yes.

1358
00:58:05,603 --> 00:58:07,172
(Mu Jin listens to Bon Hee and sits next to her.)

1359
00:58:07,173 --> 00:58:09,213
He's hilarious.

1360
00:58:10,273 --> 00:58:11,583
Goodness.

1361
00:58:12,543 --> 00:58:15,252
I think Mu Jin is trying to show her...

1362
00:58:15,253 --> 00:58:18,152
that he's gone sulky.

1363
00:58:18,153 --> 00:58:20,152
- When he just sits down, - He's gone sulky.

1364
00:58:20,153 --> 00:58:21,822
- she wouldn't notice it. - So he kept doing this.

1365
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,929
- That's why he made it noticeable. - "I've gone sulky."

1366
00:58:23,953 --> 00:58:25,363
I think Mu Jin...

1367
00:58:26,193 --> 00:58:27,693
is very quick-witted.

1368
00:58:27,893 --> 00:58:28,933
What makes you say that?

1369
00:58:29,233 --> 00:58:32,703
He decided to leave the place quickly.

1370
00:58:33,003 --> 00:58:34,502
- That he got up? - It means...

1371
00:58:34,503 --> 00:58:37,402
he is wise enough to control...

1372
00:58:37,403 --> 00:58:39,303
his emotions.

1373
00:58:39,903 --> 00:58:42,713
He had to leave to change the air.

1374
00:58:43,143 --> 00:58:45,012
So he left the place,

1375
00:58:45,013 --> 00:58:47,843
calmed his emotions, and returned.

1376
00:58:48,013 --> 00:58:50,083
If I were him, I would sit there...

1377
00:58:50,753 --> 00:58:53,753
- "What do I do?" - and just watch everything.

1378
00:58:55,223 --> 00:58:56,692
"Let's see how this unfolds."

1379
00:58:56,693 --> 00:58:58,462
(Anxious, nervous)

1380
00:58:58,463 --> 00:58:59,823
I will just keep drinking.

1381
00:59:00,663 --> 00:59:02,863
- And end up drunk. - I hate that.

1382
00:59:03,493 --> 00:59:05,532
- If he's someone I'm into, - I know.

1383
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:06,962
I would hate it.

1384
00:59:06,963 --> 00:59:10,003
"From what I've observed..."

1385
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:12,542
After hearing what you said...

1386
00:59:12,543 --> 00:59:14,303
- Is he amazing? - Yes. Mu Jin handled it...

1387
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:17,942
very professionally.

1388
00:59:17,943 --> 00:59:19,282
- Right. - Is he a professional now?

1389
00:59:19,283 --> 00:59:21,713
- He's a professional. - He's skilful.

1390
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,313
The way he handled it.

1391
00:59:23,683 --> 00:59:24,753
It was so good.

1392
00:59:27,783 --> 00:59:29,823
It was really impressive when I had the first bite.

1393
00:59:30,093 --> 00:59:31,122
It was so good.

1394
00:59:31,123 --> 00:59:32,792
(Love QR messages are sent. Check the younger men's hearts.)

1395
00:59:32,793 --> 00:59:34,199
It's the men's choice now, isn't it?

1396
00:59:34,223 --> 00:59:35,932
- Today, - It's the men this time.

1397
00:59:35,933 --> 00:59:37,893
- they get to find out. - It will be so much fun.

1398
00:59:39,633 --> 00:59:42,002
(Today, the ladies get to check...)

1399
00:59:42,003 --> 00:59:47,173
(how the younger men feel about them.)

1400
00:59:47,273 --> 00:59:51,173
(Who captured the hearts of the younger men?)

1401
00:59:56,983 --> 01:00:00,653
(Ye Eun came first to check the Love QR message.)

1402
01:00:01,623 --> 01:00:04,823
(Did Ye Eun receive any Love QR message?)

1403
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,663
After going on a date with Sang Won,

1404
01:00:10,793 --> 01:00:14,533
I felt like getting to know him more.

1405
01:00:16,473 --> 01:00:18,773
(How many people do you want to get to know more?)

1406
01:00:21,643 --> 01:00:24,842
(Sang Won wanted to get to know one more woman.)

1407
01:00:24,843 --> 01:00:25,943
(And that made Ye Eun sad.)

1408
01:00:26,213 --> 01:00:28,813
- That made the mood turn bad. - Yes, she had a bitter smile.

1409
01:00:29,313 --> 01:00:32,983
(But Sang Won approached her again.)

1410
01:00:34,523 --> 01:00:38,493
(And their relationship improved.)

1411
01:00:39,263 --> 01:00:42,493
(Did Sang Won send Ye Eun a Love QR message?)

1412
01:00:42,933 --> 01:00:44,063
Did he?

1413
01:00:45,663 --> 01:00:48,933
(You have received no Love QR message.)

1414
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:50,803
What?

1415
01:00:51,573 --> 01:00:52,602
Sang Won!

1416
01:00:52,603 --> 01:00:53,702
(Don't do this!)

1417
01:00:53,703 --> 01:00:55,343
But why?

1418
01:00:55,873 --> 01:00:57,012
What is this?

1419
01:00:57,013 --> 01:00:58,113
(But why?)

1420
01:01:05,883 --> 01:01:08,793
After checking the Love QR Code,

1421
01:01:11,193 --> 01:01:12,562
it got me thinking a lot.

1422
01:01:12,563 --> 01:01:15,993
(It got me thinking a lot.)

1423
01:01:17,963 --> 01:01:19,303
There's that too.

1424
01:01:19,863 --> 01:01:21,463
But everyone is super nice.

1425
01:01:21,903 --> 01:01:23,273
I don't feel so good.

1426
01:01:23,673 --> 01:01:25,473
I'm sure.

1427
01:01:25,943 --> 01:01:28,002
Her first date, Sang Hyeon is gone,

1428
01:01:28,003 --> 01:01:29,942
- Right. - and Sang Won, her second date,

1429
01:01:29,943 --> 01:01:31,472
is also gone.

1430
01:01:31,473 --> 01:01:32,843
(Throwing)

1431
01:01:39,623 --> 01:01:41,282
(On the second day, Ye Eun didn't receive...)

1432
01:01:41,283 --> 01:01:45,723
(any Love QR message.)

1433
01:01:46,993 --> 01:01:48,963
I'm hurt.

1434
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,993
Did we expect too much from Sang Won?

1435
01:01:51,363 --> 01:01:53,002
Looking back, Sang Won...

1436
01:01:53,003 --> 01:01:56,273
never approached Ye Eun...

1437
01:01:56,473 --> 01:01:58,373
that aggressively.

1438
01:01:58,543 --> 01:02:00,402
- He asked her out on a date. - He asked her out on a date.

1439
01:02:00,403 --> 01:02:01,642
Isn't that being aggressive?

1440
01:02:01,643 --> 01:02:03,073
- Asking her out on a date? - Yes.

1441
01:02:03,543 --> 01:02:05,712
- You wouldn't just date anyone. - Five-Minute Time Attack Date.

1442
01:02:05,713 --> 01:02:07,512
- Right. - Okay.

1443
01:02:07,513 --> 01:02:08,982
He was all touchy too.

1444
01:02:08,983 --> 01:02:10,112
- Okay? - Okay?

1445
01:02:10,113 --> 01:02:11,599
(Okay! Let's say he appraoched her aggressively.)

1446
01:02:11,623 --> 01:02:14,052
- I'm sad. They went on a date too. - I think this is the reason...

1447
01:02:14,053 --> 01:02:15,329
why you feel offended by Sang Won.

1448
01:02:15,353 --> 01:02:18,293
Sang Won tried hard from time to time...

1449
01:02:18,763 --> 01:02:20,523
to make Ye Eun feel better.

1450
01:02:20,923 --> 01:02:22,662
- Right. - But that was...

1451
01:02:22,663 --> 01:02:24,662
just Sang Won being considerate,

1452
01:02:24,663 --> 01:02:28,572
being a nice person he is.

1453
01:02:28,573 --> 01:02:31,202
Shouldn't he have sent the message if he was considerate?

1454
01:02:31,203 --> 01:02:32,542
- No, he shouldn't. - He shouldn't.

1455
01:02:32,543 --> 01:02:35,072
Being considerate of her doesn't mean he loves her.

1456
01:02:35,073 --> 01:02:36,512
If he's considerate, he shouldn't send her a message.

1457
01:02:36,513 --> 01:02:37,773
Why did he not send it?

1458
01:02:40,643 --> 01:02:43,012
(Ji Won is the second visitor.)

1459
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:44,013
Goodness.

1460
01:02:48,183 --> 01:02:54,093
(She nervously checks Love QR Code for the first time.)

1461
01:02:56,963 --> 01:02:58,063
What is it?

1462
01:03:03,803 --> 01:03:07,703
(You have received no Love QR message.)

1463
01:03:09,073 --> 01:03:13,283
(She scans the Love QR Code once again to make sure.)

1464
01:03:16,953 --> 01:03:18,652
(But the result doesn't change.)

1465
01:03:18,653 --> 01:03:21,253
Oh, dear. That's sad.

1466
01:03:22,153 --> 01:03:25,362
It made me wonder if I was not appealing to them...

1467
01:03:25,363 --> 01:03:26,663
as a woman.

1468
01:03:27,093 --> 01:03:30,193
I think they just see me as someone fun.

1469
01:03:30,793 --> 01:03:32,102
Since I'm already here,

1470
01:03:32,103 --> 01:03:35,432
I should change. That's what I thought.

1471
01:03:35,433 --> 01:03:37,472
- No. - She can think that.

1472
01:03:37,473 --> 01:03:38,903
That's understandable.

1473
01:03:39,343 --> 01:03:41,572
(On the second day, )

1474
01:03:41,573 --> 01:03:44,713
(Ji Won and Ye Eun didn't receive a Love QR message.)

1475
01:03:48,713 --> 01:03:50,113
(Surprised)

1476
01:03:52,553 --> 01:03:55,423
(Bon Hee heads to her Love QR Code.)

1477
01:03:56,823 --> 01:03:58,423
(Taking breath)

1478
01:04:00,063 --> 01:04:04,793
(Is there any Love QR message for Bon Hee?)

1479
01:04:07,933 --> 01:04:09,303
(Surprised)

1480
01:04:09,733 --> 01:04:10,590
(Did Bon Hee receive a Love QR message?)

1481
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:15,448
(Is there any Love QR message for Bon Hee?)

1482
01:04:18,548 --> 01:04:19,918
(Surprised)

1483
01:04:20,348 --> 01:04:23,848
(Did Bon Hee receive a Love QR message?)

1484
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:27,288
(You have received four Love QR message.)

1485
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:28,857
- No way. - Four people?

1486
01:04:28,858 --> 01:04:30,087
(4 people sent Bon Hee a Love QR message?)

1487
01:04:30,088 --> 01:04:31,088
(What is happening?)

1488
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,598
That's terrible.

1489
01:04:33,198 --> 01:04:34,227
(Four younger men have chosen Bon Hee.)

1490
01:04:34,228 --> 01:04:35,628
She must feel flustered.

1491
01:04:37,698 --> 01:04:40,038
I felt happy,

1492
01:04:40,398 --> 01:04:41,918
and at the same time, I felt confused.

1493
01:04:44,578 --> 01:04:48,348
(Who are the 4 younger men that sent her the messages?)

1494
01:04:49,808 --> 01:04:53,118
(What about the last one, Yeong Gyeong's Love QR Code?)

1495
01:04:54,618 --> 01:04:57,217
(You have received one Love QR message.)

1496
01:04:57,218 --> 01:05:00,288
We think it must be from Hyeon Jun.

1497
01:05:00,658 --> 01:05:02,457
That's our guess.

1498
01:05:02,458 --> 01:05:03,857
- It might be someone else. - Yes.

1499
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,527
(I want to listen to good music with you.)

1500
01:05:05,528 --> 01:05:06,658
Music?

1501
01:05:07,428 --> 01:05:12,338
(On their way to the date, they talked about music.)

1502
01:05:13,198 --> 01:05:16,138
(I listen to music a lot at home too.)

1503
01:05:17,508 --> 01:05:19,677
She seemed to like listening to music.

1504
01:05:19,678 --> 01:05:21,778
So I said I wanted to listen to good music with her.

1505
01:05:21,878 --> 01:05:24,077
It was Hyeon Jun after all.

1506
01:05:24,078 --> 01:05:25,318
(Hyeon Jun chose Yeong Gyeong.)

1507
01:05:27,448 --> 01:05:29,948
(Love QR Zone on the second day is closed.)

1508
01:05:30,948 --> 01:05:34,788
(After the Love QR event, they gathered again.)

1509
01:05:35,788 --> 01:05:38,957
(Bon Hee, who received 4 messages, returns.)

1510
01:05:38,958 --> 01:05:41,427
Oh, dear. Now, all the younger men...

1511
01:05:41,428 --> 01:05:42,798
will seem different to her.

1512
01:05:43,298 --> 01:05:44,298
I'm sure.

1513
01:05:44,299 --> 01:05:45,468
(Peeking)

1514
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:53,478
(She received messages from Mu Jin, Ji Yung, Sang Won, and Sang Hyeon.)

1515
01:05:54,808 --> 01:05:56,977
I expected two people.

1516
01:05:56,978 --> 01:05:58,878
Ji Yung and...

1517
01:05:59,248 --> 01:06:02,088
I thought Mu Jin would've chosen me too.

1518
01:06:02,688 --> 01:06:06,187
(Let's go eat pizza next time!)

1519
01:06:06,188 --> 01:06:07,758
I want to eat pizza too.

1520
01:06:08,288 --> 01:06:09,988
What if you eat pizza with someone else?

1521
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:11,657
(Gosh.)

1522
01:06:11,658 --> 01:06:13,058
It wouldn't taste so good.

1523
01:06:13,758 --> 01:06:14,928
I mean it.

1524
01:06:15,368 --> 01:06:16,667
He's so cute.

1525
01:06:16,668 --> 01:06:18,337
He expresses his affection without hesitation.

1526
01:06:18,338 --> 01:06:20,997
(Take a photo for me next time!)

1527
01:06:20,998 --> 01:06:24,038
(Ji Yung is the second person who sent the message.)

1528
01:06:24,508 --> 01:06:26,138
(I like a man who likes linen.)

1529
01:06:26,878 --> 01:06:28,378
(When I choose what to wear, )

1530
01:06:28,448 --> 01:06:30,647
(I choose linen clothes very often.)

1531
01:06:30,648 --> 01:06:32,078
- So cute. - Oh, really?

1532
01:06:32,918 --> 01:06:36,387
When we talked, I realized that she is a great person.

1533
01:06:36,388 --> 01:06:37,918
I had a lot of fun today.

1534
01:06:38,488 --> 01:06:39,688
That's why I chose her.

1535
01:06:41,858 --> 01:06:43,457
The other two have never...

1536
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,258
given me any signs.

1537
01:06:46,098 --> 01:06:52,138
(For the first time, she realized how the two feel.)

1538
01:06:53,068 --> 01:06:59,037
(The one who sent the third message)

1539
01:06:59,038 --> 01:07:01,577
(Sang Hyeon)

1540
01:07:01,578 --> 01:07:03,948
I think I like Bon Hee.

1541
01:07:04,348 --> 01:07:05,477
I liked her first impression.

1542
01:07:05,478 --> 01:07:06,678
He thinks he likes Bon Hee.

1543
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:11,588
(Since the first time they met, Sang Hyeon's heart grew.)

1544
01:07:11,758 --> 01:07:13,418
(Bong Hee?)

1545
01:07:13,618 --> 01:07:16,428
- Bon Hee. - Bon Hee.

1546
01:07:17,228 --> 01:07:21,328
(The first time they met, he felt nervous.)

1547
01:07:22,068 --> 01:07:24,267
(And naturally, )

1548
01:07:24,268 --> 01:07:27,338
(his eyes followed Bon Hee.)

1549
01:07:28,238 --> 01:07:30,238
You have something in your hair. Can I get it off?

1550
01:07:30,768 --> 01:07:31,838
What is it?

1551
01:07:34,308 --> 01:07:36,178
Who did you choose?

1552
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:37,778
Bon Hee.

1553
01:07:38,718 --> 01:07:43,348
(Because of a moment's hesitation, he missed the chance to date her.)

1554
01:07:44,048 --> 01:07:47,658
Who else do you want to talk to?

1555
01:07:51,128 --> 01:07:52,157
Bon Hee.

1556
01:07:52,158 --> 01:07:55,568
(In front of another person, he revealed his true feelings.)

1557
01:07:55,868 --> 01:07:59,668
Mu Jin is the only one I showed my feelings to.

1558
01:07:59,738 --> 01:08:01,268
When we were alone,

1559
01:08:01,408 --> 01:08:03,308
I asked him how Bon Hee was.

1560
01:08:03,608 --> 01:08:05,578
I wanted to find out any information about her.

1561
01:08:08,608 --> 01:08:10,578
(How was it with Bon Hee?)

1562
01:08:11,418 --> 01:08:14,888
(He couldn't stop being curious about the date with Bon Hee.)

1563
01:08:16,248 --> 01:08:18,458
I will do it at my pace.

1564
01:08:19,258 --> 01:08:20,258
Goodness.

1565
01:08:20,259 --> 01:08:22,899
(Sang Hyeon expressed his feelings to Bon Hee for the first time.)

1566
01:08:22,928 --> 01:08:23,928
(The person who sent the fourth message...)

1567
01:08:23,929 --> 01:08:25,298
"Let's take a photo together."

1568
01:08:27,558 --> 01:08:31,398
(is Sang Won.)

1569
01:08:31,968 --> 01:08:34,298
I never had a chance to talk to Bon Hee.

1570
01:08:35,768 --> 01:08:37,938
I am curious to learn about who Bon Hee is.

1571
01:08:39,278 --> 01:08:43,407
That's why I sent the message to Bon Hee today.

1572
01:08:43,408 --> 01:08:45,454
(The other person Sang Won wanted to get to know was Bon Hee.)

1573
01:08:45,478 --> 01:08:46,717
What will they do?

1574
01:08:46,718 --> 01:08:49,688
(Sang Won's Love QR message was for Bon Hee, not Ye Eun.)

1575
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:51,687
(The second night deepens, )

1576
01:08:51,688 --> 01:08:53,357
The emotions are running wild.

1577
01:08:53,358 --> 01:08:55,028
(with emotions running wild.)

1578
01:08:55,258 --> 01:08:57,127
Beer. Do you have beer?

1579
01:08:57,128 --> 01:08:58,798
- We have beer. - We have beer.

1580
01:08:58,898 --> 01:09:00,527
- Because you mentioned it... - Yes.

1581
01:09:00,528 --> 01:09:03,928
Because I don't drink, I don't know when to pour.

1582
01:09:04,528 --> 01:09:06,167
You shouldn't mind it.

1583
01:09:06,168 --> 01:09:07,497
(Handing it to her)

1584
01:09:07,498 --> 01:09:08,537
You want me to pour it?

1585
01:09:08,538 --> 01:09:09,768
(Nodding)

1586
01:09:10,368 --> 01:09:12,307
What's the ratio? What are you drinking?

1587
01:09:12,308 --> 01:09:14,484
(Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon express their feelings differently.)

1588
01:09:14,508 --> 01:09:15,808
I don't really know.

1589
01:09:17,578 --> 01:09:19,378
- Things change so quickly. - Are you hungry?

1590
01:09:20,218 --> 01:09:22,178
I'm constantly eating, but I'm constantly hungry.

1591
01:09:22,888 --> 01:09:24,088
You will regret it tomorrow.

1592
01:09:24,718 --> 01:09:26,394
- Why? - You will regret it in the morning.

1593
01:09:26,418 --> 01:09:27,734
- Because my face will swell? - Yes.

1594
01:09:27,758 --> 01:09:29,158
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1595
01:09:29,188 --> 01:09:30,358
It's okay.

1596
01:09:30,488 --> 01:09:32,258
It bothers me so much.

1597
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,667
Your face isn't swollen at all.

1598
01:09:36,668 --> 01:09:37,727
- It's okay now, - In the morning?

1599
01:09:37,728 --> 01:09:38,837
But tomorrow...

1600
01:09:38,838 --> 01:09:42,208
If you need, I will apply shading on your face.

1601
01:09:43,168 --> 01:09:45,278
- You will do it for me? - I will do it for you.

1602
01:09:45,508 --> 01:09:46,707
- You will? - The makeup.

1603
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:48,007
- Then your face will look... - Really?

1604
01:09:48,008 --> 01:09:49,307
Sharper on screen.

1605
01:09:49,308 --> 01:09:51,448
Right. It makes a huge difference.

1606
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:54,777
Can you do that for me?

1607
01:09:54,778 --> 01:09:56,347
If you come at the end and ask to contour your face,

1608
01:09:56,348 --> 01:09:57,548
I'll do it for you.

1609
01:09:58,258 --> 01:10:00,258
"Please apply shading on my face."

1610
01:10:00,288 --> 01:10:01,487
I will do it here in the living room.

1611
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:02,968
(Even a little joke makes him smile.)

1612
01:10:03,428 --> 01:10:06,557
(The other 3 younger men are after Bon Hee too.)

1613
01:10:06,558 --> 01:10:08,427
- Oh, dear. - There's tension.

1614
01:10:08,428 --> 01:10:10,498
Four men are going after one woman.

1615
01:10:11,998 --> 01:10:15,107
- Oh, dear. - What's going to happen?

1616
01:10:15,108 --> 01:10:16,908
(How will today's Love QR Code stir them up?)

1617
01:10:17,808 --> 01:10:22,978
(Sang Hyeon returns to his room after the drinking is over.)

1618
01:10:23,908 --> 01:10:25,117
(He's lost in thought.)

1619
01:10:25,118 --> 01:10:26,798
- What did he think about? - I wonder too.

1620
01:10:27,218 --> 01:10:28,388
What is it?

1621
01:10:30,788 --> 01:10:32,518
(Sighing)

1622
01:10:38,558 --> 01:10:41,428
(He checks his face all of a sudden.)

1623
01:10:43,798 --> 01:10:48,668
(Sang Hyeon heads somewhere.)

1624
01:10:50,008 --> 01:10:53,338
(Did he go to the women's floor?)

1625
01:10:53,608 --> 01:10:55,848
(She finds Sang Hyeon.)

1626
01:10:55,908 --> 01:10:57,677
- It's over, though. - Sorry?

1627
01:10:57,678 --> 01:10:59,548
- It's over. - What is?

1628
01:10:59,978 --> 01:11:01,547
We cleaned up.

1629
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:03,918
No, I just want to talk to Bon Hee.

1630
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:06,834
- Do you want me to get her? - Yes, please.

1631
01:11:06,858 --> 01:11:08,927
Can you wait a little?

1632
01:11:08,928 --> 01:11:10,287
Can you tell her that I will be on the first floor?

1633
01:11:10,288 --> 01:11:11,628
The first floor? Okay.

1634
01:11:13,528 --> 01:11:16,867
He wants to spend time with her...

1635
01:11:16,868 --> 01:11:18,997
when nobody else is around, so he mustered up his courage.

1636
01:11:18,998 --> 01:11:21,968
I think he's amazing.

1637
01:11:22,338 --> 01:11:25,508
I hope Sang Hyeon would express his feelings.

1638
01:11:25,608 --> 01:11:26,837
I hope so too.

1639
01:11:26,838 --> 01:11:29,477
I think he's going to be quite aggressive this time.

1640
01:11:29,478 --> 01:11:30,907
Will he tell her that he has feelings for her?

1641
01:11:30,908 --> 01:11:33,247
"Can you go on a date with me tomorrow?"

1642
01:11:33,248 --> 01:11:34,317
- Right. - Yes.

1643
01:11:34,318 --> 01:11:37,217
I think he will get a chance only if he's aggressive.

1644
01:11:37,218 --> 01:11:38,658
I think he has to go the extra mile.

1645
01:11:39,418 --> 01:11:40,887
Can you tell her that I will be on the first floor?

1646
01:11:40,888 --> 01:11:42,258
The first floor? Okay.

1647
01:11:44,588 --> 01:11:50,128
(For the first time, Sang Hyeon asked Bon Hee to talk.)

1648
01:11:50,998 --> 01:11:53,038
I should express my feelings even if it's subtle.

1649
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:55,138
Whatever happens,

1650
01:11:57,408 --> 01:12:00,208
I thought I should talk to her. So I went to her...

1651
01:12:01,038 --> 01:12:02,077
and talked to her.

1652
01:12:02,078 --> 01:12:04,448
(Finally, Sang Hyeon starts to move.)

1653
01:12:04,678 --> 01:12:07,777
Sang Hyeon is waiting for you on the first floor.

1654
01:12:07,778 --> 01:12:09,818
- Sang Hyeon? - He's waiting.

1655
01:12:09,988 --> 01:12:11,347
- On the first floor? - Yes.

1656
01:12:11,348 --> 01:12:12,418
Okay.

1657
01:12:16,128 --> 01:12:17,328
Sang Hyeon?

1658
01:12:35,478 --> 01:12:36,548
(Surprised)

1659
01:12:38,048 --> 01:12:40,148
- Where do you want to go? - I...

1660
01:12:40,918 --> 01:12:42,648
- Outside? - Outside?

1661
01:12:42,818 --> 01:12:44,648
- I don't think it's too hot. - Right.

1662
01:12:45,858 --> 01:12:49,528
(Sang Hyeon and Bon Hee sit on the terrace.)

1663
01:12:50,858 --> 01:12:53,258
(Thinking)

1664
01:12:53,798 --> 01:12:55,428
(Laughing)

1665
01:12:55,528 --> 01:12:56,928
- What's wrong? - Nothing.

1666
01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:01,398
- I wanted to talk to you. - Right.

1667
01:13:01,468 --> 01:13:02,608
I am...

1668
01:13:03,668 --> 01:13:06,478
not the type to talk in front of everyone.

1669
01:13:06,808 --> 01:13:09,608
I felt sorry about it, so I asked you to talk in private.

1670
01:13:10,848 --> 01:13:13,147
(Do you know how INFPs flirt?)

1671
01:13:13,148 --> 01:13:14,148
How?

1672
01:13:14,678 --> 01:13:16,287
(Dressing up nicely and lingering around that person)

1673
01:13:16,288 --> 01:13:17,887
I'm sure he thought he couldn't do this anymore.

1674
01:13:17,888 --> 01:13:20,858
(Sang Hyeon confessed his hidden feelings.)

1675
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:25,658
(I was really grateful that he worked up his courage like that.)

1676
01:13:27,828 --> 01:13:30,548
(Will Sang Hyeon's sincerity be enough to shake up Bon Hee's heart?)

1677
01:13:30,898 --> 01:13:32,798
(Do we each choose a bag?)

1678
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:37,308
(They must choose a date partner based on the items in the bags.)

1679
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:43,308
(A subtle battle of wits for the women to find their desired dates)

1680
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:46,618
(Today's fate was decided simply based on a bag.)

1681
01:13:47,118 --> 01:13:49,248
(The older women wait for the owner of the bag.)

1682
01:13:49,418 --> 01:13:50,688
(Did you know it was me?)

1683
01:13:51,118 --> 01:13:53,458
(I've been wanting to talk to you too.)

1684
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:57,088
(Who will be the older women's date partners?)

1685
01:13:58,428 --> 01:14:00,257
(A new heart-fluttering feeling...)

1686
01:14:00,258 --> 01:14:03,428
(connected by the random dates)

1687
01:14:06,298 --> 01:14:09,337
(And the connection beyond their imaginations...)

1688
01:14:09,338 --> 01:14:11,978
(that they tried to hide)

1689
01:14:12,178 --> 01:14:14,308
(I knew him before.)

1690
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:18,277
(What is the connection between Ji Won and the younger guy...)

1691
01:14:18,278 --> 01:14:21,518
(that shocked everyone?)
