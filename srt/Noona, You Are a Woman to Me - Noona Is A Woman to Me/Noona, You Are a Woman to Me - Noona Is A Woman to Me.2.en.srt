1
00:00:00,609 --> 00:00:05,989
(4 older women looking to fall in love again)

2
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:07,748
(Drive over to pick up...)

3
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:10,619
(the younger men waiting for older women.)

4
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:13,729
(Hi.)

5
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:16,059
(Nice to meet you.)

6
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:17,629
(May I ask what your name is?)

7
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:19,129
(It's Park Ye Eun.)

8
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:21,999
(You're a real beauty.)

9
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:24,368
(Their first encounter...)

10
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:26,269
(was like a movie scene.)

11
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:29,439
(The older women and younger men's first night)

12
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,008
(I can drink...)

13
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:32,678
(one glass of a soju-beer cocktail.)

14
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,009
(Laughing)

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,218
(Amid the happy atmosphere, )

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,989
(their eyes meet.)

17
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:42,619
(Glancing)

18
00:00:43,819 --> 00:00:47,129
(You have something in your hair. Can I get it off?)

19
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:50,729
(It was bothering me.)

20
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:54,869
(A strange tension lingered on their first night.)

21
00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:58,369
(The older women received a text message.)

22
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:00,238
(Send a Love QR Code...)

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,439
(to the person you're interested in within 15 minutes.)

24
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:04,908
(The older women send...)

25
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:07,208
(their Love QR Codes to the younger men.)

26
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:11,749
(The younger men scan the codes to see the older women's feelings.)

27
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:14,188
(Mu Jin...)

28
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:17,558
(received QR Codes from two older women.)

29
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:19,599
(Mu Jin gains a benefit for being chosen the most.)

30
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:22,658
(Secret Room)

31
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:25,298
(Open the drawer and guess the age of the person you're interested in.)

32
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:27,568
(Secret Room: A space where they can guess the other person's age)

33
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:29,598
Whether it will be a blessing or a curse.

34
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,809
(Which older woman's age does he want to know the most?)

35
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,709
After the first episode,

36
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:41,749
Seul Hye got herself a nickname.

37
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:43,618
- Already? - Yes.

38
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:44,849
(I did?)

39
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:46,649
Isn't it Mu Jin's Mom?

40
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:48,219
It's Hwang Yes Seul Hye.

41
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:51,119
That's right. She's head over heels for Mr. Yes.

42
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,288
(Do you sleep well even after coffee?)

43
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:57,459
(Yes.)

44
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,828
As things developed at lightning speed,

45
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,898
many viewers must've gotten totally absorbed.

46
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:03,899
For sure.

47
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,138
The Secret Room opened.

48
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:07,238
- It did. - So...

49
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,538
don't you want to know whose drawer...

50
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,978
- Mu Jin opened? - For real.

51
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,008
Didn't the episode end right before that?

52
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:13,849
- Yes. - That was mean.

53
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:21,849
(Kim Mu Jin gains the Love Benefit for receiving 2 Love QR Codes.)

54
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:25,088
(Check out the information of the person...)

55
00:02:25,089 --> 00:02:27,328
(you're curious about in the Secret Room.)

56
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:33,369
(Mu Jin checks out the Secret Room for the first time.)

57
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:36,368
(Open the drawer and guess the age of the person you're interested in.)

58
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:37,598
(What you find out is a secret.)

59
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,069
What could the hint be?

60
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:45,139
(Whose age does Mu Jin want to know?)

61
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:53,788
(Choosing without hesitation)

62
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:55,219
He didn't think for long.

63
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:57,288
(Bon Hee)

64
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:59,388
(It's Bon Hee's drawer.)

65
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:01,159
- It's Bon Hee. - I see.

66
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:03,259
I knew it.

67
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:05,429
It's a duffle coat.

68
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:09,099
Is that photo from when she was a student?

69
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:10,839
Hold on. Duffle coat means...

70
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:13,739
we're not that far apart age-wise.

71
00:03:17,179 --> 00:03:18,879
I just wanted to know about Bon Hee.

72
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:23,219
I'm not that curious about the others.

73
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:32,689
(He looks at Bon Hee's photo closely.)

74
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,459
I have really good eyesight.

75
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:39,359
But the photo was blurry.

76
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:41,910
I stared at it because the numbers were hard to make out.

77
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,169
Numbers? There must be some on it.

78
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,809
The numbers on the photo were hard to read.

79
00:03:48,809 --> 00:03:50,179
But it was 2004.

80
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:52,009
The year?

81
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:55,048
The date was left so he could know when it was taken.

82
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:56,519
(Bon Hee's photo was taken in 2004.)

83
00:03:57,179 --> 00:04:00,119
(Looking closely)

84
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:07,729
(What's the age gap between Bon Hee and Mu Jin?)

85
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:11,229
It seems like we are more than five years apart.

86
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:14,768
(Thinking)

87
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:16,669
(Smiling)

88
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:26,749
(Mu Jin leaves the Secret Room with a mysterious smile.)

89
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:28,908
He said they were at least five years apart.

90
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:31,379
I don't know what it is,

91
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:34,449
but her bangs.

92
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,359
They give off...

93
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:39,529
a really old vibe.

94
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:42,759
I don't know what it is, okay? I'm sorry, Bon Hee.

95
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:46,229
From what I can see, she's in high school.

96
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,828
She seems to be in tenth grade.

97
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:51,498
Me too. It looks like a photo from middle or high school.

98
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,568
- Really? - Yes.

99
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:54,808
Since Mu Jin said they were at least...

100
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:56,579
five years apart,

101
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,579
if I were to make a wild guess,

102
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:01,478
Bon Hee would have been born in the late 1980s...

103
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,719
and Mu Jin in the early 1990s.

104
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:06,549
I think Mu Jin is in his 20s.

105
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,888
Judging solely by his face,

106
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:10,989
I thought Mu Jin was in his 20s.

107
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,558
But saying they're at least five years apart...

108
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:15,959
after looking at the photo suggests...

109
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:18,599
- he's nearly in his 30s? - No.

110
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:20,728
If that were the case,

111
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:24,599
Mu Jin might be seeing Bon Hee much younger than we think.

112
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,339
I doubt Mu Jin analyzed the photo properly.

113
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:30,709
- I agree with you. - He made a bad analysis.

114
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,178
He doesn't get the photo.

115
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:33,509
- That's possible. - Right?

116
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:41,188
It's the morning of the next day.

117
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:42,189
It's Day Two.

118
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:47,528
(The first to wake up is...)

119
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:50,899
(Sang Hyeon.)

120
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,569
(Spatula)

121
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:56,738
(Cleaning with an alcohol swab)

122
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:58,139
- What is he doing? - What is that?

123
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,169
(Lightly)

124
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:06,038
(Using his finger as a palette, )

125
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:08,309
(he spreads it with effort.)

126
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:11,149
(Getting up)

127
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:13,148
My gosh.

128
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:14,149
(Putting on makeup in earnest)

129
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,319
He's using a spatula?

130
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,018
Is he a makeup artist?

131
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:18,688
(A reasonable question)

132
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:19,829
(Amazed)

133
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:21,188
Do you use that too, Seul Hye?

134
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,959
No, not even my makeup artist does.

135
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,869
(The Golden Retriever takes great care of himself.)

136
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,039
(Sang Hyeon is grooming himself before meeting the older women.)

137
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:37,708
(The other younger men do too.)

138
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:39,078
They sure are different.

139
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,079
Right?

140
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,909
- Everyone does their own hair. - For real.

141
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:44,978
That's a pretty rare sight...

142
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,719
- from my point of view. - Why?

143
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,718
I have quite a few guy friends...

144
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:51,089
who wear makeup.

145
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,119
- Right? - Yes.

146
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,788
- These days, grooming... - Yes.

147
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,259
Has become the norm.

148
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:56,859
Exactly.

149
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,558
(9am, 1st floor common area)

150
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:03,139
(Sang Hyeon comes downstairs first after getting ready.)

151
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:07,439
(Looking around)

152
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,239
(Glancing)

153
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,319
(Glancing)

154
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:18,848
He's looking for someone.

155
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:20,289
(Sang Hyeon is looking for someone.)

156
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:22,648
What do you have for breakfast?

157
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,258
(Last night)

158
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:25,319
I have Greek yogurt.

159
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:26,659
(Listening)

160
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,159
I love Greek yogurt too.

161
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:31,259
- I'll make it for breakfast. - Sounds good.

162
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:34,998
I'll slice some fruit in.

163
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:38,599
(He recalls the breakfast promise.)

164
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:42,839
(However, no one is on the 1st floor.)

165
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:44,838
(In front of the older women's room)

166
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,309
(Knocking)

167
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:49,819
Oh, my.

168
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:52,648
- Are they sleeping? - None of the older women are up?

169
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:54,649
(The older women are still asleep.)

170
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:59,289
(Disappointed)

171
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:02,688
Sang Hyeon is like,

172
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:05,758
"But you promised to make yogurt for breakfast. Where are you?"

173
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,898
Isn't he just a puppy?

174
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:08,799
(A sulking puppy actually exists.)

175
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:13,938
(Eating a banana instead of Greek yogurt by himself)

176
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:15,239
- Are you alone? - Yes.

177
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,679
(Sulking)

178
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,978
Are they all sleeping?

179
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:23,519
(Looking around)

180
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,249
There are bananas. Have some.

181
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:29,819
No rush.

182
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:37,729
Did you go to the rooftop yesterday?

183
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:40,069
The rooftop? Yes.

184
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,629
- Did you see it? - I did.

185
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:44,769
What did you think?

186
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,878
(0 votes, 1 vote)

187
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,679
It got me thinking a lot.

188
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,079
Right.

189
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:58,319
(It also got Sang Won thinking a lot.)

190
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,249
I bet one guy got all the votes.

191
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:06,189
Is it Mu Jin or Hyeon Jun?

192
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:10,929
(Suddenly laughing)

193
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:23,908
(10am, Yeong Gyeong gets up.)

194
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:25,909
(Stretching)

195
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,779
(A sip of water)

196
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:33,689
The older women have their own morning routines.

197
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:36,659
(Touching the flower)

198
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:41,389
(Greeting her comfort doll)

199
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:43,998
She's lighting a scented candle.

200
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,929
(Aromatherapy candle)

201
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,899
- What? - Goodness.

202
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:48,999
That's impressive.

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,480
(The older women welcome the morning with their own routines.)

204
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:55,508
(The younger men have all gathered on the 1st floor.)

205
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:58,139
(Yeong Gyeong appears.)

206
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:02,009
(The older women come down after getting ready.)

207
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:04,519
Hi.

208
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:07,788
Hi.

209
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:08,818
(Bowing)

210
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:10,319
(Smiling)

211
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,329
(Staring)

212
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:15,829
Did you eat something?

213
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,699
- No, not yet. - No?

214
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,799
Granola and nuts.

215
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:23,169
Where was that banana?

216
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,999
This banana? Over here.

217
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:27,109
- I want one too. - Me too.

218
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:28,939
Greek yogurt with bananas is amazing.

219
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,849
(Their hands touched slightly.)

220
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:37,518
- Oranges? I'm in. - Me too.

221
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,819
I'm fine with oranges too.

222
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:43,259
(Glancing)

223
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:46,689
(Turning around)

224
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,128
(Mu Jin's eyes are following Bon Hee.)

225
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,199
He's watching her.

226
00:10:58,139 --> 00:10:59,699
(Glancing)

227
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:03,069
(This time, Bon Hee looks toward Mu Jin.)

228
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:06,479
(As promised, Yeong Gyeong prepares Greek yogurt.)

229
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:09,349
Hi.

230
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:12,619
- Hi. - Hi.

231
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:17,019
Didn't we say breakfast would be at 10am or something?

232
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:20,829
Are you a hardcore judger? I'm sorry.

233
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:24,159
No, well...

234
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,669
(Blushing)

235
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:31,398
He must've been waiting. His face is beet red.

236
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,469
Oh, no.

237
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:35,309
How cute.

238
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:36,678
Right?

239
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,239
(The older women find him adorable.)

240
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:42,678
At least she's making it...

241
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,749
- right now. - Oh, right.

242
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,689
(Touching his nose)

243
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,719
Let's go.

244
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:55,859
(The first breakfast at Yeon House)

245
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:58,699
(Yeong Gyeong's pretty fruit plating)

246
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,669
(Cereal, granola, milk, and Greek yogurt)

247
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:04,269
Do we sit wherever we want?

248
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:07,609
(Walking on eggshells)

249
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:09,508
It looks good.

250
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:11,339
(Ji Won heads straight to the far end.)

251
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:16,108
Are you sitting there today?

252
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:17,779
I'm further inside today.

253
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,819
(Last night's dinner)

254
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:26,759
(Mu Jin, Ji Won)

255
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:29,388
(Glancing)

256
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:32,428
Mu Jin seems really relaxed.

257
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:34,699
Seeing that...

258
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:38,139
(Wanting to talk to Mu Jin, )

259
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:41,769
(Ji Won chose a seat that might be close to him.)

260
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:45,109
(Mu Jin heads to the dining table.)

261
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:48,909
(Hesitating)

262
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:50,979
(Glancing)

263
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:53,989
(Glancing again)

264
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:57,529
- Will he sit next to her? - Here he goes.

265
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:59,689
- He's turning. - There he goes.

266
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:02,289
- It's the opposite side. - Yes.

267
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:05,099
(Mu Jin sits in the same seat as last night.)

268
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,999
(Smiling)

269
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,269
The eggs have been boiled to perfection.

270
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:11,739
Look at them steaming.

271
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:14,868
- Would you like an egg? - Can I have one?

272
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:16,239
- Here. - Thank you.

273
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,308
(Smiling)

274
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:19,379
Thank you.

275
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:23,248
(Glancing)

276
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:26,079
(Ji Won unconsciously leans her body toward Mu Jin.)

277
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:29,248
They can kind of guess...

278
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:31,889
who chose whom last night.

279
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:35,259
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

280
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,559
How much milk would you like?

281
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:41,599
- Just enough? - Yes.

282
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,439
(Smiling)

283
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:45,269
(Glancing)

284
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:49,869
(Mu Jin naturally takes care of Bon Hee first.)

285
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,578
(Mu Jin closes the bottle.)

286
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:56,879
He only took care of Bon Hee.

287
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:02,089
Pour the milk if you're eating cereal.

288
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,388
(Earlier in the kitchen)

289
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,358
Who is having cereal?

290
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:11,398
Me.

291
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,399
(Raising her hand)

292
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:14,899
Would you like milk and cereal?

293
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:16,728
- Three. - Three?

294
00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:18,199
- Nice. - They look like soup bowls.

295
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:21,209
He forgot.

296
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:22,539
How disappointing.

297
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:26,209
Would you like some fruit?

298
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,979
We should have a bit of Greek yogurt.

299
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,579
I should have a taste, so just a tiny bit.

300
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:35,849
(Reading the mood)

301
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,629
Thanks.

302
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:44,729
(Reading the room)

303
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:52,199
(Topping her yogurt with fruit)

304
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:55,429
(The older women seem familiar with enjoying Greek yogurt.)

305
00:14:55,739 --> 00:14:56,739
(On the other hand, the younger men...)
(Hesitant)

306
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,149
The younger men aren't used to Greek yogurt.

307
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:03,278
(Tasting)

308
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,278
(Moaning)

309
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,879
So, this is what it usually tastes like.

310
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,418
They're so cute.

311
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:12,019
Why does it feel like this is my first time?

312
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,859
- It doesn't taste good by itself. - Oh, you're supposed to top it.

313
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:18,099
(Finding him cute)

314
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:20,999
(A little embarrassed)

315
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:23,399
What time did you go to bed?

316
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:26,399
We stayed awake until around 3:30am.

317
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:28,209
We went to bed at around 4am.

318
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,309
Are we allowed on the third floor?

319
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,279
Last night, I went to bring you water.

320
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:38,429
He said you were on your foam roller.

321
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:40,849
Excuse me.

322
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:42,289
That's enough.

323
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:45,789
(The 2nd-floor communal space last night)

324
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:48,329
(Ye Eun stretches her whole body.)

325
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:50,958
(Sang Hyeon enters.)

326
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:51,959
Excuse...

327
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:53,699
Oh, I'm sorry.

328
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:56,429
I thought I should give you water.

329
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,598
I didn't want to bother anyone.

330
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:00,439
(Sang Hyeon and Ye Eun ran into each other.)

331
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:02,568
(Embarrassed)

332
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:05,379
(Their hands are touching.)

333
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,409
- That's enough. - Sorry.

334
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:11,279
She grabbed his hand like this.

335
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:14,349
Should she have grabbed it like this?

336
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:17,619
Still... You don't find that strange?

337
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:20,088
Not really. It seems fine to me.

338
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:23,129
It doesn't mean anything significant.

339
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:26,498
If I were him, I would have thought she was into me.

340
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:27,598
Exactly.

341
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,099
(It's that serious?)

342
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:30,438
(Shy)

343
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:31,439
(She stops him as she's embarrassed.)

344
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,869
(Their hands are touching.)

345
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:35,868
- That's enough. - Okay.

346
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,439
- Sorry. - You told everyone?

347
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:39,939
- I... - Did he tell everyone?

348
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:42,049
He said you were startled.

349
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:43,648
I couldn't go in.

350
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:46,079
I felt too guilty to go there this morning.

351
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:55,929
(And it's silent once again.)

352
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:59,829
(Reading the room)

353
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,679
Should we talk about our blood types?

354
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:03,639
Blood types?

355
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:05,839
That's so random.

356
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,869
(That's pretty random.)

357
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,679
My blood type is A.

358
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:12,738
(Embarrassed)

359
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:14,848
- Type A? - Yes. Don't I look it?

360
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,179
You don't.

361
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:18,119
- What do I look like? - Type O.

362
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,319
(What are they talking about?)

363
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:26,659
(Watching others' reactions)

364
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:29,558
May I ask you what the blood types mean?

365
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,259
We don't know what they mean.

366
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:33,599
It's just that she's cheerful.

367
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:36,029
Ji Won also looks like a type O.

368
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:38,638
- I'm type A. - Seriously?

369
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:40,769
- Yes. - So am I.

370
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,039
(Startled)
So am I.

371
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,008
- What? - Really?

372
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:46,538
(All the older women are type A.)

373
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:49,578
Which type does type A go well with?

374
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:51,249
- Type O. - Type O?

375
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:54,319
Is that a thing? I've never heard that before.

376
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:56,618
(He's type O.)

377
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:57,659
That's nice.

378
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:00,989
(Sang Won is glad that he's blood type O.)

379
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:02,859
I knew you'd be type O.

380
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:07,769
Don't you feel comfortable talking to him?

381
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:10,098
Doesn't he make you feel comfortable?

382
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:11,169
(Agreeing)

383
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:13,519
So, that was because of my blood type.

384
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:20,648
The younger men don't understand why they're asking blood types.

385
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:23,178
We used to talk about personalities based on blood types...

386
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:24,979
back in elementary school, but...

387
00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:27,818
- You did talk about it. - But it was so long ago...

388
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:30,389
that I vaguely remember it now.

389
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:33,758
Judging from how Sang Hyeon doesn't know anything,

390
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,158
- he may be younger than me. - No way.

391
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,598
He might be younger.

392
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,658
- I think he is. - I don't think so.

393
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,229
He might be in his early 20s.

394
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:45,199
For him to be more than 12 years younger...

395
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,915
- He should be around that age. - He should be.

396
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:48,308
- He could be. - If the woman is 35,

397
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:52,438
- the man has to be 23 or 24. - Right.

398
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:53,978
Before MBTI types,

399
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,708
we tried to figure out people's personalities...

400
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:57,419
through blood types.

401
00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,649
(I see.)

402
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,119
(Nodding)

403
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:04,419
I'll take all the plates.

404
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,589
No, let's clean up together.

405
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:11,458
(The breakfast ends while they fail to bring generations together.)

406
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:12,998
(Mu Jin and Sang Won's room)

407
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:14,869
I wonder what they do for a living.

408
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:16,569
It completely changes their image.

409
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,368
Ye Eun looks like...

410
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:22,169
a violinist or something.

411
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:25,709
She said she's been doing her hobby for a long time...

412
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,379
and that it was related to her job.

413
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:30,718
That's why I think she plays an instrument.

414
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:33,018
- In music? - She must play an instrument.

415
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:34,249
Or she's...

416
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:37,158
a ballerina. I have a feeling she's a dancer.

417
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:38,719
- Dance? - Yes.

418
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,229
One of them is definitely a dancer.

419
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:42,729
- A dancer? - A dancer?

420
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:45,658
Ji Won has a way...

421
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:48,229
- of coddling you. - Right.

422
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,698
So, she might be a teacher.

423
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:52,968
Her job must involve...

424
00:19:52,969 --> 00:19:54,709
dealing with kids.

425
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:58,508
- Maybe... - Or she's an announcer.

426
00:19:58,509 --> 00:19:59,509
Right?

427
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:02,979
Ji Won is a good driver.

428
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,279
I can tell.

429
00:20:05,949 --> 00:20:08,819
(When Ji Won and Sang Won first met)

430
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:12,289
(You're driving with one hand, so I can trust you more.)

431
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:13,619
(One hand?)

432
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,628
(I believe in you.)

433
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:16,159
(I'll relax now.)

434
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:20,229
(She naturally showed her driving skills.)

435
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:21,428
Once I saw her car,

436
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,069
I instantly knew that she was into cars.

437
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:26,299
- Really? - Was it a Wrangler?

438
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:28,209
No. It's a BMW.

439
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:31,409
- It is? - But it's...

440
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,879
- BMW M? - Wait.

441
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:34,378
(Startled)

442
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:35,848
- It's a BMW M? - It is.

443
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:37,778
(Amazed)

444
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:38,848
As soon as I got into her car,

445
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:40,888
I said, "I can tell that you're into cars,"

446
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,819
- and she said, "Not at all." - Ji Won?

447
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:45,559
- Ji Won. - Wait.

448
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:48,788
Don't tell me you're tempted by her car.

449
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,859
No.

450
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:53,898
Your impression of her changes...

451
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,428
once you realize she's into cars.

452
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:56,468
(Agreeing)

453
00:20:56,469 --> 00:20:57,539
It was new.

454
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:02,009
What if they're all...

455
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:05,238
lawyers or business owners?

456
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:07,679
Maybe they're at that level.

457
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:10,208
I'm worried they might be...

458
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:12,248
extremely capable, earning a high income.

459
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:13,995
(They're almost worried about their competence.)

460
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:15,689
I prefer someone similar to my level.

461
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:18,419
Right. If we're way too apart...

462
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:20,189
I wanted to ask you.

463
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:23,588
If your girlfriend, or to go further, your wife,

464
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:28,169
made far more money than you, how would you feel?

465
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:30,638
Are you asking if I'd be a house husband?

466
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:33,738
I just want to know your thoughts. Is it even better for you?

467
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:35,285
I have to be the one making more in the relationship.

468
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:36,468
I also wish I'd make more.

469
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:37,879
- Right? - I think...

470
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:40,679
I aspire to be the head of the household.

471
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:44,979
The best case for me is that we make similar income.

472
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,288
I'm sure...

473
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:50,049
it'll hit you hard in reality.

474
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:54,089
Say you're preparing to go on a trip together.

475
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:58,159
And you see her naturally booking a business-class flight.

476
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:01,568
I'd go, "Isn't that too expensive?"

477
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:04,298
But it might be ordinary for her.

478
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:05,369
That could happen.

479
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:07,969
I'd definitely feel intimidated then.

480
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:10,039
That's why I also prefer making similar incomes.

481
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:13,809
When you want to lead as a man,

482
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:15,608
it's natural to be intimidated...

483
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:17,179
if she makes far more money than you.

484
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:20,048
I wonder what their jobs are.

485
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:22,018
(They're curious and worried.)

486
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:24,488
That sounded like it came from his experience.

487
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:26,919
(The younger men have an honest chat.)

488
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,459
I get it, though.

489
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:31,028
- Even I'd be intimidated. - Right?

490
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:34,368
- Considering their ages, - Really?

491
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:36,369
They would be entry-level workers at best.

492
00:22:36,469 --> 00:22:39,139
- Or they might be a job seeker. - That's true.

493
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:43,368
And none of them will want to rely on their partners...

494
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:45,309
- when they go on dates. - Indeed.

495
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:48,878
But if your girlfriend makes way more...

496
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:50,148
Would you be daunted?

497
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:54,088
They would be expecting a simple date like eating gimbap.

498
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:55,488
- And if she's cutting steaks, - Right.

499
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:56,948
- I'd feel... - That's true.

500
00:22:56,949 --> 00:23:00,018
Burdened to pay for it.

501
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:02,339
(The psychological burden that comes from a financial gap)

502
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:06,659
Did you get a text?

503
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,569
They asked us to come to the swimming pool.

504
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:11,599
They want the men to come.

505
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:13,538
- Right now? - Right now?

506
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:14,885
(The men will gather by the pool.)

507
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:15,909
Am I the only one who got it?

508
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,355
- Everyone got it, right? - I got it too.

509
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:19,878
(What is this about?)

510
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:20,979
Let's go.

511
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:32,219
(He spots something.)

512
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:35,259
"Please check once everyone arrives."

513
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:36,529
What's this now?

514
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:40,329
Let's open it.

515
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,999
(Looking forward to it)

516
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:45,999
I'll open it.

517
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:51,209
(Curious)

518
00:23:57,379 --> 00:24:00,448
"The men will ask them out in five minutes."

519
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:04,318
(5-Minute Time Attack Date)

520
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,858
"You only get one chance,"

521
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:08,099
"and you'll be matched on a 1st-come, 1st-served basis."

522
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:13,759
(Grinning)

523
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:15,599
(Getting up)

524
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:19,139
(Mu Jin gets up as if he's been waiting for it.)

525
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:22,737
"The men will ask them out in five minutes."

526
00:24:22,738 --> 00:24:24,707
(5-Minute Time Attack Date)

527
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,767
(The men will ask them out in 5 minutes.)

528
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:28,037
"You only get one chance,"

529
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:29,977
"and you'll be matched on a 1st-come, 1st-served basis."

530
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:31,477
(You only get one chance, )

531
00:24:31,478 --> 00:24:33,878
(and you'll be matched on a first-come, first-served basis.)

532
00:24:34,718 --> 00:24:35,878
(Grinning)

533
00:24:36,878 --> 00:24:37,888
(Getting up)

534
00:24:38,488 --> 00:24:41,118
(Mu Jin gets up as if he's been waiting for it.)

535
00:24:41,418 --> 00:24:42,958
He gets up that fast?

536
00:24:43,258 --> 00:24:45,288
He's a racehorse who only goes forward.

537
00:24:46,058 --> 00:24:47,897
(He strides without even looking back.)

538
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:49,897
I thought I'd stand a chance...

539
00:24:49,898 --> 00:24:51,967
only if I hurried up.

540
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,228
That's why I went so fast.

541
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:57,707
(Walking up)

542
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,868
(He goes straight to where his girl is.)

543
00:25:00,508 --> 00:25:03,108
I want to get to know her better.

544
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:06,477
(Knocking)

545
00:25:06,478 --> 00:25:08,518
- Can I open it? - Yes, you can.

546
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:12,417
(The older woman that Mu Jin wants to get to know)

547
00:25:12,418 --> 00:25:13,788
- Can I come in? - Yes.

548
00:25:14,058 --> 00:25:17,958
(It was Bon Hee.)

549
00:25:20,628 --> 00:25:23,057
Do you want to go on a date with me today?

550
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:26,968
(Do you want to go on a date with me today?)

551
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:28,237
(Nodding)

552
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:29,238
Okay.

553
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:33,808
Mu Jin is so cute.

554
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:39,147
It made me feel good.

555
00:25:39,148 --> 00:25:40,918
I was probably smiling without realizing it.

556
00:25:41,348 --> 00:25:43,147
It made my heart flutter.

557
00:25:43,148 --> 00:25:44,417
You make this older woman's heart flutter.

558
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,087
Yes, that's the charm of a younger guy.

559
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,088
- Right. - I think so.

560
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,657
They ask you out all of a sudden...

561
00:25:50,658 --> 00:25:53,327
- when they don't know much. - Yes, they're straightforward.

562
00:25:53,328 --> 00:25:54,358
Exactly.

563
00:25:55,528 --> 00:25:58,727
(Hyeon Jun followed Mu Jin.)

564
00:25:58,728 --> 00:26:00,897
I thought the one I liked...

565
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:03,398
would have attracted someone else.

566
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:06,168
- That's cool. - Who is he going to?

567
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:10,708
Can I come in?

568
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,378
Yes, come in.

569
00:26:14,418 --> 00:26:15,518
Oh, this was your room?

570
00:26:17,818 --> 00:26:18,987
Do you want to go on a date with me?

571
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:22,488
(Do you want to go on a date with me?)

572
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:24,387
Oh, okay.

573
00:26:24,388 --> 00:26:25,428
Good.

574
00:26:25,788 --> 00:26:27,328
- Did you just ask me out? - Yes.

575
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,357
(Embarrassed)

576
00:26:29,358 --> 00:26:30,997
(Hyeon Jun chose Yeong Gyeong.)

577
00:26:30,998 --> 00:26:32,098
Okay, then.

578
00:26:32,998 --> 00:26:34,367
Who's that behind him?

579
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,237
- Isn't that Sang Won? - It is.

580
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:37,767
Ye Eun, will you go out with me?

581
00:26:37,768 --> 00:26:41,238
(Ye Eun, will you go out with me?)

582
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:43,178
(Nodding)

583
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:44,547
Good.

584
00:26:44,548 --> 00:26:47,518
(Sang Won chose Ye Eun.)

585
00:26:48,478 --> 00:26:50,218
- Seriously? - She accepted.

586
00:26:50,418 --> 00:26:51,617
- What? Oh, no. - Wait!

587
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:52,988
(Sang Won's unexpected choice)

588
00:26:53,148 --> 00:26:54,757
It was Sang Won, not Sang Hyeon.

589
00:26:54,758 --> 00:26:55,887
- Sang Won. - It was Sang Won.

590
00:26:55,888 --> 00:26:56,988
It was Sang Won.

591
00:27:00,428 --> 00:27:01,598
I was surprised.

592
00:27:02,358 --> 00:27:06,198
I never expected Sang Won to ask me out.

593
00:27:07,898 --> 00:27:09,937
Sang Hyeon...

594
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:14,138
stayed by my side and looked after me.

595
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:16,838
I had a feeling that Sang Hyeon would ask me out.

596
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:18,808
That was my guess.

597
00:27:18,878 --> 00:27:20,678
Sang Won started making a move.

598
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:26,018
(Hyeon Jun and Sang Won returned to their room.)

599
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:31,087
Is this how we do it?

600
00:27:31,088 --> 00:27:33,188
Didn't we look so lame, though?

601
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:36,197
I looked like I just followed you there.

602
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:37,968
But I did go there to ask Ye Eun.

603
00:27:38,468 --> 00:27:40,737
I just asked her if she wanted to go on a date.

604
00:27:40,738 --> 00:27:42,667
I looked, and she was there, so I asked her out.

605
00:27:42,668 --> 00:27:45,267
I'm afraid I wasn't polite enough.

606
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:47,114
(This younger guy is worried that he was rude.)

607
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:48,577
You can be polite while you're on the date.

608
00:27:48,578 --> 00:27:49,578
That's true.

609
00:27:50,608 --> 00:27:52,777
- No, that is how you do it. - That's cute.

610
00:27:52,778 --> 00:27:55,048
- You're right. They were so cute. - They were.

611
00:27:55,778 --> 00:27:57,387
See? They act first.

612
00:27:57,388 --> 00:27:58,517
- Yes. - Exactly.

613
00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:00,534
- They think after they act. - "Did we look too lame?"

614
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:02,458
And that's what older women are into.

615
00:28:03,858 --> 00:28:06,428
Wait. What happens to Sang Hyeon, then?

616
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:10,227
(What's Sang Hyeon doing in the meantime?)

617
00:28:10,228 --> 00:28:12,098
Who did you ask out? Bon Hee?

618
00:28:12,368 --> 00:28:13,368
Me?

619
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,038
Bon Hee.

620
00:28:21,678 --> 00:28:24,348
(When they got up and left one by one, )

621
00:28:25,748 --> 00:28:30,048
(Sang Hyeon was the last one to stand up.)

622
00:28:35,288 --> 00:28:40,128
(Who will he pick?)

623
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:47,668
Ji Won?

624
00:28:48,868 --> 00:28:50,397
Will you go with me?

625
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:54,437
(Will you go with me?)

626
00:28:54,438 --> 00:28:56,537
- Now? - No, I meant on a date.

627
00:28:56,538 --> 00:28:57,608
Okay.

628
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:00,248
She said, "Now?"

629
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:02,078
(Sang Heyon picked...)

630
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,318
- Good. - Okay.

631
00:29:04,388 --> 00:29:05,487
What was that about?

632
00:29:05,488 --> 00:29:07,818
(Sang Heyon picked Ji Won.)

633
00:29:08,688 --> 00:29:13,658
(All the younger men asked them out.)

634
00:29:14,328 --> 00:29:19,827
(The brave younger guy will get the older woman of his choice.)

635
00:29:19,828 --> 00:29:24,467
Sang Hyeon looked conflicted.

636
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:25,567
- Right. - You're right.

637
00:29:25,568 --> 00:29:28,138
Who did you think he was going to ask out?

638
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,507
He probably had feelings for Bon Hee.

639
00:29:30,508 --> 00:29:32,807
He would have stood up instantly if he wanted to pick Ye Eun.

640
00:29:32,808 --> 00:29:34,177
In that situation,

641
00:29:34,178 --> 00:29:38,447
who you were with on the first private date...

642
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:40,858
- takes up a huge part. - Right.

643
00:29:41,218 --> 00:29:43,217
The two are starting to be...

644
00:29:43,218 --> 00:29:44,527
an official couple.

645
00:29:44,528 --> 00:29:46,728
Mu Jin and Bon Hee, I mean.

646
00:29:47,028 --> 00:29:50,498
So, Sang Hyeon couldn't do anything...

647
00:29:51,168 --> 00:29:52,467
because of Mu Jin.

648
00:29:52,468 --> 00:29:54,597
He knew who Mu Jin was choosing,

649
00:29:54,598 --> 00:29:58,707
and it was the woman he was interested in.

650
00:29:58,708 --> 00:29:59,807
What makes you think...

651
00:29:59,808 --> 00:30:02,038
that Sang Hyeon is interested in Bon Hee...

652
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:04,078
all of a sudden?

653
00:30:04,508 --> 00:30:05,948
Because he didn't get up right away.

654
00:30:06,308 --> 00:30:07,617
- That's why? - And he asked...

655
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:09,278
Mu Jin who he picked.

656
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:10,917
He was making sure.

657
00:30:10,918 --> 00:30:12,788
- Right. Exactly. - Anyway.

658
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:15,088
I'm excited.

659
00:30:18,328 --> 00:30:22,397
(The first date, Mu Jin and Bon Hee)

660
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:24,998
We're dressed similarly, though.

661
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:26,598
That's good.

662
00:30:27,998 --> 00:30:29,318
They're wearing matching outfits.

663
00:30:31,768 --> 00:30:34,007
- What's so similar? - They don't look so similar.

664
00:30:34,008 --> 00:30:36,708
(They're off to a fresh start, claiming they're dressed similarly.)

665
00:30:37,848 --> 00:30:39,007
Aren't you curious about what we're doing?

666
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:40,148
I'm so curious.

667
00:30:41,778 --> 00:30:43,278
Do you know our destination?

668
00:30:43,848 --> 00:30:46,688
Deokso? Have you heard of it?

669
00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:48,957
(Shaking her head)

670
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:50,217
That's where we're going.

671
00:30:50,218 --> 00:30:51,928
(We're going to Deokso.)

672
00:30:54,328 --> 00:31:00,568
(She follows him, only knowing the destination.)

673
00:31:01,198 --> 00:31:02,918
Do you regularly use public transportation?

674
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:04,907
Rarely.

675
00:31:04,908 --> 00:31:06,167
You always drive your car around?

676
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:09,078
(Mu Jin's first event)

677
00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:11,548
Oh, they're taking the bus.

678
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,578
(Romantic bus stop date)

679
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:16,978
The last time I took the bus was like ten years ago.

680
00:31:17,218 --> 00:31:18,687
I own a car,

681
00:31:18,688 --> 00:31:21,487
so I normally drive my car instead of taking the bus.

682
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:25,458
When he said we were taking the bus, I got excited.

683
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:30,598
(This older woman is excited about taking the bus after 10 years.)

684
00:31:31,068 --> 00:31:32,828
- Do you know what number it is? - Yes.

685
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:35,198
This one. "Thank you."

686
00:31:35,568 --> 00:31:37,297
(Amazed)

687
00:31:37,298 --> 00:31:39,138
- It's 58-3. - I can't believe they have this.

688
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:41,608
I should take a photo.

689
00:31:43,608 --> 00:31:47,078
(She takes a photo of the bus route she'll be on with Mu Jin.)

690
00:31:47,648 --> 00:31:49,148
I want to take a photo of this too.

691
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:53,318
- Oh, me? - Well...

692
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,657
- What is this? - Hold up.

693
00:31:57,658 --> 00:31:59,088
That line was...

694
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:01,627
Did you see him looking back, saying, "Oh, me?"

695
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,428
(Mu Jin picked it up immediately.)

696
00:32:04,198 --> 00:32:05,668
I want to take a photo of this too.

697
00:32:07,998 --> 00:32:09,768
- Oh, me? - Well...

698
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:12,237
Scooch to the right.

699
00:32:12,238 --> 00:32:13,668
- To the right? - Yes, that's it.

700
00:32:14,078 --> 00:32:15,377
A little to the left.

701
00:32:15,378 --> 00:32:17,307
- No, the other way. - This way?

702
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:18,348
Yes.

703
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:20,818
Good.

704
00:32:23,048 --> 00:32:24,818
Can you show me your profile?

705
00:32:24,948 --> 00:32:26,188
(My profile?)

706
00:32:26,588 --> 00:32:27,818
(A slight turn)

707
00:32:28,088 --> 00:32:29,158
Good.

708
00:32:30,588 --> 00:32:32,227
(Embarrassed for some reason)

709
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:33,328
I took it.

710
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:38,098
(Bon Hee's first photo of Mu Jin)

711
00:32:46,538 --> 00:32:48,008
(Tapping)

712
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:50,177
(Staring)

713
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:52,378
I have a handkerchief. Do you want it?

714
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:54,178
You do?

715
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:56,448
Thank you. It's hot.

716
00:32:56,818 --> 00:32:58,718
Keep it in your pocket.

717
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:00,988
You'll need it for your sweat.

718
00:33:01,218 --> 00:33:02,817
I'll wash it and give it back to you later.

719
00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:05,888
Okay. Dab this area too. Around your jawline.

720
00:33:06,088 --> 00:33:07,898
(Getting something)

721
00:33:09,428 --> 00:33:11,097
That's what older women do.

722
00:33:11,098 --> 00:33:12,228
- Is it? - Yes.

723
00:33:12,498 --> 00:33:15,297
They give you everything. They ask, "Are you hot?"

724
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:17,568
(He cools down using Bon Hee's fan and handkerchief.)

725
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:21,878
- There's our bus. - What is that bus?

726
00:33:23,338 --> 00:33:24,807
(Amazed)

727
00:33:24,808 --> 00:33:26,448
- This is fascinating. - "Thank You Bus?"

728
00:33:27,418 --> 00:33:29,417
They'll have to sit in the back if they want to sit together.

729
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:30,747
(It's obviously extraordinary.)

730
00:33:30,748 --> 00:33:31,817
That's what it looks like?

731
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:33,788
- That's so impressive. - Hello.

732
00:33:38,158 --> 00:33:39,788
This is fascinating.

733
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:44,598
I didn't know there was such a bus like this.

734
00:33:45,498 --> 00:33:48,038
(Sitting closely together)

735
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:54,738
(Thank You 58-3)

736
00:33:58,308 --> 00:34:03,048
(The romantic route that goes along the river)

737
00:34:09,118 --> 00:34:10,658
How was your first impression of me?

738
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:12,038
My first impression of you?

739
00:34:14,058 --> 00:34:15,058
You were pretty.

740
00:34:19,298 --> 00:34:21,838
I feel shy. Right.

741
00:34:22,098 --> 00:34:24,768
I was surprised, to be honest.

742
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:27,938
You didn't expect much?

743
00:34:28,078 --> 00:34:30,177
- I was very excited. - I see.

744
00:34:30,178 --> 00:34:31,507
I was really excited,

745
00:34:31,508 --> 00:34:35,678
wondering what kind of people I would meet.

746
00:34:36,278 --> 00:34:37,518
I was surprised when I saw you.

747
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:43,488
I had no expectations.

748
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:45,778
- So I liked you. - You had no expectations?

749
00:34:46,028 --> 00:34:47,528
With no expectations,

750
00:34:48,158 --> 00:34:50,828
I kept driving to go there to meet you.

751
00:34:51,568 --> 00:34:53,297
(Oh, my. He seems great.)

752
00:34:53,298 --> 00:34:54,438
And that made me happy.

753
00:34:55,768 --> 00:35:00,838
(They liked each other when they first met.)

754
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,678
I want to take a photo of you. Can you sit over there?

755
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,547
You'll look great if I take a photo from this angle.

756
00:35:07,548 --> 00:35:10,778
(Mu Jin gets up right away and moves to the seat.)

757
00:35:11,148 --> 00:35:12,448
How should I pose?

758
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:14,888
Just sit comfortably.

759
00:35:16,758 --> 00:35:17,758
(She takes a photo and saves it in her heart.)

760
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:19,057
They look great together.

761
00:35:19,058 --> 00:35:20,538
- They look great together. - Indeed.

762
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:22,328
Can you turn your head a little bit more?

763
00:35:23,828 --> 00:35:25,727
I need to see your face from a side view.

764
00:35:25,728 --> 00:35:26,767
Can you look ahead?

765
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:27,768
- Ahead? - Yes.

766
00:35:28,298 --> 00:35:30,338
Can you lean slightly? Good.

767
00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:32,337
(Passionate)

768
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,208
I want to keep taking until I get a good one.

769
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:38,008
(He does just as Bon Hee asks.)

770
00:35:39,808 --> 00:35:42,118
Bon Hee's dimple is getting deeper.

771
00:35:43,318 --> 00:35:45,418
(Click)

772
00:35:45,419 --> 00:35:46,488
It's done.

773
00:35:48,018 --> 00:35:49,658
- Did I look okay? - You did a great job.

774
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:51,927
Posing for a photo...

775
00:35:51,928 --> 00:35:53,458
is not an easy thing to do.

776
00:35:53,558 --> 00:35:54,697
It makes you nervous.

777
00:35:54,698 --> 00:35:55,957
- And we're on a bus... - I'll take photos of you later.

778
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:57,258
I'm okay.

779
00:35:57,358 --> 00:35:59,097
I'm fine. You don't have to do that.

780
00:35:59,098 --> 00:36:00,658
I'll take a lot of photos of you later.

781
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:02,668
I like taking photos.

782
00:36:04,968 --> 00:36:07,678
So I often take photos of the people I like.

783
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:10,838
"The people she likes."

784
00:36:12,908 --> 00:36:14,547
(Right in front of her, )

785
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:18,948
(there's a person she likes.)

786
00:36:19,018 --> 00:36:21,418
I'll have a look at the photos you took later.

787
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:23,888
(Chuckling awkwardly)

788
00:36:24,018 --> 00:36:25,058
Okay.

789
00:36:26,658 --> 00:36:28,527
When I take photos of people, they use their photos...

790
00:36:28,528 --> 00:36:30,598
as their profile photos on social media.

791
00:36:30,928 --> 00:36:32,097
Really?

792
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:35,298
Like those platforms... Buddy... No, not Buddy Buddy.

793
00:36:35,398 --> 00:36:36,438
Cyworld?

794
00:36:37,398 --> 00:36:38,907
Buddy Buddy and Cyworld.

795
00:36:38,908 --> 00:36:40,637
No, I didn't mean to say Buddy Buddy.

796
00:36:40,638 --> 00:36:41,777
"Buddy Buddy?"

797
00:36:41,778 --> 00:36:42,854
(She can't believe her ears.)

798
00:36:42,878 --> 00:36:45,348
- What does it mean? "Buddy Buddy?" - "Buddy Buddy?"

799
00:36:45,978 --> 00:36:47,938
- Why did she mention it suddenly? - I'm worried.

800
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:49,518
She must've been born in 1983.

801
00:36:51,118 --> 00:36:52,217
- Really? - She must be 42 or 43.

802
00:36:52,218 --> 00:36:54,217
No. I was born in 1989, and I used Buddy Buddy.

803
00:36:54,218 --> 00:36:55,918
- Really? - What about you, SOOBIN?

804
00:36:56,158 --> 00:36:58,328
I only know the name.

805
00:36:59,058 --> 00:37:00,287
Where did you hear of it?

806
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,197
My older sister was born in 1990.

807
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:03,827
She's ten years older than me.

808
00:37:03,828 --> 00:37:06,327
Do you think your sister is around Bon Hee's age?

809
00:37:06,328 --> 00:37:08,698
How old does she look to you?

810
00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:11,837
She definitely looks younger than my sister.

811
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:12,867
Come on.

812
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:14,878
You'll be in trouble when your sister sees this.

813
00:37:15,938 --> 00:37:18,948
Like those platforms... Buddy... No, not Buddy Buddy.

814
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:20,208
Cyworld?

815
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:22,677
Buddy Buddy and Cyworld.

816
00:37:22,678 --> 00:37:24,417
No, I didn't mean to say Buddy Buddy.

817
00:37:24,418 --> 00:37:27,117
They put their photos on their Instagram profile.

818
00:37:27,118 --> 00:37:28,198
(Making up for her mistake)

819
00:37:29,218 --> 00:37:30,287
(Realizing)

820
00:37:30,288 --> 00:37:31,358
Platforms like that.

821
00:37:32,028 --> 00:37:33,088
Oh, I see.

822
00:37:33,528 --> 00:37:35,097
(I feel so hot.)

823
00:37:35,098 --> 00:37:36,328
She's flustered.

824
00:37:37,628 --> 00:37:38,898
I'm blushing.

825
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:42,768
Did you use Buddy Buddy too?

826
00:37:43,538 --> 00:37:44,538
Do you know what it is?

827
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:46,638
You don't look like you know it.

828
00:37:46,938 --> 00:37:48,338
(Oh, boy)

829
00:37:49,338 --> 00:37:51,748
I've heard of it before.

830
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:54,177
He's heard of it.

831
00:37:54,178 --> 00:37:56,277
I did feel the difference then.

832
00:37:56,278 --> 00:37:58,118
I felt a generation gap.

833
00:37:58,218 --> 00:37:59,918
I realized...

834
00:38:01,218 --> 00:38:02,588
that we had quite a big age gap.

835
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,488
Don't you want to know my age?

836
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:08,857
Well, I can tell your age roughly.

837
00:38:08,858 --> 00:38:09,998
- Really? - Yes.

838
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:16,338
Do you think an age gap matters in a relationship?

839
00:38:16,938 --> 00:38:18,708
- Do I think that matters? - Yes.

840
00:38:21,308 --> 00:38:23,678
I tended to think of younger men...

841
00:38:25,608 --> 00:38:28,978
like little brothers, not thinking of them romantically.

842
00:38:29,678 --> 00:38:32,888
A man in his early or mid-20s is too young.

843
00:38:33,648 --> 00:38:35,488
But for example...

844
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:37,318
A man older than that...

845
00:38:37,928 --> 00:38:40,427
would have enough life experience,

846
00:38:40,428 --> 00:38:42,058
and so I wouldn't mind dating him.

847
00:38:43,898 --> 00:38:46,828
(Mu Jin seems to have mixed feelings.)

848
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:50,967
Oh, no. How big of an age gap do they have?

849
00:38:50,968 --> 00:38:52,614
I don't think they have such a big age gap.

850
00:38:52,638 --> 00:38:54,877
- I think they have a big age gap. - Really?

851
00:38:54,878 --> 00:38:56,707
I think she's around eight years older than him.

852
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:57,907
- Eight years? - Yes.

853
00:38:57,908 --> 00:38:59,184
(Hye Jin assumes that Mu Jin and Bon Hee have an 8-year age gap.)

854
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:00,807
But aside from that,

855
00:39:00,808 --> 00:39:04,078
it's hard for me to develop feelings for someone.

856
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:06,718
So I think it's more important.

857
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:12,228
So the age gap doesn't matter?

858
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:14,358
I think I wouldn't mind.

859
00:39:15,028 --> 00:39:17,598
I don't know how much younger you are than me.

860
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:19,528
The younger, the better.

861
00:39:20,228 --> 00:39:21,398
What are the good things?

862
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:24,708
A younger man is not picky...

863
00:39:25,468 --> 00:39:27,237
Younger men are not picky?

864
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:28,537
- I mean, less picky... - Really?

865
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:30,678
- As people age... - I see what you mean.

866
00:39:31,008 --> 00:39:32,578
As people become older,

867
00:39:32,678 --> 00:39:34,678
they calculate more.

868
00:39:35,318 --> 00:39:38,718
Also, with a younger man, it can be more emotional...

869
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,428
I mean, you can have a more passionate relationship.

870
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:47,958
He's right about that.

871
00:39:48,228 --> 00:39:49,558
- What else? - What else?

872
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:52,398
Being young is good.

873
00:39:52,698 --> 00:39:53,798
What's good about it?

874
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:55,668
- Everything. - It's good overall?

875
00:39:57,438 --> 00:40:00,138
There are many good things about becoming older.

876
00:40:01,178 --> 00:40:02,577
I'll tell you later.

877
00:40:02,578 --> 00:40:03,578
Later?

878
00:40:07,918 --> 00:40:10,517
Nine days is a very short time.

879
00:40:10,518 --> 00:40:11,617
(They have limited time to spend together.)

880
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,218
In only nine days,

881
00:40:14,088 --> 00:40:15,658
do you think it's possible...

882
00:40:17,488 --> 00:40:19,088
to find true love?

883
00:40:22,698 --> 00:40:25,328
I used to think it wasn't possible.

884
00:40:26,898 --> 00:40:29,138
I may not fall in love,

885
00:40:31,168 --> 00:40:33,707
but I think I could be sure about the relationship.

886
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:35,038
I could develop feelings.

887
00:40:38,378 --> 00:40:39,378
(Within the short time given to us...)

888
00:40:39,379 --> 00:40:40,877
- This is so... - It's like a youth drama.

889
00:40:40,878 --> 00:40:42,318
- This is so fun to watch. - Indeed.

890
00:40:42,848 --> 00:40:45,488
(At the same time, at Yeon House...)

891
00:40:46,048 --> 00:40:48,357
(Sang Won is waiting for Ye Eun.)

892
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:51,558
(Nervous)

893
00:40:52,558 --> 00:40:54,857
(The older women sent Love QR Code last night.)

894
00:40:54,858 --> 00:40:58,168
(Sang Won got no vote.)

895
00:40:59,328 --> 00:41:02,237
Looking at it with my own eyes, I was shocked.

896
00:41:02,238 --> 00:41:03,837
Right. He must have been shocked.

897
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,037
I decided to approach the one I like more carefully and seriously...

898
00:41:07,038 --> 00:41:08,238
the next day.

899
00:41:09,638 --> 00:41:12,547
(Sang Won, who got 0 votes, is nervous about his first date.)

900
00:41:12,548 --> 00:41:13,808
- Shall we get going? - Okay.

901
00:41:14,078 --> 00:41:16,077
How will things go between them?

902
00:41:16,078 --> 00:41:17,478
I'm so curious.

903
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:24,558
Go to your left, please.

904
00:41:25,328 --> 00:41:26,428
To my car.

905
00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:27,758
Be careful.

906
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,268
(Jumping)

907
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:33,498
Please get in.

908
00:41:34,098 --> 00:41:35,338
He seems proactive.

909
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:46,948
(Sang Won begins their date with thoughtful gestures.)

910
00:41:48,678 --> 00:41:50,678
Have you been to this area many times?

911
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:53,188
- Here... Namyangju. - Namyangju?

912
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:54,547
Around Paldang Dam.

913
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:56,917
I've come to this area many times to hang out.

914
00:41:56,918 --> 00:41:59,087
- Really? - My friends and I booked a place...

915
00:41:59,088 --> 00:42:00,228
with private pools.

916
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:03,227
We used to go on trips together when I was younger.

917
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:05,068
When you were most physically fit.

918
00:42:05,698 --> 00:42:06,867
You'd have more fun if you're physically fit.

919
00:42:06,868 --> 00:42:08,838
Before my friends got married.

920
00:42:10,898 --> 00:42:12,207
Are many of your friends married?

921
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:14,338
Almost all of my friends are married.

922
00:42:15,078 --> 00:42:16,937
(Almost all of them?)

923
00:42:16,938 --> 00:42:17,978
He's surprised.

924
00:42:19,408 --> 00:42:20,477
He can't believe it.

925
00:42:20,478 --> 00:42:21,677
He seems quite surprised.

926
00:42:21,678 --> 00:42:23,117
He must be very young.

927
00:42:23,118 --> 00:42:24,417
- Right. Sang Won seems... - Right?

928
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:25,718
Very surprised.

929
00:42:26,888 --> 00:42:29,857
Do some of them have children?

930
00:42:29,858 --> 00:42:31,328
Yes, of course.

931
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:34,488
When I ask them to meet me, they invite me to their homes.

932
00:42:34,628 --> 00:42:35,898
(Chuckling)

933
00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:39,427
So you go to your friend's house where she is with her baby?

934
00:42:39,428 --> 00:42:40,528
That's right.

935
00:42:40,668 --> 00:42:42,548
My friends invite me so I can see their babies.

936
00:42:44,468 --> 00:42:46,184
Do they ask you to look after their babies?

937
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:48,288
They're like, "I'll cook for you. Come to my house."

938
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:51,777
Kids like to play with their parents' friends.

939
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:52,807
Yes, they do.

940
00:42:52,808 --> 00:42:55,248
(Marriage and parenting are unfamiliar subjects to Sang Won.)

941
00:42:58,218 --> 00:43:01,418
It looks like a house in a mountain.

942
00:43:03,118 --> 00:43:05,588
Here you go. You will begin by sterilizing these.

943
00:43:06,428 --> 00:43:08,527
- Did you read the recipe? - Yes, we did.

944
00:43:08,528 --> 00:43:10,397
You just have to mix it with malt in water...

945
00:43:10,398 --> 00:43:13,068
and put the mixture in an earthen crock, and it becomes liquor.

946
00:43:16,668 --> 00:43:17,788
I'll help you put on gloves.

947
00:43:18,538 --> 00:43:20,967
Sang Won seems like a person who's comfortable to be with...

948
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:22,207
- The right hand. - judging by his tone of voice...

949
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,408
and good manners.

950
00:43:24,408 --> 00:43:26,248
- Good. - Good?

951
00:43:27,578 --> 00:43:29,218
I feel like I'm about to perform surgery.

952
00:43:29,618 --> 00:43:30,747
Scalpel, please.

953
00:43:30,748 --> 00:43:31,888
(Chuckling)

954
00:43:32,088 --> 00:43:33,088
Are you really a doctor?

955
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:34,288
(No way)

956
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:37,558
- Great. - Shall I help you?

957
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,857
(Realistic pose)

958
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:44,298
Wait. Are you a surgeon? You were holding your hands up.

959
00:43:47,128 --> 00:43:49,337
(They helped each other wear gloves.)

960
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:50,368
Good.

961
00:43:50,438 --> 00:43:52,737
Should we just mix it like this? What does it say?

962
00:43:52,738 --> 00:43:54,537
(Getting close to Ye Eun)

963
00:43:54,538 --> 00:43:55,577
That's dangerous.

964
00:43:55,578 --> 00:43:57,508
- What does it say? - It was natural.

965
00:43:58,778 --> 00:43:59,908
It says dissolve it.

966
00:44:00,178 --> 00:44:01,178
Using our hands?

967
00:44:02,078 --> 00:44:04,378
- It says dissolve it in water. - In water?

968
00:44:05,488 --> 00:44:06,518
But how?

969
00:44:07,248 --> 00:44:08,358
By stirring?

970
00:44:09,558 --> 00:44:10,788
(What's that?)

971
00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:12,228
By stirring?

972
00:44:12,688 --> 00:44:14,658
Right. Trust me on this.

973
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:16,498
I'll trust you.

974
00:44:16,828 --> 00:44:18,297
I can see that she finds him so cute.

975
00:44:18,298 --> 00:44:19,298
(Smiling)

976
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:21,098
I'm the only one you can trust now anyway.

977
00:44:22,138 --> 00:44:24,537
(Chuckling)

978
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:26,007
What is she so happy about?

979
00:44:26,008 --> 00:44:27,008
(He can't understand.)

980
00:44:28,008 --> 00:44:29,037
Shall we begin?

981
00:44:29,038 --> 00:44:30,884
(Just looking at each other makes them chuckle.)

982
00:44:30,908 --> 00:44:33,078
So this will become makgeolli?

983
00:44:35,178 --> 00:44:37,248
- Ma'am. - This is hard rice.

984
00:44:38,388 --> 00:44:39,448
It smells delicious.

985
00:44:39,688 --> 00:44:41,788
I have a feeling that it's undercooked.

986
00:44:42,788 --> 00:44:44,657
Do you remember how to check the rice...

987
00:44:44,658 --> 00:44:47,288
when you're not sure if it's cooked properly?

988
00:44:48,558 --> 00:44:49,597
You should taste it.

989
00:44:49,598 --> 00:44:51,058
That's correct. You can taste some.

990
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:52,468
I got it right.

991
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:54,528
(Both chuckle.)

992
00:44:54,698 --> 00:44:56,168
That was witty.

993
00:44:56,768 --> 00:44:58,937
- Ye Eun is very cute. - Indeed.

994
00:44:58,938 --> 00:45:01,007
- They both laugh easily. - She's cute.

995
00:45:01,008 --> 00:45:02,677
- She's lovely. - Yes.

996
00:45:02,678 --> 00:45:04,677
(Proud of himself)

997
00:45:04,678 --> 00:45:05,848
Scoop some nicely.

998
00:45:06,148 --> 00:45:07,777
Are we supposed to eat it with our hands?

999
00:45:07,778 --> 00:45:09,777
(Laughing)

1000
00:45:09,778 --> 00:45:10,978
Shall I feed you with my hand?

1001
00:45:11,148 --> 00:45:12,647
Do you mind? Would that be okay with you?

1002
00:45:12,648 --> 00:45:13,848
Shall I feed you with my hand?

1003
00:45:13,988 --> 00:45:15,287
(Shy)

1004
00:45:15,288 --> 00:45:16,564
She finds everything he does interesting.

1005
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,557
- Here you go. - Thank you.

1006
00:45:18,558 --> 00:45:20,187
(Fortunately, the instructor brought them chopsticks.)

1007
00:45:20,188 --> 00:45:21,228
Shall we taste it?

1008
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,197
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1009
00:45:24,198 --> 00:45:25,278
(They clink with the rice.)

1010
00:45:33,038 --> 00:45:34,267
(Exclaiming)

1011
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:36,737
(Chuckling)

1012
00:45:36,738 --> 00:45:39,278
(Exclaiming together)

1013
00:45:39,378 --> 00:45:41,108
Nice. It's delicious.

1014
00:45:41,618 --> 00:45:42,618
Is it because I'm hungry?

1015
00:45:43,248 --> 00:45:45,848
Am I the only one who thinks it's tasty? It's good.

1016
00:45:46,748 --> 00:45:50,187
Cool the rice down with your own method.

1017
00:45:50,188 --> 00:45:51,394
(Sang Won will cool down the rice.)

1018
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:52,587
(Glancing)

1019
00:45:52,588 --> 00:45:53,658
You're good at this.

1020
00:45:53,928 --> 00:45:56,058
(Chuckling)

1021
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:57,798
Are you a good cook?

1022
00:45:58,298 --> 00:45:59,767
I don't cook.

1023
00:45:59,768 --> 00:46:00,768
You don't cook at all?

1024
00:46:00,898 --> 00:46:01,898
I've never cooked before.

1025
00:46:02,198 --> 00:46:03,937
- What are you going to do then? - I don't really have to.

1026
00:46:03,938 --> 00:46:05,738
What will you do when it's your turn to cook?

1027
00:46:05,808 --> 00:46:08,137
- I'll do what I can... - To prepare a meal?

1028
00:46:08,138 --> 00:46:09,938
Yes, I'll do what I can, but...

1029
00:46:10,238 --> 00:46:11,278
(Looking at him nervously)

1030
00:46:11,408 --> 00:46:13,077
- But the taste... - You can't guarantee the taste?

1031
00:46:13,078 --> 00:46:16,348
That's right. I'll follow a recipe, but...

1032
00:46:16,718 --> 00:46:18,394
- You won't be sure if it's good? - That's right.

1033
00:46:18,418 --> 00:46:19,787
(Nodding)

1034
00:46:19,788 --> 00:46:20,988
I'll strongly suggest...

1035
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,588
that we shouldn't let you cook.

1036
00:46:24,288 --> 00:46:25,858
Because we won't get to eat food.

1037
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,427
Hey, that's mean.

1038
00:46:27,428 --> 00:46:28,628
We all will have to starve.

1039
00:46:29,558 --> 00:46:32,267
I may have never cooked before, but I think I have the talent.

1040
00:46:32,268 --> 00:46:34,148
I cooled it down well. Do you want to touch it?

1041
00:46:36,068 --> 00:46:37,774
Oh, you're right. There's a big difference.

1042
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:39,807
(Happy)

1043
00:46:39,808 --> 00:46:41,637
- But you... - Do you think I can be a good cook?

1044
00:46:41,638 --> 00:46:44,237
You should focus on our conversation instead of this.

1045
00:46:44,238 --> 00:46:46,798
You're focused on this so much and working hard to cool it down.

1046
00:46:47,648 --> 00:46:50,878
- Why are you trying so hard? - Haven't I been actively talking?

1047
00:46:51,448 --> 00:46:54,018
(Getting close to Sang Won)

1048
00:46:55,388 --> 00:46:56,388
He's taken aback.

1049
00:46:56,389 --> 00:46:58,657
(Taken aback)

1050
00:46:58,658 --> 00:47:00,664
- I think you were focused on this. - I don't think so.

1051
00:47:00,688 --> 00:47:03,127
Did we make a bet?

1052
00:47:03,128 --> 00:47:04,997
- He's malfunctioning. - I think I just didn't notice it.

1053
00:47:04,998 --> 00:47:07,028
Why won't mine cool down? Why is it still so warm?

1054
00:47:07,528 --> 00:47:08,868
I wish we had made a bet.

1055
00:47:09,168 --> 00:47:10,168
What a shame.

1056
00:47:12,508 --> 00:47:14,668
(Chuckling)

1057
00:47:16,038 --> 00:47:17,077
I'm done.

1058
00:47:17,078 --> 00:47:18,598
(Their own makgeolli is done already.)

1059
00:47:18,648 --> 00:47:21,308
(It feels like they've become closer.)

1060
00:47:21,778 --> 00:47:23,277
We misjudged Sang Won.

1061
00:47:23,278 --> 00:47:24,278
- Right. - We did.

1062
00:47:24,279 --> 00:47:27,948
Now I see why his keyword was "the day flies by."

1063
00:47:28,418 --> 00:47:30,157
He seems to be relaxed now, right?

1064
00:47:30,158 --> 00:47:31,827
Right. I think he was nervous on the first day.

1065
00:47:31,828 --> 00:47:33,087
Things went well between them.

1066
00:47:33,088 --> 00:47:37,658
So I'm pretty sure that Sang Won will ignite the fire.

1067
00:47:38,098 --> 00:47:40,767
- He'll be more active. - More active than he is now?

1068
00:47:40,768 --> 00:47:43,668
- He was shocked on the first day. - He'll approach her actively.

1069
00:47:43,998 --> 00:47:45,138
How do you think about this?

1070
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:47,437
As she whined cutely,

1071
00:47:47,438 --> 00:47:49,914
she playfully bumped her shoulder into him. What do you think of it?

1072
00:47:49,938 --> 00:47:54,848
I think Ye Eun doesn't mind light physical touch at all.

1073
00:47:55,218 --> 00:47:57,378
To be honest, if a woman does that to me,

1074
00:47:57,478 --> 00:48:01,548
I would probably get the wrong idea.

1075
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:02,858
Wouldn't you, Woo Young?

1076
00:48:03,388 --> 00:48:04,717
- First of all... - Am I the only one...

1077
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:06,834
How would you feel when a woman touches you casually?

1078
00:48:06,858 --> 00:48:10,357
I would be happy. I'd definitely be happy. However...

1079
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:14,568
I'm sure that Ye Eun was interested in Sang Hyeon.

1080
00:48:14,668 --> 00:48:16,497
- Today... - It's possible...

1081
00:48:16,498 --> 00:48:19,637
that she became interested Sang Won as well.

1082
00:48:19,638 --> 00:48:20,638
Do you think that could be the case?

1083
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:22,137
I think she became interested in him while dating him.

1084
00:48:22,138 --> 00:48:25,477
Right. I think that's why she made physical contact.

1085
00:48:25,478 --> 00:48:26,777
(Did Ye Eun make physical contact to show her interest in him?)

1086
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,378
She might have become interested in him.

1087
00:48:29,878 --> 00:48:31,647
We're finally going to a cafe together.

1088
00:48:31,648 --> 00:48:33,064
(Hyeon Jun and Yeong Gyeong's first date)

1089
00:48:33,088 --> 00:48:35,618
We had little time to spend together yesterday.

1090
00:48:35,858 --> 00:48:37,117
- That's true. - Yes.

1091
00:48:37,118 --> 00:48:39,558
As soon as we met, it started raining.

1092
00:48:40,028 --> 00:48:41,128
That's why I asked you out.

1093
00:48:41,558 --> 00:48:43,697
(They got stuck in the rain on the first day they met.)

1094
00:48:43,698 --> 00:48:44,897
They spent so little time together.

1095
00:48:44,898 --> 00:48:45,898
(Flustered)

1096
00:48:46,098 --> 00:48:49,867
But I think it will remain in my memory for a long time.

1097
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:51,568
It rained so heavily.

1098
00:48:52,768 --> 00:48:54,208
It reminded me of something.

1099
00:48:54,708 --> 00:48:57,778
Have you watched the movie "The Classic?"

1100
00:48:58,278 --> 00:48:59,278
"The Classic?"

1101
00:49:00,278 --> 00:49:02,377
Is it the right title? Son Ye Jin stars in it.

1102
00:49:02,378 --> 00:49:04,777
Oh, that one? I haven't watched it.

1103
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:06,818
(Surprised)

1104
00:49:07,348 --> 00:49:08,657
(Deep sigh)

1105
00:49:08,658 --> 00:49:09,787
Hold on a second.

1106
00:49:09,788 --> 00:49:11,594
- He's never watched it. - He hasn't even watched it.

1107
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:13,357
She gasped.

1108
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:15,497
Hold on. This is... Oh, boy.

1109
00:49:15,498 --> 00:49:16,898
This is what older women do.

1110
00:49:17,198 --> 00:49:20,628
When a woman says the first encounter with a man...

1111
00:49:20,868 --> 00:49:22,538
reminded her of "The Classic,"

1112
00:49:23,238 --> 00:49:27,268
she expects the man to be touched by how she feels about it...

1113
00:49:27,468 --> 00:49:29,778
and to become much more fond of her.

1114
00:49:30,078 --> 00:49:31,354
- I see. - I mean, the best thing...

1115
00:49:31,378 --> 00:49:32,708
Hold on. SOOBIN.

1116
00:49:32,908 --> 00:49:34,948
- SOOBIN doesn't know the movie. - What's going on?

1117
00:49:35,148 --> 00:49:36,377
- What was that reaction? - SOOBIN mustn't know the movie.

1118
00:49:36,378 --> 00:49:38,177
- SOOBIN, don't you know the movie? - Our eyes met.

1119
00:49:38,178 --> 00:49:40,217
And his eyes were shaking.

1120
00:49:40,218 --> 00:49:41,218
(I saw it. SOOBIN's eyes were shaking.)

1121
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:42,957
What was that reaction, SOOBIN? Please explain.

1122
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:45,088
When she mentioned "The Classic,"

1123
00:49:46,188 --> 00:49:48,087
- You thought of classic movies? - I thought she meant music.

1124
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:50,757
- To be honest, I've never heard... - No way. That can't be.

1125
00:49:50,758 --> 00:49:51,797
Of the movie "The Classic."

1126
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:53,728
Right. I didn't think he knew the movie.

1127
00:49:54,668 --> 00:49:57,114
(When everyone else was talking as "The Classic" was mentioned...)

1128
00:49:57,138 --> 00:49:59,508
(Trying to read their faces)

1129
00:50:00,468 --> 00:50:02,038
(I should laugh for now.)

1130
00:50:02,508 --> 00:50:03,738
Is it a Korean movie?

1131
00:50:05,808 --> 00:50:07,147
- Not knowing the movie... - That hurts my feelings.

1132
00:50:07,148 --> 00:50:08,924
Is more shocking than not knowing Buddy Buddy.

1133
00:50:08,948 --> 00:50:10,148
It really hurts my feelings.

1134
00:50:10,348 --> 00:50:11,348
"The Classic?"

1135
00:50:12,348 --> 00:50:14,587
Is it the right title? Son Ye Jin stars in it.

1136
00:50:14,588 --> 00:50:15,717
Oh, that one? I haven't watched it.

1137
00:50:15,718 --> 00:50:17,058
- You haven't? - No.

1138
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:18,387
I haven't watched it.

1139
00:50:18,388 --> 00:50:20,087
(Surprised)

1140
00:50:20,088 --> 00:50:23,398
This is bad. What should he do?

1141
00:50:23,498 --> 00:50:24,927
My gosh. What should he do?

1142
00:50:24,928 --> 00:50:28,267
Is there a scene with a similar atmosphere?

1143
00:50:28,268 --> 00:50:29,497
He's tiptoeing around her. I feel bad for him.

1144
00:50:29,498 --> 00:50:32,167
There's this scene where it starts raining suddenly.

1145
00:50:32,168 --> 00:50:34,838
Oh, I see. I guess it rained that heavily yesterday.

1146
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:36,438
He has no idea.

1147
00:50:37,408 --> 00:50:41,277
It made me worry if he was too much younger...

1148
00:50:41,278 --> 00:50:42,748
than me.

1149
00:50:43,518 --> 00:50:45,547
But I found him cute.

1150
00:50:45,548 --> 00:50:48,048
Right. He must've seemed so cute.

1151
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:50,948
(Yeong Gyeong and Hyeon Jun's dating place: Terrarium cafe)

1152
00:50:53,488 --> 00:50:54,958
Are we going to make something?

1153
00:50:55,298 --> 00:50:56,328
Please sit here.

1154
00:50:57,498 --> 00:50:58,498
- "Terrarium?" - "Terrarium?"

1155
00:50:58,499 --> 00:51:02,037
You make your own mini ecosystem in a container.

1156
00:51:02,038 --> 00:51:03,898
(Making a terrarium)

1157
00:51:04,198 --> 00:51:07,208
These stones look expensive.

1158
00:51:08,738 --> 00:51:10,908
(Yeong Gyeong spotted luxurious stones.)

1159
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:13,048
It has the color of jade.

1160
00:51:13,808 --> 00:51:14,848
Do you like jade?

1161
00:51:15,678 --> 00:51:19,048
The Chinese character "yeong" from my name "Yeong Gyeong..."

1162
00:51:19,548 --> 00:51:23,058
- can also be pronounced as "ok." - Yes.

1163
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:24,988
Ok Gyeong?

1164
00:51:25,858 --> 00:51:30,728
Yes. So when I show my name in Chinese characters to elders,

1165
00:51:31,658 --> 00:51:33,468
- they call me Ok Gyeong. - I see.

1166
00:51:34,498 --> 00:51:35,938
That's why I like jade.

1167
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:41,507
Also, my birthstone is emerald.

1168
00:51:41,508 --> 00:51:42,608
Oh, really?

1169
00:51:44,308 --> 00:51:46,408
(Pouring)

1170
00:51:48,778 --> 00:51:50,778
- I'll put these here. - What?

1171
00:51:51,518 --> 00:51:55,258
Are you picking out the green stones for me?

1172
00:51:56,888 --> 00:51:59,387
He took action as soon as he heard what she said.

1173
00:51:59,388 --> 00:52:02,828
He's so romantic. He really is crunchy outside, tender inside.

1174
00:52:03,658 --> 00:52:04,898
He's very thoughtful.

1175
00:52:05,728 --> 00:52:08,738
(The emerald green stones he picked out for Yeong Gyeong)

1176
00:52:09,238 --> 00:52:13,268
I will put these stones together on one side...

1177
00:52:13,408 --> 00:52:15,237
to cherish them.

1178
00:52:15,238 --> 00:52:17,578
You'll use only the stones in that color?

1179
00:52:18,278 --> 00:52:21,848
The emerald green stones that Hyeon Jun picked out for me.

1180
00:52:23,178 --> 00:52:24,218
That's so sweet.

1181
00:52:25,588 --> 00:52:28,658
(The two of them are falling for each other gradually.)

1182
00:52:28,888 --> 00:52:33,958
(After making their own terrariums...)

1183
00:52:34,358 --> 00:52:36,957
It's really nice. And I think we came here at perfect timing.

1184
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:40,398
It's about time for sunset.

1185
00:52:45,938 --> 00:52:47,967
Sujebi will be added to the stew.

1186
00:52:47,968 --> 00:52:51,978
Since you eat outside, you put sujebi in it by yourselves.

1187
00:52:52,078 --> 00:52:53,577
Divide the dough evenly.

1188
00:52:53,578 --> 00:52:55,477
- Isn't this your first time? - Yes, it is.

1189
00:52:55,478 --> 00:52:56,478
That's the point.

1190
00:52:58,688 --> 00:53:00,088
It's a sujebi contest.

1191
00:53:00,648 --> 00:53:01,648
I'm good at this.

1192
00:53:01,748 --> 00:53:04,188
- Oh, my. Have you done this before? - Yes.

1193
00:53:06,288 --> 00:53:07,688
He said we should start right away.

1194
00:53:07,788 --> 00:53:08,798
Right away?

1195
00:53:09,998 --> 00:53:12,698
I made a donut. A sujebi donut.

1196
00:53:13,568 --> 00:53:14,628
That's cute.

1197
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:16,098
Oh, my.

1198
00:53:20,808 --> 00:53:21,908
What's that?

1199
00:53:22,838 --> 00:53:25,207
Is that a twisted donut sujebi?

1200
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:26,378
I made a twisted donut.

1201
00:53:27,248 --> 00:53:28,248
They're cute.

1202
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:30,748
Goodbye.

1203
00:53:31,548 --> 00:53:34,448
Oh, my. The sujebi is swelling like bread dough in the oven.

1204
00:53:34,888 --> 00:53:37,188
This looks good. I'm starving.

1205
00:53:38,018 --> 00:53:39,158
Look at it.

1206
00:53:39,858 --> 00:53:41,728
The broth got thicker.

1207
00:53:42,258 --> 00:53:44,128
It's like we're camping.

1208
00:53:44,598 --> 00:53:45,768
Do you like going camping?

1209
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,298
I go camping about once a year.

1210
00:53:49,638 --> 00:53:51,498
Isn't once a year very often?

1211
00:53:51,898 --> 00:53:52,968
Is it?

1212
00:53:53,468 --> 00:53:55,007
I do it once in about every four years or so.

1213
00:53:55,008 --> 00:53:56,407
- It's hot. Be careful. - Thank you. Is it?

1214
00:53:56,408 --> 00:53:58,107
(He places the hot bowl in front of Yeong Gyeong.)

1215
00:53:58,108 --> 00:53:59,948
(He's very sweet.)

1216
00:54:00,078 --> 00:54:01,678
- Let's tuck in. - Let's tuck in.

1217
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:03,648
Thank you for this.

1218
00:54:04,018 --> 00:54:05,218
Thank you too.

1219
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,818
The catfish is huge.

1220
00:54:09,188 --> 00:54:11,187
Let me debone it.

1221
00:54:11,188 --> 00:54:12,258
(Flipping)

1222
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:13,888
Are you good at deboning fish?

1223
00:54:14,988 --> 00:54:16,198
Are you bad at it?

1224
00:54:21,998 --> 00:54:23,667
I got a big piece. Do you want this?

1225
00:54:23,668 --> 00:54:25,867
(I got a big piece. Do you want this?)

1226
00:54:25,868 --> 00:54:27,738
This guy is too sweet.

1227
00:54:27,968 --> 00:54:29,408
- You should eat it. - Eat this.

1228
00:54:29,538 --> 00:54:30,777
(Yeong Gyeong is poor at deboning, so he does it for her.)

1229
00:54:30,778 --> 00:54:32,507
Hyeon Jun doesn't make a big deal of it either.

1230
00:54:32,508 --> 00:54:34,647
He casually gives it to her and says, "Take this."

1231
00:54:34,648 --> 00:54:35,778
I will debone it.

1232
00:54:36,218 --> 00:54:37,818
- Thank you. - I will debone it.

1233
00:54:37,948 --> 00:54:39,548
- I will enjoy it. - Please do.

1234
00:54:39,988 --> 00:54:41,648
- You did such a neat job. - Enjoy.

1235
00:54:42,018 --> 00:54:43,217
I did it in one go.

1236
00:54:43,218 --> 00:54:45,388
Men like it when women do that.

1237
00:54:46,028 --> 00:54:47,587
Women are the same.

1238
00:54:47,588 --> 00:54:48,588
Right.

1239
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:50,509
(She tries the catfish meat Hyeon Jun gave her.)

1240
00:54:51,028 --> 00:54:52,968
(Yum!)

1241
00:54:53,968 --> 00:54:55,798
- It's good. - It's good.

1242
00:54:57,468 --> 00:54:59,238
Do you cook?

1243
00:54:59,738 --> 00:55:01,037
- Do I cook? - Yes.

1244
00:55:01,038 --> 00:55:02,278
I like cooking.

1245
00:55:04,978 --> 00:55:08,948
Is there anything you wanted to do here?

1246
00:55:09,478 --> 00:55:12,488
I wanted to cook for the person...

1247
00:55:13,948 --> 00:55:16,318
I'm interested in and eat with her.

1248
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:18,787
You wanted to cook and eat with her?

1249
00:55:18,788 --> 00:55:20,828
(Hyeon Jun wanted to cook with the woman he likes.)

1250
00:55:20,888 --> 00:55:22,158
How about you, Ok Gyeong?

1251
00:55:23,228 --> 00:55:24,658
Only he gets to call her that.

1252
00:55:25,598 --> 00:55:27,027
Teasing her like that is nice.

1253
00:55:27,028 --> 00:55:29,198
- It will lighten the mood. - Right.

1254
00:55:29,538 --> 00:55:32,838
I guess I wanted to go on a date like this.

1255
00:55:33,938 --> 00:55:35,068
I guess...

1256
00:55:35,778 --> 00:55:37,307
a cooking date is next.

1257
00:55:37,308 --> 00:55:38,338
Right.

1258
00:55:39,478 --> 00:55:41,648
It's really pretty behind you.

1259
00:55:41,748 --> 00:55:43,148
It's really pretty.

1260
00:55:45,888 --> 00:55:48,448
- It's a pink sunset. - The view is magnificent.

1261
00:55:50,858 --> 00:55:52,757
(Looking at the pink sunset, )

1262
00:55:52,758 --> 00:55:54,757
(they get lost in emotion.)

1263
00:55:54,758 --> 00:55:56,858
What a great view for a fish stew restaurant.

1264
00:55:58,128 --> 00:56:00,368
I love looking at the sunset.

1265
00:56:02,138 --> 00:56:06,208
They get along so naturally.

1266
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:09,807
- Don't tell me you're done. - Pardon?

1267
00:56:09,808 --> 00:56:12,108
- Don't tell me you're done. - I have a grand plan.

1268
00:56:12,248 --> 00:56:14,348
- What is it? - I'll ask if there's fried rice.

1269
00:56:15,378 --> 00:56:17,058
I will go and cook the fried rice for you.

1270
00:56:17,418 --> 00:56:19,048
- Will you really? - Another fried rice.

1271
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:21,718
- Shall we go? - Sounds great.

1272
00:56:24,058 --> 00:56:26,157
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

1273
00:56:26,158 --> 00:56:27,657
(How will this date change the two?)

1274
00:56:27,658 --> 00:56:31,098
That restaurant must have had fried rice in the menu.

1275
00:56:31,428 --> 00:56:33,427
- They could've had it there. - Right.

1276
00:56:33,428 --> 00:56:34,897
- But he insisted. - To cook it for her.

1277
00:56:34,898 --> 00:56:36,998
When he said he would go cook it for her,

1278
00:56:37,168 --> 00:56:38,667
she would've figured out that he is trying to win her over.

1279
00:56:38,668 --> 00:56:40,707
She must've found him cute.

1280
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:41,737
- He saw through Hyeon Jun. - You think so?

1281
00:56:41,738 --> 00:56:45,978
There are eight of them.

1282
00:56:46,078 --> 00:56:48,007
The fact that he's willing to make fried rice for her...

1283
00:56:48,008 --> 00:56:49,948
in front of everyone...

1284
00:56:50,778 --> 00:56:52,187
- You would hate that? - I would love that.

1285
00:56:52,188 --> 00:56:53,664
- You would love that? That too? - I...

1286
00:56:53,688 --> 00:56:55,117
- How can you not love it? - I would hate that.

1287
00:56:55,118 --> 00:56:56,887
- I thought you would hate it. - Isn't it super sweet?

1288
00:56:56,888 --> 00:56:58,417
- Really? - It's like declaring...

1289
00:56:58,418 --> 00:57:00,557
that she's mine in front of everyone.

1290
00:57:00,558 --> 00:57:02,358
(Is it like declaring that she's his?)

1291
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,097
(It's the date spot Sang Hyeon picked.)

1292
00:57:04,098 --> 00:57:05,528
It must be here.

1293
00:57:07,898 --> 00:57:09,838
Dogs! They are huge.

1294
00:57:10,238 --> 00:57:11,468
- Cute. - Can you pat them?

1295
00:57:11,698 --> 00:57:13,138
Hello.

1296
00:57:13,668 --> 00:57:14,708
They are adorable.

1297
00:57:17,908 --> 00:57:19,747
There's a stream in front of it too.

1298
00:57:19,748 --> 00:57:21,578
(Sang Hyeon and Ji Won's first date)

1299
00:57:22,008 --> 00:57:23,118
This is so lovely.

1300
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:25,598
I think the food is going to be delicious.

1301
00:57:26,018 --> 00:57:27,887
(Looking away)

1302
00:57:27,888 --> 00:57:29,257
(Sang Hyeon can't even lock eyes with her...)

1303
00:57:29,258 --> 00:57:32,388
(now that they are sitting across each other.)

1304
00:57:33,388 --> 00:57:34,388
(Staring)

1305
00:57:34,389 --> 00:57:37,598
(But Ji Won stares right into his eyes.)

1306
00:57:39,428 --> 00:57:42,068
He's shy. Goodness.

1307
00:57:44,398 --> 00:57:45,538
Golden Retriever.

1308
00:57:47,138 --> 00:57:49,778
I'm so embarrassed.

1309
00:57:50,778 --> 00:57:55,048
You're a Golden Retriever, so I thought you'd be just cute.

1310
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:58,948
But hearing you talk...

1311
00:57:59,388 --> 00:58:00,848
and talking to you,

1312
00:58:01,718 --> 00:58:05,358
I realized you are not just a cute person.

1313
00:58:05,788 --> 00:58:07,157
You are super calm.

1314
00:58:07,158 --> 00:58:08,758
That makes me too boring.

1315
00:58:09,058 --> 00:58:10,428
You are not too boring.

1316
00:58:12,668 --> 00:58:14,298
(Embarrassed)

1317
00:58:14,668 --> 00:58:15,738
(Dropping his head)

1318
00:58:18,738 --> 00:58:20,438
(Embarrassed)

1319
00:58:23,008 --> 00:58:24,338
Sang Hyeon,

1320
00:58:25,538 --> 00:58:27,208
why did you...

1321
00:58:27,808 --> 00:58:29,218
ask me out on a date today?

1322
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:32,248
Well...

1323
00:58:34,718 --> 00:58:36,057
It's still too early to say anything,

1324
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:39,058
but when it came to the spark...

1325
00:58:40,628 --> 00:58:42,898
and some other reason for wanting to get closer...

1326
00:58:43,298 --> 00:58:44,957
Whatever reason it was,

1327
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:48,098
it was you I wanted to talk to.

1328
00:58:49,598 --> 00:58:51,067
(On the first day of Yeon House, )

1329
00:58:51,068 --> 00:58:52,868
(Ji Won and Sang Hyeon did dishes together.)

1330
00:58:53,068 --> 00:58:55,538
Have you dated an older woman?

1331
00:58:56,038 --> 00:58:57,678
I've never dated one seriously.

1332
00:58:57,908 --> 00:58:58,938
Is that right?

1333
00:58:59,908 --> 00:59:01,708
Is there a specific type you like?

1334
00:59:02,078 --> 00:59:03,647
I like a teto-guy.

1335
00:59:03,648 --> 00:59:04,878
- A teto-guy. - Yes.

1336
00:59:05,118 --> 00:59:07,017
That's a surprise.

1337
00:59:07,018 --> 00:59:09,517
I thought you would like to lead the relationship.

1338
00:59:09,518 --> 00:59:10,657
- Lead? - Yes.

1339
00:59:10,658 --> 00:59:11,918
I lead one well too.

1340
00:59:12,558 --> 00:59:14,027
(Ji Won made Sang Hyeon feel comfortable.)

1341
00:59:14,028 --> 00:59:16,458
That's where he got the first impression.

1342
00:59:17,758 --> 00:59:18,898
I'm glad to hear it.

1343
00:59:21,268 --> 00:59:22,938
This makes me...

1344
00:59:23,568 --> 00:59:26,138
a little more serious.

1345
00:59:27,938 --> 00:59:31,907
If I fall for someone's looks only...

1346
00:59:31,908 --> 00:59:34,208
and approach her aggressively,

1347
00:59:35,508 --> 00:59:38,747
that might hurt her feelings.

1348
00:59:38,748 --> 00:59:42,388
That's why I'm more cautious.

1349
00:59:46,428 --> 00:59:48,988
That's why I took it slow today.

1350
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:51,797
Even if I liked someone,

1351
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:54,567
I didn't want to express my feelings right away.

1352
00:59:54,568 --> 00:59:56,498
If I told her that I liked her now,

1353
00:59:57,998 --> 01:00:00,808
that wouldn't be sincere.

1354
01:00:01,008 --> 01:00:03,137
That's more of a momentary attraction.

1355
01:00:03,138 --> 01:00:05,338
(That's just attraction. That's not a sincere feeling.)

1356
01:00:07,408 --> 01:00:08,607
He's sensitive.

1357
01:00:08,608 --> 01:00:10,517
(This man is sensitive.)

1358
01:00:10,518 --> 01:00:14,088
Sang Hyeon is a serious and thoughtful man.

1359
01:00:14,418 --> 01:00:16,157
He's the man who wants...

1360
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:19,127
to take responsibility for his words.

1361
01:00:19,128 --> 01:00:21,558
Not all younger men are the same.

1362
01:00:21,858 --> 01:00:23,158
They are all different.

1363
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:26,468
I want to date someone who sees that side of me.

1364
01:00:26,868 --> 01:00:28,298
- Who sees that side of you? - Yes.

1365
01:00:28,998 --> 01:00:31,367
I'm not someone...

1366
01:00:31,368 --> 01:00:33,508
who is always cheerful.

1367
01:00:34,038 --> 01:00:37,238
But just because I look cheerful,

1368
01:00:37,778 --> 01:00:39,778
people see me as a bubbly person.

1369
01:00:41,408 --> 01:00:42,748
But I am a very serious type.

1370
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:46,188
I'm a not-so-boomer boomer.

1371
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:51,488
So I want someone who can see even that side of me.

1372
01:00:52,388 --> 01:00:53,458
Yes.

1373
01:00:56,698 --> 01:00:58,058
You look serious.

1374
01:00:59,668 --> 01:01:00,727
I do?

1375
01:01:00,728 --> 01:01:01,998
(She's touched.)

1376
01:01:02,568 --> 01:01:05,038
You and I can have a conversation.

1377
01:01:06,908 --> 01:01:08,107
(They got closer through the date.)

1378
01:01:08,108 --> 01:01:09,238
My goodness.

1379
01:01:09,478 --> 01:01:10,938
Sang Hyeon is so charming.

1380
01:01:11,678 --> 01:01:13,578
Thank you.

1381
01:01:13,948 --> 01:01:15,208
Can you pass me your plate?

1382
01:01:15,608 --> 01:01:16,717
- This one? - Yes.

1383
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:18,547
(Sang Hyeon naturally serves Ji Won first.)

1384
01:01:18,548 --> 01:01:20,547
- The meat is... - Are you giving me the biggest one?

1385
01:01:20,548 --> 01:01:21,618
- Of course. - Goodness.

1386
01:01:21,988 --> 01:01:23,958
- Thank you, Sang Hyeon. - You're welcome.

1387
01:01:24,758 --> 01:01:26,728
Thanks to you, I got to come here.

1388
01:01:27,188 --> 01:01:29,268
I wouldn't come to a place like this alone, would I?

1389
01:01:30,098 --> 01:01:31,298
I'm grateful to you.

1390
01:01:32,598 --> 01:01:34,668
What's common...

1391
01:01:35,668 --> 01:01:37,898
about the people you've dated?

1392
01:01:41,908 --> 01:01:43,268
- What's common about them? - Yes.

1393
01:01:45,178 --> 01:01:47,578
I like someone who speaks nicely.

1394
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:51,318
(Thinking hard)

1395
01:01:51,618 --> 01:01:53,518
Did I speak nicely today?

1396
01:01:57,418 --> 01:01:58,757
You did speak nicely.

1397
01:01:58,758 --> 01:01:59,788
(Shy)

1398
01:02:03,058 --> 01:02:04,228
Sang Hyeon.

1399
01:02:05,158 --> 01:02:07,067
When you get back today,

1400
01:02:07,068 --> 01:02:08,128
Yes?

1401
01:02:10,068 --> 01:02:13,738
Who else do you want to talk to?

1402
01:02:15,108 --> 01:02:17,538
(Thinking carefully)

1403
01:02:17,815 --> 01:02:19,045
Sang Hyeon.

1404
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:21,784
When you get back today,

1405
01:02:21,785 --> 01:02:22,855
Yes?

1406
01:02:24,785 --> 01:02:28,355
Who else do you want to talk to?

1407
01:02:29,825 --> 01:02:32,295
(Thinking carefully)

1408
01:02:35,195 --> 01:02:36,235
Bon Hee.

1409
01:02:36,935 --> 01:02:38,334
- Bon Hee. - No way.

1410
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,805
See? I told you.

1411
01:02:39,865 --> 01:02:43,435
(I see.)

1412
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:45,804
There's still time.

1413
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:47,445
- It's only the second day. - Yes.

1414
01:02:47,945 --> 01:02:51,574
You need to talk to several people.

1415
01:02:51,575 --> 01:02:53,545
(It looks like Sang Hyeon has a lot on his mind.)

1416
01:02:54,385 --> 01:02:58,215
(Sang Hyeon and Ji Won had an honest conversation.)

1417
01:02:58,855 --> 01:02:59,855
(Mu Jin's second spot is a pork belly barbecue place.)

1418
01:02:59,856 --> 01:03:02,155
- You want a soju-beer cocktail? - Yes.

1419
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:05,255
I haven't had this cocktail in so long.

1420
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:07,595
I will mix up a good one.

1421
01:03:09,295 --> 01:03:10,634
You don't use a shot glass for measurement?

1422
01:03:10,635 --> 01:03:11,735
I don't need it.

1423
01:03:12,405 --> 01:03:14,104
No mixing performance?

1424
01:03:14,105 --> 01:03:15,945
- No. This is how I mix. - That's how you mix.

1425
01:03:17,805 --> 01:03:18,944
Shall we have a drink?

1426
01:03:18,945 --> 01:03:20,844
It's going to hit hard if we have this on an empty stomach.

1427
01:03:20,845 --> 01:03:21,974
Would you have it?

1428
01:03:21,975 --> 01:03:23,215
- I want to drink it. - You do?

1429
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:25,174
But you said you had an upset stomach.

1430
01:03:25,175 --> 01:03:27,184
It might get worse if you drink it on an empty stomach.

1431
01:03:27,185 --> 01:03:28,444
She's worrying about him again.

1432
01:03:28,445 --> 01:03:30,985
- Me? - Yes. I'm the same. Us.

1433
01:03:31,955 --> 01:03:33,455
- I will drink it later then. - Okay.

1434
01:03:36,525 --> 01:03:39,925
(Meanwhile, the table is set.)

1435
01:03:40,825 --> 01:03:42,564
That's the meat, isn't it?

1436
01:03:42,565 --> 01:03:43,594
It is.

1437
01:03:43,595 --> 01:03:44,875
Are you going to grill the meat?

1438
01:03:45,705 --> 01:03:47,235
I will try grilling it.

1439
01:03:48,205 --> 01:03:49,235
I'd love that.

1440
01:03:50,435 --> 01:03:51,774
It's just a barbecue.

1441
01:03:51,775 --> 01:03:53,075
(Excited)

1442
01:03:53,805 --> 01:03:56,274
It's the first to get the meat in a plastic bag.

1443
01:03:56,275 --> 01:03:58,815
I know. I've never gotten the meat in a bag.

1444
01:04:00,385 --> 01:04:02,185
Let's grill the kimchi too.

1445
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,185
I didn't think about kimchi.

1446
01:04:05,115 --> 01:04:07,085
I was really craving pork belly.

1447
01:04:08,085 --> 01:04:09,655
(Proud)

1448
01:04:10,295 --> 01:04:11,495
What kind of meat do you like?

1449
01:04:12,225 --> 01:04:13,741
I like pork belly barbecue with kimchi.

1450
01:04:13,765 --> 01:04:15,405
- Pork belly barbecue with kimchi. - Yes.

1451
01:04:15,765 --> 01:04:17,264
I like pork belly barbecue with kimchi too.

1452
01:04:17,265 --> 01:04:18,534
(Mu Jin remembered what Bon Hee likes to eat.)

1453
01:04:18,535 --> 01:04:21,305
She said she likes pork belly barbecue with kimchi.

1454
01:04:21,435 --> 01:04:22,475
Bon Hee said that.

1455
01:04:22,975 --> 01:04:24,275
Should I cut up the meat?

1456
01:04:26,105 --> 01:04:27,574
Should I cut it?

1457
01:04:27,575 --> 01:04:30,745
- Only the big pieces like these? - Only the big pieces?

1458
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,785
I like my meat big.

1459
01:04:33,915 --> 01:04:36,785
(He cuts the meat nicely for Bon Hee.)

1460
01:04:37,615 --> 01:04:39,425
(Looking around)

1461
01:04:39,755 --> 01:04:41,385
What do you need? An apron?

1462
01:04:41,855 --> 01:04:43,025
Yes. An apron.

1463
01:04:43,395 --> 01:04:44,655
How did you know?

1464
01:04:45,355 --> 01:04:48,165
When you're in front of someone you like,

1465
01:04:48,525 --> 01:04:50,364
you keep checking what that person needs, don't you?

1466
01:04:50,365 --> 01:04:51,495
- Do you do that? - Yes.

1467
01:04:51,965 --> 01:04:53,205
I guess you don't do that.

1468
01:04:53,465 --> 01:04:55,974
But you need to know that person to do that.

1469
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,674
But when she looks around, you would know.

1470
01:04:57,675 --> 01:04:58,705
I would?

1471
01:05:00,075 --> 01:05:02,845
Excuse me. Do you have an apron?

1472
01:05:04,745 --> 01:05:07,745
You are actually thoughtful.

1473
01:05:07,915 --> 01:05:09,085
Who is?

1474
01:05:09,385 --> 01:05:10,955
I think you are very thoughtful.

1475
01:05:11,085 --> 01:05:12,585
I'm thoughtful?

1476
01:05:13,155 --> 01:05:14,225
Did you know?

1477
01:05:15,485 --> 01:05:17,395
I guess I am.

1478
01:05:25,435 --> 01:05:26,505
I'll wear it alone, okay?

1479
01:05:26,605 --> 01:05:27,905
(Nodding)

1480
01:05:35,245 --> 01:05:37,115
- It's ready to eat. - I think it's ready now.

1481
01:05:37,845 --> 01:05:39,415
Thank you for this.

1482
01:05:39,945 --> 01:05:40,985
It looks so good.

1483
01:05:50,595 --> 01:05:51,624
(They look at each other.)

1484
01:05:51,625 --> 01:05:52,864
(Nodding)

1485
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:53,895
It's good.

1486
01:05:55,865 --> 01:05:57,265
Cheers.

1487
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:59,665
- No. - I will drink slowly.

1488
01:06:04,575 --> 01:06:06,605
Doesn't it taste sweet?

1489
01:06:07,205 --> 01:06:08,405
- Is it sweet? - Yes.

1490
01:06:09,645 --> 01:06:11,445
It's because it's made with the golden ratio.

1491
01:06:13,415 --> 01:06:14,485
That's why it's sweet.

1492
01:06:16,085 --> 01:06:18,815
You actually think you don't have an accent?

1493
01:06:19,025 --> 01:06:21,055
What? When did I speak with an accent?

1494
01:06:25,255 --> 01:06:28,125
When we become more comfortable with each other,

1495
01:06:29,135 --> 01:06:31,265
I think I might speak with a heavier accent.

1496
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,735
I had no idea at first.

1497
01:06:33,805 --> 01:06:34,835
At the cafe.

1498
01:06:35,335 --> 01:06:37,974
But as more time passed, you started to speak with an accent.

1499
01:06:37,975 --> 01:06:39,305
At first, I had no idea.

1500
01:06:41,675 --> 01:06:44,515
Isn't speaking with an accent sometimes really sexy?

1501
01:06:44,975 --> 01:06:47,784
Am I wrong? And when girls speak with an accent,

1502
01:06:47,785 --> 01:06:48,915
they sound cute, don't they?

1503
01:06:49,855 --> 01:06:51,484
(Agreeing)

1504
01:06:51,485 --> 01:06:52,925
What if a man speaks with an accent?

1505
01:06:54,025 --> 01:06:55,745
I think it's a plus when you speak it well.

1506
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,454
I've never dated someone who speaks with an accent.

1507
01:06:58,455 --> 01:06:59,795
You've never dated one?

1508
01:07:07,405 --> 01:07:09,205
You saw all the men yesterday.

1509
01:07:12,645 --> 01:07:14,605
Is there anyone you want to know more about?

1510
01:07:19,815 --> 01:07:21,285
Someone I want to know more about?

1511
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:25,215
(Smiling)

1512
01:07:25,785 --> 01:07:26,954
- Look at him staring at her. - What a question.

1513
01:07:26,955 --> 01:07:28,354
Did you see him smiling like a little devil?

1514
01:07:28,355 --> 01:07:29,725
- Look at him. - He smiled at her.

1515
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,325
It was the smile that said, "You're mine now."

1516
01:07:34,225 --> 01:07:36,095
(Smiling brightly)

1517
01:07:36,995 --> 01:07:39,565
(What's so funny?)

1518
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:41,565
You're curious about that?

1519
01:07:43,305 --> 01:07:44,305
I'm just asking.

1520
01:07:47,845 --> 01:07:49,575
- There's no one. - No one?

1521
01:07:50,245 --> 01:07:51,445
No one so far.

1522
01:07:55,485 --> 01:07:56,555
(Peeking at her)

1523
01:07:57,355 --> 01:07:59,955
I received a text message last night.

1524
01:08:01,885 --> 01:08:02,995
You received only one?

1525
01:08:03,925 --> 01:08:05,094
(Hesitating)

1526
01:08:05,095 --> 01:08:06,165
I got two.

1527
01:08:07,965 --> 01:08:08,995
But there was...

1528
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:14,104
a photo I saw that looked like...

1529
01:08:14,105 --> 01:08:15,335
it was sent by you.

1530
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:18,575
You sent that one, didn't you?

1531
01:08:19,175 --> 01:08:20,945
The color of the sofa.

1532
01:08:21,275 --> 01:08:22,875
I think it was green.

1533
01:08:23,245 --> 01:08:24,575
(Agreeing)

1534
01:08:25,075 --> 01:08:26,815
I thought it might be you.

1535
01:08:27,415 --> 01:08:28,645
And it made me happy.

1536
01:08:31,785 --> 01:08:34,155
My facial muscles are getting stiff.

1537
01:08:38,895 --> 01:08:40,824
I didn't tell you this yesterday, but I like deep green.

1538
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,735
It's actually my favorite color.

1539
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,195
Is it really?

1540
01:08:45,165 --> 01:08:46,445
Then we are the same, aren't we?

1541
01:08:47,335 --> 01:08:48,764
You must've been shocked yesterday then.

1542
01:08:48,765 --> 01:08:51,275
I was shocked. It wasn't just green either.

1543
01:08:52,705 --> 01:08:53,945
It was deep green.

1544
01:08:55,145 --> 01:08:56,745
- Did you not say it on purpose? - No.

1545
01:08:57,745 --> 01:09:01,015
It's because we share a lot of other things in common too.

1546
01:09:01,745 --> 01:09:04,484
When you like someone too much,

1547
01:09:04,485 --> 01:09:05,925
it's hard to express, isn't it?

1548
01:09:07,955 --> 01:09:09,625
(Nodding)

1549
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,655
What's the best dish you can cook?

1550
01:09:12,425 --> 01:09:13,425
Fried rice?

1551
01:09:13,765 --> 01:09:16,005
- Kimchi fried rice? - That I can do. Kimchi fried rice.

1552
01:09:17,095 --> 01:09:18,865
Do you want me to cook it for you later?

1553
01:09:18,995 --> 01:09:21,704
I can eat about two bowls of kimchi fried rice.

1554
01:09:21,705 --> 01:09:22,835
- Two bowls? - Yes.

1555
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:25,334
Okay. Two bowls.

1556
01:09:25,335 --> 01:09:26,705
- Fried rice again? - Fried rice.

1557
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:29,644
Perhaps two men are going to stand in front of the stove...

1558
01:09:29,645 --> 01:09:30,675
and make fried rice.

1559
01:09:33,415 --> 01:09:38,815
(Sang Won and Ye Eun's second date spot is an izakaya.)

1560
01:09:43,525 --> 01:09:44,555
You're not cold?

1561
01:09:44,855 --> 01:09:46,265
- I'm still fine. - You are?

1562
01:09:46,295 --> 01:09:47,495
I'm afraid you might get cold.

1563
01:09:51,835 --> 01:09:52,904
Do you eat this?

1564
01:09:52,905 --> 01:09:53,905
(Shaking her head)

1565
01:09:53,906 --> 01:09:54,935
I'm the same.

1566
01:09:55,565 --> 01:09:58,105
I wondered if you ate it.

1567
01:09:58,275 --> 01:09:59,545
Have you tried it?

1568
01:09:59,675 --> 01:10:01,405
I eat it when someone peels it.

1569
01:10:01,505 --> 01:10:03,375
Would you like it? Do you want me to peel it?

1570
01:10:03,615 --> 01:10:05,144
No, you don't have to do it.

1571
01:10:05,145 --> 01:10:07,025
Let's have it together. I will have a bean too.

1572
01:10:07,985 --> 01:10:09,215
- Wait. - Edamame.

1573
01:10:09,555 --> 01:10:11,855
- How do you do it? - You can't even peel it.

1574
01:10:12,655 --> 01:10:13,685
Can't I just rip it open?

1575
01:10:14,985 --> 01:10:16,155
(Realizing)

1576
01:10:16,525 --> 01:10:17,895
It pops out like this.

1577
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:19,264
Do you want me to hand it like this?

1578
01:10:19,265 --> 01:10:20,725
Maybe you will make it fly?

1579
01:10:21,765 --> 01:10:23,564
(He shoots a bean.)

1580
01:10:23,565 --> 01:10:24,865
You dropped it everywhere.

1581
01:10:25,195 --> 01:10:27,305
(Her guess was right.)

1582
01:10:27,435 --> 01:10:28,465
I am sorry.

1583
01:10:30,635 --> 01:10:33,705
Why don't we just put it here like how they put wasabi?

1584
01:10:34,175 --> 01:10:36,075
Nobody would notice it even if we don't eat it.

1585
01:10:37,345 --> 01:10:38,944
- Do you like wasabi? - I like it.

1586
01:10:38,945 --> 01:10:40,345
I love it.

1587
01:10:40,685 --> 01:10:41,685
It's...

1588
01:10:41,686 --> 01:10:42,715
Should we ask for a lot?

1589
01:10:43,315 --> 01:10:44,355
A mountain of it, perhaps?

1590
01:10:44,685 --> 01:10:47,385
- A mountain of it, perhaps? - Only if we need more.

1591
01:10:49,525 --> 01:10:51,055
(Thinking)

1592
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:56,335
Actually, here's what I'm thinking.

1593
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:58,495
We met for the first time.

1594
01:10:58,565 --> 01:10:59,934
We are bound to be a little awkward.

1595
01:10:59,935 --> 01:11:01,405
We are strangers after all.

1596
01:11:02,105 --> 01:11:05,075
When do we drop the honorifics?

1597
01:11:05,235 --> 01:11:08,205
Or do we keep the honorifics? That's difficult for me.

1598
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:11,175
That's understandable.

1599
01:11:12,515 --> 01:11:15,485
Are you suggesting that we drop it now?

1600
01:11:17,455 --> 01:11:18,455
Why don't we drop it now?

1601
01:11:19,325 --> 01:11:21,625
(He's very assertive.)

1602
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:23,154
Why don't we drop it now?

1603
01:11:23,155 --> 01:11:24,195
Shall we?

1604
01:11:24,525 --> 01:11:25,595
Let's do it.

1605
01:11:26,525 --> 01:11:27,565
Drop the honorifics.

1606
01:11:28,265 --> 01:11:30,134
It's a little tough when you drop it suddenly, you know?

1607
01:11:30,135 --> 01:11:31,734
It was his idea in the first place.

1608
01:11:31,735 --> 01:11:32,904
And now he's shy.

1609
01:11:32,905 --> 01:11:35,935
He had the manly side.

1610
01:11:36,405 --> 01:11:39,205
That made my heart skip a beat.

1611
01:11:45,985 --> 01:11:47,215
I can't talk now.

1612
01:11:47,985 --> 01:11:49,815
Should we keep it until we feel comfortable?

1613
01:11:50,285 --> 01:11:51,385
I like that too.

1614
01:11:51,855 --> 01:11:54,184
Let's mix.

1615
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:55,185
We will mix it up.

1616
01:11:57,525 --> 01:11:59,495
- Here's your food. - Thank you.

1617
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:01,494
You said you like wasabi.

1618
01:12:01,495 --> 01:12:02,734
- Here's your wasabi. - Thank you.

1619
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,194
(Sang Won turns the plate so wasabi goes to Ye Eun.)

1620
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:06,565
Do we have wasabi at Yeon House?

1621
01:12:07,065 --> 01:12:08,335
- We don't have it. - We don't?

1622
01:12:08,565 --> 01:12:10,405
But I haven't really checked.

1623
01:12:12,435 --> 01:12:13,475
Anyway.

1624
01:12:13,945 --> 01:12:16,115
Wasabi is important.

1625
01:12:18,245 --> 01:12:20,744
(Smiling)

1626
01:12:20,745 --> 01:12:21,815
(Happy)

1627
01:12:22,245 --> 01:12:25,954
(Hesitating)

1628
01:12:25,955 --> 01:12:26,985
I'm curious.

1629
01:12:28,555 --> 01:12:31,115
I've been wanting to ask you this, even when we were in the car.

1630
01:12:31,525 --> 01:12:33,065
By any chance, were you glad...

1631
01:12:34,025 --> 01:12:37,965
when I asked you on a date? Or...

1632
01:12:38,665 --> 01:12:41,205
You know, I was... How should I say this?

1633
01:12:42,565 --> 01:12:44,304
I didn't think you'd ask me.

1634
01:12:44,305 --> 01:12:46,051
Right. I wanted to ask you about that kind of thing.

1635
01:12:46,075 --> 01:12:47,604
I figured you might not have expected it.

1636
01:12:47,605 --> 01:12:49,745
To be honest, I really didn't expect it.

1637
01:12:50,045 --> 01:12:53,315
For me, I was like, "I'm curious about her."

1638
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:56,085
"Her personality isn't what I thought it was."

1639
01:12:56,155 --> 01:12:58,814
"I thought she'd be really cold, but she isn't."

1640
01:12:58,815 --> 01:13:00,455
You seemed really cheerful.

1641
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:03,254
I had that thought while we were eating.

1642
01:13:03,255 --> 01:13:05,495
- While we were eating? - We sat across from each other.

1643
01:13:05,555 --> 01:13:06,624
(During breakfast, the two sat across from each other.)

1644
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:08,365
(Sang Won, Ye Eun)

1645
01:13:09,265 --> 01:13:12,705
(Unlike her cold image, Ye Eun's behavior was different.)

1646
01:13:13,335 --> 01:13:16,835
(Finding her cute)

1647
01:13:17,035 --> 01:13:18,104
That was the first time I got a good look at you...

1648
01:13:18,105 --> 01:13:20,775
and realized you have such a small face.

1649
01:13:21,175 --> 01:13:22,621
That was the first time I got a really good look at you.

1650
01:13:22,645 --> 01:13:25,125
You can't really get a close look when you're just passing by.

1651
01:13:25,915 --> 01:13:26,915
I was surprised.

1652
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:28,284
(I was surprised when I saw you from up close.)

1653
01:13:28,285 --> 01:13:29,454
I'm not kidding.

1654
01:13:29,455 --> 01:13:30,455
(Giggling)

1655
01:13:30,456 --> 01:13:32,984
I think it's just a fact that you have a small face.

1656
01:13:32,985 --> 01:13:34,865
(She feels great at the series of compliments.)

1657
01:13:37,095 --> 01:13:39,195
How many people do you want to get to know more?

1658
01:13:42,025 --> 01:13:43,965
(Thinking)

1659
01:13:47,865 --> 01:13:48,905
One person?

1660
01:13:50,435 --> 01:13:51,435
One person?

1661
01:13:51,475 --> 01:13:53,574
(Thinking)

1662
01:13:53,575 --> 01:13:54,895
I think there's one other person.

1663
01:13:55,775 --> 01:13:57,015
He's so honest.

1664
01:13:57,845 --> 01:14:00,144
But it's better to do that rather than choose someone else later.

1665
01:14:00,145 --> 01:14:01,585
I think just saying it is better.

1666
01:14:01,685 --> 01:14:04,285
No. We already heard the answer earlier.

1667
01:14:05,255 --> 01:14:06,985
(The answer?)

1668
01:14:07,355 --> 01:14:10,255
- You're the only one right now. - You're the only one right now?

1669
01:14:10,455 --> 01:14:11,455
- Right. - Right now...

1670
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:14,564
Not me. I think it's better to say that there's one other person.

1671
01:14:14,565 --> 01:14:17,764
What if he chooses someone else after this?

1672
01:14:17,765 --> 01:14:18,995
I'd be more annoyed.

1673
01:14:21,465 --> 01:14:22,465
You're so honest.

1674
01:14:22,705 --> 01:14:23,705
One person?

1675
01:14:23,706 --> 01:14:25,934
(Thinking)

1676
01:14:25,935 --> 01:14:27,255
I think there's one other person.

1677
01:14:27,575 --> 01:14:29,445
The vibe has slightly shifted.

1678
01:14:30,575 --> 01:14:32,985
But I think it's not about getting to know...

1679
01:14:34,785 --> 01:14:36,545
I can't figure that person out, to be exact.

1680
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,254
"What kind of person is she?"

1681
01:14:39,255 --> 01:14:41,254
(He's curious about one other person besides Ye Eun.)

1682
01:14:41,255 --> 01:14:43,335
I think I should have some level of understanding...

1683
01:14:44,425 --> 01:14:46,464
to become more strongly attracted.

1684
01:14:46,465 --> 01:14:49,425
And I think I need that stronger attraction to actively move forward.

1685
01:14:49,995 --> 01:14:51,065
You think so?

1686
01:14:51,765 --> 01:14:53,705
- Her energy level has dropped. - It has.

1687
01:14:56,805 --> 01:15:00,244
Well, I just... Do what you want, Sang Won.

1688
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:01,975
Don't think too much about it.

1689
01:15:03,715 --> 01:15:06,445
I shouldn't think too much when it comes to emotions.

1690
01:15:10,015 --> 01:15:12,215
I just didn't feel that great.

1691
01:15:13,955 --> 01:15:17,555
I'm not really sure...

1692
01:15:17,995 --> 01:15:22,195
what he's trying to express with his uncertain behavior.

1693
01:15:25,135 --> 01:15:26,564
(The air suddenly seems much heavier.)

1694
01:15:26,565 --> 01:15:28,325
- Oh, no. - Things suddenly became so heavy.

1695
01:15:29,335 --> 01:15:31,134
- Oh, no. - Gosh, he was too honest.

1696
01:15:31,135 --> 01:15:33,104
Oh, no. Her face is expressionless.

1697
01:15:33,105 --> 01:15:34,875
See? This is what happens.

1698
01:15:35,205 --> 01:15:36,944
Gosh, I still think it's better to say it, though.

1699
01:15:36,945 --> 01:15:38,074
- Oh, no. - Let's put...

1700
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:39,235
the heavy conversation aside.

1701
01:15:39,315 --> 01:15:42,215
- Let's eat. - Oh, no.

1702
01:15:43,255 --> 01:15:44,815
Gosh, but Ye Eun is so...

1703
01:15:46,685 --> 01:15:48,424
How much wasabi do I put... Should I put it on?

1704
01:15:48,425 --> 01:15:50,105
Oh, I guess I don't have to put that much.

1705
01:15:51,825 --> 01:15:53,025
Don't you dip it in soy sauce?

1706
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:55,065
- I don't really do that. - Oh, really?

1707
01:15:57,565 --> 01:15:58,565
That's good.

1708
01:15:59,935 --> 01:16:01,334
Oh, no.

1709
01:16:01,335 --> 01:16:02,641
(They go through many emotions on the night of the first date.)

1710
01:16:02,665 --> 01:16:04,974
Gosh, what are we going to do about this vibe?

1711
01:16:04,975 --> 01:16:05,975
(Everyone is at a loss.)

1712
01:16:06,175 --> 01:16:07,275
Oh, dear.

1713
01:16:08,475 --> 01:16:09,874
This is really bad.

1714
01:16:09,875 --> 01:16:12,985
Gosh, but Ye Eun... Is it really necessary for her...

1715
01:16:13,145 --> 01:16:16,855
to express how disappointed she is?

1716
01:16:17,285 --> 01:16:22,224
But don't you think that Sang Won would make her feel better?

1717
01:16:22,225 --> 01:16:24,424
I think that will require so much effort...

1718
01:16:24,425 --> 01:16:26,095
- to do so. Yes. - Lots of effort?

1719
01:16:27,325 --> 01:16:29,264
(After the date, )

1720
01:16:29,265 --> 01:16:31,135
(the mood has become frigid.)

1721
01:16:31,965 --> 01:16:33,835
(I have a headache.)

1722
01:16:34,765 --> 01:16:36,204
(The date...)

1723
01:16:36,205 --> 01:16:37,905
(wasn't enjoyable.)

1724
01:16:38,175 --> 01:16:41,105
(I want to get to know her more.)

1725
01:16:42,275 --> 01:16:47,485
(At Yeon House, the temperature seems subtly different.)

1726
01:16:48,315 --> 01:16:51,584
(And...)

1727
01:16:51,585 --> 01:16:55,255
(a mysterious car arrives at Yeon House.)

1728
01:16:58,255 --> 01:17:01,125
(Will a younger guy appear to change the temperature?)

1729
01:17:01,995 --> 01:17:03,695
(I don't care about age differences.)

1730
01:17:05,395 --> 01:17:08,205
(I think I just need 3 seconds to make a decision.)

1731
01:17:08,405 --> 01:17:10,234
(No way.)

1732
01:17:10,235 --> 01:17:11,335
- Hello. - Hello.

1733
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,145
(He looked cool.)

1734
01:17:15,045 --> 01:17:17,275
(He had a huge impact.)

1735
01:17:18,015 --> 01:17:21,215
(The mood changes with the appearance of a new younger guy.)

1736
01:17:22,145 --> 01:17:24,615
(The beginning of a change in the game at Yeon House)

1737
01:17:30,455 --> 01:17:32,825
(Could we talk for a bit?)

1738
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,995
(I can't really express everything in my heart.)

1739
01:17:36,665 --> 01:17:39,235
(It does make me jealous.)
