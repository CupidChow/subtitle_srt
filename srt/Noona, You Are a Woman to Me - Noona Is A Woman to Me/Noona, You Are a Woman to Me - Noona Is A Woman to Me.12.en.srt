1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:03,609
(Sang Won chose So Hyun as his Day Date.)

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:06,508
(Nothing has been decided yet.)

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,078
(Even if one has made up their mind, )

4
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:09,879
(they could have a change of heart.)

5
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:12,848
(Let's make a final push.)

6
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:13,919
(I should give it a shot.)

7
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,029
(Looking at Sang Won's eyes and expressions...)

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,558
(made me a little confused.)

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,028
(It could be confusing.)

10
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:22,558
(Because nothing...)

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,199
(has been settled yet.)

12
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:30,069
(Ji Won couldn't find certainty from Sang Won.)

13
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,769
(So Hyun and Ji Yung have their Night Date.)

14
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:38,679
(Ji Yung only had eyes for So Hyun until the very end.)

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,778
(I have no regrets.)

16
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:42,878
It's nice.

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:43,879
- Really? - Yes.

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,489
(So Hyun keeps feeling both bad and grateful towards Ji Yung.)

19
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:53,128
(Yeong Gyeong and Hyeon Jun's Night Date)

20
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:54,229
From now on...

21
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,928
(Hyeon Jun wants to know about Yeong Gyeong's feelings...)

22
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:58,699
(before the final decision.)

23
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,928
(The answer to it.)

24
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:05,239
(You'll probably find out tomorrow.)

25
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,909
(Yeong Gyeong gave him a vague answer.)

26
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:10,579
(The 12-year gap, Bon Hee and Mu Jin's Night Date)

27
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,808
(Are you worried about anything?)

28
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:14,648
(Worried?)

29
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:19,378
(You might worry...)

30
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,889
(more than me.)

31
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:24,019
(Do my eyes say that I'm in a dilemma?)

32
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:27,389
(I can't tell today.)

33
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:30,189
(Their feelings waver right before the final decision.)

34
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:32,199
(So Hyun and Sang Hyeon's Night Date)

35
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:36,398
(I'm attracted to both someone different from me...)

36
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:39,169
(and someone similar to me.)

37
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:43,238
(So you thought about it.)

38
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,739
(And for a long while at that.)

39
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,749
(She realized he was also interested in another girl.)

40
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:51,679
(And then came the Truth or Dare time.)

41
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:55,119
(Is there a moment you want to undo?)

42
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,118
(No.)

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,688
(I stayed true to my feelings...)

44
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:02,289
(every minute, every second.)

45
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:06,629
(So Hyun doesn't regret any of her decisions.)

46
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:11,669
(Did you have a change of heart after today's dates?)

47
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:14,039
(Yes.)

48
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,208
(Even I don't know...)

49
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,709
(what kind of decision I'll make.)

50
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,649
(To whom will they settle their feelings on?)

51
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,848
To the question of whether his feelings had changed...

52
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:28,088
after the Day and Night Dates,

53
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:29,518
Sang Hyeon answered "yes..."

54
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:31,195
- after much deliberation. - That's right.

55
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:34,728
Who do you think Sang Hyeon's feelings are headed towards?

56
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,558
- Today is the last episode. - Yes.

57
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:38,699
I really have no clue how they are feeling.

58
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:42,398
Even when I think I have an idea,

59
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:43,399
I'm proven wrong.

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,798
There were many confusing moments,

61
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:49,209
so I'm worried whether there will even be any final couples.

62
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:54,379
(After the confusing Truth or Dare)

63
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,019
I'm curious about what they'll talk about.

64
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:02,319
- I want to ask something. - What is it?

65
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:05,059
- It's about Sang Hyeon. - Okay.

66
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:08,459
- When we meet up and talk, - Yes.

67
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:10,229
- I can feel he likes me. - I see.

68
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:13,468
But he said that he had a change of heart...

69
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:15,469
through today's dates.

70
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:18,569
During our date today,

71
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:23,378
Sang Hyeon said he had two people in mind.

72
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:24,739
- Today? - Yes.

73
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:27,349
- During the date? - Yes.

74
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,149
- Why does he even say that? - What did you ask?

75
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,678
I don't remember clearly.

76
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:34,319
But I said today was the toughest day for me.

77
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,788
After hearing that, he said, "Is that so?"

78
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:40,029
- "You dated with them?" - How many dates did you go on?

79
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:42,489
Four.

80
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:45,329
Maybe Sang Hyeon knew that.

81
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:48,529
I don't think he knew how many dates I went on.

82
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,039
Did it not show?

83
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:52,969
I don't know. I don't remember.

84
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:55,438
I'm just curious, okay?

85
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,938
Even at a glance, he's into me.

86
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:00,049
But I have no clue who this other girl he's thinking about is.

87
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:03,419
- She doesn't? - It's your roommate.

88
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:05,378
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

89
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,379
(Thinking)

90
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,288
I can't figure it out, you know? What he's thinking.

91
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:11,458
Me neither.

92
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,489
(So Hyun doesn't know about Bon Hee and Sang Hyeon's Day Date.)

93
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:17,329
Was it Yeong Gyeong? I don't think so.

94
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:19,458
I'm sure it wasn't Yeong Gyeong.

95
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,929
But then who else could it be?

96
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,169
- Either way, - Right.

97
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,968
Him telling me that...

98
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:27,339
made me feel strange too.

99
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:30,108
"I'll have to wait and see" is all I can say.

100
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:31,939
- I get it. - Right?

101
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:35,208
What should Bon Hee say in that situation?

102
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,278
- Right now... - She has to keep a poker face.

103
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,578
- Bon Hee can't let it show. - Oh, dear.

104
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:39,579
She must play innocent.

105
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,220
- Exactly. - It must put her on the spot.

106
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,558
So here's what I'm thinking.

107
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:47,759
With the warm feelings from Yeon House,

108
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:51,798
Sang Hyeon might take...

109
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,298
the relationship seriously.

110
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:55,728
Or maybe not. I could become serious too.

111
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,339
But with someone as unclear as him, I can't get serious.

112
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:00,039
Never.

113
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,539
Because I know...

114
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:06,339
he thinks a lot,

115
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:08,749
I've understood him until now.

116
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:10,079
If not...

117
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:13,019
Bon Hee's mind must be a mess right now.

118
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:16,218
The answer Sang Hyeon gave me today...

119
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:17,699
was far from what I could understand.

120
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,828
I'm sure he has his reasons.

121
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,359
He always does.

122
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:29,299
(Sang Hyeon's wishy-washy attitude has made So Hyun extremely upset.)

123
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:31,699
Despite my growing feelings for him,

124
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:36,539
I have a hunch that we don't click and that things won't work out.

125
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,079
So I'm getting emotional.

126
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,349
I'm sorry.

127
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:52,289
(So Hyun ends up crying.)

128
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:57,528
Right now, things are...

129
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,329
(Things are really hard for me.)

130
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:04,298
(And...)

131
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:06,568
(the last day in Yeon House has come.)

132
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:08,309
It's really the last day.

133
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:11,479
(Sighing)

134
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,349
(Sighing)

135
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,218
(With the final decision right ahead)

136
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:20,488
- I'm so curious. - Everyone must be in a dilemma.

137
00:06:20,489 --> 00:06:21,749
Everyone is sighing.

138
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:25,988
(A text has arrived in Yeon House.)

139
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:27,129
They got a text.

140
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,929
What is it? Did we get something?

141
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,029
- What could it be? - I wonder.

142
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:43,679
(Head to the Secret Room and make your final decision.)

143
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:48,948
(Opened for the final decision)

144
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:52,149
(Secret Room)

145
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,719
(The last decision in Yeon House)

146
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,058
(Make your final decision by putting the photo in the drawer...)

147
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:05,859
(of the person you have feelings for.)

148
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:09,369
Today is finally the day.

149
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,269
I still have a lot on my mind.

150
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:14,939
I can tell how worried he is.

151
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,009
"Are we really not cut out for each other?"

152
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,379
That's the realistic part.

153
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:24,419
I don't want him to get hurt.

154
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:26,779
I've finally found my path.

155
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:29,549
(What decisions did they make?)

156
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,689
Now then, what kind of decision did they make?

157
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,328
(Exclaiming)

158
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,389
The last day.

159
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,998
- Shall we make guesses? - Okay.

160
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,059
- My guess is two final couples. - Whom and whom?

161
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,899
Ji Won and Sang Won.

162
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:45,698
Bon Hee and Mu Jin.

163
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,699
Okay.

164
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:48,768
I think either 1 or 2 final couples.

165
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,138
- One couple? - Yes.

166
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:51,909
If it's just one, whom with whom?

167
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,055
- Mu Jin and Bon Hee. - Mu Jin and Bon Hee.

168
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,548
Only Mu Jin and Bon Hee will make it.

169
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:56,549
(Embarrassed)

170
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,479
First off, So Hyun and Sang Hyeon.

171
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,988
- So Hyun and Sang Hyeon? - I think they will become a couple.

172
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:04,488
- Next is Ji Won and Sang Won. - Sang Won.

173
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:05,718
- Ji Won and Sang Won. - The Won-Won couple.

174
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:06,719
- Won-Won. - Yes.

175
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,628
Won-Won will become a couple.

176
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:09,988
And also, Mu Jin and Bon Hee.

177
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,359
- Even Mu Jin and Bon Hee? - Yes.

178
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:12,728
- Three couples in total. - Three couples.

179
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:13,729
That's right.

180
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,268
Hold on. I don't think Mu Jin and Bon Hee will work out.

181
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:17,539
- What? - For real?

182
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,868
I'm not certain about Mu Jin and Bon Hee.

183
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:21,968
- It might... - They won't become a couple?

184
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,309
- No, they won't. - Really?

185
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,978
It's a possibility.

186
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:25,979
(No way.)

187
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,848
(The last day in Yeon House)

188
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:34,549
(The Love QR Zone has opened.)

189
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,688
(What's the last message in the Love QR Code?)

190
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:41,758
- The last Love QR Code. - Gosh.

191
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,399
(Bon Hee)

192
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:48,968
(Sang Won has entered with a nervous face.)

193
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:50,029
It's Sang Won.

194
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:54,809
(Which older woman has been matched with Sang Won?)

195
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,549
(Exhaling)

196
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,808
(Checking with anxiety)

197
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:07,089
(The last Love QR Code)

198
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,789
(Did the person I chose also choose me?)

199
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:16,489
(Nervous)

200
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:23,298
(While tensed up, )

201
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:26,239
(the older women and younger men check the last QR code.)

202
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,479
Is this even possible?

203
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,579
Is it?

204
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:39,118
- What? What is it this time? - What is it?

205
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,648
(They are shocked after checking the Love QR Code.)

206
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,169
- Is something going on? - What is it?

207
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:47,988
I thought it was the final decision, so it left me in great shock.

208
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:50,599
- What does that mean? - There must be something.

209
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:52,759
It's a moment where I could think about...

210
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:56,729
whether I could take the relationship further.

211
00:09:57,569 --> 00:10:00,939
(What's the message in the Love QR Code that shocked everyone?)

212
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,509
(The final decision will be made 7 days later!)

213
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:08,508
(Decide on where and when to meet your matched partner 7 days later.)

214
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:10,048
(The final couple will be decided in 7 days.)

215
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:11,049
- "The final decision..." - "The final decision..."

216
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,210
- "will be made seven days later." - Seven days later?

217
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,019
Seriously?

218
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:17,789
(This is how it goes?)

219
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:20,059
To make the final decision seven days later?

220
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,658
For seven days, they'll return...

221
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:23,129
- to their normal lives? - Yes.

222
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,828
The person you miss even at home is the one.

223
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:27,028
- Exactly. - This is...

224
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:28,105
That's what I love about it.

225
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,129
I love this method.

226
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,338
- It is a new method. - I like it.

227
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,769
I've never seen it before.

228
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,779
(They leave the Yeon House where they were solely focused on love.)

229
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,208
This is tricky.

230
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:38,808
I bet they were all surprised.

231
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:40,108
- I bet. - I'm sure they were startled.

232
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:41,509
- Right. - Right.

233
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,218
I liked it...

234
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:46,478
because I could take the time to see who was right for me...

235
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,159
and whether it was the right relationship.

236
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:50,459
- She got the chance to think. - Yes.

237
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:54,529
I was dumbfounded.

238
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:57,059
I'll need to clear my head.

239
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,399
Living ordinarily for a week,

240
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:03,229
the feelings that I felt while I was here...

241
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,039
could change.

242
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,069
I'll go back to my everyday life...

243
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,608
and rethink the emotions...

244
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:13,339
that I felt here.

245
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,849
I reckon there will be people...

246
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,248
who are happy about this situation...

247
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:19,548
and those who aren't.

248
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:20,588
- Right. - Really?

249
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:24,088
Because not everyone feels the same way,

250
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:28,789
some might think, "I need to make things work..."

251
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,398
"during this period."

252
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,699
And some might think, "After spending seven days separately,"

253
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:37,138
"the feelings for me may not be as strong anymore."

254
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:38,139
Exactly.

255
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,199
They're going to make it this realistic?

256
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,439
That's incredible.

257
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:46,109
(Which couple will reunite after 7 days?)

258
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:53,613
(The younger men wait for the older women.)

259
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:56,385
(If they chose each other, the woman will visit the man.)

260
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,550
(Can they promise to meet the women after 7 days?)

261
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:02,754
I regret a lot of things.

262
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,224
I wish we had more time.

263
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,034
If I could...

264
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:14,404
go on more dates with the person I wanted...

265
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:18,884
If I'm right about the feelings I felt,

266
00:12:18,984 --> 00:12:21,413
I'm sure I'll meet her again.

267
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:22,983
- It's Bon Hee. - He sounds confident.

268
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:24,013
Yes, it must be Bon Hee.

269
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:27,583
I want to get to know her better.

270
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:28,984
(I want to get to know her better.)

271
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:31,324
I have no other reasons.

272
00:12:31,424 --> 00:12:32,463
My feelings for her are sincere.

273
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:34,264
- Gosh. - That's admirable.

274
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:39,534
(Who chose each other?)

275
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:44,733
(Waiting for the older woman of his choice...)

276
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:48,374
(is Sang Hyeon.)

277
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:51,113
Let's find out.

278
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:53,944
(Did she choose him back?)

279
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:57,354
I made up my mind,

280
00:12:57,454 --> 00:12:59,954
and this is my final decision.

281
00:13:01,184 --> 00:13:05,424
(Rather than physical traits, my ideal type has always been...)

282
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:11,234
(someone who never makes me feel small.)

283
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:14,764
(Seeing you, I finally understand what type of person is.)

284
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:18,774
(The person who doesn't make me feel small.)

285
00:13:19,504 --> 00:13:22,413
(We certainly know...)

286
00:13:22,414 --> 00:13:24,984
(that you and I are different.)

287
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:28,854
(I'm curious about your world.)

288
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:34,654
(Is he waiting for Bon Hee or So Hyun?)

289
00:13:40,964 --> 00:13:45,833
(Behind Sang Hyeon, )

290
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:46,834
She's here!
(a woman walks in.)

291
00:13:49,034 --> 00:13:50,034
Hey.

292
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:51,903
(The woman that he promises to meet again in 7 days is...)

293
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:52,904
Who is it?

294
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:57,778
(Behind Sang Hyeon, )

295
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:58,779
She's here!
(a woman walks in.)

296
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,019
Hey.

297
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:03,818
(The woman that he promises to meet again in 7 days is...)

298
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:04,819
Who is it?

299
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:08,158
(So Hyun)

300
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,329
It was So Hyun.

301
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:10,929
Congratulations.

302
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,959
I'm so relieved.

303
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:24,209
(So Hyun and Sang Hyeon chose each other.)

304
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:27,379
This is so gratifying.

305
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:30,648
So Hyun was the one who really made my heart flutter.

306
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:32,119
Really?

307
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:37,119
I was considering Bon Hee again without realizing.

308
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,858
That's why I was so torn.

309
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:41,459
(He was torn until the very end.)

310
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,998
But the woman I want to keep in touch with...

311
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:45,328
and get to know more outside this place...

312
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:46,599
is So Hyun.

313
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:49,728
So, I made my final decision.

314
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:50,798
(Sang Hyeon chose So Hyun.)

315
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,938
- That's a relief. - It is.

316
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:54,139
I'm so happy for him.

317
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:57,379
(Glancing)

318
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,378
She's staring right into his eyes!

319
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,449
- This is so nice. - Oh, my.

320
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,018
- She's so attractive. - So Hyun is...

321
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,679
staring at him like,

322
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:11,219
"Why did you give me such a hard time?"

323
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:13,288
That's the look on her face!

324
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:15,458
- Seriously. - "You were torn?"

325
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:16,958
- "And puzzled?" - Exactly.

326
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,229
"Puzzled how?"

327
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:19,329
"Puzzled how?"

328
00:15:19,729 --> 00:15:22,899
SOOBIN, how would you feel if an older woman stared at you?

329
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,599
I think it'll be too much for me,

330
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:29,538
but if So Hyun were to stare at me like that,

331
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:32,178
- Yes. - it must hit different.

332
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:34,979
Isn't she so attractive?

333
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:37,248
Her eyes are full of affection, no?

334
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:39,049
- They are. - Right?

335
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,839
It's the look when you're looking at someone you like.

336
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:45,019
(Staring)

337
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:49,029
(He can't meet her eyes.)

338
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,069
(The Golden Retriever is back.)

339
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:57,338
- "Golden Retriever." - He's back to being one.

340
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:58,369
Oh, my gosh.

341
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,609
(Gently looking)

342
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:08,749
You're pretty.

343
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:11,518
(What a great line!)

344
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,978
"You're pretty."

345
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:14,649
(Their hearts are about to burst.)

346
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:16,319
You're pretty.

347
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:19,689
(Giggling)

348
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:22,129
I've always been pretty.

349
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,969
(Feeling shy)

350
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:34,308
It certainly feels different...

351
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:35,709
after you make your choice.

352
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:38,039
Different how?

353
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:42,249
But my mind is fully made up now.

354
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:45,119
After seeing the result?

355
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,919
After I made my choice...

356
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:51,359
and after seeing the choice you made.

357
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,219
I'm glad.

358
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:58,029
I thought about...

359
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:00,698
who I wanted to keep in touch with...

360
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:03,769
when we leave this place,

361
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,369
and it was genuinely you.

362
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:10,909
I'm not sure if you can feel it, though.

363
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:21,119
We're supposed to make a decision in seven days.

364
00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:23,449
- Did you see that? - Yes.

365
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:27,388
It's a bit... Anyway...

366
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:28,659
(So Hyun seems worried.)

367
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,759
I just...

368
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:34,629
Well, when one week...

369
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:37,299
passes,

370
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:43,139
I don't know how you'll change your mind.

371
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:47,509
You seem like you're changing your mind twice a day.

372
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:49,978
- That's true. - Right.

373
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:51,849
- He's indecisive. - Right.

374
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:54,388
- She must be worried. - Indeed.

375
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:56,295
(So Hyun is worried that he'll have a change of heart.)

376
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,559
Do what you want.

377
00:17:58,189 --> 00:17:59,189
About what?

378
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:02,188
However you're feeling in seven days.

379
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:03,358
That's disappointing to hear.

380
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,228
I've given you a hard time long enough,

381
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:07,299
so I felt bad.

382
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:09,829
You're right.

383
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:13,598
You must have a lot on your mind.

384
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,638
Yes.

385
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:17,508
He should be straightforward when he's going for her,

386
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,908
but he's taking another step back.

387
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:20,978
(This is frustrating.)

388
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:22,779
It must be dispiriting.

389
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:25,648
A week isn't enough time...

390
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:27,118
to express their love.

391
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,488
It's a very insecure situation, right?

392
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:30,519
- It is. - We can't predict anything.

393
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:32,818
- It'll be decided after seven days. - It's how you feel.

394
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,619
(No one can know how they'll feel in 7 days.)

395
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:36,959
He's an overthinker,

396
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,499
and that confuses me.

397
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,599
Now that we have seven days,

398
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:48,509
he'll live in his own head during those days.

399
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,879
Then, the result might change.

400
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,339
Right now, I'm insecure...

401
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,909
because he might not reciprocate my feelings,

402
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:59,279
and I'm afraid...

403
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,219
of getting hurt again.

404
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:06,289
I was extremely confused.

405
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:10,089
In seven days,

406
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:13,599
we're supposed to make one more decision, right?

407
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:16,699
We've never talked in the real world,

408
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:18,239
so I'm worried about that too.

409
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:20,599
I didn't think it would mean much...

410
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:22,238
for me to rashly say,

411
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,809
"It's all going to be okay."

412
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,409
I'm worried about multiple things.

413
00:19:31,449 --> 00:19:32,919
Anyway, where...

414
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,748
Where?

415
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:36,688
No, next week...

416
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,119
(Next week...)

417
00:19:38,989 --> 00:19:40,219
Next Sunday?

418
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:42,929
- Next Sunday? - Yes. Next Sunday.

419
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:44,959
Maybe...

420
00:19:45,729 --> 00:19:46,829
at 7pm?

421
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:50,299
Next Sunday at 7pm.

422
00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:51,699
- Good. - Yes.

423
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:53,239
All right.

424
00:19:55,969 --> 00:20:01,049
(Can they meet again after 7 days?)

425
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:06,278
(Waiting for the woman of his choice is...)

426
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:09,689
(Hyeon Jun.)

427
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:12,319
I've expressed all my feelings,

428
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:15,529
so I don't regret anything.

429
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:19,399
(Did she choose him back?)

430
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,068
(Clicking)

431
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:22,129
Someone's coming out.

432
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:26,499
(Nervous)

433
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:31,538
(The one walking in...)

434
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:35,979
(is Yeong Gyeong.)

435
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:39,118
(Grinning)

436
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,219
He's so happy!

437
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:47,589
(Yeong Gyeong and Hyeon Jun promise to meet again in 7 days.)

438
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,059
I'm happy.

439
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:55,169
(Yeong Gyeong and Hyeon Jun chose each other.)

440
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,969
I have a question, though.

441
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,999
What is it?

442
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:03,838
Why did you choose me?

443
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,739
(He wants to know why she picked him.)

444
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:09,509
I was honest about my feelings and followed...

445
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,419
my heart.

446
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:16,519
There was only one person...

447
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,788
who made my heart flutter.

448
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:24,559
(The one man that made Yeong Gyeong's heart flutter)

449
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:28,629
(The two start and finish their day in the Yeon House.)

450
00:21:28,969 --> 00:21:31,399
- We have to pick... - Yes.

451
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:33,069
The location and time, right?

452
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:36,039
Have you thought about where you wanted to go?

453
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:37,608
(Shaking her head)

454
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:38,739
No?

455
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,549
I actually thought of one.

456
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:45,318
An amusement park.

457
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,418
(Hyeon Jun wants to meet at an amusement park.)

458
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:47,419
Yes.

459
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,819
You said you wanted to go, so...

460
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:52,888
He remembered.

461
00:21:52,889 --> 00:21:55,389
Should we go to an amusement park?

462
00:21:55,489 --> 00:21:57,159
Sure. Let's go to an amusement park.

463
00:21:58,699 --> 00:21:59,959
What time?

464
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,699
At 1pm?

465
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:05,939
Good. Meet me there at 1pm.

466
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:07,769
I wonder how it will go.

467
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:13,209
It would be a long-distance relationship,

468
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:16,978
but I'm not sure what it's actually like.

469
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:18,395
(The distance between Seoul and Gyeongju)

470
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:23,089
I'm pretty discreet,

471
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:25,858
so I want to make use of these seven days...

472
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:29,528
to think about the realistic issues...

473
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:31,359
one by one.

474
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,858
(What will be their decisions in 7 days?)

475
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:34,899
Seven days.

476
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:36,699
I wonder how it'll go.

477
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:39,869
Sang Won.

478
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,190
(Sang Won waits for the woman he chose for the last time.)

479
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:45,109
(Tense)

480
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,849
(Did she choose him back?)

481
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:53,618
(The woman who will promise him to meet again in 7 days...)

482
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:54,648
Who is it?

483
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:57,048
(The woman who will promise him to meet again in 7 days is Ji Won.)

484
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:58,318
- Good for him. - Congrats.

485
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,259
Goodness, Ji Won.

486
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:02,929
I thought it was this.

487
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:04,499
So did I.

488
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:07,829
It was so dark out here.

489
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:10,428
We once talked over there, so...

490
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:12,389
- I didn't know there was space. - Neither did I.

491
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:18,039
(Shy)

492
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,708
It's the final moment.

493
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:21,949
How do you feel?

494
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:23,479
How do I feel?

495
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,719
What's with that look?

496
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:28,648
I saw that we were supposed to pick...

497
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:31,219
the time and location after seven days.

498
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,358
I thought...

499
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,088
(Hesitant)

500
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:37,958
Well, I had so much on my mind...

501
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,458
and panicked.

502
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,169
- It suddenly feels real, right? - Yes!

503
00:23:41,729 --> 00:23:43,598
I took the time to think,

504
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,838
- but it felt so sudden. - Right.

505
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,739
Going back...

506
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:51,108
to our ordinary lives is a totally different matter.

507
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:52,109
Yes.

508
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,839
You're right.

509
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:57,278
It felt so realistic,

510
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,879
and I started...

511
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:01,819
thinking about the problems...

512
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:04,249
that I was never worried about.

513
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:06,418
It felt like I should be careful.

514
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,788
(It felt like I should be careful.)

515
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:10,389
And it felt like I should contemplate.

516
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:13,928
That was how it felt.

517
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:16,399
(The appointment in 7 days suddenly feels so serious.)

518
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,269
- We ended up... - Yes.

519
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:21,769
- picking each other. - Right.

520
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:23,409
You're right.

521
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:24,979
So, let's pick...

522
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:27,878
the time and location to meet in seven days.

523
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:28,979
Yes.

524
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:31,978
I think we should meet...

525
00:24:31,979 --> 00:24:33,718
at Seoul Station or Suseo Station. What do you think?

526
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:34,919
Which is closer to you?

527
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,219
Suseo Station?

528
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:38,769
- Suseo Station? - Suseo Station.

529
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,118
- Good. - We'll meet there.

530
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,189
Sure.

531
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:44,828
We could have coffee there and move to another place.

532
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:46,128
Sure.

533
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:48,428
- I'll check my schedule... - Yes.

534
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:50,868
- and notify you of the exact time. - Okay.

535
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:52,569
- Okay. Good. - Yes.

536
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:58,479
(Will they meet again in 7 days?)

537
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:03,778
(The last younger man waiting for his older woman is...)

538
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:04,948
(Mu Jin.)

539
00:25:04,949 --> 00:25:07,179
(Looking around)

540
00:25:09,189 --> 00:25:11,919
(Nervous)

541
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:16,328
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin's last Night Date)

542
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:19,298
(To be honest, )

543
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:24,869
(you might worry more than me.)

544
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:28,038
(He was worried that she'd have a change of heart...)

545
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,939
(due to their 12-year age gap.)

546
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:34,439
(It's a completely different matter after this program.)

547
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:37,408
(We're more immersed in our feelings...)

548
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:39,679
(because we're staying in the same house.)

549
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:44,719
(I believe it's a different matter once we're outside.)

550
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,529
(Mu Jin waits for Bon Hee.)

551
00:25:55,899 --> 00:26:02,669
(Time keeps passing.)

552
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:08,049
(Anxious)

553
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:11,448
(Is Bon Hee not showing up?)

554
00:26:11,449 --> 00:26:12,518
Seriously?

555
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:14,549
No way. They looked so promising.

556
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:17,549
(Getting up)

557
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:20,559
(Smiling)

558
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:25,358
(Bon Hee chose him back.)

559
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,559
Did you wait long?

560
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:29,469
(Shaking his head)

561
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:33,939
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin promise to meet again in 7 days.)

562
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,409
How do you feel?

563
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:41,249
Did you want to ask me that?

564
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:43,509
- What? - Did you want to ask that?

565
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:45,649
Yes.

566
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:50,289
I think this decision is an answer in itself.

567
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:52,058
So I won't say it out loud.

568
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:54,018
(I won't say it out loud.)

569
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:55,459
- Okay. - Yes.

570
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:02,069
(They can't help but smile every time they look at each other.)

571
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:05,269
Where should we meet?

572
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:07,268
If we meet.

573
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:09,469
(If we meet.)

574
00:27:09,969 --> 00:27:12,209
(Pondering)

575
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:13,679
There aren't...

576
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:16,149
that many places to go in Daegu.

577
00:27:16,449 --> 00:27:19,549
Really? But Daegu is a pretty big city.

578
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:21,848
Oh, there's a place called the Suseong Lake.

579
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:22,949
It's in Daegu.

580
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:27,959
That's the only date spot I can think of.

581
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:30,958
(She suddenly realizes their distance...)

582
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:32,859
(between Seoul and Daegu.)

583
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:34,798
I can come to Seoul.

584
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,828
(I can come to Seoul.)

585
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:40,039
I'll come to Seoul on the weekend,

586
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:43,369
- so we'll meet then. - Okay.

587
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,139
I'd like that.

588
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,209
Didn't you tell me a few things you wanted to try?

589
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:51,978
- Things I wanted to try? - Yes.

590
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:53,618
(She asks him what he wants to do.)

591
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:56,219
I just want to comfortably eat delicious food...

592
00:27:56,949 --> 00:27:59,219
- and watch a movie. - A movie?

593
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:01,019
A movie date sounds nice.

594
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:03,589
What else other than watching a movie?

595
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:06,328
(Thinking)

596
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:07,528
The Han River?

597
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:09,498
- The Han River? - Yes, the Han River.

598
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:10,528
Han River sounds good.

599
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:11,738
- You like it? - Yes.

600
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:12,838
(They smoothly choose to meet by the Han River.)

601
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,499
- Let's walk along the Han River. - Sure.

602
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:21,179
I wish I could live in Seoul.

603
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:22,549
- In Seoul? - Yes.

604
00:28:22,949 --> 00:28:24,309
He wants to live in Seoul.

605
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:26,619
He can move.

606
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:33,189
I'm worried about returning to our ordinary lives.

607
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,429
- Things will change. - Yes.

608
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,929
Even my everyday routine...

609
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:42,169
will see some changes.

610
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:44,169
It certainly won't be the same.

611
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:46,189
That moment must feel like a dream to them.

612
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:49,039
I'm not sure about these two.

613
00:28:49,369 --> 00:28:50,439
- Why not? - Why not?

614
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,339
- That can't be true. - Absolutely no.

615
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,409
I'm worried...

616
00:28:58,049 --> 00:28:59,819
about realistic problems.

617
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:04,549
If I had found out about his age in the real world,

618
00:29:05,189 --> 00:29:08,929
it would have been difficult to start a relationship.

619
00:29:10,189 --> 00:29:14,398
I might not even have felt these feelings.

620
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,268
That's totally understandable.

621
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:18,269
I'm confused because of our age gap.

622
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:20,568
And because we live far away from each other.

623
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:22,045
(The age gap and the long distance can be obstacles in real life.)

624
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:26,908
I want to know if I could have those feelings...

625
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:28,778
because of the rules of this program.

626
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:30,178
(Were those feelings possible only at Yeon House?)

627
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,578
- Right. She'll know when she's out. - That's right.

628
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:33,579
She'll probably know.

629
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,788
(What choice will we make 7 days later?)

630
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:36,049
I'm so curious.

631
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,689
(And...)

632
00:29:42,189 --> 00:29:43,788
I knew that...

633
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:46,429
So Hyun wouldn't change her mind.

634
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:50,399
Even so, my feelings for her...

635
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:54,239
were still the same. My feelings didn't change.

636
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:55,638
Oh, goodness.

637
00:29:55,639 --> 00:29:59,678
I think I've conveyed my feelings to her in every possible way...

638
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,838
while living in Yeon House.

639
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:03,349
(Ji Yung chose So Hyun even at the end.)

640
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:06,119
I don't regret it.

641
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:09,889
- I really like his transparency. - Right.

642
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,418
- He's not calculative. - Indeed.

643
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,388
(There was no older women who shared the same feelings with Ji Yung.)

644
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:15,958
But he's thoughtful at the same time.

645
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:19,259
(There was no older women who shared the same feelings with Ji Yung.)

646
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:20,928
I chose Sang Won.

647
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:22,498
She chose him even at the end.

648
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:26,298
I've had feelings for only 1 person since the 1st day.

649
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:29,238
(Ye Eun's heart was leaning toward Sang Won to the end.)

650
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:33,139
I want to do my best to fulfill my feelings.

651
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:34,408
You did well.

652
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:37,779
(Ye Eun couldn't plan a date that'd be 7 days later.)

653
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:44,089
(So everyone at Yeon House has made their decisions.)

654
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:46,218
(The older women and the younger men are going back to their real lives.)

655
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,489
They're leaving Yeon House?

656
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:48,989
It feels weird.

657
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:50,459
- At night? - It feels weird.

658
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,659
- Oh, my goodness. - I'm grateful for those days.

659
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:55,798
I keep telling myself that...

660
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,569
I should remember the precious memories I made here.

661
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:01,338
It really feels weird.

662
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:02,368
(It's time to go back to reality.)

663
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:04,809
- They must feel so strange. - Right.

664
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,779
I feel sad and relieved at the same time.

665
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:10,109
And I have...

666
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:13,519
a very complex feeling.

667
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:20,619
(They came here to overcome the age gap, a real-life obstacle, )

668
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:29,129
(and find true love.)

669
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:30,998
It feels so weird.

670
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:34,699
(They decided the time and place to meet 7 days later, )

671
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:37,268
(and left Yeon House.)

672
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:39,309
Goodbye, Yeon House.

673
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:44,878
(They forgot their ages and focused on love at Yeon House.)

674
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:46,319
I wonder how things will pan out.

675
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:48,078
I'm so curious.

676
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,648
- I'm so curious. - I'm really curious.

677
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:50,688
(Could their feelings stay the same even in their real lives?)

678
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:54,758
Four couples promised to meet up again seven days later.

679
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,488
Do you think...

680
00:31:56,489 --> 00:31:57,928
all of the four couples will meet again?

681
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:59,659
- No. - You don't think so?

682
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:00,979
- Never. - Not all of them.

683
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:03,298
How many couples will meet again? Two couples?

684
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:05,339
I think only one couple will meet again.

685
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:06,998
- What? Are you serious? - Only one couple?

686
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:08,669
- Which couple? - Sang Hyeon and So Hyun.

687
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:10,209
- Sang Hyeon and So Hyun? - Yes.
(Woo Young predicts Sang Hyeon and So Hyun will be a couple.)

688
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,878
I think Mu Jin and Bon Hee will meet again.

689
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:17,279
And So Hyun and Sang Hyeon will too.

690
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:18,849
My thoughts haven't changed.

691
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:20,549
Three couples will meet again.

692
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,995
(So Hyun and Sang Hyeon, Ji Won and Sang Won, Bon Hee and Mu Jin)

693
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:24,958
Unfortunately, 3 out of the 4 couples...

694
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:28,258
- live far away from each other. - Exactly.

695
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:29,259
Well, I'm worried...

696
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,059
(Worried)

697
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:36,969
(7 days later, the day of the final decision)

698
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:42,538
(The older women and the younger men went back to reality...)

699
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:47,038
(and spent time in their own ordinary lives.)

700
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,049
(They went back to reality and spent time in their own ordinary lives.)

701
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,848
(A week has passed. Will there be final couples today?)

702
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,048
If they meet again, will they be final couples?

703
00:32:58,049 --> 00:32:59,688
- That's right. Yes. - If they meet again?

704
00:32:59,689 --> 00:33:01,665
(A week has passed. Will there be final couples today?)

705
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:02,928
(I'm nervous.)

706
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:05,458
This is really a final decision they have to make.

707
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:06,835
(If a couple meets again, they'll be the final couple.)

708
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,568
Was there a rule?

709
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,829
Were they allowed to contact each other?

710
00:33:11,129 --> 00:33:13,289
They didn't contact or meet each other for seven days.

711
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:14,798
I guess they decided to think about it seriously...

712
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,068
- for a week... - Exactly.

713
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:18,149
- before they met again. - To spend time separately.

714
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:21,578
(Yeong Gyeong and Hyeon Jun promised to meet again...)

715
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:26,679
(at the amusement park at 1pm.)

716
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,759
(It's almost time for them to meet.)

717
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:35,659
(Will the two of them meet again?)

718
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:44,169
(Hyeon Jun arrives first.)

719
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:48,039
(Impressed)

720
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:49,269
He looks dashing.

721
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:51,238
- Oh, my. Indeed. - He looks great.

722
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:52,308
Please.

723
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:53,589
(Please come out, Yeong Gyeong.)

724
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:58,579
She could've changed her mind in the past week.

725
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:00,819
That worries me a little bit.

726
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:05,689
But as for me, I want to get to know her better.

727
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:15,229
(Their first encounter was like a scene from a movie.)

728
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:18,168
(Are you good at deboning fish?)

729
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:20,199
(Are you bad at it?)

730
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:22,439
(I got a big piece. Do you want this?)

731
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,808
(Hyeon Jun took care of her like a big brother from the start.)

732
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:28,779
(Yeong Gyeong, have you not eaten?)

733
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:30,449
(Shall I make you something to eat?)

734
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,379
- Just a quick bite? - Sounds great.

735
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,778
It's so delicious.

736
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:37,288
(He expressed his feelings quietly and consistently.)

737
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:39,688
(Happy)

738
00:34:39,689 --> 00:34:41,829
(Looking back now...)

739
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:43,928
(Everything I've done until now...)

740
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:45,799
(was for you, Yeong Gyeong.)

741
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:52,969
(Hyeon Jun liked Yeong Gyeong from the start to the end.)

742
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:55,469
(But...)

743
00:34:56,509 --> 00:34:58,138
(I've always wanted to get married early.)

744
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,439
- Really? - Yes.

745
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,248
(I never want to be in a marriage that looks happy...)

746
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:05,478
(only from the outside.)

747
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:08,219
(Living alone would be a lot better than living in such a marriage.)

748
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:12,059
(Their views on marriage were a little bit different.)

749
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:17,128
(I also want to know what you think about a long-distance relationship.)

750
00:35:17,129 --> 00:35:18,435
- A long-distance relationship? - Yes.

751
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:21,999
(I've never been in a long-distance relationship.)

752
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,428
(There was another realistic issue, the long distance between them.)

753
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:26,638
It turns out they have more major issues...

754
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:28,539
than we thought.

755
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:31,308
(Could they be a final couple despite the realistic problems?)

756
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:33,029
- Will Yeong Gyeong show up? - My goodness.

757
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:34,909
I'm worried.

758
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:36,479
Even I'm nervous.

759
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,920
(Yeong Gyeong hasn't showed up yet.)

760
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:42,819
This is driving me crazy.

761
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,919
- Oh, no. - Seriously.

762
00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:46,459
Oh, no.

763
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:49,559
(Sighing)

764
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:55,399
(Will Yeong Gyeong show up despite the realistic problems?)

765
00:35:57,329 --> 00:35:58,839
How will this pan out?

766
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:01,909
- Oh, goodness. - He prepared two cups of coffee.

767
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:07,109
(It's a bit past the promised time.)

768
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:11,278
(Turning around)

769
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:12,279
Is she coming?

770
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,879
What?

771
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:15,519
- Is she there? - Is she there?

772
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:20,619
(Smiling)

773
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:23,829
(Relieved)

774
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:25,659
That's awesome.

775
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:28,298
Congratulations. I'm so happy for them.

776
00:36:28,299 --> 00:36:29,799
(Touched)

777
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:38,208
(The two of them meet again after a week.)

778
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:39,738
It's so crowded here, right?

779
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,809
- Sorry? - It's so crowded here, right?

780
00:36:42,549 --> 00:36:44,879
- Here's your coffee. - My goodness. Thank you.

781
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:46,248
Did you wait long?

782
00:36:46,249 --> 00:36:48,789
Sorry? No, I waited only for a bit.

783
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:51,049
You're in pink today.

784
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:53,689
Do I look okay in this outfit?

785
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:58,028
(Nodding)

786
00:36:58,029 --> 00:36:59,059
You look pretty.

787
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,229
The sun is so bright.

788
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:03,928
You can't open your eyes in the sun.

789
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:05,398
I can't open my eyes in the sun.

790
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:07,468
- Shall I stand on the other side? - You remember it.

791
00:37:07,469 --> 00:37:08,669
Yes.

792
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:11,039
How were things for the past week?

793
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:15,509
For the past week... To be honest...

794
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:18,379
Since I came back to reality,

795
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:21,679
I was very busy. Weren't you?

796
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:24,948
There was something I realized...

797
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:28,959
while working after we all left Yeon House.

798
00:37:29,189 --> 00:37:33,629
I always took care of you while staying at Yeon House.

799
00:37:33,899 --> 00:37:35,999
But I had no one to take care of in my real life.

800
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:37,898
- Oh, because you went back home? - That...

801
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:39,669
That felt a little strange.

802
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:43,839
I realized taking care of someone made me feel satisfied.

803
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:45,778
(Realizing)

804
00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:48,409
I decided to show up today...

805
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:51,849
- for that reason. - I see.

806
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:54,848
Clearly, you take care of me...

807
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:57,449
better than I take care of you.

808
00:37:57,689 --> 00:38:01,759
So that's one of the reasons why I'm here.

809
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:04,489
I want to know what made you decide to show up.

810
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,099
I decided to show up today...

811
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:14,639
- I did a lot of thinking too. - Right.

812
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:15,969
So...

813
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:20,279
I thought about the conversations we had...

814
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:25,108
and the times we spent together while we were separated,

815
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:27,419
and I realized something.

816
00:38:28,249 --> 00:38:32,319
People around me often say that...

817
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:35,658
I'm like a robot. They say I'm like an AI.

818
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:39,028
They say that I seem to have an iron heart.

819
00:38:39,029 --> 00:38:41,559
I get that a lot.

820
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:44,669
While staying at Yeon House, I felt...

821
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:47,939
My heart melted.

822
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,509
It melted.

823
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:52,739
But it took you a long time to open up to me.

824
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,338
It took you too long.

825
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:56,279
It melted slowly.

826
00:38:56,509 --> 00:38:59,518
- That's so sweet. - Her heart melted. That's amazing.

827
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,679
But most importantly,

828
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:03,788
we are similar to each other.

829
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:05,288
- Oh, that's right. - Yes.

830
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:07,859
You have a similar personality to mine.

831
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:11,359
And we seem to view the world in a similar way.

832
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:13,899
- So that's why you showed up? - Yes.

833
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,729
Because you're handsome.

834
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,075
Honestly, I decided to show up because you were handsome.

835
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:23,469
My goodness. What is it?

836
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:26,379
(Feigning indifference)

837
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:30,009
Look at him. He looks so happy.

838
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:33,219
Your ears turned red.

839
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:35,788
I can't hide my emotions because of my ears.

840
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:38,088
- So your ears are the window... - Yes, my ears...

841
00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:40,988
- to your soul. - My ears show my emotions.

842
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:43,389
Then I'm going to look at your ears from now on.

843
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:47,358
They're so red.

844
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,369
He must be really happy. He looks happy.

845
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,369
It's because I'm happy.

846
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:54,499
I'm relieved.

847
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:57,839
So I'd like to maintain...

848
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,209
this relationship we have.

849
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,049
I do live a bit far away from you. It's true.

850
00:40:06,149 --> 00:40:09,889
But we can see each other once a week.

851
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:11,819
Because I live in Korea.

852
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,758
- But... - There's a time difference though.

853
00:40:15,759 --> 00:40:17,428
- But that's okay. - There's a small time difference.

854
00:40:17,429 --> 00:40:19,699
It's as if I lived in Thailand.

855
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:24,929
I want us to contact each other often...

856
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:29,309
and grow our relationship.

857
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:35,709
Let's go somewhere to eat and continue talking.

858
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:38,078
- I'm hungry. - Shall we? Are you hungry?

859
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,079
- I'm jealous. - He suddenly...

860
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,695
- acts like a baby. - Let's eat something delicious.

861
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:42,599
Let's go somewhere to have something delicious.

862
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:45,919
I can ride that one.

863
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:48,358
Come on. That's boring.

864
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:49,599
They have a seven-year age gap.

865
00:40:49,729 --> 00:40:50,758
It's so good to see them together.

866
00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:52,358
Congratulations.

867
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:54,058
(A couple with a 7-year age gap has been formed.)

868
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:55,199
I'm jealous.

869
00:40:56,769 --> 00:40:58,068
(Suseo Station)

870
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:59,968
(Ji Won and Sang Won promised to meet at Suseo Station at noon.)

871
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:02,129
Ji Won and Sang Won promised to meet at Suseo Station.

872
00:41:04,439 --> 00:41:07,008
(Ji Won and Sang Won were each other's first date.)

873
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:09,049
- Hello. - Hello.

874
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:10,879
(Please have a seat.)
Okay.

875
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,818
(You should make my day fly by.)

876
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:17,189
(Sang Won was so nervous that he acted awkwardly.)

877
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:18,388
(Sang Won's keyword was "the day flies by.")

878
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:19,958
(He said he'd make my day fly by.)

879
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:21,088
(But it didn't fly by.)

880
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:24,429
(It's midnight now. It's gone.)

881
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:26,898
(On the first day, )

882
00:41:26,899 --> 00:41:28,528
(we couldn't talk much.)

883
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:29,599
That's right.

884
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:32,029
(I was so curious about you.)

885
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:35,709
(Sang Won plucked up the courage to approach Ji Won first.)

886
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,909
(So they went on a date together for the first time.)

887
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,509
(I told myself to become splendid like that.)

888
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:46,818
(You're shining brightly now.)

889
00:41:46,819 --> 00:41:47,819
(Touched)

890
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:52,049
(They got one step closer to each other.)

891
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:55,989
(But...)

892
00:41:57,089 --> 00:42:00,758
(Looking at his expressions when he looked at me, )

893
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:04,799
(have I felt like he liked me?)

894
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:06,369
(It could be confusing.)

895
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:12,309
(Sang Won took a little bit of a wishy-washy stance.)

896
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:17,549
(Did they become sure 7 days after that?)

897
00:42:17,749 --> 00:42:18,948
(Suseo Station)

898
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:23,719
(Suseo Station where they promised to meet 7 days later)

899
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:30,729
(The meeting time is noon.)

900
00:42:33,299 --> 00:42:41,039
(But 1 hour has passed already.)

901
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:42,569
- What? - What?

902
00:42:42,909 --> 00:42:43,909
What?

903
00:42:44,569 --> 00:42:45,778
One hour?

904
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:46,779
(1 hour has passed?)

905
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:50,048
(Time keeps passing by.)

906
00:42:50,049 --> 00:42:54,019
(Suseo Station, Meeting Square)

907
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:58,789
(Suseo Station)

908
00:43:00,189 --> 00:43:04,788
(We still can't see them.)

909
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:06,298
None of the two of them showed up?

910
00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:07,529
(Entrance)

911
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:13,099
(Ji Won and Sang Won didn't show up at the meeting place 7 days later.)

912
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:14,199
What?

913
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:15,768
- Oh, gosh. - Oh, my. Hold on a second.

914
00:43:15,769 --> 00:43:17,208
(Sighing deeply)

915
00:43:17,209 --> 00:43:18,639
They really didn't show up?

916
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:20,779
I think they didn't show up.

917
00:43:22,609 --> 00:43:26,249
(Why did Ji Won and Sang Won not show up?)

918
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:33,488
Because my feelings have changed,

919
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:37,159
even though I chose him and promised to meet him again,

920
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:40,499
I couldn't keep my promise.

921
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:45,668
Things have been different from the life at Yeon House.

922
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:46,738
Right. She went back to the real world.

923
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:49,539
I came to see the situation from an objective point of view.

924
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:54,738
And I realized that his feelings for me...

925
00:43:54,739 --> 00:43:55,949
were not very strong.

926
00:43:56,949 --> 00:43:59,119
It may be just my thought.

927
00:43:59,419 --> 00:44:00,449
But that's why...

928
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:04,518
That's why I made my decision.

929
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:06,389
I guess her feelings for him didn't grow.

930
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:10,388
At first, I was going to show up.

931
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:12,829
And I thought Ji Won would show up too.

932
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:16,668
It's not that I don't see Ji Won...

933
00:44:16,669 --> 00:44:17,699
more than a friend.

934
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:21,169
After the final decision,

935
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:23,939
I believe we should make our relationship...

936
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:26,778
deeper and more serious.

937
00:44:26,779 --> 00:44:29,219
But I was unsure if I had certainty about our relationship...

938
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:31,809
and if my feelings for her were strong enough to do so.

939
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,819
- Oh, I see. - I didn't think...

940
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:37,188
my feelings for her were strong enough...

941
00:44:37,189 --> 00:44:39,135
to see her again, which would be my final decision.

942
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:40,459
That's why I acted that way.

943
00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:43,559
As the thought overwhelmed me,

944
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:47,728
I thought it would be hard for us...

945
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:51,599
to continue our relationship in the real world.

946
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:55,069
That's why I couldn't show up.

947
00:44:55,269 --> 00:44:56,609
I see.

948
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:01,008
(36-year-old Ji Won and 27-year-old Sang Won...)

949
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:03,649
(couldn't become a couple with a 9-year age gap.)

950
00:45:04,449 --> 00:45:07,118
I guess giving them seven days before making their decisions...

951
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,119
Right.

952
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,618
- It did an important role. - As you can see,

953
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:10,648
- They could see realistic problems. - a seven-year age gap...

954
00:45:10,649 --> 00:45:11,948
The couple with a seven-year age gap...

955
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:13,518
- decided to be together, right? - Yes.

956
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:15,218
But the couple with a nine-year age gap didn't.

957
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:16,288
A nine-year age gap...

958
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:17,388
(Those with a 9-year age gap didn't become a couple.)

959
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:19,559
Hang on. If this is how things are going...

960
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:23,029
The bigger the age gap is...

961
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:24,728
No.

962
00:45:24,729 --> 00:45:28,669
(The chance of becoming a couple becomes lower?)

963
00:45:29,209 --> 00:45:31,008
(The place where another couple will confirm each other's feelings)

964
00:45:31,009 --> 00:45:32,438
Wait. Who is left now?

965
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:35,119
(The place where another couple will confirm each other's feelings)

966
00:45:36,209 --> 00:45:38,978
(The older woman and the younger man went back to their everyday lives.)

967
00:45:38,979 --> 00:45:44,889
(Did their feelings remain the same?)

968
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:49,028
(So Hyun and Sang Hyeon promised to meet...)

969
00:45:49,029 --> 00:45:50,029
So Hyun and Sang Hyeon.
(at Naksan Park at 7pm.)

970
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:52,159
So Hyun and Sang Hyeon.

971
00:45:54,629 --> 00:46:00,298
(I wanted to talk to you.)

972
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,969
(Oh, really?)

973
00:46:02,169 --> 00:46:03,809
(Sighing)

974
00:46:04,509 --> 00:46:08,909
(So Hyun showed interest in Sang Hyeon from the start.)

975
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:13,349
(And by So Hyun's choice, they went on their first date.)

976
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:15,618
(I came here with the person I wanted to be with.)

977
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:18,219
(I'm happy.)

978
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:21,888
(Oh, you...)

979
00:46:21,889 --> 00:46:23,729
(Surprised)

980
00:46:25,259 --> 00:46:26,999
(You're really pretty.)

981
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:28,599
I mean...

982
00:46:29,129 --> 00:46:30,645
(I made some effort since I was going on a date.)

983
00:46:30,669 --> 00:46:33,168
(What is this?)

984
00:46:33,169 --> 00:46:35,198
(I wanted to give you this health supplement.)

985
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:36,769
(Really?)

986
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:40,039
(Sang Hyeon opened up to So Hyun gradually.)

987
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:43,109
(To you, )

988
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,278
(I'm just a kid.)

989
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:45,949
That's how I felt.

990
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,789
(You and I are walking on different paths.)

991
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:55,389
(How could I show my honest feelings to someone who didn't?)

992
00:46:56,229 --> 00:47:00,729
(Sang Hyeon misunderstood So Hyun's honest feelings.)

993
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:03,679
The one I was attracted to because she was different from me...

994
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:08,768
(And until the end, )

995
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:13,309
(Sang Hyeon didn't stop contemplating on the choice.)

996
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:14,839
I see.

997
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:17,348
(He's an overthinker, )

998
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:18,908
(and that...)

999
00:47:18,909 --> 00:47:20,919
(confuses me.)

1000
00:47:21,019 --> 00:47:23,988
(Now that we have seven days, )

1001
00:47:23,989 --> 00:47:27,688
(he'll live in his own head during those days.)

1002
00:47:27,689 --> 00:47:29,559
(Then, the result might change.)

1003
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:34,759
(So Hyun couldn't find certainty from Sang Hyeon to the end.)

1004
00:47:36,669 --> 00:47:42,569
(7 days have passed since then. Could they meet again?)

1005
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:49,779
(It's almost the meeting time.)

1006
00:47:51,879 --> 00:47:54,778
(So Hyun and Sang Hyeon haven't come yet.)

1007
00:47:54,779 --> 00:47:56,589
- Really? It's not true, right? - Really?

1008
00:47:57,919 --> 00:47:59,019
This is driving me crazy.

1009
00:48:02,389 --> 00:48:03,658
- That's So Hyun. - She came.

1010
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:04,988
- It's So Hyun. - She's here.

1011
00:48:04,989 --> 00:48:06,775
(So Hyun arrives at the meeting place first.)

1012
00:48:06,799 --> 00:48:10,168
I'm so grateful that she showed up.

1013
00:48:10,169 --> 00:48:11,169
(Exactly)

1014
00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:14,639
I think we lacked in quantity of conversations.

1015
00:48:15,499 --> 00:48:18,739
I couldn't tell him everything that I had to say.

1016
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:22,179
To get to know someone...

1017
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:24,149
and to see his honest feelings,

1018
00:48:25,209 --> 00:48:26,679
we didn't have enough time.

1019
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:34,919
(Will Sang Hyeon respond to So Hyun's feelings?)

1020
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:37,528
- Sang Hyeon, please show up. - Please.

1021
00:48:37,529 --> 00:48:38,628
Sang Hyeon, you should show up.

1022
00:48:38,629 --> 00:48:39,998
- Please show up. - Please.

1023
00:48:39,999 --> 00:48:42,119
(Everyone desperately hopes Sang Hyeon will show up.)

1024
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:45,798
(Meanwhile, Bon Hee and Mu Jin promised to meet...)

1025
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:48,739
(by the Han River at 6pm.)

1026
00:48:50,169 --> 00:48:54,509
(It's almost the meeting time already.)

1027
00:48:56,779 --> 00:49:00,119
(Mu Jin appears at the meeting place first.)

1028
00:49:00,249 --> 00:49:01,948
Mu Jin came from Daegu.

1029
00:49:01,949 --> 00:49:03,849
Mu Jin has showed up for now.

1030
00:49:03,949 --> 00:49:05,819
I knew Mu Jin would come.

1031
00:49:07,259 --> 00:49:11,059
(Mu Jin came to the meeting place as expected.)

1032
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:20,039
(He looks unusually nervous today.)

1033
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:23,869
I had given it enough thought.

1034
00:49:24,569 --> 00:49:27,539
I still wanted to get to know her more...

1035
00:49:28,439 --> 00:49:29,849
after the show ended.

1036
00:49:30,579 --> 00:49:33,179
So I couldn't wait to meet her.

1037
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:35,679
He can't wait to meet her. He's amazing.

1038
00:49:36,889 --> 00:49:38,588
Bon Hee, please.

1039
00:49:38,589 --> 00:49:39,988
(A week passed.)

1040
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:41,458
(But Mu Jin still feels the same.)

1041
00:49:41,459 --> 00:49:42,888
What if Bon Hee doesn't show up?

1042
00:49:42,889 --> 00:49:43,959
I know.

1043
00:49:44,689 --> 00:49:49,799
(Does Bon Hee feel the same too?)

1044
00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:54,369
I'm so nervous.

1045
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:08,418
(As the sun goes down...)

1046
00:50:08,419 --> 00:50:14,719
(and the time approaches, )

1047
00:50:15,759 --> 00:50:21,959
(So Hyun becomes more and more anxious.)

1048
00:50:25,999 --> 00:50:27,138
(It's past the meeting time, )

1049
00:50:27,139 --> 00:50:29,139
- It's past the meeting time? - Really?

1050
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:33,439
(but Sang Hyeon doesn't show up.)

1051
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:34,679
(Really?)

1052
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,479
- What? - Wait.

1053
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:37,708
(No way.)

1054
00:50:37,709 --> 00:50:38,709
No.

1055
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,178
(Is this how it's going to end?)

1056
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:41,219
This is crazy.

1057
00:50:43,189 --> 00:50:49,288
(Hoping he would show up, she looks around.)

1058
00:50:49,289 --> 00:50:51,489
- This is crazy. - It got too dark.

1059
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:59,199
(Not giving up hope, she waits for him.)

1060
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,138
She's leaving.

1061
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:05,669
(So Hyun ends up leaving alone.)

1062
00:51:07,009 --> 00:51:08,208
You waited for a long time, didn't you?

1063
00:51:08,209 --> 00:51:10,179
(Stopping)

1064
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:13,049
(Giggling)

1065
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:19,358
(Sang Hyeon finally came!)

1066
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:20,419
- Hey! - Hey!

1067
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:22,288
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1068
00:51:22,289 --> 00:51:24,028
He's so annoying.

1069
00:51:24,029 --> 00:51:25,428
(Roars in joy)

1070
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:26,998
- I nearly cried. - My gosh.

1071
00:51:26,999 --> 00:51:28,058
What a relief.

1072
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:29,329
(It's a huge relief.)

1073
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:35,799
(Smiling brightly)

1074
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:47,679
Because it's So Hyun.

1075
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:50,348
I can see myself dating her.

1076
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:52,189
(I can see myself dating her.)

1077
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:56,529
I waited...

1078
00:51:57,389 --> 00:51:58,659
for quite some time.

1079
00:52:03,729 --> 00:52:05,769
- I'm honored. - You came.

1080
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:09,969
You look good today.

1081
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:12,819
I should be the one saying that.

1082
00:52:17,709 --> 00:52:19,009
Why do I feel shy?

1083
00:52:21,379 --> 00:52:22,549
I do too.

1084
00:52:24,449 --> 00:52:26,389
You look good today. The outfit suits you.

1085
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,959
- You look good today. - I...

1086
00:52:35,129 --> 00:52:36,729
- Why do I... - How have you been?

1087
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:38,869
I've been...

1088
00:52:39,439 --> 00:52:42,839
busy working.

1089
00:52:43,269 --> 00:52:45,608
I'm curious. I...

1090
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:46,709
What?

1091
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:49,278
- I just... - You're curious.

1092
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,208
I wonder what the past seven days were like for you.

1093
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,719
(I wonder what the past seven days were like for you.)

1094
00:52:54,249 --> 00:52:55,548
For the past week,

1095
00:52:55,549 --> 00:52:59,558
(For the past week)

1096
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:01,259
did you have any change of thought?

1097
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:05,889
From the moment I made a choice,

1098
00:53:06,829 --> 00:53:08,659
my mind has been made up.

1099
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,099
Not being able to meet you for a week was the tough part.

1100
00:53:12,699 --> 00:53:15,198
I wanted to meet you as soon as I could...

1101
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:16,338
and talk to you more.

1102
00:53:16,339 --> 00:53:17,508
How frustrating that must've been.

1103
00:53:17,509 --> 00:53:19,479
- I know. - He must've been anticipating it.

1104
00:53:23,009 --> 00:53:24,679
When you made your choice...

1105
00:53:25,609 --> 00:53:27,319
at the end,

1106
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:33,419
I believe you used the word "conviction."

1107
00:53:33,759 --> 00:53:35,988
I believe I said things became clear for me.

1108
00:53:35,989 --> 00:53:37,629
Right. Things became clear for you.

1109
00:53:38,689 --> 00:53:41,259
But for me, that's when I became...

1110
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:45,799
unclear about everything.

1111
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,808
I was like, "I don't know."

1112
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:54,339
"I don't know how he really feels."

1113
00:53:58,609 --> 00:54:00,679
That's how I felt.

1114
00:54:02,449 --> 00:54:03,519
But still,

1115
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:07,989
whether it works out or not, I wanted us to get to know more.

1116
00:54:08,489 --> 00:54:11,159
One week was too short.

1117
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:14,559
I thought it would be nice to get to know you...

1118
00:54:16,399 --> 00:54:19,999
a little more.

1119
00:54:23,509 --> 00:54:24,569
(Touching her hair)

1120
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:31,379
I think I gave you...

1121
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:33,519
a little too much of my heart,

1122
00:54:35,419 --> 00:54:37,018
so I had to come.

1123
00:54:37,019 --> 00:54:39,419
(I gave you a little too much of my heart.)

1124
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:42,418
I didn't have too much to think about, actually.

1125
00:54:42,419 --> 00:54:43,559
For me,

1126
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:48,699
leaving the Yeon House...

1127
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:50,629
didn't feel like the end.

1128
00:54:51,029 --> 00:54:53,539
It was more like a beginning.

1129
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:56,909
And I always knew who I wanted to get to know more outside.

1130
00:55:01,709 --> 00:55:03,848
It was always you.

1131
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:05,908
(It was always you.)

1132
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:07,978
Well, you did say you wanted to get to know me...

1133
00:55:07,979 --> 00:55:09,689
more outside the Yeon House.

1134
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:14,389
Your eyes are shining.

1135
00:55:15,589 --> 00:55:16,859
They are really. Goodness.

1136
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,899
Am I pretty?

1137
00:55:20,499 --> 00:55:21,799
Yes. As pretty...

1138
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,199
as this location.

1139
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:28,169
(Sweetness overload!)

1140
00:55:28,499 --> 00:55:30,568
That's something I never had guts to say...

1141
00:55:30,569 --> 00:55:32,538
to a man in my life.

1142
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:33,539
- "Am I pretty?" - Yes.

1143
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,908
Give it a try.

1144
00:55:34,909 --> 00:55:36,509
While So Hyun was getting...

1145
00:55:36,809 --> 00:55:39,778
more and more convinced about her feelings,

1146
00:55:39,779 --> 00:55:42,718
Sang Hyeon confused her.

1147
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:44,019
- Right. - Towards the end.

1148
00:55:44,389 --> 00:55:47,319
I guess she still had...

1149
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:49,928
the remnants of those memories.

1150
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,928
- Did she? - She had been very anxious.

1151
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:53,298
- There were moments... - Until the end.

1152
00:55:53,299 --> 00:55:54,628
- Right. - when he made her anxious.

1153
00:55:54,629 --> 00:55:56,598
He gave her that anxiety.

1154
00:55:56,599 --> 00:55:59,228
I think "Am I pretty?" was her way of saying...

1155
00:55:59,229 --> 00:56:02,299
that she will trust him and open her heart to him.

1156
00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:04,368
- "Do you like me?" - I...

1157
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:06,215
- Is that her way of saying it? - Something like that.

1158
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:07,539
I think it was like that.

1159
00:56:08,439 --> 00:56:10,909
- This is a beautiful spot. - Isn't it really beautiful?

1160
00:56:11,009 --> 00:56:12,309
On the way up,

1161
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:15,119
I thought it was really pretty.

1162
00:56:15,419 --> 00:56:16,519
It's beautiful.

1163
00:56:17,789 --> 00:56:18,819
It's my first time...

1164
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:21,489
up here.

1165
00:56:21,889 --> 00:56:23,058
Is it your first time?

1166
00:56:23,059 --> 00:56:25,058
(Is it your first time?)

1167
00:56:25,059 --> 00:56:26,798
- Is it? - Why did I come here only now?

1168
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,999
(Why did I come here only now?)

1169
00:56:29,899 --> 00:56:32,268
You can explore more new places with me.

1170
00:56:32,269 --> 00:56:35,069
(You can explore more new places with me.)

1171
00:56:35,939 --> 00:56:38,739
I got you a little something.

1172
00:56:39,809 --> 00:56:41,738
- What? - It's nothing much.

1173
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:43,179
- Is it mine? - Yes.

1174
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:48,049
- It's for you. - What is it?

1175
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:49,479
- I... - I didn't get to wrap it.

1176
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:53,000
I didn't know what you would like, so I just got a bunch.

1177
00:56:53,219 --> 00:56:55,789
These are lip balms.

1178
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:58,058
- Lip balms. - He loves lip balms.

1179
00:56:58,059 --> 00:56:59,859
You said you always wear lip balm.

1180
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:03,999
I saw that your lips were a little dry.

1181
00:57:05,169 --> 00:57:06,538
- She's thoughtful. - There.

1182
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:08,769
(Touched)

1183
00:57:08,999 --> 00:57:12,009
You can wear this now. Don't wear that.

1184
00:57:13,439 --> 00:57:15,038
The one Yeong Gyeong gave you.

1185
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:16,239
- That one. - Yes.

1186
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:18,408
You seemed to be wearing that very casually.

1187
00:57:18,409 --> 00:57:19,478
Well...

1188
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:21,579
- Right. - Right.

1189
00:57:21,979 --> 00:57:23,719
It's because it's from Yeong Gyeong.

1190
00:57:23,919 --> 00:57:27,889
"I don't want another girl's trace on your lips."

1191
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:30,359
Do you have anywhere to go after?

1192
00:57:32,829 --> 00:57:33,859
No?

1193
00:57:36,259 --> 00:57:38,168
(No?)

1194
00:57:38,169 --> 00:57:39,939
I am famished right now.

1195
00:57:41,539 --> 00:57:43,579
- What do you want to eat? - Should we grab a bite?

1196
00:57:43,809 --> 00:57:45,069
What do you feel like eating?

1197
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:50,679
I am really craving for tonkatsu.

1198
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:52,909
I like tonkatsu.

1199
00:57:54,779 --> 00:57:55,879
That sounds delicious.

1200
00:57:57,189 --> 00:57:59,189
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

1201
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:00,888
Hold hands.

1202
00:58:00,889 --> 00:58:02,058
(Shall we go on a date?)

1203
00:58:02,059 --> 00:58:03,758
- Right. - He doesn't have the courage.

1204
00:58:03,759 --> 00:58:05,789
- No? - He doesn't have the courage.

1205
00:58:06,029 --> 00:58:08,429
I want to talk a lot with you.

1206
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:10,529
- We should. - Yes.

1207
00:58:11,429 --> 00:58:13,838
This is a new beginning.

1208
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,438
(We got another...)

1209
00:58:15,439 --> 00:58:17,368
(younger-man-older-woman couple.)

1210
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,469
Congratulations!

1211
00:58:19,209 --> 00:58:20,538
(We got the second couple of Noona is A Woman to Me!)

1212
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,739
Congratulations!

1213
00:58:22,779 --> 00:58:23,848
Oh, dear.

1214
00:58:23,849 --> 00:58:24,849
(To be continued...)

1215
00:58:26,149 --> 00:58:32,289
(Mu Jin waits for Bon Hee at the meeting place.)

1216
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:40,759
(Mu Jin waits for Bon Hee at the meeting place.)

1217
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:46,029
He's wearing the ring!

1218
00:58:48,129 --> 00:58:49,329
The one they made together.

1219
00:58:53,139 --> 00:58:56,979
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin were each other's first date.)

1220
00:58:58,139 --> 00:59:00,409
(It's nice to meet you.)

1221
00:59:01,049 --> 00:59:05,149
(They couldn't hide the excitement for each other.)

1222
00:59:07,049 --> 00:59:09,188
- You got something on your hair. - Really?

1223
00:59:09,189 --> 00:59:12,318
(After the first date, )

1224
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:16,959
(they were constantly drawn to each other.)

1225
00:59:17,629 --> 00:59:19,328
(Do you want to go on a date with me...)

1226
00:59:19,329 --> 00:59:20,628
(today?)

1227
00:59:20,629 --> 00:59:21,629
(Nodding)

1228
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:22,669
(Okay.)

1229
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:27,908
(Without either of them meaning to, )

1230
00:59:27,909 --> 00:59:31,739
(the two slowly fell for each other.)

1231
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:35,179
(Is there anyone else you want to know more about?)

1232
00:59:35,479 --> 00:59:36,599
(And you want to know that?)

1233
00:59:38,379 --> 00:59:39,919
(I'm just asking.)

1234
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:41,619
(No.)

1235
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,819
- No? - No.

1236
00:59:43,489 --> 00:59:44,689
(Smiling)

1237
00:59:48,189 --> 00:59:50,528
(Do you believe in fate?)

1238
00:59:50,529 --> 00:59:51,659
I believe in fate.

1239
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,899
(Meeting Bon Hee was like a fate to him.)

1240
00:59:56,399 --> 00:59:58,398
(We made rings today.)

1241
00:59:58,399 --> 00:59:59,399
- What? - What?

1242
00:59:59,909 --> 01:00:01,008
(Is today your day one?)

1243
01:00:01,009 --> 01:00:02,069
(Yes.)

1244
01:00:02,169 --> 01:00:04,609
(Mu Jin pursued Bon Hee without hesitation.)

1245
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:08,449
(However...)

1246
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:11,348
(I am 27 years old.)

1247
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:12,549
(Gasping)

1248
01:00:13,189 --> 01:00:16,659
(- I am Kim Mu Jin. - He's young.)

1249
01:00:17,589 --> 01:00:21,759
(The 12-year-old age difference confused Bon Hee.)

1250
01:00:22,359 --> 01:00:26,798
(When the age difference is over ten years, )

1251
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:30,569
(it's impossible not to be affected by it.)

1252
01:00:30,899 --> 01:00:32,198
That's very understandable.

1253
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:36,238
(What will Bon Hee decide about the age difference?)

1254
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:38,338
Will Bon Hee get over the age difference...

1255
01:00:38,339 --> 01:00:39,609
- and show up? - Please.

1256
01:00:40,009 --> 01:00:42,548
Many people are rooting for these two though.

1257
01:00:42,549 --> 01:00:44,349
- Goodness. - I know.

1258
01:00:44,419 --> 01:00:45,419
Please.

1259
01:00:46,219 --> 01:00:47,988
(As time passes, he gets anxious.)

1260
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:49,889
Oh, dear. What's going to happen?

1261
01:00:51,819 --> 01:00:56,089
(The meeting time has passed.)

1262
01:00:57,159 --> 01:01:02,499
(Was the 12-year age difference too much for Bon Hee to overcome?)

1263
01:01:12,109 --> 01:01:13,209
My gosh!

1264
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:17,449
You startled me. Gosh.

1265
01:01:17,779 --> 01:01:19,649
(I don't believe it!)

1266
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:22,918
Congratulations. Truly.

1267
01:01:22,919 --> 01:01:24,289
(Congratulations.)

1268
01:01:30,229 --> 01:01:31,299
My gosh!

1269
01:01:32,929 --> 01:01:34,068
You really caught me off-guard there.

1270
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:37,168
- Mu Jin is really surprised. - I had no idea.

1271
01:01:37,169 --> 01:01:39,139
- It's... - I really had no idea.

1272
01:01:40,769 --> 01:01:41,809
Long time no see.

1273
01:01:45,009 --> 01:01:46,549
- Have you been well? - Yes.

1274
01:01:48,009 --> 01:01:50,519
- It's been exactly a week. - Yes.

1275
01:01:51,219 --> 01:01:52,819
Why does it feel like it's been ages?

1276
01:01:52,919 --> 01:01:53,949
Right?

1277
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:57,319
(Sighing)

1278
01:01:58,419 --> 01:02:00,129
I felt so nervous on the way here.

1279
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:01,929
- Did you come from there? - Yes.

1280
01:02:06,129 --> 01:02:08,029
- Goodness. - Gosh.

1281
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:11,769
- Have you been well? - I've been well.

1282
01:02:12,969 --> 01:02:14,129
Did you know I would be here?

1283
01:02:14,709 --> 01:02:15,739
Yes.

1284
01:02:17,879 --> 01:02:19,009
You have good intuition.

1285
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:22,579
Did you know I would come?

1286
01:02:23,019 --> 01:02:24,519
I knew you would come.

1287
01:02:26,589 --> 01:02:27,619
Lovely.

1288
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:31,019
It's only been a week. Why does it feel like it's been ages?

1289
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:32,818
It felt like no time had passed...

1290
01:02:32,819 --> 01:02:34,265
and yet it went by too fast at the same time.

1291
01:02:34,289 --> 01:02:35,289
Yes.

1292
01:02:40,129 --> 01:02:42,669
It feels different to meet here, doesn't it?

1293
01:02:42,869 --> 01:02:43,899
- It does. - Yes.

1294
01:02:44,199 --> 01:02:45,719
- To meet in a different place. - Yes.

1295
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:48,839
Did you lose weight?

1296
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:50,139
Did I lose weight?

1297
01:02:50,409 --> 01:02:52,408
I think I lost about 1 to 2kg.

1298
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:53,725
- Did you really? - Can you see it?

1299
01:02:53,749 --> 01:02:55,509
Yes. It seems like while we've been away...

1300
01:02:56,579 --> 01:02:58,878
I was really surprised to see you having gotten prettier.

1301
01:02:58,879 --> 01:02:59,989
- Really? - Yes.

1302
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:01,789
(Shy)

1303
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:04,058
(Jealous, Mu Jin never disappoints.)

1304
01:03:04,059 --> 01:03:05,988
Where did they find a guy like him?

1305
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:07,528
(Where can I meet a guy like Mu Jin?)

1306
01:03:07,529 --> 01:03:09,758
Why is there none like him around me?

1307
01:03:09,759 --> 01:03:11,529
Why are they always in a screen?

1308
01:03:11,699 --> 01:03:13,599
- Mu Jin is unstoppable. - Yes.

1309
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:15,969
(I love Mu Jin.)

1310
01:03:16,399 --> 01:03:18,868
I was really surprised to see you having gotten prettier.

1311
01:03:18,869 --> 01:03:20,209
- Really? - Yes.

1312
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:21,738
(Shy)

1313
01:03:21,739 --> 01:03:23,709
- Did I choose a good outfit? - Yes.

1314
01:03:26,479 --> 01:03:29,879
Is there anything you've been worried about...

1315
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:32,679
for the past week?

1316
01:03:36,589 --> 01:03:38,559
Here's what I came to think about.

1317
01:03:38,959 --> 01:03:42,929
- We live far away from each other. - Yes.

1318
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:49,129
I thought perhaps that might be good for both of us.

1319
01:03:49,429 --> 01:03:53,539
I was thinking maybe when we talk,

1320
01:03:54,009 --> 01:03:57,179
we respect each other’s space and everyday life,

1321
01:03:57,479 --> 01:03:59,079
and get to know more about each other.

1322
01:04:00,279 --> 01:04:02,179
I think that would be best.

1323
01:04:02,709 --> 01:04:05,448
That's what I came to think about.

1324
01:04:05,449 --> 01:04:07,865
(Bon Hee had to think about how to make the long distance work.)

1325
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:10,858
And you are clearly mature. That's an undeniable truth.

1326
01:04:10,859 --> 01:04:13,259
- Am I really? - Yes, you are.

1327
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:16,528
I've always known...

1328
01:04:16,529 --> 01:04:19,729
that you were a good person.

1329
01:04:21,969 --> 01:04:22,969
I'm glad to hear that.

1330
01:04:26,609 --> 01:04:29,309
When we were still in the Yeon House,

1331
01:04:30,609 --> 01:04:33,749
I was a little more worried.

1332
01:04:34,609 --> 01:04:36,719
Spending a week after leaving the house,

1333
01:04:37,179 --> 01:04:39,649
I didn't think much.

1334
01:04:40,449 --> 01:04:43,089
- Did you feel more at ease? - I felt more at ease.

1335
01:04:46,219 --> 01:04:49,899
I developed feelings for you while we were in the Yeon House.

1336
01:04:50,199 --> 01:04:52,529
Just because we've returned to our daily lives...

1337
01:04:53,399 --> 01:04:55,729
doesn't mean my feelings for you are gone.

1338
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:59,469
I'm curious about you, and I want to get to know more about you.

1339
01:05:01,169 --> 01:05:02,439
That's why I came here today.

1340
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:09,409
Are you wearing the ring?

1341
01:05:10,179 --> 01:05:11,279
I am wearing the ring.

1342
01:05:12,149 --> 01:05:14,689
- I always wear it. - You do?

1343
01:05:14,889 --> 01:05:17,218
(I am so jealous.)

1344
01:05:17,219 --> 01:05:18,219
He always wears it.

1345
01:05:18,419 --> 01:05:19,558
I knew it.

1346
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:20,729
(Mu Jin's done it again.)

1347
01:05:21,229 --> 01:05:23,529
(I always wear it.)

1348
01:05:23,729 --> 01:05:24,898
Even when you work?

1349
01:05:24,899 --> 01:05:25,899
Even when I work.

1350
01:05:26,569 --> 01:05:27,668
(Mu Jin has never taken it out of his finger.)

1351
01:05:27,669 --> 01:05:28,769
I always wear it.

1352
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:31,839
Are you wearing it?

1353
01:05:31,899 --> 01:05:33,409
I am wearing it.

1354
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:44,579
Are they getting married?

1355
01:05:45,649 --> 01:05:47,518
What's going on with these two?

1356
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,319
They don't need wedding rings.

1357
01:05:49,589 --> 01:05:51,318
They fell for each other at first sight.

1358
01:05:51,319 --> 01:05:53,789
They got here without getting shaken once. In the end...

1359
01:05:53,859 --> 01:05:55,389
(Mu Jin, you are great.)

1360
01:05:55,859 --> 01:05:57,499
Look at that sunset.

1361
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,469
I'm going to remember this moment for a long time.

1362
01:06:02,299 --> 01:06:03,299
It's really pretty.

1363
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:07,809
We've been wanting to come here.

1364
01:06:10,509 --> 01:06:12,679
I never thought it would be...

1365
01:06:14,009 --> 01:06:16,049
this pretty and nice.

1366
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:17,995
- I didn't think so either. - Right.

1367
01:06:18,019 --> 01:06:21,089
It's nicer than I imagined.

1368
01:06:22,489 --> 01:06:25,818
I think I should carry two camping chairs in the car.

1369
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:26,829
Yes.

1370
01:06:27,689 --> 01:06:28,689
Yes!

1371
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:30,029
"Yes!"

1372
01:06:30,259 --> 01:06:31,799
- He's cute. -He's cute.

1373
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:36,129
I'm hungry.

1374
01:06:36,369 --> 01:06:37,569
- Are you hungry? - Yes.

1375
01:06:39,169 --> 01:06:42,139
- Should we go for a barbecue? - Should we go for a barbecue?

1376
01:06:42,909 --> 01:06:43,979
Yes.

1377
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:45,279
Nice.

1378
01:06:45,439 --> 01:06:47,378
- It's nice here. - It really is.

1379
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:49,078
(Their Han River date was even more exciting...)

1380
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:50,239
(because it was their first.)

1381
01:06:51,979 --> 01:06:53,325
You have to come here with me again.

1382
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:54,419
I will.

1383
01:06:57,219 --> 01:06:58,488
It will be fun.

1384
01:06:58,489 --> 01:07:00,128
(The 39-year-old Bon Hee and 27-year-old Mu Jin)

1385
01:07:00,129 --> 01:07:02,089
What's fun?

1386
01:07:03,459 --> 01:07:05,398
Just you and I.

1387
01:07:05,399 --> 01:07:10,569
(A couple with a 12-year age gap has officially been born!)

1388
01:07:10,669 --> 01:07:12,598
- The 12-year-age gap! - Lovely.

1389
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:16,239
(A 12-year age-gap couple is official!)

1390
01:07:16,369 --> 01:07:18,408
- Why am I so happy? - They are great.

1391
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,849
(What is that?)

1392
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:26,579
I was glad that Bon Hee felt...

1393
01:07:26,919 --> 01:07:29,189
the same way I did.

1394
01:07:29,419 --> 01:07:31,718
These must be the photos they took after...

1395
01:07:31,719 --> 01:07:32,989
while being in a relationship.

1396
01:07:33,259 --> 01:07:35,459
I want to talk to her comfortably...

1397
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:37,029
and eat good food.

1398
01:07:37,329 --> 01:07:39,505
- They look good together. - They look so good together.

1399
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:44,069
- They look good together. - I just like him.

1400
01:07:45,569 --> 01:07:48,969
We now know that our feelings are mutual.

1401
01:07:49,869 --> 01:07:52,339
This is the real start.

1402
01:07:52,579 --> 01:07:53,709
Stay together forever.

1403
01:07:54,649 --> 01:07:56,679
- I hope they will be happy. - Forever.

1404
01:07:56,879 --> 01:07:59,749
I thought it would be hard to date someone older than me.

1405
01:08:00,489 --> 01:08:03,819
But through Yeong Gyeong, my thoughts have changed.

1406
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:08,559
I realized that age doesn't matter.

1407
01:08:09,459 --> 01:08:12,559
When I look at Hyeon Jun, he makes me think,

1408
01:08:12,929 --> 01:08:15,268
"A good person is a good person,"

1409
01:08:15,269 --> 01:08:17,069
"even if he's young in age."

1410
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:20,968
I'm also curious about how the emotions...

1411
01:08:20,969 --> 01:08:23,679
in my fluttering heart will grow.

1412
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:28,978
Now, I think this is...

1413
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,499
the beginning of our relationship where we can meet up again...

1414
01:08:31,879 --> 01:08:33,888
and get to know each other.

1415
01:08:33,889 --> 01:08:34,889
They look so good together.

1416
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:38,489
I'll be going on many more dates with So Hyun from now on.

1417
01:08:38,589 --> 01:08:40,429
I'll take good care of her.

1418
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:43,159
If you have feelings for a person...

1419
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:45,398
that aren't based on age,

1420
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:48,198
and you're sure that those feelings are enough,

1421
01:08:48,199 --> 01:08:51,239
I hope you don't hesitate and go for it.

1422
01:08:54,169 --> 01:08:55,169
Sang Hyeon.

1423
01:08:55,609 --> 01:08:58,079
This show isn't one that you can join lightly,

1424
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,108
but if you do join,

1425
01:09:00,109 --> 01:09:01,578
I'm sure you'll experience changes within yourself.

1426
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:03,019
That's what I'd like to tell people.

1427
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:05,548
That's cool.

1428
01:09:05,549 --> 01:09:09,948
(Noona is A Woman to Me, 3 final couples)

1429
01:09:09,949 --> 01:09:12,519
- Congratulations! - My goodness.

1430
01:09:12,919 --> 01:09:14,088
I'm so happy.

1431
01:09:14,089 --> 01:09:15,688
- Right? I'm so happy. - Seriously.

1432
01:09:15,689 --> 01:09:18,199
Every time each couple appeared,

1433
01:09:18,599 --> 01:09:20,498
I kept getting choked up.

1434
01:09:20,499 --> 01:09:22,129
My eyes were tearing up too.

1435
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:24,698
As I watched Noona is A Woman to Me,

1436
01:09:24,699 --> 01:09:28,038
I thought, "It will be okay to date even younger guys."

1437
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:30,309
(Her confidence went up.)

1438
01:09:30,339 --> 01:09:32,708
- I should stay open-minded. - Oh, really?

1439
01:09:32,709 --> 01:09:34,448
- That sounds good, right? - Oh, yes.

1440
01:09:34,449 --> 01:09:35,678
What do you think about older women?

1441
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:37,879
Oh, my thoughts about older women have totally changed.

1442
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:39,648
How?

1443
01:09:39,649 --> 01:09:42,418
Mu Jin, give me your phone number, will you?

1444
01:09:42,419 --> 01:09:43,918
(Let me learn from Mu Jin first about dating older women.)

1445
01:09:43,919 --> 01:09:45,888
For those who are still craving for more,

1446
01:09:45,889 --> 01:09:48,629
the older women and younger men will appear themselves...

1447
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:51,398
for a Behind-the-Scenes commentary.

1448
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:52,698
This sounds like fun.

1449
01:09:52,699 --> 01:09:54,728
- I definitely have to watch it. - It sounds like fun.

1450
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:56,405
- I have to be sure to watch it. - When is it?

1451
01:09:56,429 --> 01:09:58,669
- But why didn't you invite us? - I mean...

1452
01:09:58,899 --> 01:10:00,339
Hye Jin, we can't go there.

1453
01:10:00,609 --> 01:10:02,039
I want to meet them!

1454
01:10:02,469 --> 01:10:04,138
Honestly, Seul Hye, you want to meet Mu Jin, right?

1455
01:10:04,139 --> 01:10:05,278
I'd go, for sure.

1456
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:07,509
Well, sadly enough,

1457
01:10:07,609 --> 01:10:08,648
- Seul Hye, we should go. - we will...

1458
01:10:08,649 --> 01:10:10,248
- have to say goodbye here. - I want to go too!

1459
01:10:10,249 --> 01:10:12,078
- Let's go! - The real romance beyond age,

1460
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:13,118
Noona is A Woman to Me.

1461
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:15,348
- I want to go, though. - Thank you for enjoying it with us!

1462
01:10:15,349 --> 01:10:16,918
- Thank you! - Thank you!

1463
01:10:16,919 --> 01:10:18,518
- Thank you so much. - Bye!

1464
01:10:18,519 --> 01:10:20,159
- Thank you! - Thank you!

1465
01:10:25,059 --> 01:10:28,828
(Making Mu Jin smile widely, )

1466
01:10:28,829 --> 01:10:30,439
(it's the older woman, Bon Hee.)

1467
01:10:30,769 --> 01:10:32,638
(Waiting reminded them of...)

1468
01:10:32,639 --> 01:10:34,308
(their first meeting.)

1469
01:10:34,309 --> 01:10:35,408
Oh, right.

1470
01:10:35,409 --> 01:10:37,609
(Waiting reminded them of their first meeting.)

1471
01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:39,379
(Their sweetness fills the studio.)

1472
01:10:41,309 --> 01:10:43,308
(Everyone gathers in one place.)

1473
01:10:43,309 --> 01:10:45,318
- Hi. - Hi.

1474
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:46,779
It's good to see you.

1475
01:10:47,089 --> 01:10:50,288
(In Yeon House, I literally almost died.)

1476
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:52,158
For real, I was going like, "Gosh, this is frustrating."

1477
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,395
(From the untold stories of older women…)

1478
01:10:53,419 --> 01:10:54,788
(How are things between Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon?)

1479
01:10:54,789 --> 01:10:56,188
(The fact that people are asking us this...)

1480
01:10:56,189 --> 01:10:58,159
Lastly, I want to explain myself about something.

1481
01:10:59,059 --> 01:11:00,268
Where's my camera? There?

1482
01:11:00,269 --> 01:11:01,745
(Also, explanation time for the younger men)

1483
01:11:01,769 --> 01:11:04,245
(But the most intriguing part is the stories of the final couples.)

1484
01:11:04,269 --> 01:11:05,838
(Just going to pick her up after work, )

1485
01:11:05,839 --> 01:11:09,669
(and just having dinner together...)

1486
01:11:10,579 --> 01:11:13,179
(Do So Hyun and Sang Hyeon have video calls before going to bed?)

1487
01:11:14,349 --> 01:11:15,408
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin smile from simply looking at each other.)

1488
01:11:15,409 --> 01:11:16,449
(Giggling)

1489
01:11:17,179 --> 01:11:18,495
(We stayed out until really late that night.)

1490
01:11:18,519 --> 01:11:20,588
- My gosh! - Oh, dear.

1491
01:11:20,589 --> 01:11:21,718
- Really? - Oh, my.

1492
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:23,735
(Untold, candid stories from Noona is A Woman to Me)

1493
01:11:23,759 --> 01:11:24,819
This is so much fun.
