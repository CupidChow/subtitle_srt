1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,249
(Love knows no age...)

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,259
(because it is always born anew.)

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,660
(because it is always born anew.)

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,300
During an important period of my life,

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,830
I could have gotten married.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,340
But I chose my career over marriage.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,310
I don't remember ever taking a break.

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,580
My career felt more important than love.

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,309
Then I wondered,

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,320
"At this rate, am I going to grow old alone?"

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,620
"If only I had someone by my side."

12
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,789
(But don't tell me...)

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,060
He's not ten years younger than me, is he?

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,000
Does age matter when I have feelings for her?

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,230
If someone really piques my interest,

16
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,240
I don't care about the age gap.

17
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,970
It's not easy to find a younger guy like me.

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,240
What could you hate about being young?

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,080
Isn't it better?

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,410
What? This is adorable.

21
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,979
(An older woman and a younger man's...)

22
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,450
(real romance begins.)

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,320
Noona, how about a date?

24
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,790
It made my heart flutter a bit.

25
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,229
Should I say he was cute?

26
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,260
He was cute.

27
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,000
That moment itself was really nice.

28
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,269
He kept touching me a little without hesitation.

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,410
I noticed it.

30
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,310
To think that a younger guy could feel like a man.

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,839
(One by one,)

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,680
(the moments that made them forget the age gap.)

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,850
It felt like a scene out of a movie.

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,490
How old are you comfortable with?

35
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,160
About four years older?

36
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,530
"Am I not attractive as a woman?" was what I thought.

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
I'm just a child to you.

38
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,909
Laughing in front of you can't be a lie, right?

39
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,710
He was much younger than I had imagined.

40
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,210
I couldn't keep a straight face.

41
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,579
"Age doesn't matter that much."

42
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,010
That was what I thought.

43
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,879
We weren't meant to be.

44
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,720
That was the conclusion I reached.

45
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,090
(Noona Is A Woman to Me)

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,430
(Everyone is frozen.)

47
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,360
This is bad.

48
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,629
That just now...

49
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,670
We only watched for a minute or two, right?

50
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,770
- Right now, my heart is...
- Yes?

51
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,970
beating like crazy.

52
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,909
What did you think?

53
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,309
(Hwangwoo Seul Hye)

54
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,810
I liked how they called me "noona."

55
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,680
But for real, I'm serious.

56
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,419
"I really am old now."

57
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,420
Right.

58
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:56,419
- That really hit me.
- Why? And when

59
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,519
I've always been called "noona..."

60
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,329
- by my younger brother.
- I see.

61
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,160
But that kind of noona wasn't everything.

62
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,569
Being called "noona" by a younger brother...

63
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,100
and him calling me "noona" are completely different.

64
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,599
But that guy didn't call you "noona,"

65
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,810
so why?

66
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,270
It makes me happy, okay?

67
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,810
If you don't mind me asking,

68
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,179
have you dated a younger guy before?

69
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,950
- Of course.
- I see.

70
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,250
I may have dated more younger guys than you can imagine.

71
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,820
That's right.

72
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:31,089
After entering my mid-30s,

73
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,959
I've mainly dated younger guys.

74
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,560
Do older guys not like me because I'm old?

75
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,259
The participants only know that...

76
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,199
the women are older and the men are younger,

77
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,999
but they don't know their actual ages.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No.

79
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:46,339
Say that you really like someone,

80
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,669
but they turn out to be 12 years older or younger.

81
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,370
Simply put, there's a big age gap.

82
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,910
How would you feel?

83
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,709
(Sighing)

84
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,280
How old is 12 years younger?

85
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,610
He just turned 30.

86
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,750
- Thirty sounds a little tough.
- For example.

87
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,780
- May I ask the reason?
- Well...

88
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,020
I can't help but think he's too young.

89
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,790
Shouldn't he be at least 33 or 34?

90
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,490
- It's only a three-year difference.
- Here's the thing.

91
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,529
Guys in their early 30s and mid-30s are completely different.

92
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,460
There's a huge difference in their insight.

93
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,230
What about you?

94
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,830
I'm fine with it.

95
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,569
I'm fine with anyone over 30.

96
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,970
- Anyone over 30?
- Over 30?

97
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,239
Among our older women and younger men participants,

98
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
Yes?

99
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,910
the biggest age gap is 12 years.

100
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,809
- For real?
- There are participants...

101
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,810
with that age gap.

102
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,449
Will they...

103
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,990
Isn't it the one messing up her hair?

104
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,550
This sounds really fun.

105
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,560
(One day in September)

106
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,170
(Where they meet for the first time)

107
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,870
(A red car arrives first.)

108
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,400
She has an innocent style.

109
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,769
(Park Ye Eun)

110
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,200
Her skin is pure white.

111
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,770
I only worked hard for my future.

112
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,180
During an important period of my life,

113
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,940
I could have gotten married.

114
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,910
But I chose my career over marriage.

115
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,920
I'm lonely.

116
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,120
I'm lonely right now.

117
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:51,600
(She's here to meet her fated partner.)

118
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,570
She looks quite young.

119
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,009
- I'd say she's in her 20s.
- Totally in her 20s.

120
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,110
- Right?
- Yes.

121
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,650
(Pouting)

122
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,860
(Feeling shy)

123
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,830
I was extremely nervous.

124
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,760
"Who will show up?"

125
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,630
It also made me excited.

126
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,769
(Fate comes at unexpected times,)

127
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,970
(like a sudden shower.)

128
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,310
Is it a guy this time?

129
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,039
(The second participant appears amidst the shower.)

130
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,309
What a nice car.

131
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,420
(The second participant appears amidst the shower.)

132
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,529
It's a female participant?

133
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,870
(Walking confidently in high heels)

134
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,409
It's a participant with a different charm.

135
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,080
(Park Ji Won)

136
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,010
I don't remember ever taking a break like this.

137
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,719
I've always worked, studied,

138
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,880
and started a business.

139
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,179
You never really...

140
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,289
get the chance to spend time...

141
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,089
solely getting to know someone...

142
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,360
in your life.

143
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,230
(As it's a precious opportunity, she wants to find someone nice.)

144
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,800
Hi.

145
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

146
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,480
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

147
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,910
Did you wait long?

148
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,010
No.

149
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,079
It's hot, isn't it?

150
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,190
Yes, it is.

151
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,619
One female participant met another female participant.

152
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,920
- That must've been weird.
- Totally.

153
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,690
(Glancing)

154
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,890
(Glancing again)

155
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,360
(Glancing)

156
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,360
How awkward.

157
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,040
(An awkward air flows between the two.)

158
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,070
You're pretty.

159
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,110
You're much prettier.

160
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,839
That's normal when ladies meet up,

161
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,050
complimenting each other on their beauty.

162
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,320
There should be two more participants.

163
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,649
It must be a total of four.

164
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,890
Right? I'm excited.

165
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,489
- Oh, no.
- She's cute.

166
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,959
I was wondering why she looked so cheerful.

167
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,360
She thinks there's little competition.

168
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,960
She believes it's 2-on-2.

169
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,570
(A sedan arrives third.)

170
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,880
(Is it finally a younger man?)

171
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,880
Seriously?

172
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,890
It's like a commercial.

173
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,590
A commercial.

174
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,650
Gorgeous.

175
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:13,200
(Kim Yeong Gyeong)

176
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,630
To me, dating is an unknown world.

177
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,940
- It's a mystery.
- Why?

178
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,070
It's like an area I need to explore.

179
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,980
Right now, dating...

180
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,650
is at zero.

181
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,979
I spend about 99 on my work...

182
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,220
and 1 on taking breaks, doing hobbies, and enjoying life.

183
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,990
Honestly, looking back,

184
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,530
there were more times when guys passionately pursued me first...

185
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,100
rather than me winning their love.

186
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,769
That's why, if I get the chance,

187
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,970
I'd like to win his heart first.

188
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,710
I look forward to what I will do.

189
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,890
- Hi.
- Hi.

190
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,590
- Hi.
- Hi.

191
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,690
- Hi.
- Hi.

192
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,360
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

193
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,430
(Staring)

194
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,770
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too. Hi.

195
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,680
You made a long trip to get here.

196
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,810
- It was quite far.
- Right?

197
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,410
(They look taken aback.)

198
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:38,620
They thought it'd be a younger guy.

199
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,049
To think this would happen.

200
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,250
Three women.

201
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,689
What's going on?

202
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,359
Why only women?

203
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,430
What's more, everyone has long hair and is wearing a white top.

204
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,530
You're right.

205
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,399
(The fourth woman has arrived.)

206
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,500
The fourth woman. Another woman?

207
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,070
She's wearing black.

208
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,079
(Gu Bon Hee)

209
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,209
It looks like a commercial whenever a woman walks in.

210
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,949
I was the type who used myself...

211
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,650
as a tool to work.

212
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,760
My career felt more important than love.

213
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,090
But after realizing there are more important things than my career,

214
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,370
I thought this would be a chance to focus only on my feelings.

215
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,669
So I'm looking forward to it. It's giving me butterflies.

216
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,370
(Will she find someone who will make her heart pound again?)

217
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,309
What they say is different from other dating shows.

218
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,640
- How so?
- Exactly.

219
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,049
They can summarize the kind of life...

220
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,550
they've lived in one sentence.

221
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,849
The fact that they can explain...

222
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,719
in one sentence why they haven't...

223
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,559
gotten married or dated until now...

224
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,129
shows how straightforward their lives are.

225
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,459
They have a clear answer.

226
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,230
- They seem confident.
- For sure.

227
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,130
- Hi.
- Hi.

228
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,739
- Hi.
- Hi.

229
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,970
Hi.

230
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,340
I didn't know everyone had arrived.

231
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,409
(Everyone's eyes are fixed on Bon Hee upon her arrival.)

232
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,450
They're studying her.

233
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,150
The older women study her.

234
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,950
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

235
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,020
(Nervous)

236
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,819
(The 4 older women have gathered first.)

237
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,830
How awkward.

238
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,060
(Glancing)

239
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,299
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

240
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,839
Everyone here is so gorgeous...

241
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,240
that my eyes...

242
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,709
are feasting.

243
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,010
I'm...

244
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,410
(Reading the room)

245
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,550
I'll stay still because it'd be awkward if I said something back.

246
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,990
You get it, right?

247
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,520
Like when women say, "You've lost weight," and all.

248
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,290
So I won't say anything.

249
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,259
But it's not that easy to tell another woman...

250
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,629
that your eyes are feasting because she's pretty.

251
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,929
- No.
- Exactly.

252
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,070
- People keep it to themselves.
- It shows how nice she is.

253
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,310
It's a story about older women and younger men.

254
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,510
How did you feel after hearing it?

255
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,180
- It felt new.
- Right.

256
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,450
But I thought it'd be fun too.

257
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,349
Have you dated a younger guy before?

258
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,820
Once, when I was in my 20s.

259
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,090
I rarely had the chance...

260
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,160
to meet older men.

261
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,870
It's fun, and they have the energy...

262
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,940
that suits me better.

263
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,370
In general, it feels like younger men hit on women...

264
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,309
more passionately.

265
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,680
(Agreeing)

266
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,339
(Nodding)

267
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,510
Everyone can relate.

268
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,249
Aren't I right?

269
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,250
(Becoming self-conscious)

270
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,250
(Thinking)

271
00:13:58,251 --> 00:14:01,350
I hit on guys first.

272
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,620
Maybe they hit on you first because you're beautiful.

273
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,490
(Embarrassed)

274
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,059
The one time I dated a younger guy, I remember hitting on him first.

275
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,159
(Sharing memories of dating younger men)

276
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,000
But I didn't know his age at first.

277
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,799
I didn't. I only found out...

278
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,570
he was younger as we talked.

279
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,940
Teto-guy versus egen-guy.

280
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,110
But the two are...

281
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,840
- Must I choose one?
- Yes.

282
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,039
Only one.

283
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,049
(Bummed out)

284
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,550
I like crunchy outside, tender inside.

285
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,249
So a teto-guy on the outside, an egen-guy on the inside.

286
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,619
Aren't they the most popular these days?

287
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,950
- Yes.
- Right?

288
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,860
I'll go with her answer too.

289
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,230
You too?

290
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,930
A puppy-like guy.

291
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,629
In short, an egen-guy.

292
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,730
- Yes.
- Right.

293
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,230
They got a message.

294
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,770
Our phone went off.

295
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,370
- "Check the top of the cabinet."
- "Check the top of the cabinet."

296
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,479
"Here are keywords that are hints about the men."

297
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,780
"Choose one card that you like."

298
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,419
- What?
- It's for you.

299
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,420
(The fateful keyword Yeong Gyeong should choose?)

300
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,389
Crunchy outside, tender inside.

301
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,989
(Crunchy outside, tender inside is included.)

302
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,959
- Perfect.
- How is this possible?

303
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,389
There's even Golden Retriever.

304
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,900
(Golden Retriever, similar to puppy-like)

305
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,529
"Let's go get meat, noona. Well-organized."

306
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,469
(Captivating younger men's keywords)

307
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,869
- "If you're with me,"
- "If you're with me,"

308
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,439
- "your ears will never be bored."
- "your ears will never be bored."

309
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,470
- "The day flies by."
- "The day flies by."

310
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,840
Woo Young and SOOBIN. Say that you were to come up with keywords.

311
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,010
What would yours be?

312
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:32,740
- To introduce myself?
- Yes.

313
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,309
I want to see the person I'm interested in...

314
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,850
continue to laugh.

315
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,820
"Be with me, and you'll laugh your head off."

316
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,989
I'm interested.

317
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,990
- Nice.
- You are?

318
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:44,759
No? Don't you think he'll be funny?

319
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,820
What's your hashtag?

320
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,790
Have you in stitches.

321
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,859
- It suddenly...
- What is it? Was that a good one?

322
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,100
I'm no longer interested.

323
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,600
"Have you in stitches" was a bit...

324
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,770
Did it drop your expectations? What about you, SOOBIN?

325
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,039
My hashtag would be...

326
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,740
(SOOBIN's keyword to top "have you in stitches")

327
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,210
- a chameleon.
- A chameleon?

328
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,839
- Is it too old-fashioned?
- A chameleon?

329
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,610
(Embarrassed)

330
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,840
- A chameleon?
- I can become anything.

331
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,319
I like to adapt to my partner rather than expecting them to adapt to me.

332
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,650
- Really?
- Yes.

333
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,449
(At that moment)

334
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,690
Here they are.

335
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,390
(Are the younger men finally revealed?)

336
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,990
(In different locations,)

337
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,029
What's going on?

338
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,030
(the 4 younger men...)

339
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:26,099
What a nice silhouette.

340
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,100
(are waiting.)

341
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:28,300
He's got a nice silhouette.

342
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,770
(After choosing the keywords they like,)

343
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,669
(the older women head off to pick them up.)

344
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,670
They go to pick them up?

345
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,609
The older women are going to pick...

346
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,050
- the younger men up.
- Pick them up.

347
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,920
(The first younger man is waiting for the older woman.)

348
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,690
I find older women more comfortable.

349
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,790
Older women are more comfortable than younger women.

350
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,560
If she's my ideal type,

351
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,070
I could date someone ten years older than me.

352
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,539
(Who will come to this man,)

353
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,310
(looking for his ideal type?)

354
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,840
I was extremely nervous.

355
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,510
I wondered what would happen.

356
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,520
I was worried,

357
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,149
but I'm also curious.

358
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,850
(I'm curious about who I will meet.)

359
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,060
(Tense)

360
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,090
(Glancing)

361
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,230
(She eases her tension with a hand grip.)

362
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,399
A hand grip?

363
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,969
I've never seen anyone relieve tension with a hand grip.

364
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,370
She uses a hand grip?

365
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,270
(Clicking)

366
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,949
(She trains her grip strength...)

367
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,520
(and arrives at the place where a younger guy awaits.)

368
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,219
(The tense yet thrilling moment...)

369
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,660
(of a first encounter)

370
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,900
(Who's the woman that picked the first younger guy?)

371
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,739
(Bon Hee's pick)

372
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,609
He's the guy that Bon Hee picked, right?

373
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,610
Yes.

374
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:22,480
(Hesitating)

375
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:25,444
(Bon Hee's pick)

376
00:18:25,445 --> 00:18:28,214
He's the guy that Bon Hee picked, right?

377
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:29,215
Yes.

378
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:31,215
(Hesitating)

379
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:34,385
Hello.

380
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:36,685
Hello.

381
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,095
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hi.

382
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,195
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yes.

383
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:45,065
- I'll take a seat.
- Sure.

384
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:47,994
That's Mu Jin.

385
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:49,495
(Bon Hee picked Mu Jin.)

386
00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:51,865
Have you waited long?

387
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:55,805
A couple of hours.

388
00:18:56,575 --> 00:18:58,074
- You waited long.
- Yes.

389
00:18:58,075 --> 00:18:59,245
Didn't you have to wait?

390
00:19:00,315 --> 00:19:01,415
Not really.

391
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:09,754
- He's good-looking.
- He's nice.

392
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:10,755
They look cute together.

393
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:12,084
- He's handsome.
- They make a cute couple.

394
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:13,155
They do.

395
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:14,654
- They do.
- They're a good match.

396
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,124
They don't really look like a couple...

397
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,464
with an age gap.

398
00:19:17,465 --> 00:19:18,824
- Right?
- Not at all.

399
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,064
Did you see the guy trying to hold...

400
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:22,435
his smile?

401
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:25,064
I think the woman is into him too.

402
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:26,875
- She also looks satisfied.
- Yes.

403
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:32,945
(A pleasant tension)

404
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:35,344
I noticed that you almost finished your coffee,

405
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:36,944
so I thought you had been here for a while.

406
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:38,415
- Would you like one?
- Sorry?

407
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:40,015
Should I have one too?

408
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:42,215
Then, we'll...

409
00:19:42,755 --> 00:19:44,285
- I'll pay for it.
- Hold on.

410
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,925
(Mu Jin hurriedly grabbed his card.)

411
00:19:52,765 --> 00:19:53,935
What would you like?

412
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:56,094
I'll have an iced latte.

413
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,435
- An iced latte?
- Yes.

414
00:19:58,105 --> 00:19:59,535
- This one?
- Yes.

415
00:20:01,305 --> 00:20:02,705
I'll have another cup of coffee.

416
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:05,145
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

417
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,374
Do you sleep well even after having coffee?

418
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,415
Yes.

419
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,645
(Yes.)

420
00:20:11,985 --> 00:20:14,215
- What?
- What?

421
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:15,815
He subtly dropped the honorifics.

422
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,125
This show is wild.

423
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,995
(This older woman is thrilled.)

424
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,464
But they've just met.

425
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:24,764
(Speechless)

426
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,994
Before...

427
00:20:25,995 --> 00:20:28,595
they went to order coffee, Bon Hee asked,

428
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:31,864
"Do you sleep well, even after coffee?"

429
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:33,234
- She did.
- Yes.

430
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:37,145
I felt a difference from that one sentence.

431
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:39,774
Right? She was being considerate.

432
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:42,374
I felt cared for.

433
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,415
- Right.
- That's how it felt.

434
00:20:45,715 --> 00:20:47,415
Do you sleep well even after having coffee?

435
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:48,585
Yes.

436
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:51,725
(Grinning)

437
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,295
Thank you for the coffee.

438
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,064
(Spotting the keyword)

439
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:04,135
Did you pick this card?

440
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:05,305
I did.

441
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:07,705
(Twitching his nose)

442
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:11,904
- The profiles were...
- Yes.

443
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:13,375
all different.

444
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:15,614
- That looks like my profile.
- Yes.

445
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:17,684
- Can you turn to the side?
- Me?

446
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:19,244
Is it this side? I think it's the other side.

447
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,954
- Is it this side?
- There it is.

448
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:22,555
I said that the back of your head was pretty.

449
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:25,654
When I saw this,

450
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:28,525
I said that the back of your head was very round.

451
00:21:31,795 --> 00:21:34,595
But you look way better in person.

452
00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:35,895
- Do I?
- Yes.

453
00:21:36,565 --> 00:21:39,365
In the shadow, you're more...

454
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,904
The back of my head really is round.

455
00:21:41,905 --> 00:21:44,044
- I also have a round head.
- I see.

456
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:45,105
Can I see?

457
00:21:45,175 --> 00:21:47,115
- I have a round head.
- You do.

458
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:50,514
(Staring)

459
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:51,914
You're really beautiful.

460
00:21:51,915 --> 00:21:53,815
Me? Thank you.

461
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:57,485
(Goodness gracious)

462
00:21:58,255 --> 00:21:59,524
(Amazed)

463
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:01,325
- Wait!
- "You're beautiful."

464
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:02,755
What was that?

465
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,625
- Who is this guy?
- They do that?

466
00:22:05,865 --> 00:22:07,365
I loved the non-honorifics, though.

467
00:22:07,695 --> 00:22:09,294
You can make a clip of that...

468
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:11,505
and give it to Seul Hye.

469
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:12,764
Make a clip of him saying, "You're beautiful,"

470
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,404
and send it to me.

471
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:16,605
I'm cool with just an audio file if you can't get a video.

472
00:22:16,975 --> 00:22:18,674
- SOOBIN, - Yes.

473
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:20,475
would you be able...

474
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:24,445
to say that while sipping a drink?

475
00:22:25,015 --> 00:22:26,484
I'm not good at saying things I don't mean,

476
00:22:26,485 --> 00:22:28,814
- so if it's not true...
- But she's actually pretty.

477
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:31,654
If she's as pretty as Bon Hee,

478
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:33,694
I wouldn't have a problem saying that.

479
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:34,854
- Really?
- Yes.

480
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:37,495
It's also a good way to start a conversation.

481
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:39,924
Mu Jin is skilled.

482
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,035
- He's no ordinary man.
- Definitely.

483
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:44,464
You're really beautiful.

484
00:22:44,465 --> 00:22:46,635
Me? Thank you.

485
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:48,675
You're handsome.

486
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:52,404
(Twitching his nose)

487
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:55,114
The way he twitches his nose is very charming.

488
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:56,645
- I'm nervous.
- Are you nervous?

489
00:23:04,955 --> 00:23:07,125
I'll tell you why I picked it.

490
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,795
Because you like meat?

491
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:12,125
I must have wanted meat.

492
00:23:12,895 --> 00:23:16,495
And this keyword "well-organized" made me think...

493
00:23:17,065 --> 00:23:18,364
you'd be...

494
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:21,775
capable and responsible.

495
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:24,044
- Right.
- Am I right?

496
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:26,145
My name is Kim Mu Jin.

497
00:23:26,915 --> 00:23:29,515
- It's Kim Mu Jin?
- Yes, Kim Mu Jin.

498
00:23:30,415 --> 00:23:32,585
- And I'm well-organized, so...
- Really?

499
00:23:32,985 --> 00:23:34,685
- Is that why you chose that word?
- Yes.

500
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:36,785
- It's my nickname.
- Your nickname?

501
00:23:37,685 --> 00:23:39,124
What's your name, if you mind me asking?

502
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,795
I'm Gu Bon Hee.

503
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:44,025
- Gu Bon Hee?
- Bon Hee.

504
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:46,365
That's right.

505
00:23:47,995 --> 00:23:48,995
Yes.

506
00:23:51,205 --> 00:23:53,335
- What kind of meat do you like?
- Meat?

507
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:55,505
Pork belly with kimchi.

508
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,245
- Pork belly with kimchi?
- Yes.

509
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:00,475
We'll get to have meat together one day, right?

510
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:02,215
I'd like that.

511
00:24:09,185 --> 00:24:11,525
(Grinning)

512
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:18,395
She's shivering.

513
00:24:19,195 --> 00:24:21,565
- Oh, my gosh!
- She's so nervous.

514
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,135
- She suddenly got awkward.
- Yes.

515
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:28,735
She totally lost control.

516
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:33,004
He's very charismatic.

517
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,215
(His presence overwhelms her.)

518
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:39,715
Is that bobbed hair?

519
00:24:40,685 --> 00:24:42,915
- Right now? Yes.
- Yes.

520
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:47,895
It suits you.

521
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:51,765
Okay.

522
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,034
(Even when he's shy,)

523
00:24:59,035 --> 00:25:02,775
(he can't take his eyes off Bon Hee.)

524
00:25:04,275 --> 00:25:06,704
I was so nervous when I met the other women.

525
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:07,714
Right.

526
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,614
My face started to stiffen.

527
00:25:09,615 --> 00:25:10,984
I feel comfortable now.

528
00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:13,655
I don't know why I feel so comfortable.

529
00:25:14,155 --> 00:25:16,084
- Now that you're here?
- No, I...

530
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:17,155
- Did you mean me?
- Yes.

531
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,755
That's good.

532
00:25:23,995 --> 00:25:25,225
I think it'll be fun.

533
00:25:26,295 --> 00:25:27,335
Yes.

534
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:29,665
Let's go now.

535
00:25:31,105 --> 00:25:32,305
I'm getting nervous.

536
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:37,245
- Her smile is completely different.
- Oh, my gosh.

537
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:39,675
It's like he bewitched her.

538
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:43,045
His vibe is...

539
00:25:43,445 --> 00:25:45,614
nothing like that of a younger guy.

540
00:25:45,615 --> 00:25:47,714
- You're right.
- Bon Hee...

541
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:50,384
wasn't exactly the gentle one...

542
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:52,454
- among the females.
- Right.

543
00:25:52,455 --> 00:25:53,795
But now,

544
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:58,164
I feel like she's behaving that way because of Mu Jin.

545
00:25:58,165 --> 00:25:59,194
Right.

546
00:25:59,195 --> 00:26:02,295
He's the type of guy that makes you act awkwardly.

547
00:26:02,765 --> 00:26:04,164
She knocked her down.

548
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:05,665
Yes, he has that subtle vibe.

549
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:11,004
(Another younger guy...)

550
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:12,845
(waiting for a woman from another place.)

551
00:26:13,545 --> 00:26:15,775
What I was worried about was...

552
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,985
that I would seem too young to her.

553
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:22,515
I was worried that I would look too childish.

554
00:26:24,825 --> 00:26:26,955
I didn't want to call her "noona."

555
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:34,295
- Hello.
- Hello.

556
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:37,135
- Hello.
- Hello.

557
00:26:38,905 --> 00:26:40,805
- Did you just get here?
- Yes.

558
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:46,805
(Peeking)

559
00:26:47,615 --> 00:26:48,974
(Ye Eun picked Golden Retriever.)

560
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,384
He looks like a Golden Retriever.

561
00:26:50,385 --> 00:26:53,214
(Anxious)

562
00:26:53,215 --> 00:26:55,155
He doesn't know where to look.

563
00:26:56,355 --> 00:26:58,755
I didn't know you'd enter so suddenly.

564
00:27:07,535 --> 00:27:09,734
Do you drink coffee?

565
00:27:09,735 --> 00:27:12,735
Yes, I love coffee.

566
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:15,034
Thanks.

567
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:16,274
(Golden Retriever turns to drink.)

568
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:17,905
The ice must have melted a little.

569
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:21,115
Why is he turning and drinking coffee?

570
00:27:21,315 --> 00:27:23,214
She's not that old!

571
00:27:23,215 --> 00:27:24,215
Right.

572
00:27:24,315 --> 00:27:25,584
(Laughing)

573
00:27:25,585 --> 00:27:26,615
That was cute.

574
00:27:27,055 --> 00:27:28,185
He's too tense.

575
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,784
He's restless.

576
00:27:29,785 --> 00:27:32,784
- That's so cute.
- Golden Retriever...

577
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:34,224
- looks so cute.
- He does.

578
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:37,024
He's completely different from well-organized.

579
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:38,025
(He's the opposite of Mu Jin.)

580
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:42,135
May I ask your name?

581
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,465
I'm Park Ye Eun.

582
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:46,004
- Ye Eun?
- What's your name?

583
00:27:46,005 --> 00:27:48,475
- I'm Kim Sang Hyeon. Yes.
- Sang Hyeon.

584
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:53,105
Ye Eun. Ms. Park?

585
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,415
- "Ms. Park?"
- He's cute.

586
00:28:00,655 --> 00:28:01,655
(Spotting)

587
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:03,015
I didn't notice that was here.

588
00:28:09,895 --> 00:28:11,525
(Exclaiming)

589
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:16,095
- Are you feeling shy?
- Yes.

590
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:22,635
- Do you...
- Yes.

591
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:24,805
Why is it Golden Retriever?

592
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,015
I've been told...

593
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:32,715
that I was like a puppy.

594
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:34,884
I picked this card.

595
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:36,415
- Did you?
- Yes.

596
00:28:36,855 --> 00:28:39,355
Can I ask you why you picked it?

597
00:28:41,695 --> 00:28:43,965
It's my type of guy.

598
00:28:45,595 --> 00:28:48,994
You must like guys who are like puppies.

599
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:51,165
- Yes. I like puppies.
- I see.

600
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:55,575
That's a pretty necklace.

601
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:03,544
He should have said she was pretty.

602
00:29:03,545 --> 00:29:04,884
He can't even meet eyes.

603
00:29:04,885 --> 00:29:07,585
Mu Jin didn't just say she was pretty.

604
00:29:07,785 --> 00:29:10,185
He was looking straight at her...

605
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:11,524
and said it so nonchalantly.

606
00:29:11,525 --> 00:29:13,384
(He had his eyes on her and said it calmly.)

607
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:16,294
But Sang Hyeon is very shy...

608
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:19,664
and doesn't know where to look.

609
00:29:19,665 --> 00:29:21,234
The two are the exact opposite...

610
00:29:21,235 --> 00:29:23,765
in terms of the way they speak on a first encounter.

611
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:28,375
I've been told...

612
00:29:29,805 --> 00:29:31,375
that I looked like a cat.

613
00:29:31,475 --> 00:29:32,744
Right.

614
00:29:32,745 --> 00:29:39,145
Do you like girls with cat-like faces?

615
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,655
Yes, I do.

616
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:47,195
Are you sure you don't like the puppy types?

617
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:51,765
No. I think I like a cat-like woman more.

618
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:53,365
- Really?
- Yes.

619
00:29:55,135 --> 00:29:57,505
I have a cat-like face, so I like a guy with a puppy-like face.

620
00:29:57,605 --> 00:29:59,065
Oh, the opposite.

621
00:30:02,605 --> 00:30:04,045
What types of girls are you into?

622
00:30:04,145 --> 00:30:07,215
I also like the opposite.

623
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:08,975
Someone cold...

624
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,285
I like a woman with a cold, cat-like face.

625
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:15,985
I've never heard of a cold, cat-like face before.

626
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:20,354
I'm usually smiley, and I rarely get angry.

627
00:30:20,355 --> 00:30:24,194
I prefer someone who I can be considerate toward.

628
00:30:24,195 --> 00:30:27,024
Rather than being considerate toward each other,

629
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:30,095
I like someone who's honest.

630
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,665
I'm very honest.

631
00:30:33,905 --> 00:30:34,905
(Flustered)

632
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:36,205
Don't be too honest, though.

633
00:30:37,305 --> 00:30:38,605
You might hurt my feelings.

634
00:30:42,015 --> 00:30:43,575
Yes. So, there's that.

635
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:46,914
(His hands are sweating.)

636
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:50,655
What's your... I can't quite phrase it well.

637
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:53,454
Are you usually...

638
00:30:53,455 --> 00:30:57,664
into guys who are big...

639
00:30:57,665 --> 00:30:58,794
and masculine?

640
00:30:58,795 --> 00:31:00,695
Or do you like guys who are small and cute?

641
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:06,065
Appearance-wise, I like someone with big eyes with monolids.

642
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:07,975
Big eyes with monolids?

643
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:11,305
I do have monolids.

644
00:31:11,845 --> 00:31:12,845
You do.

645
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:14,575
Just saying.

646
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:21,855
And a guy who looks pretty when he smiles.

647
00:31:23,155 --> 00:31:25,285
I should try to smile prettily.

648
00:31:25,485 --> 00:31:26,485
Oh, my.

649
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:27,994
(Although he feels awkward,)

650
00:31:27,995 --> 00:31:29,895
(he says what he needs to say to win her over.)

651
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:32,925
And I prefer...

652
00:31:34,295 --> 00:31:37,865
a man who takes good care of himself.

653
00:31:38,705 --> 00:31:40,604
I take pretty good care of myself.

654
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:41,605
Goodness.

655
00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:47,644
(The awkward...)

656
00:31:47,645 --> 00:31:49,545
(yet thrilling first encounter ends.)

657
00:31:51,345 --> 00:31:53,814
(At that moment,)

658
00:31:53,815 --> 00:31:58,854
(another guy is waiting for a woman.)

659
00:31:58,855 --> 00:32:01,395
He has a big build. He's very tall.

660
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:04,364
I've dated lots of older women since I was younger...

661
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:05,565
because of how I look.

662
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:08,735
I had dated a lot of older women.

663
00:32:09,435 --> 00:32:10,665
I liked it.

664
00:32:10,765 --> 00:32:12,065
He looks good.

665
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:25,315
She gives off a different vibe.

666
00:32:26,015 --> 00:32:27,115
Hello.

667
00:32:34,555 --> 00:32:35,625
That height difference makes my heart flutter.

668
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:39,465
Are you "crunchy outside, tender inside?"

669
00:32:40,065 --> 00:32:42,195
Pardon? Oh, right.

670
00:32:43,535 --> 00:32:44,565
That's me.

671
00:32:50,605 --> 00:32:51,974
So, he's "crunchy outside, tender inside."

672
00:32:51,975 --> 00:32:53,005
(Kim Hyeon Jun)

673
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:54,244
(Yeong Gyeong picked "crunchy outside, tender inside.")

674
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:55,445
(Glancing)

675
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,415
(Feeling shy)

676
00:32:59,515 --> 00:33:00,885
(Glancing)

677
00:33:01,115 --> 00:33:02,755
I get shy around strangers.

678
00:33:05,355 --> 00:33:07,895
- You do?
- Yes. How about you?

679
00:33:09,025 --> 00:33:11,195
- So do I.
- We're in trouble.

680
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:21,375
(A "crunchy outside, tender inside" meeting at a rainy train station)

681
00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:23,205
By the way,

682
00:33:24,405 --> 00:33:26,105
I think we're stuck here.

683
00:33:30,415 --> 00:33:32,185
I think we are.

684
00:33:32,985 --> 00:33:35,615
It's showering hard.

685
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,355
It is.

686
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:44,965
It suddenly started raining hard.

687
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,395
It was more atmospheric,

688
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,565
and it felt like I was in a scene from a movie.

689
00:33:51,665 --> 00:33:54,074
- It does look like a movie.
- It's like a painting.

690
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,075
Come with me.

691
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:57,035
Will you be all right with those shoes?

692
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,505
It's fine.

693
00:34:01,015 --> 00:34:04,115
Hold on. There's a huge puddle.

694
00:34:04,715 --> 00:34:06,445
- Step on these.
- Okay.

695
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,854
Go on. It's dangerous.

696
00:34:08,855 --> 00:34:09,914
(Hyeon Jun seems naturally well-mannered.)

697
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:12,485
- Go on.
- Thank you.

698
00:34:13,825 --> 00:34:15,955
This is getting interesting.

699
00:34:17,995 --> 00:34:21,764
(He walks her to her car until she gets in.)

700
00:34:21,765 --> 00:34:22,765
All good?

701
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,765
Yes. Thank you.

702
00:34:27,105 --> 00:34:28,734
Your jacket must be soaking wet.

703
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:29,875
(His arm is soaked.)

704
00:34:31,305 --> 00:34:32,875
(It's rainier than expected.)

705
00:34:33,175 --> 00:34:34,374
There was lightning.

706
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:36,244
(Scared)

707
00:34:36,245 --> 00:34:37,245
No way.

708
00:34:38,185 --> 00:34:40,085
(Looking)

709
00:34:41,515 --> 00:34:43,115
I don't think it's going to stop any time soon.

710
00:34:43,755 --> 00:34:44,785
Should we switch seats?

711
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:46,725
Should we?

712
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:51,465
(He readily offers to drive.)

713
00:34:53,295 --> 00:34:56,134
I love this type of stuff.

714
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,804
(Impressed)

715
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,305
What does the rain have to do with switching seats?

716
00:35:01,175 --> 00:35:02,974
- When it's raining...
- Shouldn't you...

717
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,104
- hit the road as soon as possible?
- It's harder to drive...

718
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,104
- in the rain.
- Oh, I see.

719
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,645
It's a heavy rain, so it's harder to see.

720
00:35:10,445 --> 00:35:12,084
He's naturally considerate.

721
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:13,445
(He understood.)

722
00:35:14,555 --> 00:35:17,485
I wasn't hesitant because she was older.

723
00:35:18,085 --> 00:35:19,524
Instead, she was mature,

724
00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:21,155
and I could learn a lot from her.

725
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:23,725
Our relationship was calmer.

726
00:35:25,995 --> 00:35:29,365
(They meet for the first time.)

727
00:35:32,935 --> 00:35:34,875
- Hello.
- Hello.

728
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:38,375
- Hello.
- Hello.

729
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:40,605
- Hi.
- Hello.

730
00:35:41,215 --> 00:35:42,545
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

731
00:35:43,215 --> 00:35:45,185
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

732
00:35:45,285 --> 00:35:46,685
He can't look her in the eyes.

733
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:50,554
"The day flies by." I'm dying to find out.

734
00:35:50,555 --> 00:35:52,624
What? Oh, right.

735
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:53,925
- Is this you?
- It is.

736
00:35:54,425 --> 00:35:55,554
(Ji Won picked "the day flies by.")

737
00:35:55,555 --> 00:35:57,624
- "The day flies by."
- So, you picked it based on that.

738
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,095
- Yes.
- I had no idea.

739
00:36:00,395 --> 00:36:01,965
What's your name?

740
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:04,364
I'm Park Sang Won.

741
00:36:04,365 --> 00:36:06,164
- Park Sang Won?
- Sang Won.

742
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:07,905
- What is your name?
- I'm Park Ji Won.

743
00:36:09,105 --> 00:36:11,805
"If you're with me, your ears will never be bored."

744
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:13,605
That means I'm chatty.

745
00:36:16,345 --> 00:36:18,985
I don't like silence in conversations.

746
00:36:22,085 --> 00:36:23,914
You seem very calm right now.

747
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,784
I know. I'm trying hard to suppress my urge to chat.

748
00:36:25,785 --> 00:36:26,785
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

749
00:36:27,325 --> 00:36:30,625
- But you should make my day fly by.
- That's right.

750
00:36:32,365 --> 00:36:33,495
Give me a few moments.

751
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,265
We have a lot of time, you know.

752
00:36:35,795 --> 00:36:37,165
We still have much time.

753
00:36:38,605 --> 00:36:39,804
(Ji Won leads Sang Won, who's nervous, naturally.)

754
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:42,675
- I see that Ji Won's very cheerful.
- Yes, indeed.

755
00:36:43,005 --> 00:36:45,345
Have you ever dated an older woman?

756
00:36:46,775 --> 00:36:48,675
- Yes, I have.
- I see.

757
00:36:49,545 --> 00:36:53,915
I've dated two older women, both for over a year.

758
00:36:54,685 --> 00:36:57,385
Were the ladies you dated nice?

759
00:36:58,225 --> 00:37:00,685
They were more stable than younger ones.

760
00:37:01,255 --> 00:37:03,125
Before I met them,

761
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:06,195
I dated some younger women.

762
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,135
- I found them mentally unstable.
- I see.

763
00:37:10,765 --> 00:37:13,265
But it was different when I dated older women.

764
00:37:13,335 --> 00:37:15,775
Since they had already stabled their lives,

765
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:18,305
there were not a lot of changes in their lives.

766
00:37:19,105 --> 00:37:20,804
So we didn't have a lot of conflicts.

767
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,615
Everything would be fine as long as I didn't cause trouble.

768
00:37:25,885 --> 00:37:27,984
(The romantic first meeting of the participants is over.)

769
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:30,084
We've watched...

770
00:37:30,085 --> 00:37:31,754
- how all participants met 1-on-1.
- Yes.

771
00:37:31,755 --> 00:37:35,525
Which of those four couples made your heart flutter?

772
00:37:35,655 --> 00:37:36,854
I pick Mr. Yes.

773
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,524
- He spoke casually to his partner.
- Right, Yes Mu Jin.

774
00:37:38,525 --> 00:37:40,194
And the way he wrinkled his nose.

775
00:37:40,195 --> 00:37:41,334
- That's right.
- Yes.

776
00:37:41,335 --> 00:37:43,564
As for the other couples,

777
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:46,364
- the women seemed to take the lead.
- Right.

778
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:47,634
Mu Jin was the only guy...

779
00:37:47,635 --> 00:37:49,905
- who seemed to be the leader.
- That's right.

780
00:37:50,105 --> 00:37:53,205
Sang Hyeon seemed like a man who'd be devoted to a relationship.

781
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:55,845
I think his heart wouldn't change once he falls in love.

782
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:59,144
He didn't know how to express his feelings.

783
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:01,114
The way he acted struck me as cute.

784
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:03,115
- He seemed innocent to you.
- It brings out your affection.

785
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:05,885
What do you think about Sang Won?

786
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:08,625
I was excited to see...

787
00:38:08,925 --> 00:38:10,794
how he'd entertain his partner.

788
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:12,895
- But he seemed unexpectedly shy.
- Right.

789
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:15,534
So I thought he was a younger man after all.

790
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:17,534
Was he very nervous to meet an older woman?

791
00:38:17,535 --> 00:38:19,464
- I think he was very nervous.
- Yes, because she's older than him.

792
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:22,404
- Honestly, a man like Hyeon Jun...
- Right.

793
00:38:22,405 --> 00:38:24,004
makes me feel comfortable.

794
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:25,904
- I knew you would like him.
- He seemed...

795
00:38:25,905 --> 00:38:28,744
- to be a manly and attentive type.
- Right, he's manliest of all.

796
00:38:28,745 --> 00:38:30,175
- He's very attractive.
- Indeed.

797
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:32,684
- He's very...
- Hye Jin, your eyes are sparkling.

798
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,885
- I'm completely into it.
- Right.

799
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:35,515
Show us the rest. I'm so curious.

800
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:38,625
That must be it.

801
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,355
It looks so fancy.

802
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:43,425
I think we're the first to arrive.

803
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:45,965
We're the first to arrive.

804
00:38:48,435 --> 00:38:50,665
- I'm glad it's not raining.
- Right.

805
00:38:52,465 --> 00:38:53,565
This must be it.

806
00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:01,575
(Yeon House)

807
00:39:01,815 --> 00:39:04,114
(The place they arrived at is...)

808
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:05,115
(Yeon House)

809
00:39:05,116 --> 00:39:06,445
Yeon House.

810
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,655
I wonder we're the first to arrive.

811
00:39:09,685 --> 00:39:11,224
- This must be it.
- Maybe we should...

812
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:12,625
(The first couple: Bon Hee and Mu Jin)

813
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:16,325
(- Impressive.
- It's nice.)

814
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,134
(This is Yeon House...)

815
00:39:22,135 --> 00:39:25,205
(where the older women and the younger men will stay together.)

816
00:39:25,705 --> 00:39:26,835
It's huge.

817
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:31,075
It has a swimming pool too.

818
00:39:32,505 --> 00:39:33,605
Exactly.

819
00:39:34,045 --> 00:39:36,675
A lot of things will happen here.

820
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:42,985
(The place where you forget your age and focus solely on your feelings)

821
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:44,284
(Amazed)

822
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:45,454
(Exclaiming in awe)

823
00:39:45,455 --> 00:39:47,325
It's practically a castle.

824
00:39:47,925 --> 00:39:49,494
I wonder what will happen in this house.

825
00:39:49,495 --> 00:39:50,594
(The romance in Yeon House is completely unpredictable.)

826
00:39:50,595 --> 00:39:52,464
What kind of wild, crazy things will happen?

827
00:39:52,465 --> 00:39:53,495
(The romance in Yeon House is completely unpredictable.)

828
00:39:54,065 --> 00:39:55,495
Would you like to open it?

829
00:40:03,805 --> 00:40:06,075
(Putting the slippers down)

830
00:40:06,775 --> 00:40:07,875
Thank you.

831
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:14,915
(Amazed)

832
00:40:15,615 --> 00:40:18,285
It's... Oh, my. It's all furnished like a house.

833
00:40:21,195 --> 00:40:22,424
(1st floor, common area)

834
00:40:22,425 --> 00:40:23,995
My goodness. This place is so nice.

835
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:30,165
(1st floor, kitchen)

836
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:33,135
I guess we eat here.

837
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:40,875
(The area next to the kitchen where they can eat together)

838
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:44,485
(1st floor, dining room)

839
00:40:44,815 --> 00:40:47,245
These are real flowers. Do you like flowers?

840
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:48,755
Yes, I like flowers.

841
00:40:50,085 --> 00:40:51,225
I thought they were fake.

842
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:54,854
I like flowers so much. I can tell if it's real right away.

843
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:56,254
- You can tell by looking at it?
- Yes.

844
00:40:56,255 --> 00:40:57,255
(Smiling)

845
00:40:58,595 --> 00:41:00,725
I go to a flower market too.

846
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:03,495
- You go to a flower market?
- Yes.

847
00:41:04,865 --> 00:41:06,335
- Shall we go upstairs?
- Yes.

848
00:41:09,435 --> 00:41:10,635
It's big.

849
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:16,815
- It's really nice.
- Indeed.

850
00:41:19,285 --> 00:41:20,285
(2nd floor, common area)

851
00:41:20,286 --> 00:41:22,455
I guess this is where we can have a chat.

852
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:27,585
(The space where honest and serious conversations will occur)

853
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:33,125
(2nd floor, girls' room)

854
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:34,665
So each of us will have one.

855
00:41:37,165 --> 00:41:38,264
(3rd floor, guys' room)

856
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:40,005
- This is the guys' room.
- Right.

857
00:41:42,405 --> 00:41:43,534
Terrace.

858
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:44,675
(3rd floor, terrace)

859
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:47,105
The view is nice.

860
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:54,045
(The luxurious and private space only for the participants)

861
00:41:54,815 --> 00:41:56,515
What color do you like?

862
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:59,585
- I like neutral colors. Yes.
- Neutral colors?

863
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:02,325
Colors that don't stand out.

864
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:05,495
What color would you pick if you had to pick one?

865
00:42:06,195 --> 00:42:08,135
Well... I guess I'd pick green.

866
00:42:08,365 --> 00:42:09,994
Dark green.

867
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:11,195
Oh, really?

868
00:42:14,005 --> 00:42:18,645
(There's one room they haven't checked out yet.)

869
00:42:20,745 --> 00:42:21,915
It's locked.

870
00:42:22,645 --> 00:42:23,744
- It's locked.
- Sorry?

871
00:42:23,745 --> 00:42:25,685
(The door is locked.)

872
00:42:25,915 --> 00:42:28,214
- What is it?
- What is it?

873
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:29,215
(What could be the purpose of the locked room?)

874
00:42:30,985 --> 00:42:35,325
(This room is unlocked only once a day.)

875
00:42:36,455 --> 00:42:39,565
(The chamber of secrets)

876
00:42:39,895 --> 00:42:40,965
"The chamber of secrets?"

877
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:43,764
(They can guess a participant's age in the chamber of secrets.)

878
00:42:43,765 --> 00:42:46,334
I think they can get a hint on someone's age in there.

879
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:47,704
(They can guess a participant's age in the chamber of secrets.)

880
00:42:47,705 --> 00:42:48,975
I guess they can get information about one another.

881
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:53,004
(Could it be possible...)

882
00:42:53,005 --> 00:42:55,975
(for love to transcend age differences?)

883
00:42:57,515 --> 00:42:58,515
(Who will enter this room? And how will he or she do it?)

884
00:42:58,516 --> 00:42:59,615
I'm so curious.

885
00:43:01,685 --> 00:43:03,615
Oh, my. It's so beautiful.

886
00:43:09,995 --> 00:43:13,325
(The second couple: Ye Eun and Sang Hyeon)

887
00:43:18,435 --> 00:43:19,635
One person must have arrived.

888
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:23,605
(Staggering)

889
00:43:25,105 --> 00:43:27,105
(Chuckling)

890
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:29,575
Thank you.

891
00:43:31,815 --> 00:43:33,445
(Impressed)

892
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,455
Can we take a look around?

893
00:43:45,965 --> 00:43:48,195
- Hello.
- Hello. It's nice to meet you.

894
00:43:49,195 --> 00:43:50,794
I'm glad to see you again. Don't you?

895
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:54,064
Take a look around. There's a kitchen here.

896
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:55,775
And don't forget to check what's in the fridge.

897
00:43:56,305 --> 00:44:00,004
- Did you have a look?
- Yes, it has four stories.

898
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:01,005
Really?

899
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:03,545
- He hid behind his partner.
- My goodness.

900
00:44:05,415 --> 00:44:07,685
- He's so cute.
- He's cute.

901
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:09,085
- He really is like a puppy.
- How cute.

902
00:44:11,755 --> 00:44:12,984
Let's look around.

903
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:13,985
(Avoiding eye contact)

904
00:44:13,986 --> 00:44:15,794
- I'm so excited.
- I see.

905
00:44:15,795 --> 00:44:17,154
(Wherever Ye Eun goes,)

906
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,565
(Sang Hyeon goes.)

907
00:44:21,395 --> 00:44:23,034
This place makes me feel comfortable for some reason.

908
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:26,104
- He's following her around.
- My goodness.

909
00:44:26,105 --> 00:44:27,705
(Following)

910
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:29,034
What is this?

911
00:44:29,035 --> 00:44:30,305
We have pasta noodles.

912
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,305
(Surprised)

913
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:34,845
- Hello.
- Hello.

914
00:44:35,045 --> 00:44:36,114
When did you get here?

915
00:44:36,115 --> 00:44:37,975
- We just got here.
- I see.

916
00:44:39,785 --> 00:44:40,885
- Hello.
- Hello.

917
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:42,415
- It's nice to meet you.
- I'm glad to meet you.

918
00:44:43,215 --> 00:44:45,024
Right. See? Mu Jin is different.

919
00:44:45,025 --> 00:44:46,724
- He greeted them right away...
- That's right.

920
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,324
and came up to them to have a chat.

921
00:44:48,325 --> 00:44:49,495
- He approached them first.
- Exactly.

922
00:44:51,295 --> 00:44:52,695
(Glancing)

923
00:44:54,965 --> 00:44:56,034
Have a look around.

924
00:44:56,035 --> 00:44:57,035
(He already feels at home.)

925
00:44:58,565 --> 00:45:02,405
(After greeting them briefly, Mu Jin goes to Bon Hee.)

926
00:45:02,605 --> 00:45:04,135
- Shall we check if there's water?
- Okay.

927
00:45:05,345 --> 00:45:06,745
I want something to drink too.

928
00:45:12,785 --> 00:45:16,055
(Mu Jin looks for a cup.)

929
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:18,955
Here's a cup.

930
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:20,755
I think you can just rinse it with water.

931
00:45:24,395 --> 00:45:26,165
(Here you go.)

932
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:30,635
(He checks Bon Hee's cup.)

933
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:34,605
(Glancing)

934
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,275
(Sighing)

935
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:44,815
(Picking up)

936
00:45:46,115 --> 00:45:47,414
What's that cup?

937
00:45:47,415 --> 00:45:49,185
I think we can use this too.

938
00:45:49,985 --> 00:45:51,984
Are you washing it for me?

939
00:45:51,985 --> 00:45:53,055
(Nodding)

940
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,895
(Smiling)

941
00:45:54,925 --> 00:45:58,364
(The cup she received from Sang Hyeon)

942
00:45:58,365 --> 00:45:59,794
(Surprised)

943
00:45:59,795 --> 00:46:00,824
She put it in there.

944
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:02,495
He might be subtly keeping Sang Hyeon in check.

945
00:46:02,665 --> 00:46:04,735
- My goodness.
- It's just the beginning.

946
00:46:05,465 --> 00:46:07,765
- Mind if I just wash it with water?
- Not at all.

947
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:12,645
Thank you.

948
00:46:18,885 --> 00:46:21,485
Oh, he saw that. He saw what happened.

949
00:46:22,785 --> 00:46:23,785
Oh, it worked.

950
00:46:30,725 --> 00:46:32,624
- Hello.
- Hello.

951
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:34,564
- Go on in.
- Hello.

952
00:46:34,565 --> 00:46:35,835
- Hello.
- Hello.

953
00:46:36,065 --> 00:46:38,095
- Hello.
- Hello.

954
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,265
I see you guys are here already.

955
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:46,845
- Hello.
- Hello.

956
00:46:50,145 --> 00:46:52,285
- It feels like we're late.
- Exactly.

957
00:46:54,115 --> 00:46:55,385
Can we just sit down?

958
00:46:56,655 --> 00:46:57,954
You can sit on the floor or on the sofa.

959
00:46:57,955 --> 00:47:00,485
Please sit anywhere you want. We did so.

960
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,155
It's nice.

961
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:06,895
(Mu Jin is the last to join them.)

962
00:47:07,665 --> 00:47:09,135
(Glancing)

963
00:47:12,505 --> 00:47:16,804
(He goes past Ji Won...)

964
00:47:16,805 --> 00:47:18,004
(and sits next to Bon Hee.)

965
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:19,005
Was that necessary?

966
00:47:20,075 --> 00:47:22,174
He went so far from everyone to sit next to her.

967
00:47:22,175 --> 00:47:23,175
(Satisfied)

968
00:47:24,145 --> 00:47:25,145
Yes.

969
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:29,655
She seems happy. Bon Hee must be happy.

970
00:47:30,115 --> 00:47:31,954
(Of course, she is.)

971
00:47:31,955 --> 00:47:33,225
May I ask your names, please?

972
00:47:33,755 --> 00:47:35,224
I'm Kim Mu Jin.

973
00:47:35,225 --> 00:47:37,954
- Mu Jin? Oh, I see.
- Yes, Kim Mu Jin.

974
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:40,095
That's why his keyword was "well-organized."

975
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,265
- Right?
- Yes.

976
00:47:43,565 --> 00:47:44,695
The one who wanted to have meat.

977
00:47:45,205 --> 00:47:46,565
- Yes, that's him.
- "Well-organized."

978
00:47:48,775 --> 00:47:50,605
I'm Ji Won.

979
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:53,545
- What's your full name?
- I'm Park Ji Won.

980
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:58,385
What is your name?

981
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:00,214
I'm Kim Sang Hyeon.

982
00:48:00,215 --> 00:48:01,485
- Sang Hyeon?
- Yes.

983
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:03,285
The puppy-like one.

984
00:48:04,355 --> 00:48:06,625
- Oh, "Golden Retriever?"
- Oh, you all know our keywords.

985
00:48:08,855 --> 00:48:10,295
I'm Park Sang Won.

986
00:48:12,395 --> 00:48:13,395
Sang Won...

987
00:48:14,765 --> 00:48:15,835
Park Sang Won...

988
00:48:16,565 --> 00:48:19,905
(Awkward)

989
00:48:21,305 --> 00:48:23,475
- We should let them in.
- Oh, hello.

990
00:48:24,675 --> 00:48:25,704
Hello.

991
00:48:25,705 --> 00:48:29,474
- Hello.
- Hello.

992
00:48:29,475 --> 00:48:30,475
- Hello.
- Hello.

993
00:48:32,645 --> 00:48:34,714
- Hello.
- Hello.

994
00:48:34,715 --> 00:48:36,315
- Hello.
- Hello.

995
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,855
- Let's all sit down for now.
- He was watching her.

996
00:48:43,895 --> 00:48:46,665
They finally met one another. They all gathered now.

997
00:48:49,465 --> 00:48:51,065
What were you doing?

998
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:53,965
- We were introducing ourselves.
- Just now.

999
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:57,275
Hello. I am Kim Hyeon Jun.

1000
00:48:57,475 --> 00:49:00,874
I am Kim Yeong Gyeong. It's nice to meet you all.

1001
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:02,575
It's nice to meet you.

1002
00:49:06,185 --> 00:49:09,255
(The older women and the younger men finally gathered.)

1003
00:49:09,755 --> 00:49:12,525
But they didn't seem to be much older than me.

1004
00:49:16,255 --> 00:49:19,565
I think they're only a few years older than me.

1005
00:49:22,895 --> 00:49:25,565
I didn't get that kind of feeling.

1006
00:49:26,305 --> 00:49:27,335
Like they were much older than me.

1007
00:49:29,435 --> 00:49:32,645
To me, they didn't seem to be a lot older than me.

1008
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:40,215
(The story of the older women and the younger men begins.)

1009
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:44,155
To me, the ladies don't seem any older...

1010
00:49:45,555 --> 00:49:47,255
than the early 30s.

1011
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,395
- They don't seem that old.
- I agree.

1012
00:49:50,595 --> 00:49:52,224
I can't even guess how old they are.

1013
00:49:52,225 --> 00:49:53,865
- You don't have any idea?
- No.

1014
00:49:54,795 --> 00:49:55,964
Let me remind you. Two of them...

1015
00:49:55,965 --> 00:49:57,235
- have a twelve-year age gap.
- I'm worried.

1016
00:49:57,665 --> 00:50:00,104
That will cause a huge stir.

1017
00:50:00,105 --> 00:50:01,705
- Right. I think it will.
- My point exactly.

1018
00:50:03,705 --> 00:50:05,874
There's a lot of stuff here. Can I sit here?

1019
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:06,945
Yes, of course.

1020
00:50:07,645 --> 00:50:09,145
I have no clue.

1021
00:50:10,015 --> 00:50:11,245
But I think...

1022
00:50:12,245 --> 00:50:15,085
that all the guys have a job.

1023
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,354
(Laughing)

1024
00:50:17,355 --> 00:50:19,455
Being younger than you doesn't mean they have no job.

1025
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:22,194
(As an older woman, she was worried about it.)

1026
00:50:22,195 --> 00:50:24,554
They all seem very young.

1027
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:25,565
Right.

1028
00:50:25,925 --> 00:50:28,295
They must be in their late 20s..

1029
00:50:29,265 --> 00:50:30,735
or early 30s.

1030
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:35,035
You know...

1031
00:50:36,735 --> 00:50:37,874
They all seem to be around the same age as me.

1032
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:41,674
I heard they were older than us,

1033
00:50:41,675 --> 00:50:44,245
but they don't feel so much older than me.

1034
00:50:45,015 --> 00:50:47,945
Right. Don't I look even older than them?

1035
00:50:49,085 --> 00:50:50,815
Perhaps, you're the youngest of all.

1036
00:50:53,655 --> 00:50:55,054
- Oh, gosh.
- That's possible.

1037
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:57,655
I don't want a man who's 188cm tall to address me like a big brother.

1038
00:50:58,965 --> 00:50:59,995
That's possible.

1039
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:03,164
Clearly, both the men and the women...

1040
00:51:03,165 --> 00:51:05,235
are very sensitive about the age.

1041
00:51:05,635 --> 00:51:10,105
The guys seem rather excited about what could happen.

1042
00:51:10,305 --> 00:51:12,374
But the ladies seem more worried than excited.

1043
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:13,545
- Right.
- Yes, I think so too.

1044
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:16,075
Shall we start preparing food?

1045
00:51:17,845 --> 00:51:21,445
(Sang Hyeon and Sang Won are preparing a move-in party.)

1046
00:51:22,155 --> 00:51:24,285
When this show airs,

1047
00:51:26,085 --> 00:51:27,385
my parents will probably scold me.

1048
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,194
"You never do any house chores."

1049
00:51:29,195 --> 00:51:31,524
I was thinking the same thing. "Why wouldn't you do it at home?"

1050
00:51:31,525 --> 00:51:34,325
Exactly. They'll say I'm doing house chores actively...

1051
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:36,465
to impress the girls.

1052
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:39,834
You can tell they're on the younger side...

1053
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:41,364
by the conversation they're having.

1054
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:43,574
They're worried if they might upset their parents.

1055
00:51:43,575 --> 00:51:46,374
(Sang Hyeon and Sang Won prepared...)

1056
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:49,675
(the Yeon House move-in party.)

1057
00:51:51,715 --> 00:51:54,645
- Come down to the first floor.
- Okay.

1058
00:51:55,615 --> 00:51:57,214
Shall we bring 1 bottle of red wine and 1 bottle of white wine?

1059
00:51:57,215 --> 00:51:58,215
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

1060
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,484
- Hello.
- Hello.

1061
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:01,684
(The older women and the younger men will be together...)

1062
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:02,925
Thank you.

1063
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:05,524
(on their first night at Yeon House.)

1064
00:52:05,525 --> 00:52:08,735
Maybe we can open it without a wine opener.

1065
00:52:09,395 --> 00:52:10,894
I was right. We don't need an opener.

1066
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:13,205
I think we need one for this bottle. Or not?

1067
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:20,075
Some of them could be flustered in that situation.

1068
00:52:21,475 --> 00:52:23,074
The ladies are watching him.

1069
00:52:23,075 --> 00:52:24,944
- Oh, no.
- All eyes are on him.

1070
00:52:24,945 --> 00:52:26,185
"All right. Let's see how you do it."

1071
00:52:26,415 --> 00:52:27,485
Eight eyes are watching him.

1072
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,085
(Pressured)

1073
00:52:30,415 --> 00:52:32,385
You can start without me.

1074
00:52:32,925 --> 00:52:34,025
I'll take my time and open it.

1075
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:37,824
(Sang Won is struggling to open the wine bottle.)

1076
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:38,865
- Goodness.
- Oh, boy.

1077
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:42,095
(Pulling it upward)

1078
00:52:42,195 --> 00:52:44,195
(Flustered)

1079
00:52:44,965 --> 00:52:46,335
(Pulling it upward)

1080
00:52:46,765 --> 00:52:48,265
(The wine cork is broken.)

1081
00:52:48,775 --> 00:52:50,005
Did he open it the wrong way?

1082
00:52:50,705 --> 00:52:51,705
Oh, no.

1083
00:52:52,075 --> 00:52:53,375
He's cute.

1084
00:52:53,475 --> 00:52:55,975
He made the cork disappear instead of the day.

1085
00:52:56,075 --> 00:52:57,814
I can relate to that...

1086
00:52:57,815 --> 00:53:00,285
because I've never opened a wine bottle before.

1087
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:02,714
Men around my age...

1088
00:53:02,715 --> 00:53:04,914
rarely choose wine when we have a drink.

1089
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,784
- I see.
- Right. That makes sense.

1090
00:53:06,785 --> 00:53:07,785
(Oh, that makes sense.)

1091
00:53:13,965 --> 00:53:15,794
- We have an emergency.
- Oh, my gosh.

1092
00:53:15,795 --> 00:53:17,795
- It broke inside the bottle.
- Really?

1093
00:53:19,105 --> 00:53:21,635
This is bad. We might not be able to drink this.

1094
00:53:22,975 --> 00:53:24,575
You should rotate it more.

1095
00:53:25,275 --> 00:53:26,974
(Ji Won helps Sang Won, who's flustered.)

1096
00:53:26,975 --> 00:53:27,975
All the way down.

1097
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:30,575
It's supposed to come out. Why won't it work?

1098
00:53:33,245 --> 00:53:34,585
- Shall I bring another one?
- I'll bring another bottle.

1099
00:53:35,015 --> 00:53:36,155
Let's drink something else.

1100
00:53:37,385 --> 00:53:39,685
- Anything?
- Anything would do. Thank you.

1101
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:43,225
(He came to the kitchen to get a new bottle of wine.)

1102
00:53:43,895 --> 00:53:44,955
I feel bad.

1103
00:53:46,395 --> 00:53:48,464
- It's okay. That happens.
- It happens.

1104
00:53:48,465 --> 00:53:49,535
It's not a big deal.

1105
00:53:49,965 --> 00:53:51,035
It's okay.

1106
00:53:52,235 --> 00:53:54,134
Hang on. Please don't comfort me.

1107
00:53:54,135 --> 00:53:56,935
I feel like I caused big trouble. I wasn't feeling that way.

1108
00:53:59,475 --> 00:54:00,845
Would any of these do?

1109
00:54:02,415 --> 00:54:04,115
Let's drink this one.

1110
00:54:04,215 --> 00:54:07,045
This is a sweet, fruity type.

1111
00:54:08,585 --> 00:54:10,455
- A fruity type?
- Yes.

1112
00:54:10,555 --> 00:54:11,784
I don't know what it is.

1113
00:54:11,785 --> 00:54:12,955
I don't know either.

1114
00:54:13,055 --> 00:54:15,324
- It says "sweet."
- "Sweet?"

1115
00:54:15,325 --> 00:54:16,325
"Sweet."

1116
00:54:16,326 --> 00:54:18,865
(When you don't know, choose something sweet.)

1117
00:54:19,795 --> 00:54:22,034
Thank you for bringing the wine. Shall we drink it?

1118
00:54:22,035 --> 00:54:23,035
Yes, let's drink it.

1119
00:54:23,065 --> 00:54:25,505
- It's good to meet you all.
- It's good to meet you all.

1120
00:54:26,765 --> 00:54:32,375
(They start their first evening at Yeon House with wine.)

1121
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:35,075
(Impressed)

1122
00:54:35,245 --> 00:54:37,044
(The older women enjoy the wine.)

1123
00:54:37,045 --> 00:54:38,045
(Exclaiming)

1124
00:54:38,685 --> 00:54:40,685
(Nodding)

1125
00:54:40,985 --> 00:54:43,615
(Meanwhile, the younger men...)

1126
00:54:47,455 --> 00:54:49,595
(Frowning)

1127
00:54:52,695 --> 00:54:53,824
(Looking around nervously)

1128
00:54:53,825 --> 00:54:55,695
The guys don't seem to like it.

1129
00:54:56,935 --> 00:54:57,965
He seems confused.

1130
00:55:00,265 --> 00:55:03,475
(Coughing)

1131
00:55:05,675 --> 00:55:06,705
"Well-organized!"

1132
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:08,675
You should drink it in a well-organized manner.

1133
00:55:10,145 --> 00:55:11,945
(Gazing)

1134
00:55:12,445 --> 00:55:14,514
Like I said, things like that make him cute.

1135
00:55:14,515 --> 00:55:16,355
The ladies look at him like they find him cute.

1136
00:55:17,215 --> 00:55:19,925
(He has a piece of apple to get rid of the aftertaste.)

1137
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:21,585
- Isn't the wine good?
- This wine is refreshing.

1138
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,325
- Yes, it's better than I expected.
- Right.

1139
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:27,294
- He's cute. Yes.
- He's so cute. Isn't he cute?

1140
00:55:27,295 --> 00:55:30,665
(With a fresh mindset, he has another sip.)

1141
00:55:35,575 --> 00:55:36,704
"Why would anyone drink this?"

1142
00:55:36,705 --> 00:55:38,604
He drank wine and reacted as if it were soju.

1143
00:55:38,605 --> 00:55:40,574
Tell us honestly. I understand that he looks cute,

1144
00:55:40,575 --> 00:55:41,975
but isn't it a little frustrating to watch him like that?

1145
00:55:42,175 --> 00:55:43,644
Exactly. That's what I was curious about.

1146
00:55:43,645 --> 00:55:45,644
- But he's Mu Jin.
- Gosh, seriously.

1147
00:55:45,645 --> 00:55:46,714
He's Mr. Yes.

1148
00:55:46,715 --> 00:55:47,785
He's invincible.

1149
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,315
How much alcohol can you drink at once?

1150
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,755
I can drink up to half a bottle of soju.

1151
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,095
It's true.

1152
00:55:57,655 --> 00:56:01,624
I can drink one glass of soju-beer cocktail.

1153
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:02,864
- One glass?
- One glass?

1154
00:56:02,865 --> 00:56:04,095
Yes. One glass.

1155
00:56:04,795 --> 00:56:06,405
- You're unbelievable.
- My goodness.

1156
00:56:07,005 --> 00:56:08,305
Yes. About that much.

1157
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:10,335
You probably shouldn't be drinking then.

1158
00:56:10,805 --> 00:56:13,405
Right. My face is starting to burn.

1159
00:56:17,915 --> 00:56:19,615
My face is burning a little.

1160
00:56:20,215 --> 00:56:21,344
Yes.

1161
00:56:21,345 --> 00:56:22,815
The girls are surprised.

1162
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:27,785
But I drink soju quite well.

1163
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:30,194
I can handle 2 to 2 and a half bottles of soju.

1164
00:56:30,195 --> 00:56:31,225
You can drink.

1165
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:34,165
I can drink about 1 and a half to 2 bottles.

1166
00:56:34,665 --> 00:56:37,164
But I am not a big fan of soju,

1167
00:56:37,165 --> 00:56:39,735
so I rarely drink soju.

1168
00:56:40,435 --> 00:56:42,704
- What do you like to drink then?
- Which liquor then?

1169
00:56:42,705 --> 00:56:43,905
I like whiskey.

1170
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:45,945
You must drink really well, I mean you must love to drink.

1171
00:56:46,245 --> 00:56:47,604
(Thinking)

1172
00:56:47,605 --> 00:56:49,445
It tastes like wood, though.

1173
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:52,314
- Whiskey is expensive.
- But you can't drink.

1174
00:56:52,315 --> 00:56:53,585
Do you like it?

1175
00:56:55,855 --> 00:56:57,414
- She adores him.
- He's adorable.

1176
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:58,484
- He's adorable.
- She adores him, whatever he says.

1177
00:56:58,485 --> 00:56:59,685
He says whiskey tastes like wood.

1178
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:02,355
It tastes like wood, though.

1179
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,295
It tastes like wood?

1180
00:57:08,835 --> 00:57:10,994
He's the serious type.

1181
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:12,035
I know.

1182
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:15,975
Their eyes locked.

1183
00:57:16,105 --> 00:57:19,705
(Bon Hee and Sang Hyeon lock eyes with each other.)

1184
00:57:20,245 --> 00:57:22,175
She's staring right at me.

1185
00:57:23,115 --> 00:57:25,174
I guess I am sitting directly across you.

1186
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:26,945
I was trying hard not to lock eyes with you.

1187
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:30,254
(Looking)

1188
00:57:30,255 --> 00:57:31,285
I...

1189
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:33,325
Sang Hyeon is cute.

1190
00:57:33,785 --> 00:57:39,095
(Mu Jin was quietly watching.)

1191
00:57:39,395 --> 00:57:40,595
That can't be helped.

1192
00:57:40,995 --> 00:57:42,364
You got something here.

1193
00:57:42,365 --> 00:57:44,465
- Can I get it for you?
- What is it?

1194
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,664
You got something here.

1195
00:57:46,665 --> 00:57:48,705
- Can I get it for you?
- What is it?

1196
00:57:53,905 --> 00:57:54,905
- What is it?
- Dust.

1197
00:57:54,906 --> 00:57:55,975
- Dust.
- Dust?

1198
00:57:57,445 --> 00:57:58,475
I see.

1199
00:58:00,815 --> 00:58:01,914
I couldn't stop looking at it.

1200
00:58:01,915 --> 00:58:06,055
(I couldn't stop looking at it.)

1201
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,255
That's like, "I can't stop looking at you."

1202
00:58:11,595 --> 00:58:13,664
Bon Hee's attention is now on Mu Jin.

1203
00:58:13,665 --> 00:58:16,095
It's the first day, and he'd say something like that?

1204
00:58:16,295 --> 00:58:18,135
What's wrong with that?

1205
00:58:18,665 --> 00:58:19,734
(Infinitely amazed)

1206
00:58:19,735 --> 00:58:21,234
- "I couldn't stop looking at it?"
- That's lovely.

1207
00:58:21,235 --> 00:58:22,275
(He's the fearless younger man.)

1208
00:58:22,935 --> 00:58:25,035
- Stop it.
- I can't help it.

1209
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:26,974
You got something here.

1210
00:58:26,975 --> 00:58:29,015
- Can I get it for you?
- What is it?

1211
00:58:29,175 --> 00:58:30,275
- Dust.
- Dust?

1212
00:58:31,245 --> 00:58:32,345
I see.

1213
00:58:35,085 --> 00:58:36,214
I couldn't stop looking at it.

1214
00:58:36,215 --> 00:58:40,285
(I couldn't stop looking at it.)

1215
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:49,495
I heard you had to pick...

1216
00:58:49,995 --> 00:58:52,965
a keyword in the beginning.

1217
00:58:53,065 --> 00:58:54,805
Among the keywords...

1218
00:58:55,405 --> 00:58:56,675
What was it at the bottom?

1219
00:58:57,005 --> 00:58:58,275
- "Well-organized?"
- Yes.

1220
00:58:58,475 --> 00:59:02,375
He looked hard-working and responsible.

1221
00:59:02,645 --> 00:59:04,415
That's why I picked it.

1222
00:59:07,315 --> 00:59:08,915
She let me have it.

1223
00:59:09,555 --> 00:59:11,284
- Did she?
- So he could've had...

1224
00:59:11,285 --> 00:59:13,155
the first date with Ji Won.

1225
00:59:13,725 --> 00:59:15,054
What was your keyword?

1226
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:16,555
- What?
- What was it?

1227
00:59:16,725 --> 00:59:18,825
It was "the day flies by."

1228
00:59:19,395 --> 00:59:21,525
- But he didn't make it happen.
- It's midnight now.

1229
00:59:22,395 --> 00:59:23,465
The day flew by.

1230
00:59:24,065 --> 00:59:25,265
Shall we drink?

1231
00:59:31,275 --> 00:59:32,744
Should we go back to what we were discussing?

1232
00:59:32,745 --> 00:59:36,044
For the gents, it would be older women.

1233
00:59:36,045 --> 00:59:37,515
For the ladies, it would be younger men.

1234
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:40,645
Do you have an experience of dating one?

1235
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:44,815
I've dated older and younger women.

1236
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:47,684
But the two I dated for the longest period were older.

1237
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:49,195
And we had a stable relationship.

1238
00:59:49,955 --> 00:59:53,495
It made me think I am a good match with an older woman.

1239
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:56,595
I mostly dated...

1240
00:59:57,495 --> 01:00:00,135
men younger than me.

1241
01:00:00,505 --> 01:00:04,035
So I don't have any prejudices against younger men.

1242
01:00:08,945 --> 01:00:09,945
(Turning)

1243
01:00:09,946 --> 01:00:10,975
Mu Jin?

1244
01:00:13,045 --> 01:00:15,655
I don't really care about age.

1245
01:00:17,055 --> 01:00:20,825
But I got along better with older women.

1246
01:00:23,155 --> 01:00:25,555
I don't care too much about the age though.

1247
01:00:28,365 --> 01:00:30,665
But I think older women were a better fit for me.

1248
01:00:31,535 --> 01:00:33,365
Why were they a better fit?

1249
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:36,734
I don't know. The ones I got along well with...

1250
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,805
just happened to be older than me.

1251
01:00:39,075 --> 01:00:40,175
I see.

1252
01:00:42,945 --> 01:00:43,975
I...

1253
01:00:45,745 --> 01:00:47,214
mostly dated older men.

1254
01:00:47,215 --> 01:00:49,015
I've dated a younger man once.

1255
01:00:50,515 --> 01:00:52,555
(Nodding)

1256
01:00:54,225 --> 01:00:55,625
But as I got...

1257
01:00:56,995 --> 01:00:58,255
older,

1258
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:01,795
the level of maturity mattered more. It matters more now.

1259
01:01:03,235 --> 01:01:04,635
Yes. That's me.

1260
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:09,534
I think I'm similar.

1261
01:01:09,535 --> 01:01:13,305
I've only experienced it once.

1262
01:01:13,445 --> 01:01:16,575
But age isn't a huge factor.

1263
01:01:17,815 --> 01:01:19,344
Having good conversations...

1264
01:01:19,345 --> 01:01:20,945
and sharing the same core values...

1265
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:24,155
Those are more important to me.

1266
01:01:26,925 --> 01:01:30,425
The person I most recently dated was younger than me.

1267
01:01:30,795 --> 01:01:33,895
Even if I didn't end up in a relationship with all,

1268
01:01:34,295 --> 01:01:36,265
most of the people I've dated...

1269
01:01:36,765 --> 01:01:40,565
were younger than me.

1270
01:01:41,005 --> 01:01:42,235
It just happened naturally.

1271
01:01:42,935 --> 01:01:46,245
I've mostly dated someone younger or someone of my age.

1272
01:01:48,575 --> 01:01:49,645
Yes.

1273
01:01:50,315 --> 01:01:51,375
Well.

1274
01:01:53,885 --> 01:01:56,615
For me, this is a challenge.

1275
01:01:59,785 --> 01:02:00,885
It's not ideal...

1276
01:02:02,725 --> 01:02:03,894
to lie, so...

1277
01:02:03,895 --> 01:02:06,825
This is a challenge for me.

1278
01:02:07,495 --> 01:02:10,495
He hasn't dated many older women.

1279
01:02:10,765 --> 01:02:11,995
I guess so.

1280
01:02:12,235 --> 01:02:15,335
I guess that's why he was that anxious.

1281
01:02:15,405 --> 01:02:19,445
Sang Hyeon is different from the other participants.

1282
01:02:19,675 --> 01:02:22,815
His focus is not on who he likes at this point.

1283
01:02:23,175 --> 01:02:25,445
But it is on whether he will be able to have chemistry...

1284
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:26,685
with an older woman.

1285
01:02:26,845 --> 01:02:28,785
He might be confused.

1286
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,684
He said it was a challenge.

1287
01:02:31,685 --> 01:02:33,454
I think he might get very confused...

1288
01:02:33,455 --> 01:02:36,324
when their age gets revealed.

1289
01:02:36,325 --> 01:02:37,595
Is he that young?

1290
01:02:40,095 --> 01:02:42,165
- We got texts.
- Did we?

1291
01:02:44,695 --> 01:02:47,805
(They receive texts.)

1292
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:49,605
I didn't get a text.

1293
01:02:50,835 --> 01:02:52,175
I think only the ladies got one.

1294
01:02:55,945 --> 01:02:57,844
In 15 minutes, send a love message...

1295
01:02:57,845 --> 01:02:59,914
to the person you are interested in.

1296
01:02:59,915 --> 01:03:00,985
Love QR code?

1297
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:02,484
You can send anything to it.

1298
01:03:02,485 --> 01:03:05,054
It could be a message, an audio file, a photo, a video.

1299
01:03:05,055 --> 01:03:06,685
(But make it anonymous.)

1300
01:03:08,725 --> 01:03:12,025
(It's the day the men get to read the ladies' minds.)

1301
01:03:12,695 --> 01:03:14,364
(Who is...)

1302
01:03:14,365 --> 01:03:17,365
(in the ladies' hearts tonight?)

1303
01:03:17,495 --> 01:03:18,534
I got it.

1304
01:03:18,535 --> 01:03:20,264
No, let's leave it like this for now.

1305
01:03:20,265 --> 01:03:21,505
(After the party, the younger men are cleaning up.)

1306
01:03:22,835 --> 01:03:24,475
(Looking around)

1307
01:03:25,975 --> 01:03:28,545
(Ji Won hurriedly heads to the stairs.)

1308
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:31,375
(Running up)

1309
01:03:33,945 --> 01:03:35,315
How do I do this?

1310
01:03:36,785 --> 01:03:37,815
She's thinking.

1311
01:03:38,085 --> 01:03:40,685
(Bon Hee heads to the stairs too.)

1312
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:44,455
That's not easy. What will they send to the QR code?

1313
01:03:44,755 --> 01:03:46,065
(Spotting Ji Won)

1314
01:03:47,265 --> 01:03:49,565
(She retreats.)

1315
01:03:49,965 --> 01:03:51,335
(Spotting Bon Hee)

1316
01:03:54,065 --> 01:03:58,875
(She gets even further away.)

1317
01:03:59,705 --> 01:04:00,705
(Sighing)

1318
01:04:00,706 --> 01:04:02,245
Make up your mind.

1319
01:04:04,175 --> 01:04:06,445
- Time to use my head, is it?
- Do you have one?

1320
01:04:07,085 --> 01:04:08,685
Is there someone you're interested in?

1321
01:04:09,755 --> 01:04:11,315
(Curious)

1322
01:04:12,055 --> 01:04:13,254
(Sassy)

1323
01:04:13,255 --> 01:04:14,285
It's a secret.

1324
01:04:17,825 --> 01:04:19,824
Could it be not the one...

1325
01:04:19,825 --> 01:04:22,395
they went to pick up?

1326
01:04:22,865 --> 01:04:25,234
I think a lot of them have changed their minds.

1327
01:04:25,235 --> 01:04:26,405
- You think so?
- I do.

1328
01:04:29,575 --> 01:04:31,605
Are you the love-at-first-sight type of a person?

1329
01:04:32,305 --> 01:04:33,975
I am the love-at-first-sight type of a person.

1330
01:04:34,475 --> 01:04:36,844
Most men fall for the looks first...

1331
01:04:36,845 --> 01:04:39,045
- and then slowly get to know her.
- Right.

1332
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:41,285
Is any of them your type?

1333
01:04:42,855 --> 01:04:45,214
- Among them?
- I won't ask who it is.

1334
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,654
There is one.

1335
01:04:46,655 --> 01:04:48,155
(There is one.)

1336
01:04:48,355 --> 01:04:49,455
Is any of them your type?

1337
01:04:50,155 --> 01:04:53,825
Considering the first impression, there is someone who's my type.

1338
01:04:56,365 --> 01:04:58,294
(Who are the ladies...)

1339
01:04:58,295 --> 01:05:01,965
(that entered Sang Hyeon and Hyeon Jun's hearts?)

1340
01:05:06,705 --> 01:05:07,974
(The messages have been sent. Go to the Love QR Zone...)

1341
01:05:07,975 --> 01:05:09,274
(and check the ladies' hearts.)

1342
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:10,315
It's here.

1343
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:18,184
(Love QR Zone is...)

1344
01:05:18,185 --> 01:05:20,555
(where they get to check each other's feelings.)

1345
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:24,554
(It's a place where you can check the feelings...)

1346
01:05:24,555 --> 01:05:27,895
(that were passed on through the QR code.)

1347
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,235
(Hyeon Jun)

1348
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:35,934
(When you scan your QR code,)

1349
01:05:35,935 --> 01:05:39,874
(you can check the feelings of the person...)

1350
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:42,305
(who sent a message to you.)

1351
01:05:44,215 --> 01:05:47,244
(On the first day of Yeon House,)

1352
01:05:47,245 --> 01:05:51,084
(what kind of messages will the men receive?)

1353
01:05:51,445 --> 01:05:53,614
We have the Love QR Codes here too.

1354
01:05:53,615 --> 01:05:54,645
What?

1355
01:05:55,645 --> 01:05:59,015
(They can check the result through the QR codes here too.)

1356
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:00,585
Who are you most curious about?

1357
01:06:00,785 --> 01:06:02,524
- Yes Mu Jin.
- Mu Jin?

1358
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:03,895
Should I go check Mu Jin's?

1359
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:05,195
- I'd love that.
- I'd love that too.

1360
01:06:07,565 --> 01:06:09,695
We are checking for the messages he received, right?

1361
01:06:10,235 --> 01:06:11,235
It's coming up.

1362
01:06:11,735 --> 01:06:12,964
It really works!

1363
01:06:12,965 --> 01:06:13,965
(They are the Love QR Codes of the participants!)

1364
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:16,935
How many did he get?

1365
01:06:17,235 --> 01:06:18,934
(I won't tell you.)

1366
01:06:18,935 --> 01:06:20,945
I think Mu Jin would be popular.

1367
01:06:21,105 --> 01:06:22,144
(Yes?)

1368
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,875
I think Golden Retriever would be popular.

1369
01:06:25,015 --> 01:06:27,484
Come on. Show us. We need to see it too.

1370
01:06:27,485 --> 01:06:28,485
Show us.

1371
01:06:31,915 --> 01:06:36,555
(Mu Jin is the first to come to the Love QR Zone.)

1372
01:06:40,825 --> 01:06:43,195
(Sighing)

1373
01:06:45,795 --> 01:06:48,105
(Nervous)

1374
01:06:49,665 --> 01:06:52,905
(The Love QR Code is placed in front of Mu Jin.)

1375
01:06:55,775 --> 01:07:01,784
(Did Mu Jin receive any love messages?)

1376
01:07:01,785 --> 01:07:06,385
(It will be continued shortly.)

1377
01:07:08,885 --> 01:07:21,540
(What kind of messages would his Love QR Code contain?)

1378
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,809
(Two people have sent messages to your Love QR Code.)

1379
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:27,810
- Two people.
- Two people. Goodness.

1380
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:35,990
(Puzzled)

1381
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:43,329
(What's the first message from the Love QR Code?)

1382
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:44,360
It's a video.

1383
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:47,269
(First Love QR message)

1384
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:50,569
(First Love QR message is a video of the living room sofa.)

1385
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:51,640
Who could it be?

1386
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:56,480
(Tilting his head)

1387
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:01,480
(How about the second Love QR message?)

1388
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,589
(A photo of a green object?)

1389
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:10,720
- What is that?
- What is that?

1390
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:14,260
(Smiling)

1391
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:18,130
I think I know one person clearly.

1392
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:21,770
But I am not entirely sure who the other person is.

1393
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,740
Could it be Ye Eun?

1394
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:30,040
When we were drinking wine,

1395
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,120
she was the one who could see me from that angle.

1396
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,390
I would be shocked if it turned out to be Ye Eun.

1397
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:41,120
I guess their eyes locked many times.

1398
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:42,719
I didn't see that coming though.

1399
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,720
(An unexpected result sends them into confusion.)

1400
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:48,900
(Anxious)

1401
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:54,329
(Sang Hyeon is the second person to check the Love QR Code.)

1402
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:56,870
(Taking a deep breath)

1403
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,340
I'm scared.

1404
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:10,219
(He takes a deep breath...)

1405
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:13,220
(and checks his Love QR Code.)

1406
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,560
(Did anyone send a message to Sang Hyeon's Love QR Code?)

1407
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:30,200
(One person has sent a message to your Love QR Code.)

1408
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:38,680
(He received an image of a cat.)

1409
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:43,850
(Will Sang Hyeon recognize the cat image?)

1410
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:48,960
I really don't know. I'm puzzled.

1411
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:52,729
(He couldn't figure out who the message was from.)

1412
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,830
Wait.

1413
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,160
What? That can't happen.

1414
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,199
That's not it. I think he had been so nervous...

1415
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,799
that he forgot everything.

1416
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,539
He must've forgotten everything they talked about during the date.

1417
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:06,510
It's clear that Ye Eun sent the message to Sang Hyeon.

1418
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:09,979
They talked about dogs and cats so much.

1419
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:12,009
- Right.
- We figured it out right away.

1420
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:14,909
- Yes.
- But he can't figure it out.

1421
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,350
- That's surprising, isn't it?
- It's surprising.

1422
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:17,819
How can he not know it?

1423
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:18,850
(Frustrated)

1424
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:20,989
(With the mystery unsolved,)

1425
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:25,590
(With the mystery unsolved, Sang Hyeon leaves the zone.)

1426
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:32,630
(Sang Won enters the Love QR Zone.)

1427
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:48,179
(For the first time, see who has feelings for you...)

1428
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:51,380
(through the Love QR Code.)

1429
01:10:53,290 --> 01:11:00,190
(What kind of messages would Sang Won have received?)

1430
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:03,830
What?

1431
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,170
Who is it?

1432
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:09,400
(Looks around)

1433
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:10,740
(Tilts his head)

1434
01:11:10,741 --> 01:11:12,110
(Chuckles)

1435
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:18,780
(What message did Sang Won receive through the Love QR Code?)

1436
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:20,680
Two people?

1437
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:28,250
(You have no message on your Love QR Code.)

1438
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:32,390
(Poor Sang Won.)

1439
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,960
What do we do?

1440
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:40,100
(Tilts his head)

1441
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:45,810
(Finding it hard to believe, he checks it once again.)

1442
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,209
(The result is the same.)

1443
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:53,550
He keeps refreshing the page, but he still doesn't have any.

1444
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,420
Oh, dear.

1445
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:59,390
(Trembles)

1446
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:08,529
(What does this chuckle mean?)

1447
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:10,000
I was frustrated.

1448
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,899
I knew it could happen.

1449
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,540
And I told myself that I shouldn't get disappointed.

1450
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:18,299
But when it actually happened,

1451
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,840
it hit me quite hard.

1452
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:29,420
(After checking the Love QR Code, Sang Won became puzzled.)

1453
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:37,920
It made me think I should approach them more seriously now.

1454
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:41,429
- Oh, dear. He's adorable.
- Goodness.

1455
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:42,700
He looks like he lost the world.

1456
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:46,170
- He looks like he's in shock.
- He's shocked.

1457
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:49,039
- He's very good-looking.
- Yes.

1458
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,870
He's never experienced something like this, so he is flustered.

1459
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,670
This is what seemed to have gone through his mind.

1460
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,439
"Did this just happen to me?"

1461
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,910
- That's how it felt.
- Right.

1462
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:03,780
(The last one to check the Love QR Code is Hyeon Jun.)

1463
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,189
(He checks the message on his Love QR Code...)

1464
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:10,720
(for the first time.)

1465
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:16,599
(One person has sent a message to your Love QR Code.)

1466
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,100
(One person has sent a message to your Love QR Code.)

1467
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,500
I wonder what he received.

1468
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,269
(Hyeon Jun received one photo.)

1469
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:29,909
What's that? It's pasta and a wine opener.

1470
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:30,910
What?

1471
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:33,009
Is it their height difference?

1472
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:34,909
- No.
- No?

1473
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,780
- Their height difference?
- Why pasta and a wine opener then?

1474
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:39,420
It's difficult.

1475
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:44,890
(Does Hyeon Jun know who the Love QR message is from?)

1476
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:49,960
I have no clue about who sent the message.

1477
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:53,600
I have no idea. I have no clue.

1478
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:58,870
What's your favorite food?

1479
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:00,609
I like pasta.

1480
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:03,180
- You like pasta.
- I love pasta.

1481
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,709
I like pasta too.

1482
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:06,880
You like pasta?

1483
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:08,580
- Pasta.
- They had that conversation.

1484
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:13,519
I thought perhaps he might remember the things...

1485
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,320
we talked about earlier.

1486
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,859
Oh, dear. They talked about it.

1487
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:20,429
She looked for it and took a picture of it.

1488
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:21,689
She did.

1489
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:24,300
(Yeong Gyeong sent a photo of Hyeon Jun's favorite, pasta.)

1490
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,129
He should've known.

1491
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:27,970
Poor Yeong Gyeong.

1492
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:34,040
(Ye Eun sent an image of a cat to Sang Hyeon.)

1493
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:38,950
I am cat-like.

1494
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:40,150
Right.

1495
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:41,910
Do you like someone who looks like a cat?

1496
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,480
Yes. I like someone who is cat-like.

1497
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:51,220
(The cat-like Ye Eun expressed herself with the cat image.)

1498
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,089
- They had a long conversation too.
- I know.

1499
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:55,630
Things aren't going to be easy for this couple.

1500
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:59,799
(The Love QR message Bon Hee sent...)

1501
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,470
(is a framed picture.)

1502
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:05,940
What color do you like?

1503
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:10,240
Well, green, I think? Kind of like a dark green.

1504
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:11,839
Oh, a dark green.

1505
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,350
(She didn't forget that Mu Jin likes dark green.)

1506
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:16,419
Honestly, it's not easy to remember stuff like that.

1507
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:17,480
- Right.
- Yes.

1508
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:22,660
It means that the guy keeps lingering in her mind.

1509
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:26,629
(And Ji Won also...)

1510
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:28,229
(chooses Mu Jin.)

1511
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:30,730
I chose Mu Jin.

1512
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:35,800
He sat next to me when I was sitting in the first-floor living room.

1513
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:39,810
His gaze was so soft.

1514
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:41,810
I want to try talking to him.

1515
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,880
(They finish checking the Love QR Codes amid confusion.)

1516
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,949
I can't even imagine...

1517
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:51,879
- what we'll do from tomorrow.
- Are they roommates, perhaps?

1518
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,390
Going on dates for seven days?

1519
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:56,820
- I haven't been on many dates.
- I can't even imagine.

1520
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:58,290
Really?

1521
01:15:58,291 --> 01:15:59,830
- Are they?
- They happen to be roommates too.

1522
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:04,260
Was there someone who caught your attention?

1523
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,029
(Nodding)

1524
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:09,340
- Really?
- Just someone I met today...

1525
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,269
- Me too.
- Was there someone?

1526
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:16,679
There was someone I wanted to talk to a bit more.

1527
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:17,740
That's good.

1528
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:21,279
- Tomorrow...
- That's much better than...

1529
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,820
not being curious about anyone.

1530
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,290
Gosh, it will be awkward if they're roommates.

1531
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:31,060
They turned out to be roommates.

1532
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:34,589
- Do you know what will happen?
- What will happen?

1533
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,830
It becomes so interesting.

1534
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:38,000
- From the viewer's perspective?
- Yes.

1535
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:45,270
(Late at night, Mu Jin gets a text message.)

1536
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:47,169
(Kim Mu Jin, you've received 2 Love QR Codes. You get a Love Benefit.)

1537
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:48,269
A benefit.

1538
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,680
(Kim Mu Jin, you've received 2 Love QR Codes. You get a Love Benefit.)

1539
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:51,439
(Check the info of someone you want to know about in the Secret Room.)

1540
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,680
- The room that was locked earlier.
- The Secret Room?

1541
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:57,019
Didn't they say they'll get hints that help you guess someone's age?

1542
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,290
(Mu Jin gets the key to the Secret Room tonight.)

1543
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:18,300
(Mu Jin is the first to check the Secret Room.)

1544
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:31,219
(Open the drawer and guess the age of the person you're curious about.)

1545
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,750
(The information you learn must remain secret.)

1546
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:34,920
And you have to keep it to yourself?

1547
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:39,329
Will knowing the age of someone you're interested in...

1548
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:41,330
be a good thing or a bad thing?

1549
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,400
You actually don't know about that.

1550
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:52,200
(Who is Mu Jin's heart heading towards?)

1551
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,479
- Is that how it ends?
- What? Right here?

1552
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,479
(Is this the end?)

1553
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,180
Gosh, dating shows are always like this.

1554
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,420
I know because I've experienced this a lot.

1555
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:08,620
Yes.

1556
01:18:08,621 --> 01:18:10,020
(Meanwhile, in Hyeon Jun and Sang Hyeon's room)

1557
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:13,630
Hyeon Jun, you're also not good at actively approaching someone, right?

1558
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:16,130
I'm not good at it if there are lots of people.

1559
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:17,860
I see.

1560
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,300
But when it's just me and her, I think I'm better at it.

1561
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,570
But are you confident that you can get someone alone with you?

1562
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,140
No.

1563
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:32,710
I just felt like you and I have similar personalities.

1564
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:35,010
Kind of introverted...

1565
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:37,650
So, you're an INFP. I'm an INFJ.

1566
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:41,520
- Just the J and P are different.
- I know.

1567
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:46,490
I hope there isn't any competition.

1568
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:49,360
That's too grand a dream, right?

1569
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:54,599
- Suddenly doing push-ups?
- Suddenly?

1570
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,600
(Suddenly doing push-ups?)

1571
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,739
How much competition is he going to get into?

1572
01:18:57,740 --> 01:19:00,810
(Is he doing strength training for tomorrow's competition?)

1573
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:04,009
Oh, man.

1574
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:05,139
(The younger guy doesn't like competition but prepares for it.)

1575
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:07,450
He's seriously here to compete against himself.

1576
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,990
(He even works out in the outdoor gym in the rain.)

1577
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:16,559
(Huffing and puffing)

1578
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,460
(Will there really be no competition as Sang Hyeon hoped for?)

1579
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:22,190
(Men, please ask someone out on a date within 5 minutes.)

1580
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:24,330
(The younger men stand up right away without any hesitation.)

1581
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,770
(Would you like to go on a date?)

1582
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,200
(Do you want to go out on a date today?)

1583
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:29,700
(I'd like that.)

1584
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,070
(Why did you choose me?)

1585
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,310
(You're so pretty.)

1586
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:35,880
(I'll help you.)

1587
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,909
(A sense of giddiness is reawakened for the first time in a while.)

1588
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:39,879
(Older women aren't all that bad.)

1589
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,980
(Is this what dating an older woman is like?)

1590
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,720
(You're so adorable.)

1591
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:49,219
(How many women do you want to get to know more?)

1592
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:52,490
(Let's put the serious conversation aside for now and just eat.)

1593
