1
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:04,073
(Male participants, please head over to enjoy breakfast.)

2
00:00:04,703 --> 00:00:08,973
(A breakfast date with 5 younger men?)

3
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:12,143
(Who does the empty seat belong to?)

4
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:16,513
(So Hyun, the fifth older woman to appear before the younger men)

5
00:00:16,913 --> 00:00:18,152
(Breakfast date, )

6
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:20,952
(So Hyun's benefit for joining later)

7
00:00:20,953 --> 00:00:22,482
(We'll treat you really well today.)

8
00:00:22,483 --> 00:00:25,053
(Don't do a thing. We'll do everything.)

9
00:00:25,723 --> 00:00:27,062
(The breakfast date for So Hyun...)

10
00:00:27,063 --> 00:00:28,423
(with the five younger men)

11
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,363
(And with the date ticket on the line, )

12
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:35,163
(the younger men's 3-Minute Match)

13
00:00:35,963 --> 00:00:40,273
(A match concerning the younger men's pride)

14
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:43,372
(The younger men work hard to go on a date...)

15
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:45,873
(with the younger woman they want.)

16
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:49,682
(After the match, )

17
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:53,023
(Bon Hee naturally takes care of Mu Jin.)

18
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:55,283
(Glancing)

19
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,793
(Sang Hyeon had a lot on his mind while watching them.)

20
00:00:59,963 --> 00:01:01,723
(Bon Hee, can I talk to you briefly?)

21
00:01:02,023 --> 00:01:04,583
(Sang Hyeon asks to talk to Bon Hee while she is with everyone.)

22
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,162
(I realized that he wasn't interested in me.)

23
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:11,872
(You were the only one I was interested in romantically, )

24
00:01:11,873 --> 00:01:13,772
(and so I wanted to talk to you.)

25
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,842
(It's hard not to notice...)

26
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:17,083
(how Mu Jin takes care of you.)

27
00:01:18,843 --> 00:01:20,812
(It made me realize that you two were already...)

28
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:22,682
(into each other so deeply.)

29
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:23,803
He's telling her everything.

30
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:29,553
(I think I should give up on you.)

31
00:01:35,063 --> 00:01:37,692
(And that night, someone comes to see Sang Hyeon.)

32
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:39,093
(Tapping)

33
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:48,472
(So Hyun asked to talk to Sang Hyeon.)

34
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:50,412
(Feeling shy)

35
00:01:50,413 --> 00:01:52,173
(Let me catch my breath.)

36
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,742
(Since it happened out of the blue, )

37
00:01:54,743 --> 00:01:56,413
(I was really bewildered.)

38
00:01:56,513 --> 00:01:58,983
(It was quite fascinating.)

39
00:01:59,623 --> 00:02:00,653
Nice.

40
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:03,893
Last week, the younger men's...

41
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:07,293
Three-Minute Match caused quite a stir.

42
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:09,292
Sang Hyeon,

43
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:11,392
having seen Bon Hee hand a water bottle to Mu Jin,

44
00:02:11,393 --> 00:02:13,932
- was deeply hurt. - He was.

45
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,202
- What came as a relief, however, - Yes?

46
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:17,573
Was that So Hyun asked to talk to Sang Hyeon...

47
00:02:17,873 --> 00:02:19,332
and told him she was rooting for him.

48
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,972
- She spoke openly about it. - Yes.

49
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:22,142
- Of course, she should. - It must have...

50
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,613
opened his heart to So Hyun.

51
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:25,142
As someone rooting...

52
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:26,212
for Sang Hyeon,

53
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:27,312
- that made me happy. - But...

54
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,383
Same.

55
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,553
(While So Hyun is opening up about her feelings to Sang Hyeon)

56
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,783
I wonder what we'll do tomorrow.

57
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,193
I really want to know what we'll be doing.

58
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,593
We'll probably go on a date.

59
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,622
But I want to know...

60
00:02:40,623 --> 00:02:41,892
how the date will be decided.

61
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:43,263
Do we choose directly?

62
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,532
Or is it random?

63
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,003
Which do you prefer?

64
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:48,633
Choosing directly.

65
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:51,003
- Choosing yourself? - Random...

66
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:52,943
is literally random.

67
00:02:53,443 --> 00:02:54,902
(Thinking)

68
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:57,773
But you could always ask to talk directly.

69
00:02:58,443 --> 00:02:59,982
It doesn't have to be a date.

70
00:02:59,983 --> 00:03:01,243
Yes, true.

71
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:02,883
We can totally talk,

72
00:03:03,113 --> 00:03:04,452
- but it's better... - You want the date...

73
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:05,752
in a more comfy setting...

74
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,429
- to be at a nice place. - with good food.

75
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,982
Sang Won, weren't you...

76
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:10,352
going to give me medicine for this?

77
00:03:10,353 --> 00:03:12,252
- Oh, right. - Can't you give me one?

78
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:14,622
- It's ointment. - Yes, you don't have it?

79
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:15,992
- No, I do. It's upstairs. - Me too.

80
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:17,692
You know what it is, right?

81
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:19,232
Are you talking about the dabbing thing?

82
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,402
You squeeze a little on a cotton swab or your finger...

83
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:22,462
- What? - and dab it on...

84
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:23,732
- before bed. - I got something right here too.

85
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:24,773
Does it disappear?

86
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:28,572
Wait, but keep a poker face.

87
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:30,412
- It gets better. - I see.

88
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:31,812
Apply a thick layer,

89
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:33,143
- and it absorbs. - What?

90
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,513
Sang Won approached me first...

91
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:40,683
and asked if we could talk.

92
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:42,993
We agreed to talk right then and there.

93
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:45,452
- I always wanted to talk to you. - You did?

94
00:03:45,453 --> 00:03:46,822
- How about we talk? - Okay.

95
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:48,023
We've got some time right now.

96
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:49,863
- On our first day, - Yes?

97
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,932
- we barely spoke to each other. - True.

98
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:56,333
When you talked with the others, it piqued my interest.

99
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,063
I wanted to know what you talked about.

100
00:03:58,303 --> 00:04:01,343
That's why I sent you the Love QR Code yesterday.

101
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,312
(Realizing)

102
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:04,413
Really?

103
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:06,043
Because...

104
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:08,983
I've been really curious.

105
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,583
You're someone I can't read at all.

106
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:15,122
It's only natural for me to find him interesting...

107
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:17,492
now that he has told me he's interested in me.

108
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:18,692
Anyone would.

109
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,262
So I want to get to know him more.

110
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,662
- It's a grueling schedule, - So...

111
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,233
even for the skin.

112
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:28,463
All of the men in my family wash their faces before bed.

113
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:31,173
Where's the drink we made?

114
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,573
Right, we need to do that.

115
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:34,802
- Made what? - The drink we made.

116
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:38,242
That move is to change the subject to her.

117
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:39,782
The memory only the two of them know.

118
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:41,282
(Ye Eun and Sang Won...)

119
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:42,913
(made makgeolli together.)

120
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:45,452
Where's the drink we made?

121
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,682
Right, we need to do that.

122
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:47,923
- Yes. - Let's do it right now.

123
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:49,722
(Bewildered)

124
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,823
- Made what? - The drink we made.

125
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:53,922
- The makgeolli we made. - Really?

126
00:04:53,923 --> 00:04:55,083
- Nice. - It slipped my mind.

127
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:57,162
I came down to do that but totally forgot...

128
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,293
because you weren't here.

129
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:00,332
You should've called me over if it was for that.

130
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,503
Why didn't you?

131
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,472
No, I came down thinking about whether I should do it.

132
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:09,603
But I was talking to her.

133
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:14,213
(Ultimately, Ye Eun successfully secured time alone with Sang Won.)

134
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,383
Are you drinking it?

135
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,583
- Makgeolli. - We...

136
00:05:19,283 --> 00:05:21,559
- Let's take a photo of it. - went to a makgeolli studio.

137
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,152
- Okay. - We made it.

138
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:26,022
But apparently, we have to stir it today.

139
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:28,792
- I had no idea. - That makgeolli is really special.

140
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:29,832
I agree.

141
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,109
(Pink Princess and Puppy, the names they gave each other)

142
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33,803
Do I just stir it?

143
00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:34,963
(Laughing)

144
00:05:34,964 --> 00:05:36,232
- Like... - What did the instructor say?

145
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,633
To stir it diligently.

146
00:05:38,473 --> 00:05:39,843
I'll give it a go.

147
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,073
Give what a go?

148
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:43,742
- Are you going to shake it? - Yes.

149
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,142
What if it bursts open?

150
00:05:45,143 --> 00:05:46,682
(Ye Eun naturally puts her hand on top.)

151
00:05:46,683 --> 00:05:47,683
No, like this.

152
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:50,113
Oh, no.

153
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,323
(I'll grab my own hand.)

154
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,053
(Grabbing)

155
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,093
(Surprised)

156
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:58,722
Is it okay?

157
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:00,493
(Her hands are frozen.)

158
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:03,833
It's not mixing at all.

159
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:05,932
(Shaking)

160
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,003
You're right.

161
00:06:07,563 --> 00:06:08,902
- I can't use it. - How cute.

162
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:10,772
Nothing fits.

163
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:11,933
(Ye Eun finds Sang Won cute.)

164
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:13,702
- Puppy. - It's working.

165
00:06:13,703 --> 00:06:14,773
Is it?

166
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:16,712
It's nice...

167
00:06:16,713 --> 00:06:18,172
- how the two have... - Done.

168
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:20,113
- something to talk about. - Exactly.

169
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,643
- Wash your hands. - Wait.

170
00:06:21,743 --> 00:06:23,252
I have to pat it.

171
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:24,452
(Patting)

172
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:25,553
Make sure to turn out well.

173
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:28,252
- Become delicious. - Delicious.

174
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:29,582
It's as if everyone...

175
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,993
has gone back to when they had their first date.

176
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,462
(Ji Yung has come upstairs alone.)

177
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,463
(Glancing at So Hyun's room)

178
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,593
So Hyun's room?

179
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,232
(Setting up snacks and wine glasses...)

180
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:43,733
(in an empty living room)

181
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:49,343
(Looking around)

182
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:51,313
Who is he waiting for?

183
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,843
It's So Hyun.

184
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:56,612
I want to talk to her more.

185
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:58,683
I want to get to know her better.

186
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:00,483
That's what I want to do.

187
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:03,753
(After the glamping date)

188
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:05,253
It's...

189
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:07,923
kind of cute when you get flustered.

190
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:12,263
(Ji Yung's feelings for So Hyun have grown bigger.)

191
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,132
(Ji Yung, who kept hesitating, )

192
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,702
Just call her out.

193
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:18,302
(heads toward So Hyun's room.)

194
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:19,303
(Knocking)

195
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:20,343
Yes?

196
00:07:20,743 --> 00:07:22,472
- Ji Yung. - Yes.

197
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:23,643
Why are you here?

198
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:25,013
(Flustered)

199
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:26,073
It's nothing.

200
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:28,243
Did he leave because So Hyun...

201
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:29,283
- isn't there? - Yes.

202
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:32,052
I was just about to ask...

203
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:33,283
if we could talk.

204
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:34,722
Go and ask now.

205
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:36,553
- Yes, go now. - Should I?

206
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:41,063
(Is So Hyun over here?)

207
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:43,963
(Looking around)

208
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:47,502
Are you looking for someone?

209
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:48,932
- No. - I see.

210
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,033
Can we talk...

211
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:53,203
- for a minute? - Sure.

212
00:07:58,373 --> 00:08:01,683
I feel like we don't have much time,

213
00:08:02,113 --> 00:08:04,683
and I've always wanted...

214
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:06,252
to talk to you.

215
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,283
- Is that so? - Yes.

216
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,483
Shall we go to my room?

217
00:08:10,753 --> 00:08:12,422
- What about... - If it's not cold,

218
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:14,563
- how about the terrace? - Yes, I'm in.

219
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:20,662
(Of all people)

220
00:08:20,663 --> 00:08:21,663
What?

221
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:23,932
- That was when they were talking. - What?

222
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:25,102
How did that happen?

223
00:08:25,103 --> 00:08:26,463
- What... - How could that happen?

224
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:29,572
(So Hyun, whom Ji Yung was looking for, )

225
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:31,413
(and Sang Hyeon are on the terrace.)

226
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:32,613
I'm sorry.

227
00:08:32,614 --> 00:08:34,183
- Sorry. - And his shoe came off.

228
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:37,153
I'm sorry. Let's go somewhere else. Not good.

229
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,682
- He said, "Not good." - I feel bad for Ji Yung.

230
00:08:39,683 --> 00:08:40,722
He's all flustered.

231
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,251
(Laughing)

232
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:45,922
What was that? People rarely come here.

233
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:47,022
- Really? - This spot...

234
00:08:47,023 --> 00:08:48,143
has suddenly become popular.

235
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:50,063
To think they'd meet there.

236
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,633
- Was someone there? - Yes.

237
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:53,333
Why don't we go over here?

238
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,563
- There's another terrace. - I feel bad for Ji Yung.

239
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,403
- Are you not cold? - No, I'm fine.

240
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,743
It was bad timing in many ways.

241
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:04,542
Ji Yung won't be able to focus anymore.

242
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,983
Exactly. At least he found So Hyun.

243
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,383
For real.

244
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,052
- He found where she was. - He found her.

245
00:09:10,053 --> 00:09:11,053
You're right.

246
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,082
Here.

247
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,052
(Ji Won and Ji Yung talk on the other terrace.)

248
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:20,292
It'd be great if we got a chance to go on a date,

249
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,422
but it didn't seem like we had much time.

250
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:24,663
- So... - They didn't have many chances.

251
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:28,963
You being full of confidence...

252
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:32,432
is charming,

253
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:34,403
and it'd be a bummer if I didn't talk to you.

254
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:36,003
- She's very straightforward. - Yes.

255
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:38,773
What's your ideal type of woman?

256
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:40,982
(Ji Won asked about Ji Yung's ideal type when he joined.)

257
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:44,513
Someone who is proud of her job.

258
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:47,952
(I want to talk to Ji Yung.)

259
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:49,083
Do you like to run?

260
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:50,592
I do.

261
00:09:50,593 --> 00:09:52,222
Really? How about a run tomorrow?

262
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:53,993
- May I join? - Sure.

263
00:09:54,423 --> 00:09:56,523
Who do you want to go on a date with today?

264
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:58,093
I'd like...

265
00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:00,033
to go with Ji Yung.

266
00:10:00,503 --> 00:10:02,863
- I want to talk to him. - Is that so?

267
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:06,903
I wasn't sure how to strike up a conversation.

268
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,042
But there weren't many situations...

269
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,713
- where I could talk to you. - I see.

270
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,113
That's why...

271
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:15,342
Only when I tell you in person that I'm interested in you...

272
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:17,713
will you realize it.

273
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:20,722
And I'd be able to hear about...

274
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:23,823
- your feelings. - Hear about it. I see.

275
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:27,293
First off, I'm sure...

276
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:30,032
it must've been hard, but thank you for telling me first.

277
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,993
- No, of course. - I'm serious.

278
00:10:33,363 --> 00:10:35,533
But...

279
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:38,903
- when I talked... - Yes?

280
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:41,073
- to So Hyun today, - Yes?

281
00:10:43,713 --> 00:10:45,713
We clicked really well.

282
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:49,243
To say it like that?

283
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:52,583
Out of all the people I've met until now,

284
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:56,523
I was surprised at how well we could keep a conversation going.

285
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:58,322
- It was really nice. - I see.

286
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:00,683
- You found her very charming. - I found her very charming.

287
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,093
- If I'm being honest. - Right.

288
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,533
What's crossing my mind right now is that I want...

289
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:08,902
- You want to focus on her. - to focus on So Hyun.

290
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:10,303
It really hit me today.

291
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:14,302
I felt this certainty today.

292
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,502
(Ji Yung is being honest about his feelings.)

293
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:17,373
So you've made up your mind.

294
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:20,013
Yes, it seems like it.

295
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:21,883
I get it.

296
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,712
(Embarrassed)

297
00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:24,713
Thank you.

298
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:27,023
It's nothing to thank me about.

299
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:30,023
You just told me about your feelings.

300
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,923
That's why I'm thanking you.

301
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:35,022
I know it must not have been easy, but you told me about your feelings.

302
00:11:35,023 --> 00:11:38,733
But this is something for myself as well.

303
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:42,303
Either way, if I hadn't talked to you,

304
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,672
I would've regretted it.

305
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:47,402
Then I would've regretted the time I spent here.

306
00:11:47,403 --> 00:11:50,412
- True. - "I should've talked to Ji Yung."

307
00:11:50,413 --> 00:11:52,212
I didn't want to have that regret,

308
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:54,242
so I'm glad I asked to talk...

309
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:55,412
- to you today. - I see.

310
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:56,852
(Ji Won doesn't want to leave any regrets.)

311
00:11:56,853 --> 00:12:00,282
I can't help but wonder if he had to be...

312
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:02,682
that clear with his answer.

313
00:12:02,683 --> 00:12:06,653
Couldn't he have just expressed his gratitude for her feelings...

314
00:12:07,363 --> 00:12:10,243
- and ended the conversation there? - Yes. After hearing how she felt...

315
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:11,963
- "I see." - "Thank you."

316
00:12:12,563 --> 00:12:15,132
It's not like Ji Won asked him out.

317
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:17,732
As a third party, it's heartbreaking to watch.

318
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:20,443
But it was a healthy conversation, wasn't it?

319
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:22,572
They expressed their feelings.

320
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:25,272
And the two did so...

321
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:26,812
in an honest-to-goodness way.

322
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:30,113
I personally think it was a rash call.

323
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,913
"I'm certain about So Hyun."

324
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:33,852
Saying that to someone.

325
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,022
Exactly. That's what makes me...

326
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:39,392
Imagine if things don't work out with So Hyun in the end.

327
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:40,553
I don't think it'll work out.

328
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,022
(Laughing)

329
00:12:42,023 --> 00:12:44,993
You saw the two of them during the swimming pool date.

330
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:47,232
So Hyun's expression is totally different.

331
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,433
When she looks at Ji Yung,

332
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:51,303
it's like, "What a cute guy."

333
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:54,372
But when she looks at Sang Hyeon,

334
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,213
her face is like a fully bloomed flower.

335
00:12:58,173 --> 00:12:59,613
This is tough.

336
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:01,683
(Oh, no. What now?)

337
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:07,153
(Mu Jin has come downstairs to the older women's floor.)

338
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:11,453
Can I come in?

339
00:13:11,553 --> 00:13:12,953
I'll head outside.

340
00:13:14,763 --> 00:13:18,633
(Mu Jin asks to see Bon Hee privately.)

341
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:19,862
Can we go outside?

342
00:13:19,863 --> 00:13:21,703
- How about we take a walk outside? - Sure.

343
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:23,973
Or outside over there?

344
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:26,473
Outside over there? You mean outside here?

345
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:27,942
Sure.

346
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:29,503
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin decide to talk.)

347
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:33,043
Did you eat something?

348
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:35,982
Earlier, when I watched the match,

349
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,252
I got all nervous myself.

350
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:38,253
(Laughing)

351
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:40,423
- You couldn't eat? Really? - I'm serious.

352
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,253
Yes, I got nervous.

353
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:43,822
Honestly, it was tough.

354
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,253
Right? I didn't expect you to be that good.

355
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:47,893
I was really surprised.

356
00:13:50,993 --> 00:13:53,433
I worked hard to go on a date with you.

357
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:54,763
I know.

358
00:13:57,973 --> 00:13:59,873
- Come to think of it, - Yes?

359
00:14:01,443 --> 00:14:04,672
Our first date happened because of the card.

360
00:14:04,673 --> 00:14:06,913
- Our second date was the bus date. - The bus date.

361
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:11,413
I wanted to go on our next date quickly.

362
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:13,353
That's what I thought.

363
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:16,053
But things haven't been working out.

364
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,152
They only had two dates.

365
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:20,222
It's a lot less than I expected.

366
00:14:20,223 --> 00:14:22,123
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin only had two dates.)

367
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:24,893
Have you talked to the others?

368
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:27,162
I have.

369
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:29,332
Once with Ji Yung. And I've talked with Sang Hyeon.

370
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,202
- Who? - Sang Hyeon.

371
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,403
- Sang Hyeon? - Yes.

372
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:37,012
I was fond of Bon Hee...

373
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:39,043
from the get-go.

374
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:45,182
(Sang Hyeon had a private talk with Bon Hee.)

375
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:48,382
Mu Jin knows Bon Hee and Sang Hyeon have talked...

376
00:14:48,383 --> 00:14:52,323
after Sang Hyeon declared war during the day.

377
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:53,963
It bothered me.

378
00:14:56,123 --> 00:14:57,132
And I've talked with Sang Hyeon.

379
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:59,192
- Who? - Sang Hyeon.

380
00:14:59,193 --> 00:15:00,503
- Sang Hyeon? - Yes.

381
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:03,363
- Sang Hyeon. - Sang Hyeon.

382
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,302
You know who it is, right?

383
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:06,533
- Sang Won and... - I do.

384
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:08,603
Sang Hyeon and I talked.

385
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:13,512
You two didn't go on a date, right?

386
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,983
No, we only talked.

387
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:16,883
(Thinking)

388
00:15:20,323 --> 00:15:21,963
Who else do you want to get to know more?

389
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:23,693
Get to know more?

390
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,293
- Get to know more? - Yes.

391
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:34,803
(Feeling nervous)

392
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:45,443
(Bon Hee can't answer him easily.)

393
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:53,353
- I've wanted to tell you this. - What?

394
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,053
When I had just joined,

395
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:59,323
the only person I was interested in from the first impression I got...

396
00:16:00,123 --> 00:16:01,723
was you.

397
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:07,463
I believe I was lucky.

398
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:09,603
- How so? - It's just...

399
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:12,933
When you came to the coffee shop.

400
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:16,343
Our first date.

401
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:21,643
It's because I believe in it.

402
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:23,343
Do you believe in fate?

403
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,553
I believe fate exists.

404
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:30,023
Yes.

405
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:34,192
You liking my first impression...

406
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,963
- the most. - Yes?

407
00:16:36,523 --> 00:16:40,293
You choosing my card.

408
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:42,703
And coming to the coffee shop.

409
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,503
All of them feel like fate to me.

410
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:52,313
That's why...

411
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:56,512
if things...

412
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:59,852
go well with someone here,

413
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:03,583
I want us to see each other for longer once we leave this place.

414
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,752
I'm wishing that would be great.

415
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,262
Honestly, I love...

416
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:13,692
how we can focus on...

417
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:15,303
that person themselves while we're here.

418
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,232
Outside, if anyone had been a lot younger,

419
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:20,031
I don't know if I could've done all of this.

420
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:22,643
I wouldn't have accepted the blind date.

421
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,573
If it were a blind date, I mean.

422
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:28,142
I wouldn't have felt this way if we were outside.

423
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:29,743
- I may have liked you, though. - Right.

424
00:17:30,243 --> 00:17:31,853
- I would have. - But you wouldn't...

425
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:37,053
That's why I'm also curious.

426
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,253
I wonder if I'll change my mind...

427
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:42,623
if our age gap is too big.

428
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:44,533
I'm not sure.

429
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:46,963
At the moment,

430
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:50,643
I don't care too much about our age difference.

431
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:54,602
We're talking and dating...

432
00:17:54,603 --> 00:17:57,443
without considering that.

433
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:03,483
(Mu Jin told Bon Hee his honest feelings.)

434
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:05,482
Mu Jin is impressive.

435
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:06,712
He's so cool.

436
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:07,852
- I love that guy. - He's straightforward.

437
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,252
I love him.

438
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:10,622
- You love him? - Yes.

439
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,992
- Because he's consistent. - Mu Jin...

440
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:14,122
I'm also in love with him now.

441
00:18:14,123 --> 00:18:16,293
Isn't he the type of guy that every girl wants?

442
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:17,533
- Definitely. - Right?

443
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:20,563
But Mu Jin... He's laughing at me again.

444
00:18:21,663 --> 00:18:22,702
Why?

445
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:24,632
- She's like, "My Mu Jin!" - "My Mu Jin!"

446
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:26,273
"Mu Jin, you're amazing!"

447
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:28,742
These two are the president and vice-president...

448
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:30,473
of Mu Jin's fan club.

449
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,312
Mu Jin must feel rushed now.

450
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,343
Right.

451
00:18:35,483 --> 00:18:38,552
But he was leaning back like this.

452
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:39,553
(Almost possessed by Mu Jin)

453
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:41,123
Are you curious about anyone else?

454
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:42,423
(Here he goes again.)

455
00:18:42,424 --> 00:18:45,122
And we often say, "We got lucky."

456
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:46,393
- "We got lucky." - Right.

457
00:18:46,553 --> 00:18:48,392
But that sounded like a love confession to me.

458
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,862
- Right. - "We got lucky" sounds all right.

459
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,393
But I'm not sure about fate.

460
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:55,303
(I like it, though.)

461
00:18:56,363 --> 00:18:59,802
(The night when honest feelings were exchanged has passed, )

462
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:02,943
(and morning has dawned.)

463
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:07,312
(Bon Hee is getting dolled up early in the morning.)

464
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,843
(Applying)

465
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:20,863
- Who's that? I think it's So Hyun. - It's So Hyun.

466
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:25,893
(Moaning)

467
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:30,603
(So Hyun starts the day by stretching.)

468
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,502
(Lifting)

469
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:33,532
She's flexible.

470
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:35,243
That's a great sunlight.

471
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,073
(Picking them up)

472
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:41,682
(After stretching, )

473
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:44,952
(she returns to her room.)

474
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:46,313
This is the base.

475
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:49,153
I hope everyone goes...

476
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:51,823
on a date with the person they want.

477
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:54,663
How was talking to Sang Hyeon last night?

478
00:19:54,863 --> 00:19:57,563
Last night... Yes, let's talk about that.

479
00:19:57,793 --> 00:19:58,863
I want to know.

480
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:04,203
(She tells Bon Hee about the talk with Sang Hyeon.)

481
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:06,573
He just told me everything honestly.

482
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:10,373
He was actually interested in you at first.

483
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,242
Then, I started expressing my interest,

484
00:20:13,243 --> 00:20:18,112
so he said he'd keep me in mind...

485
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:19,653
while he stays here.

486
00:20:21,883 --> 00:20:23,583
He's so cute.

487
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:26,023
He's so thoughtful.

488
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:28,522
But...

489
00:20:28,523 --> 00:20:30,763
I'm not sure what's on Bon Hee's mind.

490
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:37,802
(Ji Won is up.)

491
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,503
Good morning.

492
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:42,243
Did the talk go well last night?

493
00:20:42,343 --> 00:20:43,902
Yes, it did.

494
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,703
(Now, she hears about the chat with Ji Yung.)

495
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:47,113
You know,

496
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,513
I told him that I wanted to get to know him.

497
00:20:50,953 --> 00:20:54,553
But he said he was interested in someone else.

498
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,323
- That's what he said? - Yes.

499
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:59,053
And you don't want to take another shot?

500
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:03,163
He said he only sets eyes on one person.

501
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,863
He politely rejected me.

502
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,302
Really?

503
00:21:08,303 --> 00:21:09,862
"Politely rejected."

504
00:21:09,863 --> 00:21:11,703
But who knows what will happen?

505
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:13,133
Right.

506
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:19,813
I think her timing was bad.

507
00:21:21,543 --> 00:21:24,653
(Older women, please come to the Secret Room one by one.)

508
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:29,022
(Today, the older women will pick their dates.)

509
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:30,123
The older women will pick.

510
00:21:32,053 --> 00:21:34,092
(Memory Location Date)

511
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,093
"Memory Location?"

512
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:39,892
(Put a photo of a memory of yours...)

513
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:44,803
(into the drawer of the younger man you want to date.)

514
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,703
Are they old photos?

515
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:50,712
She looks good in long hair too.

516
00:21:50,713 --> 00:21:51,772
(The older women's stories they want to tell the younger men)

517
00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:52,773
(Ye Eun)

518
00:21:52,774 --> 00:21:54,413
Ye Eun was so cute!

519
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,783
That was her in high school?

520
00:21:58,453 --> 00:22:00,052
So Hyun is so cute.

521
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,322
(The older women invite the younger men...)

522
00:22:01,323 --> 00:22:02,852
(to their memorable places.)

523
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:03,922
Ji Won.

524
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,322
(Ji Won)

525
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:07,323
(Yeong Gyeong)

526
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:08,623
Yeong Gyeong.

527
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,762
(The younger men are gathered in a room at the time.)

528
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:13,763
Maybe.

529
00:22:15,663 --> 00:22:16,663
That's mine.

530
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:22,503
(Mu Jin, go to the Secret Room and see who your date is.)

531
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:25,373
(Grinning)

532
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:29,513
- What is it? - Why did you smile?

533
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:32,112
- He did that on purpose. - Is it good news?

534
00:22:32,113 --> 00:22:34,282
(The younger men are stirred by the most insignificant actions.)

535
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:35,583
I want to know too.

536
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,283
I'm dying to know.

537
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:39,492
- I'll see you soon. - Okay.

538
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:40,629
(Mu Jin excitedly goes to the Secret Room.)

539
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:43,293
- We must be going down one by one. - Are we getting chosen again?

540
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:45,162
(The younger men are nervous...)

541
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,292
(as they don't know what's happening.)

542
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:49,902
What if one of them doesn't get chosen?

543
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:51,632
(Another one left behind?)

544
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:54,572
- Sang Won. - I was thinking it,

545
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,949
- but I couldn't say it out loud. - Sang Won or...

546
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:57,342
I think it's Sang Won.

547
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,219
(Sang Won, the name that everyone was thinking)

548
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:01,283
What if he gets zero votes again?

549
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,993
Are we getting into their cars again?

550
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:06,453
(Mu Jin heads to the Secret Room.)

551
00:23:08,523 --> 00:23:10,993
(There's a card in front of him.)

552
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:12,852
(There is a photo containing the memories of the older women.)

553
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:14,792
(Open your own drawer, and if there is a photo, )

554
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,113
(go to the location in the photo and create a new memory.)

555
00:23:17,993 --> 00:23:23,263
(Will there be a photo in Mu Jin's drawer?)

556
00:23:23,303 --> 00:23:24,303
(Mu Jin)

557
00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:29,014
(Will there be a photo in Mu Jin's drawer?)

558
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,544
(Mu Jin)

559
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,584
(There's a photo for Mu Jin.)

560
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:38,124
(Staring)

561
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:45,264
(Who's the woman in the photo inside his drawer?)

562
00:23:45,794 --> 00:23:50,904
(The second younger man, Sang Won)

563
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:52,774
(Is he knocking?)

564
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:55,574
Sang Won.

565
00:23:56,344 --> 00:23:58,203
Sang Won is...

566
00:23:58,204 --> 00:23:59,273
(He's not familiar with this room, )

567
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:00,713
(so he has to knock.)

568
00:24:00,714 --> 00:24:02,814
Oh, it's his first time coming here.

569
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,613
(Only the ones with the most Love QR messages...)

570
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:07,614
(were allowed in this room until now.)

571
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,124
(Looking around)

572
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:14,594
(Focused)

573
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:16,423
You're expecting him to get zero votes, aren't you?

574
00:24:16,424 --> 00:24:18,994
No, I'm not. No!

575
00:24:19,264 --> 00:24:22,134
I could sense how intrigued he was.

576
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:23,664
(It feels hot.)

577
00:24:24,804 --> 00:24:28,374
(He sees his drawer for the first time.)

578
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:31,643
- Please. - Please.

579
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:33,573
(Will there be a photo in the drawer...)

580
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:35,513
(that he's opening for the first time?)

581
00:24:35,514 --> 00:24:36,613
There is!

582
00:24:36,614 --> 00:24:37,614
What?

583
00:24:39,784 --> 00:24:41,914
(There are two photos?)

584
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:43,723
- What? There are two photos! - Two photos?

585
00:24:43,724 --> 00:24:46,454
(There are two photos?)

586
00:24:47,054 --> 00:24:48,654
- Cheer up. - Cheer up.

587
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:49,824
You can still do it, Sang Won.

588
00:24:49,825 --> 00:24:51,623
Look how big his eyes have gotten.

589
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:54,933
I was very flustered...

590
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:58,364
because I had never imagined it.

591
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:01,504
I was surprised.

592
00:25:01,974 --> 00:25:03,504
He's like, "Are these really for me?"

593
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:09,484
(Sang Won, who had 0 votes, was chosen by 2 older women.)

594
00:25:10,684 --> 00:25:13,513
(There are 2 photos and 3 younger men left.)

595
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,113
Then, one of them isn't getting a photo.

596
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,424
(There are 2 photos and 3 younger men left.)

597
00:25:18,924 --> 00:25:21,993
(The third younger man to open the door to the Secret Room)

598
00:25:21,994 --> 00:25:24,724
(Hyeon Jun)

599
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,564
I hope that it's Yeong Gyeong,

600
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:32,104
but I'm not sure how she feels.

601
00:25:33,634 --> 00:25:35,474
(Do you want to go on a date with me?)

602
00:25:35,974 --> 00:25:39,614
(He kept showing his feelings for Yeong Gyeong.)

603
00:25:40,614 --> 00:25:42,243
(But she didn't choose him back.)

604
00:25:42,244 --> 00:25:44,844
I don't think she's interested in Hyeon Jun anymore.

605
00:25:46,384 --> 00:25:49,823
(Will there be her photo in his drawer?)

606
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,854
What?

607
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:52,724
What?

608
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:55,823
It must be empty.

609
00:25:55,824 --> 00:25:57,023
(His drawer is...)

610
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:58,024
(empty.)

611
00:25:58,024 --> 00:25:59,024
There's nothing.

612
00:26:00,864 --> 00:26:05,703
(He looks around the empty drawer as if he can't believe it.)

613
00:26:05,704 --> 00:26:09,104
Please don't break the drawer, Hyeon Jun.

614
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:10,803
He can't believe it.

615
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:11,874
(Is it really empty?)

616
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,414
He's very surprised.

617
00:26:16,014 --> 00:26:20,784
(He wasn't chosen by anyone.)

618
00:26:20,984 --> 00:26:23,724
I was disappointed.

619
00:26:29,494 --> 00:26:30,563
Ji Yung.

620
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:33,564
(The fourth younger man, Ji Yung)

621
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:39,504
(Opening)

622
00:26:41,304 --> 00:26:42,804
- What? - It's empty.

623
00:26:44,174 --> 00:26:46,344
(He fiddles with the camera.)

624
00:26:46,744 --> 00:26:48,614
(What?)

625
00:26:50,514 --> 00:26:52,243
- Ji Yung is so funny. - You laughed too hard.

626
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,964
He put his hand in as if there was a photo.

627
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:56,423
Did I laugh too hard?

628
00:26:56,424 --> 00:26:58,924
I mean, look at his face!

629
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,694
I feel so bad for him.

630
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,424
(Puzzled)

631
00:27:05,594 --> 00:27:10,364
(Ji Yung also wasn't chosen by anyone.)

632
00:27:11,434 --> 00:27:13,534
I did see it coming, though.

633
00:27:13,804 --> 00:27:15,003
He said he saw it coming.

634
00:27:15,004 --> 00:27:17,274
Stop lying! You didn't look like you did.

635
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:20,174
So Hyun has recently joined us,

636
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:22,273
and even I would have...

637
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,884
wanted to have a talk with others.

638
00:27:26,084 --> 00:27:28,054
I'll keep trying...

639
00:27:29,054 --> 00:27:31,384
to showcase my strengths...

640
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,124
and my attractiveness.

641
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:37,524
Do you know why life is all about timing?

642
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,294
If Ji Won...

643
00:27:40,664 --> 00:27:43,704
hadn't said a word to Ji Yung yesterday...

644
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,034
and picked her date today,

645
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:49,304
Ji Yung would have gone on a date with her.

646
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:52,873
Then, she would have been able to take her time...

647
00:27:52,874 --> 00:27:54,874
and charm him in a new place.

648
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:56,743
But she felt so rushed...

649
00:27:56,744 --> 00:27:58,814
when she saw Ji Yung looking for So Hyun.

650
00:27:59,414 --> 00:28:01,954
She went, "Let's have a chat. I like you."

651
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,623
"But I like someone else."

652
00:28:03,624 --> 00:28:04,654
"Okay."

653
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,924
That's how it ended.

654
00:28:07,594 --> 00:28:08,823
(Jumping up and down as she's upset)

655
00:28:08,824 --> 00:28:10,093
I think you need to take your time...

656
00:28:10,094 --> 00:28:11,523
in Yeon House.

657
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,963
On the other hand, Sang Won is even more confused.

658
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:15,533
(He must be very confused.)

659
00:28:15,534 --> 00:28:16,604
I'm so happy for him.

660
00:28:18,534 --> 00:28:19,673
There's Sang Hyeon.

661
00:28:19,674 --> 00:28:20,674
(Impressed)

662
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:22,803
(Amazed)

663
00:28:22,804 --> 00:28:25,374
(The last younger guy is Sang Hyeon.)

664
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:28,954
It's also his first time coming into this room.

665
00:28:29,614 --> 00:28:32,013
Oh, it's his first time.

666
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:34,254
(He carefully reads the instructions.)

667
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,124
If I have a photo?

668
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:42,724
(Whose photo does he want to see?)

669
00:28:43,494 --> 00:28:45,994
If I get a chance to go on a date with Bon Hee,

670
00:28:46,294 --> 00:28:48,493
or if she says,

671
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,064
"I'd like to go on a date with you..."

672
00:28:50,204 --> 00:28:51,464
"as we've never gone together,"

673
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:54,634
and we get to go,

674
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,674
I'd be more than happy.

675
00:28:58,674 --> 00:29:02,314
(Will there be Bon Hee's photo?)

676
00:29:02,944 --> 00:29:05,944
(A photo comes out of his drawer.)

677
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:09,154
Two photos.

678
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,484
(Laughing)

679
00:29:17,794 --> 00:29:20,363
(He got 2 photos, but none of them was Bon Hee's.)

680
00:29:20,364 --> 00:29:21,464
Poor him.

681
00:29:25,234 --> 00:29:27,674
I can tell for sure...

682
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:30,044
that they're both into each other.

683
00:29:30,544 --> 00:29:32,184
I don't think they'll change their minds.

684
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,583
Bon Hee...

685
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:38,643
(Bon Hee...)

686
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,053
I think he should let her go, right?

687
00:29:40,054 --> 00:29:41,384
I think he should.

688
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,923
I'm going to need some time to clear my mind.

689
00:29:43,924 --> 00:29:46,954
(I'm going to need some time to clear my mind.)

690
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,763
(He has come to definitely know...)

691
00:29:49,764 --> 00:29:52,294
(Bon Hee's feelings through today's choice.)

692
00:29:53,064 --> 00:29:55,463
(Will he have a change of heart...)

693
00:29:55,464 --> 00:29:59,134
(after today's date?)

694
00:29:59,874 --> 00:30:02,604
Do you think Bon Hee...

695
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:06,844
will change her mind just because Sang Hyeon tries?

696
00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:08,844
- I don't think so. - I agree.

697
00:30:09,044 --> 00:30:11,283
He could let go of his pride and ask her...

698
00:30:11,284 --> 00:30:12,944
for a second chat,

699
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:14,883
but I bet he'll stop asking...

700
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:15,983
for her sake.

701
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:18,484
- You're right. - It'd be too much pressure for her.

702
00:30:19,124 --> 00:30:21,823
That's how you can tell that he actually cares for her.

703
00:30:21,824 --> 00:30:23,324
- Exactly. - If he does care for her.

704
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:31,804
(The older women are waiting at the memorable places.)

705
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:37,743
(The younger men are headed toward them...)

706
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:40,914
(half-excited and half-nervous.)

707
00:30:43,314 --> 00:30:44,943
The younger men are on the move.

708
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:46,784
(How will their Memory Location Date go?)

709
00:30:49,154 --> 00:30:50,583
(A place that feels special for no reason, an amusement park)

710
00:30:50,584 --> 00:30:53,754
It's an amusement park. Which woman is waiting?

711
00:30:54,094 --> 00:30:55,953
It's been so long since I last went to one.

712
00:30:55,954 --> 00:31:00,994
(One older woman is waiting there.)

713
00:31:03,204 --> 00:31:06,333
(A younger man walks in.)

714
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:07,434
It's Sang Hyeon.

715
00:31:08,204 --> 00:31:09,744
(He spots her.)

716
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:12,374
I was expecting someone to pick me...

717
00:31:12,744 --> 00:31:16,274
if the women get to choose.

718
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:19,143
(The 1st photo of the 2 photos in his drawer)

719
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:21,214
- That's obviously So Hyun. - How adorable.

720
00:31:22,184 --> 00:31:24,384
So Hyun looks beautiful today.

721
00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:27,694
I went there often with my parents when I was little.

722
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:30,294
I also worked part-time there, and I often visited...

723
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:33,494
for my outside activities, so it's very memorable.

724
00:31:33,794 --> 00:31:35,064
She's so cute today.

725
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,404
(So Hyun and Sang Hyeon)

726
00:31:40,974 --> 00:31:42,504
(Smiling brightly)

727
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:45,174
He looks so happy.

728
00:31:45,444 --> 00:31:46,744
Hello.

729
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:49,543
- You must have waited long. - It's fine.

730
00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:50,544
- Should we... - Why are you sitting?

731
00:31:50,545 --> 00:31:52,414
- We shouldn't sit. - Why are you sitting?

732
00:31:53,114 --> 00:31:54,254
Sorry.

733
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:57,183
It took me too long to pick an outfit.

734
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,953
- It took a while. - Picking took you long?

735
00:31:58,954 --> 00:32:00,493
Yes, I was picking my outfit.

736
00:32:00,494 --> 00:32:01,594
- Oh, your clothes? - Yes.

737
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:03,394
You picked the right one.

738
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:05,424
(Shy)

739
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:08,974
Where are we going? Should we get back to the bench?

740
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,203
(He turns away from the entrance.)

741
00:32:11,204 --> 00:32:12,504
(Anxious)

742
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:14,703
He was cute.

743
00:32:14,704 --> 00:32:17,004
He felt like a giant puppy.

744
00:32:17,344 --> 00:32:18,404
He is cute.

745
00:32:22,814 --> 00:32:24,583
(It's a day to grow closer to one another.)

746
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:27,224
(Please speak casually, including the way you address each other.)

747
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:30,384
They told us to speak casually during our date.

748
00:32:31,954 --> 00:32:34,094
- Are you all right with that? - Let's do that.

749
00:32:35,694 --> 00:32:36,694
(Shy)

750
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:39,893
Oh, it was an order!

751
00:32:39,894 --> 00:32:41,393
(They're forced to drop the honorifics.)

752
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:43,604
- I think they'll get closer. - Instantly.

753
00:32:45,904 --> 00:32:48,074
I have a fan. Should we use it?

754
00:32:48,874 --> 00:32:50,374
I brought a fan...

755
00:32:50,874 --> 00:32:52,003
and a cooling...

756
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:54,273
It's awkward to speak in non-honorifics.

757
00:32:54,274 --> 00:32:56,544
I know, right? Let's just do it.

758
00:32:57,484 --> 00:32:58,913
(How will their date go...)

759
00:32:58,914 --> 00:33:00,453
(without the honorifics?)

760
00:33:00,454 --> 00:33:01,514
Come on.

761
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,583
It brings back old memories.

762
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,300
- It's interesting. - Really? Do you like coming here?

763
00:33:07,324 --> 00:33:08,593
I do. Animals...

764
00:33:08,594 --> 00:33:11,293
- Well... - Do you like the zoo...

765
00:33:11,294 --> 00:33:13,164
- or the amusement park? - I like animals.

766
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:15,533
So, I liked coming here as I could see them up close.

767
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:16,964
Oh, I see.

768
00:33:18,304 --> 00:33:20,104
What's your favorite animal?

769
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:22,903
These days, quokkas are my favorite.

770
00:33:22,904 --> 00:33:23,904
Quokkas?

771
00:33:23,905 --> 00:33:26,673
Is there a quokka headband?

772
00:33:26,674 --> 00:33:28,673
I want to pick one for you.

773
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,883
(I want to pick one for you.)

774
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,083
(Surprised)

775
00:33:33,084 --> 00:33:34,913
He just dropped the honorifics.

776
00:33:34,914 --> 00:33:37,124
I like hearing that.

777
00:33:37,424 --> 00:33:39,623
Using the honorifics or not makes a big difference.

778
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:40,893
- Of course. - It does.

779
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,123
(The non-honorifics change the mood immediately.)

780
00:33:42,124 --> 00:33:43,124
Quokka...

781
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,093
I want to pick one for you.

782
00:33:45,094 --> 00:33:47,894
(Flustered)

783
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:51,564
He just said, "You," without the honorifics.

784
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:53,734
I was surprised,

785
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:57,374
but I realized how natural he could be.

786
00:33:57,544 --> 00:33:59,104
I felt...

787
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:02,874
more intimate all of a sudden.

788
00:34:03,484 --> 00:34:05,244
Speaking in the non-honorifics to her...

789
00:34:07,014 --> 00:34:08,083
was easy.

790
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:11,123
I wasn't hesitant to use it at all.

791
00:34:11,123 --> 00:34:12,184
I just...

792
00:34:12,724 --> 00:34:14,853
I didn't want to call her "noona."

793
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:20,734
- Hello. - Hello.

794
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:22,563
- We'll take these. - Hello.

795
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:24,203
I'll get rid of the tags right away.

796
00:34:24,204 --> 00:34:25,234
- Sure. - Sure.

797
00:34:26,234 --> 00:34:28,072
- I didn't bring my wallet. - That will be 22 dollars.

798
00:34:28,074 --> 00:34:29,074
You didn't?

799
00:34:29,074 --> 00:34:30,574
I didn't bring it at all.

800
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:32,072
- He didn't bring his wallet? - What?

801
00:34:32,074 --> 00:34:33,743
- What? - Oh, no.

802
00:34:33,744 --> 00:34:34,914
(This can't be.)

803
00:34:35,313 --> 00:34:38,184
(Sang Hyeon forgot to bring his wallet by mistake.)

804
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,513
- I... - How could you leave your wallet...

805
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:40,914
on a date?

806
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:42,913
I...

807
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,924
(Restless)

808
00:34:45,654 --> 00:34:47,293
- I'll send you the money. - That's fine.

809
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,574
- "I'll send you the money." - "I'll send you the money."

810
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,322
- Thank you. Have a good day. - Thank you.

811
00:34:51,324 --> 00:34:53,194
Thank you. Goodbye.

812
00:34:53,694 --> 00:34:54,964
- Hold it for me. - Okay.

813
00:34:55,634 --> 00:34:56,980
The older woman bought it for him.

814
00:34:57,004 --> 00:34:58,503
- I make good money. - You make good money?

815
00:34:58,504 --> 00:35:00,803
I can afford this much.

816
00:35:00,804 --> 00:35:02,103
(He feels bad, so he tells her that he's capable.)

817
00:35:02,104 --> 00:35:03,744
- I know. - Let's go.

818
00:35:05,474 --> 00:35:07,574
It's on me today.

819
00:35:08,814 --> 00:35:10,914
He didn't bring his wallet to a date?

820
00:35:11,384 --> 00:35:13,244
Then, the older woman can pay.

821
00:35:13,354 --> 00:35:15,914
Why would the guy bring his wallet to a date?

822
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,423
(In love with her)

823
00:35:17,424 --> 00:35:19,483
That was a great line just now.

824
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,393
(A line that would make a younger guy's heart flutter)

825
00:35:21,394 --> 00:35:22,553
That was amazing.

826
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:25,593
I'd think, "Is he not interested in me?"

827
00:35:25,594 --> 00:35:26,764
Of course.

828
00:35:27,094 --> 00:35:30,734
I don't know why Sang Hyeon is laughing right now,

829
00:35:31,204 --> 00:35:32,533
but he must feel...

830
00:35:32,534 --> 00:35:34,533
- He's flustered. - a lot of mental stress.

831
00:35:34,534 --> 00:35:36,004
- Right? - Yes.

832
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:37,703
I couldn't agree with him more.

833
00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:39,743
Obviously,

834
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:42,774
she wouldn't be mistaken because of that.

835
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,413
Say that actually happened to you.

836
00:35:45,414 --> 00:35:47,384
- Okay. - What would you do?

837
00:35:47,784 --> 00:35:48,813
I could say, "I'm so sorry about today."

838
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,783
"I'll pay for everything on our next date,"

839
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:52,323
"so let's go on another date."

840
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:53,924
- I like that. - That's good.

841
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:58,423
(The two head to the place in her photo.)

842
00:35:58,424 --> 00:35:59,824
Should we try it?

843
00:36:00,194 --> 00:36:01,564
Is it here?

844
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:06,033
(The location in So Hyun's photo...)

845
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:07,773
It's a trail.

846
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:09,933
(is now a trail.)

847
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:13,414
But this place is completely...

848
00:36:13,844 --> 00:36:15,373
- I think... - Did it change?

849
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:16,513
There's the pirate ship,

850
00:36:16,514 --> 00:36:18,943
so it must have been around here.

851
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:21,114
(She vaguely remembers the memorable place.)

852
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:23,523
I'll take a photo of you.

853
00:36:23,524 --> 00:36:25,224
A photo? Here?

854
00:36:26,424 --> 00:36:27,723
Do you want it to be taken from a short or long distance?

855
00:36:27,724 --> 00:36:29,423
(Sang Hyeon wants to help So Hyun make a good memory as she's sad.)

856
00:36:29,424 --> 00:36:31,340
Take one from a short distance and another from afar.

857
00:36:31,364 --> 00:36:32,604
Do I look okay under the shade?

858
00:36:32,994 --> 00:36:34,474
Yes, you look better under the shade.

859
00:36:38,934 --> 00:36:41,673
(She poses for a photo at a place she came to as a little girl.)

860
00:36:41,674 --> 00:36:42,704
She looks cute.

861
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,474
You're so good at taking photos.

862
00:36:47,714 --> 00:36:49,074
- I approve. - It feels rewarding.

863
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,784
- I approve. - It feels rewarding.

864
00:36:51,214 --> 00:36:52,344
You must be feeling hot.

865
00:36:53,014 --> 00:36:55,384
I sweat easily.

866
00:36:57,884 --> 00:37:02,994
(So Hyun wipes sweat off his face.)

867
00:37:04,894 --> 00:37:05,994
It's so hot.

868
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:08,474
Can't we have a photo taken together?

869
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:10,563
- Shall we do it together? - Let's take a selfie together.

870
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:11,604
Under the shade.

871
00:37:16,574 --> 00:37:18,703
One, two... Come a little farther to this side.

872
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:19,773
(They take a selfie together for the first time.)

873
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:20,944
One, two, three.

874
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:23,883
(Our first photo together taken at a place in old memories)

875
00:37:23,884 --> 00:37:25,644
They look great together.

876
00:37:26,714 --> 00:37:29,984
I came back to the place where I made good memories.

877
00:37:31,324 --> 00:37:33,694
And I'm here with the person I want to be with. It's nice.

878
00:37:33,894 --> 00:37:36,493
She expressed her feelings so clearly and explicitly.

879
00:37:36,494 --> 00:37:38,294
I'm not used to hearing that kind of comment.

880
00:37:38,764 --> 00:37:39,793
You took me by surprise.

881
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:42,394
(I'm not used to hearing that kind of comment. You surprised me.)

882
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:46,034
Yesterday, after having a chat with you,

883
00:37:47,174 --> 00:37:49,203
I went back up to the third floor.

884
00:37:49,204 --> 00:37:51,603
I stayed in my room for a while,

885
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:53,843
spending some time calming myself down.

886
00:37:53,844 --> 00:37:55,044
Oh, my goodness.

887
00:37:55,344 --> 00:37:57,344
- I was so... - He's telling her how he felt then.

888
00:37:58,244 --> 00:38:01,283
(So Hyun told Sang Hyeon how she felt for him last night.)

889
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:03,953
I wanted to talk to you.

890
00:38:03,954 --> 00:38:05,184
- Really? - Yes.

891
00:38:05,654 --> 00:38:06,654
My goodness.

892
00:38:06,655 --> 00:38:08,523
(So Hyun asked him to talk with her, which was so unexpected...)

893
00:38:08,524 --> 00:38:09,524
(that his legs became wobbly.)

894
00:38:09,524 --> 00:38:10,524
He got that surprised?

895
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:13,393
- My goodness. - He was taken aback.

896
00:38:13,394 --> 00:38:14,874
He must've been like, "What do I do?"

897
00:38:15,034 --> 00:38:16,034
I don't know how to put it.

898
00:38:16,035 --> 00:38:18,664
- I remained that way for a while. - Really?

899
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,750
I flopped on the floor and stayed seated for a while.

900
00:38:21,774 --> 00:38:23,073
- I'm telling you the truth. - Why?

901
00:38:23,074 --> 00:38:24,173
(She finds him cute.)

902
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:26,404
That means he was really happy.

903
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:29,873
- This is it. Thunder Falls. - Thunder Falls.

904
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,544
- It'll be fun. - It'll be so much fun.

905
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:33,204
Don't you get wet on that kind of ride?

906
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,353
Probably.

907
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,784
(They get on a ride together for the first time.)

908
00:38:38,424 --> 00:38:39,654
Oh, dear me.

909
00:38:40,924 --> 00:38:42,724
(Sitting closely together)

910
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,623
Their arms are touching. When that happens,

911
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:48,334
it makes your heart flutter.

912
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:51,503
Don't you feel that way, Woo Young? Your arms would touch.

913
00:38:51,504 --> 00:38:53,104
Did you get a vaccine shot or something?

914
00:38:53,304 --> 00:38:54,774
Gosh, I can't speak to you.

915
00:38:55,234 --> 00:38:56,674
You just don't get it.

916
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,604
(Sitting closely together)

917
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:02,813
We'll get wet? Then I should... Oh, no.

918
00:39:02,814 --> 00:39:05,444
I'll put this fan in my bag.

919
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:08,414
- I don't want it to get wet. - I'll be sure to protect your bag.

920
00:39:08,684 --> 00:39:10,783
- I'll hold it like this. - Oh, okay. Thank you.

921
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:11,954
(I'll protect your bag.)

922
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,794
(Surprised)

923
00:39:14,324 --> 00:39:15,653
(Laughing)

924
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:17,093
What was that reaction? You can handle rides, right?

925
00:39:17,094 --> 00:39:19,563
- Yes. But I don't like to get wet. - Right?

926
00:39:19,564 --> 00:39:20,564
- Oh, I see. - Okay.

927
00:39:20,764 --> 00:39:21,834
I don't like to get wet.

928
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:27,204
- Oh, gosh. Wait. Really? - We're not falling just yet.

929
00:39:29,104 --> 00:39:30,273
(Protecting the quokka)

930
00:39:30,274 --> 00:39:32,574
(Getting closer to him)

931
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:34,014
What's going on?

932
00:39:35,714 --> 00:39:37,784
(He finds her cute.)

933
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:40,044
Why do I hate water so much?

934
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:43,584
- But it's fun. It's really fun. - It's fun, indeed.

935
00:39:44,484 --> 00:39:45,654
All right. Here we go.

936
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,293
- We're falling backward? - No way.

937
00:39:48,294 --> 00:39:50,023
- Right. That won't happen. - It will turn around and fall.

938
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:51,164
Let's go.

939
00:39:54,364 --> 00:39:55,394
Here we go!

940
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,004
(She hides in the end.)

941
00:40:03,674 --> 00:40:05,034
My gosh. It creates a huge splash.

942
00:40:05,674 --> 00:40:08,674
- I wonder what Sang Hyeon will do. - He's not blocking water for her.

943
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:10,683
(So Hyun is soaking wet.)

944
00:40:10,684 --> 00:40:13,384
Look at my hair. My gosh. I didn't know I'd get so wet.

945
00:40:13,714 --> 00:40:16,053
She's soaking wet. Look at her hair.

946
00:40:16,054 --> 00:40:17,883
I kept your bag dry as I promised.

947
00:40:17,884 --> 00:40:19,383
- Really? - I kept it dry.

948
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:21,793
You should've kept my hair dry, not my bag.

949
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:22,794
(Sorry)

950
00:40:25,224 --> 00:40:26,624
Why didn't he cover her face?

951
00:40:26,794 --> 00:40:29,193
- He should've covered her face. - Right. I wish he had done it.

952
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:30,933
But he... I guess you didn't notice it.

953
00:40:30,934 --> 00:40:32,934
In my opinion, he covered her face.

954
00:40:33,104 --> 00:40:34,573
- By turning his head toward her? - Yes.

955
00:40:34,574 --> 00:40:36,233
You're wrong. He did that...

956
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,673
- to keep his face dry. - He was just protecting his face.

957
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:39,873
That's why he leaned forward.

958
00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:42,573
Knowing Sang Hyeon, he would've been too shy...

959
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:44,343
to cover her face with his arms. So instead,

960
00:40:44,344 --> 00:40:45,984
he turned his head while leaning forward.

961
00:40:47,414 --> 00:40:48,654
He did that to block water.

962
00:40:48,754 --> 00:40:50,883
He actively expressed his feelings by doing so.

963
00:40:50,884 --> 00:40:52,154
(SOOBIN finds it funny.)

964
00:40:52,254 --> 00:40:53,653
He was feeling very shy,

965
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:55,354
but he tried to protect her.

966
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,470
- Was that him protecting her? - Don't be ridiculous.

967
00:40:57,494 --> 00:40:59,324
To be honest, I would...

968
00:40:59,694 --> 00:41:02,364
Maybe because I'm a little conservative,

969
00:41:02,534 --> 00:41:05,233
I'd cover her face like this if she's my girlfriend.

970
00:41:05,234 --> 00:41:07,433
- You can just put a hand up. - Like this.

971
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:09,733
I mean, it's their first date,

972
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,643
and they've known each other for only two days.

973
00:41:11,644 --> 00:41:12,773
Covering her face with his hands would also be a little...

974
00:41:12,774 --> 00:41:14,374
- But... - What if you like her so much?

975
00:41:14,614 --> 00:41:17,014
What if you're really into her?

976
00:41:17,884 --> 00:41:19,590
You wouldn't cover her face even if you're really into her?

977
00:41:19,614 --> 00:41:20,714
If I'm really into her?

978
00:41:22,554 --> 00:41:24,683
I thought Seul Hye's eyes would pop out.

979
00:41:24,684 --> 00:41:26,953
I was just curious... Aren't you curious?

980
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:28,324
"SOOBIN, I really like it."

981
00:41:28,924 --> 00:41:30,254
"Cover my face, please."

982
00:41:31,224 --> 00:41:32,423
- "Can't you do it for me?" - In that situation...

983
00:41:32,424 --> 00:41:33,794
(Cracking up)

984
00:41:37,304 --> 00:41:40,904
Let's eat first since we're hungry. Let's just grab a bite...

985
00:41:42,174 --> 00:41:43,894
Goodness. Let me take this off for a while.

986
00:41:45,744 --> 00:41:47,374
My hair must've gotten flattened.

987
00:41:47,974 --> 00:41:51,284
But you don't look so bad.

988
00:41:51,984 --> 00:41:53,914
You look okay. Can you come a little closer?

989
00:41:54,214 --> 00:41:55,214
(Leaning forward)

990
00:41:55,215 --> 00:41:56,254
Can you lower your head?

991
00:41:57,324 --> 00:41:58,424
That's good.

992
00:41:58,624 --> 00:42:00,993
- I applied hair product. - No, it's not that. Look at this.

993
00:42:00,994 --> 00:42:02,234
You had this lint on your hair.

994
00:42:03,224 --> 00:42:04,394
That's nice.

995
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:07,094
(Smiling)

996
00:42:07,934 --> 00:42:10,093
Do you mind if I ask you this? Do you have any...

997
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,363
Do you have any siblings?

998
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:13,464
What do you think?

999
00:42:14,704 --> 00:42:15,773
(Thinking)

1000
00:42:15,774 --> 00:42:17,544
- It's hard to guess. - Is it?

1001
00:42:17,674 --> 00:42:18,774
Honestly, I think...

1002
00:42:20,344 --> 00:42:21,773
It feels like you'd have a younger sibling.

1003
00:42:21,774 --> 00:42:23,613
- A younger sibling? - Yes.

1004
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:25,243
- A sister or a brother? - A brother.

1005
00:42:25,244 --> 00:42:27,153
Oh, really? I wonder why.

1006
00:42:27,154 --> 00:42:28,853
But many women with a younger brother...

1007
00:42:28,854 --> 00:42:31,324
don't think of a younger man as more than a friend.

1008
00:42:31,554 --> 00:42:33,853
They say that a younger man feels like a younger brother.

1009
00:42:33,854 --> 00:42:36,094
- Right. Indeed. - I've heard that.

1010
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:38,994
(Curious)

1011
00:42:39,194 --> 00:42:40,794
I have an older sister.

1012
00:42:41,794 --> 00:42:43,733
(Smiling)

1013
00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:44,804
Should I be relieved?

1014
00:42:45,404 --> 00:42:46,533
"Should I be relieved?"

1015
00:42:46,534 --> 00:42:48,604
I've seen some people who thought that way.

1016
00:42:49,704 --> 00:42:51,474
Oh, my. Look at him. He seems happy.

1017
00:42:52,844 --> 00:42:55,044
- You majored in computer science. - Yes.

1018
00:42:55,714 --> 00:42:57,643
- I majored in computer science too. - Really?

1019
00:42:57,644 --> 00:42:58,914
- Really? - Yes.

1020
00:42:59,014 --> 00:43:00,244
- Is that true? - Yes.

1021
00:43:00,384 --> 00:43:04,224
The computer science lectures...

1022
00:43:04,424 --> 00:43:06,054
were really difficult for me.

1023
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,194
They were so difficult for me...

1024
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:10,894
that I rarely went to school.

1025
00:43:11,564 --> 00:43:12,564
(It's hard to believe.)

1026
00:43:12,565 --> 00:43:13,623
I often went out to have fun.

1027
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:18,234
I believed I should have fun during my college years.

1028
00:43:18,504 --> 00:43:19,864
You're the opposite of me.

1029
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,104
Why? What's so different?

1030
00:43:22,234 --> 00:43:24,434
I believed I should study hard during my college years.

1031
00:43:24,774 --> 00:43:26,074
I didn't drink.

1032
00:43:26,244 --> 00:43:27,344
Oh, right.

1033
00:43:28,044 --> 00:43:29,244
I never had a drink.

1034
00:43:29,944 --> 00:43:31,984
- Right. - Of course, I also...

1035
00:43:34,014 --> 00:43:36,413
You believed you were supposed to study hard at college.

1036
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:39,453
Then when you were studying hard...

1037
00:43:39,454 --> 00:43:40,693
(The 1st date is over. Please go to the location in the 2nd photo.)

1038
00:43:40,694 --> 00:43:42,853
- You must've had your own goal. - The date is over already?

1039
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,394
You studied hard...

1040
00:43:48,164 --> 00:43:49,464
(Snorting)

1041
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,904
(What's going on?)

1042
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,504
- Hold on a second. - What's wrong?

1043
00:43:55,504 --> 00:43:58,703
- We just rode a water ride, right? - We rode a water ride.

1044
00:43:58,704 --> 00:44:00,713
- It starts with "Thunder." - We rode Thunder Falls.

1045
00:44:00,714 --> 00:44:02,913
- Why? - I want to ride T Express with you.

1046
00:44:02,914 --> 00:44:03,984
Yes?

1047
00:44:04,214 --> 00:44:05,644
Please don't say you can't.

1048
00:44:06,584 --> 00:44:07,714
Please.

1049
00:44:07,954 --> 00:44:10,354
- Please don't say you can't. - Wait, no...

1050
00:44:12,754 --> 00:44:15,594
(Sang Hyeon feels so bad that he can't tell her.)

1051
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,724
What does it say?

1052
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,134
It says...

1053
00:44:22,134 --> 00:44:24,364
that the first Memory Location Date is over.

1054
00:44:26,134 --> 00:44:28,434
That the first Memory Location Date is over.

1055
00:44:30,774 --> 00:44:33,404
The first Memory Location Date is over?

1056
00:44:37,684 --> 00:44:39,804
- What time is it now? - Maybe we should've eaten it.

1057
00:44:39,884 --> 00:44:41,814
- I mean, we should've ridden it. - It's 4:30pm.

1058
00:44:42,014 --> 00:44:43,214
We should've ridden T Express.

1059
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,383
It's over?

1060
00:44:45,384 --> 00:44:46,823
Why didn't I get the message?

1061
00:44:46,824 --> 00:44:48,270
(She checks her phone as she's sad it's over.)

1062
00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:49,654
Really? Then should you leave now?

1063
00:44:50,424 --> 00:44:51,864
Is their date over?

1064
00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:56,294
I think I should... Should I leave now?

1065
00:44:56,534 --> 00:44:59,103
- I think I should leave now. - Oh, no.

1066
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:00,334
We haven't ridden T Express.

1067
00:45:01,104 --> 00:45:02,550
Let's come back here some other time.

1068
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,703
You really should see it.

1069
00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:04,773
I wanted to go on a safari.

1070
00:45:04,774 --> 00:45:07,173
And you wanted to ride T Express.

1071
00:45:07,174 --> 00:45:08,444
You wanted to ride it.

1072
00:45:09,214 --> 00:45:11,494
At least, it gave us a reason to come back here together.

1073
00:45:12,914 --> 00:45:14,254
We have a reason to come back.

1074
00:45:15,854 --> 00:45:17,213
I'm sorry. For some reason...

1075
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,623
- Why? - Sorry for leaving like this.

1076
00:45:19,624 --> 00:45:21,424
- What are you sorry for? - I mean...

1077
00:45:22,224 --> 00:45:24,304
We couldn't do all the things you wanted to do here.

1078
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,733
I couldn't understand what you said. Why do you feel bad about it?

1079
00:45:28,734 --> 00:45:29,763
Don't feel that way.

1080
00:45:29,764 --> 00:45:31,304
I wanted to ride it too.

1081
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:35,074
- This is... - You seem more disappointed.

1082
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:37,904
We had too little time.

1083
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:41,713
I would like to go...

1084
00:45:41,714 --> 00:45:44,284
on a date with Sang Hyeon again.

1085
00:45:44,414 --> 00:45:45,944
I found him cute.

1086
00:45:46,884 --> 00:45:49,053
It was nice. I had a really great time with him.

1087
00:45:49,054 --> 00:45:50,983
(I had a great time with him.)

1088
00:45:50,984 --> 00:45:52,054
I'm embarrassed.

1089
00:45:52,784 --> 00:45:54,094
Oh, my.

1090
00:45:54,594 --> 00:45:56,294
Today, we just went...

1091
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:57,923
to a fun place.

1092
00:45:57,924 --> 00:45:59,863
I would've had fun there no matter whom I was with.

1093
00:45:59,864 --> 00:46:01,393
- No matter whom he was with? - I would've been happy...

1094
00:46:01,394 --> 00:46:03,894
no matter whom I was with.

1095
00:46:04,134 --> 00:46:07,504
The place made me feel like I was in love.

1096
00:46:08,204 --> 00:46:10,103
So I was very sad...

1097
00:46:10,104 --> 00:46:13,004
because our date was over so early.

1098
00:46:14,744 --> 00:46:16,073
I guess that's why couples often go...

1099
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:17,883
- to an amusement park. - That must be why.

1100
00:46:17,884 --> 00:46:19,583
That place makes you feel that way, indeed.

1101
00:46:19,584 --> 00:46:20,713
(Did the date with So Hyun change Sang Hyeon's heart?)

1102
00:46:20,714 --> 00:46:22,653
Their date...

1103
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,083
made me jealous, and it was nice to see them like that.

1104
00:46:25,084 --> 00:46:28,123
I thought they could make a cute couple...

1105
00:46:28,124 --> 00:46:30,423
for the first time while watching their date.

1106
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:34,264
But the last thing that Sang Hyeon said...

1107
00:46:34,864 --> 00:46:36,164
bothers me.

1108
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:37,934
- "Whomever he was with?" - Yes.

1109
00:46:38,404 --> 00:46:41,203
He said that it was the place...

1110
00:46:41,204 --> 00:46:42,803
- It was a special place? - that made their date special.

1111
00:46:42,804 --> 00:46:44,374
It sounded like that when he said that.

1112
00:46:44,604 --> 00:46:47,073
He just talked about how special the place made their date...

1113
00:46:47,074 --> 00:46:49,114
instead of talking about his feelings about her.

1114
00:46:49,214 --> 00:46:53,344
I guess that's all that he feels for now.

1115
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:57,683
But when Sang Hyeon was on a date with the other women,

1116
00:46:57,684 --> 00:46:58,753
he couldn't make eye contact with them.

1117
00:46:58,754 --> 00:47:01,093
- He kept looking down at the floor. - Right. He wasn't like that today.

1118
00:47:01,094 --> 00:47:02,723
- He seemed very relaxed. - He didn't act that way.

1119
00:47:02,724 --> 00:47:03,924
He seemed most relaxed so far.

1120
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,870
- He seemed most relaxed so far. - Oh, I didn't realize that.

1121
00:47:05,894 --> 00:47:08,533
When their date was over, he said he was sad...

1122
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,270
they couldn't ride T Express and everything.

1123
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,163
He seemed very disappointed...

1124
00:47:12,164 --> 00:47:14,703
that their date was over so early, saying they couldn't ride it.

1125
00:47:14,704 --> 00:47:17,704
And he said they had a reason to go back there sometime.

1126
00:47:17,904 --> 00:47:19,443
I think he said those things...

1127
00:47:19,444 --> 00:47:21,204
- because he was interested in her. - I see.

1128
00:47:21,374 --> 00:47:22,494
The thought crossed my mind.

1129
00:47:24,444 --> 00:47:26,214
- Oh, right. - There are 2 men, not just 1.

1130
00:47:26,714 --> 00:47:32,354
(They're running to feel less sad?)

1131
00:47:32,454 --> 00:47:33,523
(High five!)

1132
00:47:33,524 --> 00:47:34,524
Oh, my.

1133
00:47:35,124 --> 00:47:38,164
My goodness. I can't believe this. He's shirtless again.

1134
00:47:38,424 --> 00:47:40,394
The two of them look good together.

1135
00:47:42,664 --> 00:47:45,934
That's good. Way to go. They are enjoying themselves.

1136
00:47:46,034 --> 00:47:47,234
My goodness.

1137
00:47:47,434 --> 00:47:49,674
- I'm so glad they're doing that. - I feel bad for them.

1138
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:53,004
- That's good. Hold it. Okay. - You should make most of your time.

1139
00:47:53,344 --> 00:47:54,373
Nice.

1140
00:47:54,374 --> 00:47:55,673
(The physical pain will make their emotional pain go away.)

1141
00:47:55,674 --> 00:47:57,144
They're forcing themselves to smile.

1142
00:47:57,244 --> 00:47:59,513
They made themselves feel better by exercising.

1143
00:47:59,514 --> 00:48:00,874
(Now shall we wait for the girls?)

1144
00:48:01,184 --> 00:48:05,083
(A small art gallery in the mountain in Gangwon Province)

1145
00:48:05,084 --> 00:48:06,154
An art gallery?

1146
00:48:08,354 --> 00:48:10,523
(And there is an older woman...)

1147
00:48:10,524 --> 00:48:14,063
(who's waiting for a younger man...)

1148
00:48:14,064 --> 00:48:17,864
(in the art gallery.)

1149
00:48:19,304 --> 00:48:22,574
(A car is coming up toward the art gallery.)

1150
00:48:24,844 --> 00:48:30,043
(The younger man arrives at the art gallery.)

1151
00:48:30,044 --> 00:48:35,084
(It's Mu Jin.)

1152
00:48:37,454 --> 00:48:40,993
She seemed different from now. She looked younger.

1153
00:48:40,994 --> 00:48:41,994
(She seemed different and younger in her photo.)

1154
00:48:41,995 --> 00:48:44,315
Since I heard it was a place where she made good memories,

1155
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:46,023
I looked forward to our date.

1156
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:47,494
And I was curious about the place.

1157
00:48:50,434 --> 00:48:55,574
(Chun Sung Myung)

1158
00:48:59,274 --> 00:49:01,714
(Looking around)

1159
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:15,524
(He smiles as soon as he sees her.)

1160
00:49:21,927 --> 00:49:24,737
(He smiles as soon as he sees her.)

1161
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:30,406
(The girl in the photo that was in Mu Jin's drawer)

1162
00:49:30,407 --> 00:49:33,846
(Bon Hee)

1163
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:35,346
They see each other every day at home.

1164
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,787
But seeing each other outside must make their hearts flutter.

1165
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:41,780
- Hello. - You're here.

1166
00:49:42,017 --> 00:49:43,957
(He's simply happy.)

1167
00:49:44,337 --> 00:49:45,439
- Did you wait long? - Sorry?

1168
00:49:45,463 --> 00:49:47,333
- Did you wait long? - No, just a little bit.

1169
00:49:47,857 --> 00:49:49,327
I didn't wait long.

1170
00:49:49,927 --> 00:49:51,673
Shall we sit for a while before looking around?

1171
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,697
- Okay. - Okay.

1172
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,813
I opened my drawer and found this photo.

1173
00:49:59,256 --> 00:50:00,366
Was this photo taken here?

1174
00:50:01,507 --> 00:50:03,937
- In this building. Yes. - In this building?

1175
00:50:05,807 --> 00:50:09,147
How did you feel when you saw this photo?

1176
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:11,547
I'm so embarrassed.

1177
00:50:11,847 --> 00:50:14,087
- When I opened the drawer? - Yes, how did you feel?

1178
00:50:14,487 --> 00:50:16,486
- I was like, "Finally." - "Finally?"

1179
00:50:16,487 --> 00:50:17,517
It felt good.

1180
00:50:20,357 --> 00:50:23,227
I thought, "I can finally go on a date with Bon Hee."

1181
00:50:24,697 --> 00:50:26,627
Mu Jin is aggressive as he always is.

1182
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:29,297
(Embarrassed)

1183
00:50:29,937 --> 00:50:31,137
- Shall we go now? - Okay.

1184
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:34,007
(Looking carefully)

1185
00:50:34,507 --> 00:50:35,806
You brought your camera?

1186
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:37,577
I brought my film camera.

1187
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:41,777
Being back in this place makes me feel...

1188
00:50:42,847 --> 00:50:44,487
- Does it bring back old memories? - Yes.

1189
00:50:46,717 --> 00:50:50,217
I came to Chuncheon on a trip with my older sister.

1190
00:50:51,117 --> 00:50:53,317
And we came to this gallery. I really liked this place.

1191
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:55,187
It was before I opened my own studio.

1192
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:56,497
I see.

1193
00:50:58,163 --> 00:51:00,133
How do you feel coming back here?

1194
00:51:01,427 --> 00:51:03,936
It reminds me of the time...

1195
00:51:03,937 --> 00:51:07,267
when I was preparing to open my studio.

1196
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,707
I also remember how I felt then.

1197
00:51:12,077 --> 00:51:15,207
I heard it was a meaningful place for you, so I was curious.

1198
00:51:19,547 --> 00:51:22,846
This is where the photo was taken.

1199
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,086
- Oh, it was taken here? - Yes.

1200
00:51:24,087 --> 00:51:26,557
(They found the spot where her old photo was taken.)

1201
00:51:27,687 --> 00:51:29,127
- Can I see the photo? - Sure.

1202
00:51:31,897 --> 00:51:34,127
- I think it was here. - So this is it?

1203
00:51:34,667 --> 00:51:36,467
Yes. Looking at this spot, I remember it now.

1204
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:39,167
I feel that it was here.

1205
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,800
Shall I take a photo of you at the same spot?

1206
00:51:42,986 --> 00:51:44,402
Do you think you can use the camera?

1207
00:51:44,426 --> 00:51:45,606
- Yes, I'll do it. - Really?

1208
00:51:45,607 --> 00:51:47,876
Then I'll show you how to do it.

1209
00:51:47,877 --> 00:51:49,576
- Show me. - Okay.

1210
00:51:49,577 --> 00:51:51,817
First, you should adjust the horizontal axis.

1211
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:55,217
I'll set the aperture for you.

1212
00:51:55,747 --> 00:51:58,016
You can just push this button in the middle.

1213
00:51:58,017 --> 00:51:59,987
- I just have to push it once? - Yes.

1214
00:52:00,187 --> 00:52:01,227
How about you try it?

1215
00:52:01,427 --> 00:52:03,157
I set everything for you.

1216
00:52:04,057 --> 00:52:05,526
How should I hold it to make myself look good?

1217
00:52:05,527 --> 00:52:07,597
Support the bottom of the camera like this.

1218
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:11,366
Hold the lens with your fingers like this.

1219
00:52:11,367 --> 00:52:12,436
(A photographer's tip on how to hold a camera to make yourself look good)

1220
00:52:12,437 --> 00:52:13,597
- I'll give it a try. - Okay.

1221
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:16,067
- Like this? - That's right.

1222
00:52:18,777 --> 00:52:21,646
- Their vibes match, right? - Right.

1223
00:52:21,647 --> 00:52:23,277
- Can you see? - Yes, I can see.

1224
00:52:23,617 --> 00:52:25,717
- Shall I stand there now? - Yes, go ahead.

1225
00:52:29,117 --> 00:52:30,917
Here? Shall I stand here?

1226
00:52:32,057 --> 00:52:34,027
(He sees Bon Hee inside the frame.)

1227
00:52:35,927 --> 00:52:37,457
You look like a good photographer.

1228
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:39,667
(Chuckling)

1229
00:52:39,827 --> 00:52:41,797
You look perfect now.

1230
00:52:42,497 --> 00:52:43,897
Perfect? Okay.

1231
00:52:44,937 --> 00:52:46,097
- I'll take it. - Okay.

1232
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:50,107
One, two, three.

1233
00:52:51,037 --> 00:52:54,077
(She poses, holding her old photo.)

1234
00:52:54,247 --> 00:52:56,947
- I hope it will come out great. - I'm sure it will.

1235
00:52:58,377 --> 00:53:00,046
My, Bon Hee looks so pretty.

1236
00:53:00,047 --> 00:53:02,127
(Bon Hee in the old days, on a trip with her family)

1237
00:53:02,217 --> 00:53:04,586
- He did a great job. - He took the photo well.

1238
00:53:04,587 --> 00:53:06,307
(Bon Hee in the photo Mu Jin took just now)

1239
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:09,286
"I'm taking a photo of you taking a photo of me."

1240
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:12,087
(She made a good memory with Mu Jin at the place in her old memories.)

1241
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,567
- It's so nice. - Indeed.

1242
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:19,267
I can see that autumn has come. The sky is so clear.

1243
00:53:22,107 --> 00:53:24,477
When they designed this building...

1244
00:53:25,177 --> 00:53:28,047
They made it round, which symbolizes the moon.

1245
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,947
- It symbolizes the moon? - Yes.

1246
00:53:30,147 --> 00:53:34,347
There's a light on the edge, which is turned on at night.

1247
00:53:35,117 --> 00:53:36,487
- It would look splendid. - Yes.

1248
00:53:37,317 --> 00:53:39,587
Shall we come back here at night...

1249
00:53:40,287 --> 00:53:41,487
- Sounds great. - sometime?

1250
00:53:43,297 --> 00:53:44,627
Was that a flirty comment?

1251
00:53:44,727 --> 00:53:46,796
- Yes, it was explicit. - "Shall we come at night?"

1252
00:53:46,797 --> 00:53:47,837
This place is really nice.

1253
00:53:48,027 --> 00:53:49,897
You smell really good today.

1254
00:53:49,997 --> 00:53:53,707
I applied hair essence. It may be the scent of it.

1255
00:53:54,637 --> 00:53:57,776
- Anything you want to teach me? - Like what?

1256
00:53:57,777 --> 00:54:00,477
I taught you how to use a film camera.

1257
00:54:01,107 --> 00:54:02,147
It could be your hobby.

1258
00:54:02,347 --> 00:54:04,187
- My hobby? - Trivial things would do as well.

1259
00:54:07,017 --> 00:54:10,556
I want to hike or run with my future girlfriend.

1260
00:54:10,557 --> 00:54:12,357
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1261
00:54:13,457 --> 00:54:14,927
Where do you run?

1262
00:54:15,027 --> 00:54:16,087
- Where do I run? - Yes.

1263
00:54:16,857 --> 00:54:19,597
I usually run in my neighborhood or along the river.

1264
00:54:20,797 --> 00:54:22,437
I guess I should go to your neighborhood.

1265
00:54:23,537 --> 00:54:27,737
I could go to Seoul to run with you along the Han River.

1266
00:54:28,867 --> 00:54:29,937
What about hiking?

1267
00:54:30,037 --> 00:54:32,076
Hiking would be really nice.

1268
00:54:32,077 --> 00:54:33,877
It'd be really nice if we go hiking together.

1269
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:35,876
I thought of hiking too.

1270
00:54:35,877 --> 00:54:38,547
Since I was 20,

1271
00:54:40,587 --> 00:54:44,217
I've been dreaming of climbing Mount Halla with my future husband.

1272
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,986
I used to tell my sisters such things like that.

1273
00:54:47,987 --> 00:54:49,057
I see.

1274
00:54:49,427 --> 00:54:52,627
- I climbed Mount Halla once. - I think I did so.

1275
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,027
It was so exhausting.

1276
00:54:54,597 --> 00:54:57,736
I thought that unless my future wife or my father-in-law...

1277
00:54:57,737 --> 00:55:00,107
- Your father-in-law? - I mean, my future father-in-law.

1278
00:55:00,507 --> 00:55:03,177
Unless they ask me to climb Mount Halla...

1279
00:55:03,937 --> 00:55:06,537
- You'd never go back there? - Yes, I thought I'd never go there.

1280
00:55:09,747 --> 00:55:13,317
But if you want, I'll climb Mount Halla with you.

1281
00:55:22,957 --> 00:55:24,097
A metal workshop?

1282
00:55:24,827 --> 00:55:28,297
Last time we came here, I wanted to try this.

1283
00:55:28,927 --> 00:55:31,237
But this was closed back then.

1284
00:55:32,297 --> 00:55:33,836
- So, we came to do it today. - Yes.

1285
00:55:33,837 --> 00:55:36,677
(Metal workshop)

1286
00:55:37,737 --> 00:55:38,906
Is it a metal workshop?

1287
00:55:38,907 --> 00:55:40,877
(A metal workshop located under an art museum)

1288
00:55:42,077 --> 00:55:45,146
You can make something yourself and take it home.

1289
00:55:45,147 --> 00:55:46,276
(A place where you can make couple's items...)

1290
00:55:46,277 --> 00:55:47,486
(like necklaces, bracelets, or rings)

1291
00:55:47,487 --> 00:55:48,916
You can look at what you want to try...

1292
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:51,317
and tell me once you've decided.

1293
00:55:52,257 --> 00:55:54,127
You can decide what you want to do.

1294
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:55,767
- Something I want to do? - Yes.

1295
00:55:56,727 --> 00:55:59,047
- Couple's rings, of course. - They're even getting rings?

1296
00:55:59,967 --> 00:56:04,597
(Contemplating)

1297
00:56:04,967 --> 00:56:06,836
Bracelets, rings...

1298
00:56:06,837 --> 00:56:08,037
Go for the rings!

1299
00:56:08,607 --> 00:56:10,976
- Don't do a necklace. - Wouldn't a bracelet be better?

1300
00:56:10,977 --> 00:56:13,497
(Thinking for a long time since it's their first couple's item)

1301
00:56:14,447 --> 00:56:15,447
Rings?

1302
00:56:16,047 --> 00:56:17,117
Okay.

1303
00:56:17,547 --> 00:56:18,577
Oh, rings.

1304
00:56:18,947 --> 00:56:20,287
Isn't that too obvious?

1305
00:56:20,987 --> 00:56:21,987
Good!

1306
00:56:21,988 --> 00:56:23,587
- Why would you get rings? - Good!

1307
00:56:24,057 --> 00:56:25,117
Indeed.

1308
00:56:26,357 --> 00:56:27,926
(Rings?)

1309
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:29,127
(Okay!)

1310
00:56:30,197 --> 00:56:32,457
Sir, we'll go with rings.

1311
00:56:32,897 --> 00:56:34,197
- Rings? - Yes.

1312
00:56:34,527 --> 00:56:37,766
A ring has a different meaning,

1313
00:56:37,767 --> 00:56:39,137
compared to other accessories.

1314
00:56:39,907 --> 00:56:42,437
Sharing something for the first time...

1315
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:46,647
is memorable, and I'm very aware of that.

1316
00:56:47,277 --> 00:56:49,447
I think it's meaningful for me too.

1317
00:56:50,917 --> 00:56:54,487
I actually thought he obviously wouldn't choose rings,

1318
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:58,057
so I gave him other choices on purpose.

1319
00:56:58,717 --> 00:57:01,357
But he chose rings, which I was kind of surprised about.

1320
00:57:02,387 --> 00:57:04,157
I think it felt weird.

1321
00:57:04,697 --> 00:57:06,777
Of course it feels weird if you make rings together.

1322
00:57:08,697 --> 00:57:10,797
- Try it on. - Wait, okay, let's try them on.

1323
00:57:12,037 --> 00:57:13,597
Which finger do you want to wear it on?

1324
00:57:15,137 --> 00:57:17,876
I think I'll see my index finger when I take photos.

1325
00:57:17,877 --> 00:57:20,346
So, I want to wear it on this one. I press the shutter with it.

1326
00:57:20,347 --> 00:57:22,106
- Oh, as she presses the shutter, - Can you help me?

1327
00:57:22,107 --> 00:57:23,747
- it'll be shiny, right? - Like that?

1328
00:57:25,517 --> 00:57:27,787
We got texts. I'll read it first.

1329
00:57:28,617 --> 00:57:30,816
(It's a day to grow closer to one another.)

1330
00:57:30,817 --> 00:57:35,227
(Please speak casually, including the way you address each other.)

1331
00:57:35,727 --> 00:57:38,196
It says we have to address each other casually.

1332
00:57:38,197 --> 00:57:39,396
- "Please speak casually," - Yes.

1333
00:57:39,397 --> 00:57:40,726
"including the way you address each other."

1334
00:57:40,727 --> 00:57:42,166
- I think Mu Jin will do fine. - Right.

1335
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,167
- I know, right? - Yes.

1336
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,936
I usually don't speak casually.

1337
00:57:45,937 --> 00:57:47,437
I speak with honorifics...

1338
00:57:48,367 --> 00:57:50,237
even to my employees.

1339
00:57:52,107 --> 00:57:53,377
Speak comfortably.

1340
00:57:54,507 --> 00:57:55,777
What should we do?

1341
00:57:56,207 --> 00:57:57,417
I will try.

1342
00:57:57,717 --> 00:57:59,477
- Can you do it? - I'll try.

1343
00:58:00,887 --> 00:58:02,686
I may not speak that much, but...

1344
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:03,786
(Giggling)

1345
00:58:03,787 --> 00:58:06,017
I may speak less, but you have to understand.

1346
00:58:06,657 --> 00:58:08,057
I'll try. I can do it.

1347
00:58:08,987 --> 00:58:10,726
How we address each other? We have to decide.

1348
00:58:10,727 --> 00:58:11,797
How we address each other?

1349
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:14,097
I just...

1350
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:16,497
prefer calling each other by name.

1351
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:20,237
I think I'd be most comfortable with calling you Mu Jin.

1352
00:58:20,407 --> 00:58:21,566
How should I address you?

1353
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,066
Sang Hyeon called So Hyun, "You."

1354
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:24,177
Should we do the same?

1355
00:58:24,537 --> 00:58:25,607
- Just Bon Hee? - Yes.

1356
00:58:25,907 --> 00:58:28,107
(Embarrassed after saying it himself)

1357
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,147
Do you not like being called "Noona?"

1358
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:34,946
I like being called by name the most.

1359
00:58:34,947 --> 00:58:36,017
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1360
00:58:36,587 --> 00:58:38,016
We don't like being called "Noona."

1361
00:58:38,017 --> 00:58:40,327
- I like being called "Noona." - I don't like it.

1362
00:58:40,787 --> 00:58:42,486
From the man's perspective,

1363
00:58:42,487 --> 00:58:45,996
do you usually call a woman "Noona" if you're interested in her?

1364
00:58:45,997 --> 00:58:47,167
What do you guys think?

1365
00:58:47,327 --> 00:58:48,896
Wouldn't I naturally call her "Noona?"

1366
00:58:48,897 --> 00:58:50,036
Even if you like her?

1367
00:58:50,037 --> 00:58:51,136
- Doesn't it matter? - No.

1368
00:58:51,137 --> 00:58:52,236
Regardless of your feelings for her,

1369
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,566
- you just call her, "Noona?" - Yes.

1370
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,436
Even if you go on a date with her,

1371
00:58:55,437 --> 00:58:56,666
- you still call her "Noona?" - Yes.

1372
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:58,983
I would call her "Noona" even when I date her and marry her.

1373
00:58:59,007 --> 00:59:00,747
- Right. - Until you die?

1374
00:59:00,977 --> 00:59:03,616
Even when you're 80 years old, you'll go, "Noona?"

1375
00:59:03,617 --> 00:59:04,617
I think I would.

1376
00:59:04,618 --> 00:59:05,817
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1377
00:59:06,077 --> 00:59:07,186
What about you, Woo Young?

1378
00:59:07,187 --> 00:59:10,256
I think I would use whatever my partner is comfortable with.

1379
00:59:10,257 --> 00:59:12,616
If she says, "I don't like Noona. Call me something else," then...

1380
00:59:12,617 --> 00:59:14,957
Then, I'd cater to you. Yes.

1381
00:59:15,887 --> 00:59:17,896
- I would cater to you. - What do you mean, cater to me?

1382
00:59:17,897 --> 00:59:19,257
What do you feel comfortable with?

1383
00:59:19,827 --> 00:59:20,997
I would cater to you.

1384
00:59:21,697 --> 00:59:24,637
What? Ms. Han? Or like... I would cater to you.

1385
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:28,207
- Then, I'll call you Bon Hee. - Okay.

1386
00:59:30,007 --> 00:59:33,237
(Feeling shy for some reason)

1387
00:59:35,107 --> 00:59:36,207
- From here? - From here...

1388
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:38,017
Have you ever made a ring before?

1389
00:59:38,717 --> 00:59:39,847
A ring?

1390
00:59:39,947 --> 00:59:41,886
A ring? A long time ago.

1391
00:59:41,887 --> 00:59:43,117
- A long time ago? - Yes.

1392
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:48,087
I've never had couple's rings before.

1393
00:59:48,287 --> 00:59:49,786
- Really? - I've never had one before.

1394
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:51,256
(Really?)

1395
00:59:51,257 --> 00:59:53,377
I've never worn couple's T-shirts or anything either.

1396
00:59:54,227 --> 00:59:55,467
Really?

1397
00:59:57,867 --> 00:59:59,367
So, this is your first couple's ring?

1398
01:00:01,507 --> 01:00:03,637
Why didn't you have one until now?

1399
01:00:05,137 --> 01:00:07,507
(Curious)

1400
01:00:09,747 --> 01:00:11,416
I wanted to get one when I got married.

1401
01:00:11,417 --> 01:00:13,717
(I wanted to get one when I got married.)

1402
01:00:14,947 --> 01:00:18,087
(Laughing)

1403
01:00:18,557 --> 01:00:20,686
So, couple's rings had meaning for you.

1404
01:00:20,687 --> 01:00:21,687
Yes.

1405
01:00:24,327 --> 01:00:26,827
I don't think I've dated anyone I wanted to share one with.

1406
01:00:29,697 --> 01:00:31,567
Then, these are very meaningful rings.

1407
01:00:31,737 --> 01:00:34,937
Then, does this mean she is considering marriage with Mu Jin?

1408
01:00:36,607 --> 01:00:38,337
Should we make one for each other?

1409
01:00:38,537 --> 01:00:40,407
(Nodding)

1410
01:00:44,447 --> 01:00:46,207
- That's good, right? - You're good at this.

1411
01:00:46,577 --> 01:00:47,687
This is fun.

1412
01:00:47,787 --> 01:00:50,347
- It's more fun than I thought. - A lot more fun than I thought.

1413
01:00:51,087 --> 01:00:52,116
(Slipping)

1414
01:00:52,117 --> 01:00:53,187
What?

1415
01:00:54,087 --> 01:00:55,887
Gosh, I almost made a huge mistake.

1416
01:00:57,757 --> 01:01:00,427
I think it's fun to make mistakes, though.

1417
01:01:02,167 --> 01:01:03,297
Because...

1418
01:01:03,837 --> 01:01:04,866
Because?

1419
01:01:04,867 --> 01:01:07,387
I think I'll remember you making a mistake every time I see it.

1420
01:01:08,507 --> 01:01:09,967
Rather than being so good at this.

1421
01:01:12,237 --> 01:01:14,546
Bon Hee herself is...

1422
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:16,846
- giving the ring a lot of meaning. - Right.

1423
01:01:16,847 --> 01:01:19,487
(Making couple's rings with Bon Hee and Mu Jin's memories in them)

1424
01:01:20,317 --> 01:01:22,217
So, that's how they're made.

1425
01:01:23,317 --> 01:01:26,817
You chose sizes 15 and 18, right?

1426
01:01:27,087 --> 01:01:28,687
I have skinny fingers.

1427
01:01:29,557 --> 01:01:31,497
You have pretty hands.

1428
01:01:32,157 --> 01:01:33,397
- Are they? - Yes.

1429
01:01:34,627 --> 01:01:36,197
Noona, your hands are pretty too.

1430
01:01:37,637 --> 01:01:39,537
- Sorry? - Your hands are pretty too.

1431
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:42,937
(Shy)

1432
01:01:46,407 --> 01:01:50,717
Mu Jin called me "Noona" for the first time.

1433
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:52,477
At the time, I...

1434
01:01:54,217 --> 01:01:56,086
It kind of felt real for the first time.

1435
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,087
Really?

1436
01:01:57,088 --> 01:02:00,727
Until now, I was kind of immersed in the emotions from before.

1437
01:02:01,227 --> 01:02:05,696
I was just happy and having fun.

1438
01:02:05,697 --> 01:02:07,667
- But earlier, - She must've been taken aback.

1439
01:02:07,797 --> 01:02:09,896
I had so many thoughts in my head about Mu Jin.

1440
01:02:09,897 --> 01:02:10,936
This is huge.

1441
01:02:10,937 --> 01:02:14,507
Because I have a younger brother who's much younger than me.

1442
01:02:15,907 --> 01:02:18,907
In that case... I am attracted to Mu Jin,

1443
01:02:19,677 --> 01:02:22,306
but will we really be okay once we learn about our ages?

1444
01:02:22,307 --> 01:02:25,347
I still have that thought.

1445
01:02:26,217 --> 01:02:27,846
We can just think about dating,

1446
01:02:27,847 --> 01:02:30,716
but I'm usually the type who considers marriage as I date.

1447
01:02:30,717 --> 01:02:32,516
- She's very careful and serious. - So,

1448
01:02:32,517 --> 01:02:35,726
later on, when our ages are finally revealed,

1449
01:02:35,727 --> 01:02:37,697
will we be okay? I'm curious about that myself.

1450
01:02:40,157 --> 01:02:44,237
(Bon Hee has a rush of emotions upon hearing the word "Noona.")

1451
01:02:44,997 --> 01:02:46,267
- Let's try them on. - Okay.

1452
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:51,376
(Slipping it on)

1453
01:02:51,377 --> 01:02:52,577
- It's just... - Perfect.

1454
01:02:52,807 --> 01:02:53,977
It fits perfectly for me too.

1455
01:02:56,807 --> 01:02:59,677
They're really pretty. I like them.

1456
01:03:00,017 --> 01:03:02,187
- Do you like them? - Yes, they're so pretty.

1457
01:03:02,347 --> 01:03:04,617
- We should take a photo. - Okay.

1458
01:03:05,787 --> 01:03:07,657
Crossed? Like this?

1459
01:03:09,487 --> 01:03:11,456
We both have pretty hands.

1460
01:03:11,457 --> 01:03:12,726
Yes, they're pretty.

1461
01:03:12,727 --> 01:03:14,627
- Like this? - In 1, 2, 3.

1462
01:03:16,867 --> 01:03:18,367
- They look good on us. - Yes.

1463
01:03:18,937 --> 01:03:20,037
They're so pretty.

1464
01:03:20,567 --> 01:03:23,706
By the way, if they wear those back to Yeon House, there will be chaos.

1465
01:03:23,707 --> 01:03:25,537
Sang Hyeon might feel heartbroken.

1466
01:03:25,807 --> 01:03:29,147
Is being called "Noona" such a shocking incident?

1467
01:03:31,477 --> 01:03:33,047
I know. I feel the same way.

1468
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:34,316
- Right? - Yes.

1469
01:03:34,317 --> 01:03:37,587
Gosh, this is... It's simply...

1470
01:03:38,217 --> 01:03:41,857
It's not like a pet name. You're just addressing someone.

1471
01:03:42,087 --> 01:03:44,527
It's a way to address someone, but suddenly, from that...

1472
01:03:45,127 --> 01:03:47,967
Like, all of a sudden, she seems to have woken up.

1473
01:03:48,267 --> 01:03:50,367
"How many years are we apart?"

1474
01:03:50,537 --> 01:03:52,366
"When I hear this man's age,"

1475
01:03:52,367 --> 01:03:54,736
"will I still be able to feel attracted to him?"

1476
01:03:54,737 --> 01:03:56,437
I think I've felt that way before too.

1477
01:03:56,737 --> 01:03:58,236
Not in a relationship,

1478
01:03:58,237 --> 01:04:00,577
but when someone is expressing his interest in me.

1479
01:04:00,807 --> 01:04:03,917
I also want to date with marriage in mind,

1480
01:04:04,147 --> 01:04:05,646
but I wondered, "Can I just date casually like this?"

1481
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:08,817
It made me sensitive about even the smallest things.

1482
01:04:11,487 --> 01:04:13,857
(Mount Nam)

1483
01:04:14,687 --> 01:04:17,797
(Holding a ticket for the cable cars in her hand, )

1484
01:04:18,297 --> 01:04:21,627
(the older woman waits for her date on Mount Nam, a memory location.)

1485
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:26,596
(And a younger man comes to Mount Nam.)

1486
01:04:26,597 --> 01:04:27,907
Finally, Sang Won...

1487
01:04:29,537 --> 01:04:31,407
- Ji Won? - What?

1488
01:04:31,907 --> 01:04:38,046
(The 1st of 2 photos in Sang Won's drawer)

1489
01:04:38,047 --> 01:04:40,247
(Ji Won)

1490
01:04:40,887 --> 01:04:43,647
(Ji Won greets Sang Won with a bright smile.)

1491
01:04:45,287 --> 01:04:47,356
- This is from you, right? - It is.

1492
01:04:47,357 --> 01:04:49,157
How old is this photo?

1493
01:04:49,687 --> 01:04:51,657
- How long ago was this taken? - Yes.

1494
01:04:52,057 --> 01:04:55,296
This was in my early 20s.

1495
01:04:55,297 --> 01:04:56,527
- Early 20s? - Yes.

1496
01:04:57,167 --> 01:05:00,767
(The photo in Sang Won's drawer is of Ji Won in her 20s.)

1497
01:05:01,107 --> 01:05:03,907
I mean, it's obviously you,

1498
01:05:04,807 --> 01:05:06,047
but the quality of the photo...

1499
01:05:07,577 --> 01:05:09,906
Well, the quality...

1500
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:11,177
- Is that so? - A bit.

1501
01:05:11,877 --> 01:05:12,976
By the way, wasn't it hot?

1502
01:05:12,977 --> 01:05:14,186
- It's hot right now. - It is, right?

1503
01:05:14,187 --> 01:05:15,346
You should have some of this.

1504
01:05:15,347 --> 01:05:17,887
- Can I have this? - Yes, you can.

1505
01:05:18,157 --> 01:05:19,157
(Sang Won brought beverages to share with Ji Won.)

1506
01:05:19,158 --> 01:05:21,086
Did you bring these tumblers?

1507
01:05:21,087 --> 01:05:23,357
- Yes, I brought some drinks. - They're cute.

1508
01:05:23,957 --> 01:05:25,997
- Can we drink them now? - Oh, that's how it works.

1509
01:05:26,397 --> 01:05:27,397
(Satisfied)

1510
01:05:27,397 --> 01:05:28,397
It's nice and cool.

1511
01:05:30,067 --> 01:05:32,896
I had said I was curious about Sang Won...

1512
01:05:32,897 --> 01:05:34,707
and Yang Ji Yung.

1513
01:05:34,867 --> 01:05:39,377
Last night, I spoke with Ji Yung for a bit.

1514
01:05:40,847 --> 01:05:46,716
(Ji Yung had been honest about wanting to focus on So Hyun.)

1515
01:05:46,717 --> 01:05:50,957
From his answer, I just made up my mind right away.

1516
01:05:51,617 --> 01:05:55,557
I only want to talk more with Sang Won now,

1517
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:58,057
and I want to get to know him more.

1518
01:05:58,727 --> 01:06:01,167
I just hope Sang Won doesn't ruin it.

1519
01:06:02,027 --> 01:06:04,267
(Concerned about Sang Won)

1520
01:06:05,037 --> 01:06:07,506
Then, are we going up on the cable car now?

1521
01:06:07,507 --> 01:06:10,406
- Yes, I got us a ticket. - Oh, thank you.

1522
01:06:10,407 --> 01:06:12,136
So, we can take that up.

1523
01:06:12,137 --> 01:06:13,237
For two?

1524
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:14,447
Where are we going?

1525
01:06:19,277 --> 01:06:20,277
Thank you.

1526
01:06:22,147 --> 01:06:24,987
"Please speak casually, including the way you address each other.

1527
01:06:25,457 --> 01:06:27,633
- How we address each other? - How we address each other?

1528
01:06:27,657 --> 01:06:28,657
What should I call you?

1529
01:06:28,657 --> 01:06:29,657
(Staring into her eyes)

1530
01:06:29,787 --> 01:06:31,957
What should I call you? How we address each other?

1531
01:06:32,497 --> 01:06:33,826
Our names both end in Won.

1532
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:35,566
- I know, I thought about that too. - Won and Won...

1533
01:06:35,567 --> 01:06:37,026
- Oh, Sang Won and Ji Won? - Shall we just...

1534
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:39,896
- call each other Won? - Oh, for each other?

1535
01:06:39,897 --> 01:06:41,736
- Won. What do you think? - Nice.

1536
01:06:41,737 --> 01:06:43,536
I like it. Then, starting right now?

1537
01:06:43,537 --> 01:06:44,637
- What? - Casual mode.

1538
01:06:45,537 --> 01:06:46,906
- Let's try. - Let's do it.

1539
01:06:46,907 --> 01:06:48,507
- Okay. - Let's go.

1540
01:06:48,607 --> 01:06:49,706
Won, shall we go?

1541
01:06:49,707 --> 01:06:50,747
Let's go.

1542
01:06:51,047 --> 01:06:53,746
- Shall we go to ride the cable car? - Let's go.

1543
01:06:53,747 --> 01:06:55,786
- All right. - Ji Won leads a man so well.

1544
01:06:55,787 --> 01:06:56,916
(Won and Won start their Mount Nam date.)

1545
01:06:56,917 --> 01:06:59,687
My, we're riding the cable car. I'm excited.

1546
01:07:00,087 --> 01:07:01,257
It's nice.

1547
01:07:01,757 --> 01:07:02,757
(The cable car goes up to the top of Mount Nam.)

1548
01:07:02,758 --> 01:07:04,797
It's really nice. This is fascinating.

1549
01:07:07,497 --> 01:07:08,597
How beautiful.

1550
01:07:08,697 --> 01:07:10,497
I've never ridden it before in my whole life.

1551
01:07:10,537 --> 01:07:11,666
- Really? - Yes.

1552
01:07:11,667 --> 01:07:13,797
I don't think I've ever ridden a cable car here.

1553
01:07:14,137 --> 01:07:15,743
I think this is my first time coming here.

1554
01:07:15,767 --> 01:07:17,537
This is the date I wanted to go on.

1555
01:07:25,677 --> 01:07:28,587
(Impressed)

1556
01:07:29,617 --> 01:07:30,756
- It's beautiful. - I mean,

1557
01:07:30,757 --> 01:07:32,486
- thank you for taking me here. - Do you mean that?

1558
01:07:32,487 --> 01:07:34,207
- I'm at Mount Nam thanks to you. - Really?

1559
01:07:34,457 --> 01:07:35,557
I mean it.

1560
01:07:35,657 --> 01:07:37,596
I've never had a chance to enjoy a scenery like this.

1561
01:07:37,597 --> 01:07:39,597
I planned this date.

1562
01:07:39,757 --> 01:07:41,266
This is so nice. I'm really excited.

1563
01:07:41,267 --> 01:07:42,567
- Really? - Really.

1564
01:07:43,127 --> 01:07:45,367
- My, the view here is beautiful. - Indeed.

1565
01:07:46,837 --> 01:07:48,806
- I don't think I've seen it before. - Exactly.

1566
01:07:48,807 --> 01:07:50,513
I didn't know I could enjoy such a scenery here.

1567
01:07:50,537 --> 01:07:51,606
This is really nice.

1568
01:07:51,607 --> 01:07:52,753
(You can see Seoul at a glance on top of Mount Nam.)

1569
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,877
Thank you so much for coming here with me.

1570
01:07:54,907 --> 01:07:57,316
Don't say that. I should be thanking you.

1571
01:07:57,317 --> 01:08:00,446
While I was alone, waiting for you, I started to worry...

1572
01:08:00,447 --> 01:08:02,186
no one might come.

1573
01:08:02,187 --> 01:08:03,386
Is that possible?

1574
01:08:03,387 --> 01:08:05,516
- I thought it could be the case. - I see.

1575
01:08:05,517 --> 01:08:06,877
- You just thought vaguely? - Yes.

1576
01:08:07,017 --> 01:08:08,426
- I see. - So I thought...

1577
01:08:08,427 --> 01:08:10,896
- that I would take a selfie... - Take a selfie alone?

1578
01:08:10,897 --> 01:08:12,926
In front of the wall of locks just as I did in my old photo.

1579
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:15,596
I was going to take a selfie there and go back.

1580
01:08:15,597 --> 01:08:17,567
But then suddenly, you appeared behind me.

1581
01:08:18,167 --> 01:08:20,435
I heard you calling me.

1582
01:08:20,437 --> 01:08:21,636
(She was happy to hear his voice.)

1583
01:08:21,636 --> 01:08:22,937
I got excited that you came.

1584
01:08:23,737 --> 01:08:26,037
- Thank you for coming. - Sure.

1585
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:29,577
- Do you remember this day clearly? - Yes.

1586
01:08:29,707 --> 01:08:31,746
Yes. This is when I...

1587
01:08:31,747 --> 01:08:34,185
- I transferred to another college. - I see.

1588
01:08:34,187 --> 01:08:37,246
This is when I was studying for the transfer exam.

1589
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:40,587
I wanted to get some fresh air since all I did was study back then.

1590
01:08:40,857 --> 01:08:44,656
So I decided to come to Seoul Tower with a female friend.

1591
01:08:44,657 --> 01:08:46,956
- With a female friend? - Yes. I told myself...

1592
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:50,566
to become splendid just like Seoul Tower.

1593
01:08:50,567 --> 01:08:51,607
It made me think that way.

1594
01:08:51,767 --> 01:08:54,206
And right now, I'm studying to become a co-pilot.

1595
01:08:54,207 --> 01:08:56,305
- You're preparing to be one. - I'm preparing...

1596
01:08:56,307 --> 01:08:57,706
to become a co-pilot as I hope.

1597
01:08:57,707 --> 01:09:00,106
So I kind of have the same feelings I had when this photo was taken.

1598
01:09:00,107 --> 01:09:01,546
- You feel that way again. - Yes.

1599
01:09:01,546 --> 01:09:05,616
I want to see the splendid scenery...

1600
01:09:05,617 --> 01:09:07,645
- To boost your morale? - Yes, to boost my morale.

1601
01:09:07,647 --> 01:09:09,716
When you look back later in your life,

1602
01:09:09,716 --> 01:09:11,316
you'll realize how important...

1603
01:09:11,317 --> 01:09:12,993
the process of the preparation and planning for the future is.

1604
01:09:13,017 --> 01:09:14,687
We just don't realize it yet.

1605
01:09:15,687 --> 01:09:18,327
Don't think you're not splendid now.

1606
01:09:18,997 --> 01:09:20,256
You're shining brightly now.

1607
01:09:21,926 --> 01:09:23,127
You're shining brightly now.

1608
01:09:25,067 --> 01:09:26,736
- My, Sang Won impressed me. - How sweet.

1609
01:09:26,737 --> 01:09:27,737
(Impressed)

1610
01:09:27,738 --> 01:09:29,058
That's such a thoughtful comment.

1611
01:09:29,337 --> 01:09:30,406
He didn't ruin it.

1612
01:09:30,407 --> 01:09:32,407
- Doesn't he seem so attractive? - Of course.

1613
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:34,645
We've never seen him like this before.

1614
01:09:34,647 --> 01:09:35,977
Right. It's a new side of him.

1615
01:09:36,307 --> 01:09:38,346
I hope things will go well between the two of them.

1616
01:09:39,546 --> 01:09:44,316
(You're shining brightly now.)

1617
01:09:44,317 --> 01:09:45,616
(Touched)

1618
01:09:45,617 --> 01:09:46,933
Think that when you look in the mirror.

1619
01:09:46,957 --> 01:09:49,057
- The sun makes me shine right now. - Right.

1620
01:09:49,127 --> 01:09:51,157
Maybe it's your sweat that's sparkling in the sun.

1621
01:09:51,756 --> 01:09:53,897
- Can we go there to see it? - Let's do that.

1622
01:09:55,627 --> 01:09:57,027
This is really nice.

1623
01:09:57,537 --> 01:09:58,697
It's magnificent.

1624
01:09:59,437 --> 01:10:01,367
I'm so grateful toward you. I really mean it.

1625
01:10:01,537 --> 01:10:02,837
- Really? - It feels like...

1626
01:10:02,967 --> 01:10:04,813
I've been living in Seoul since I was a little boy.

1627
01:10:04,837 --> 01:10:08,647
But I rarely visit famous places like the Han River or Seoul Tower.

1628
01:10:08,777 --> 01:10:11,093
- You don't visit such places? - I rarely visit those places.

1629
01:10:11,117 --> 01:10:12,647
Have you ever visited Seosulla-gil?

1630
01:10:13,017 --> 01:10:14,516
- Yes, just once. - Really?

1631
01:10:14,517 --> 01:10:16,517
- Really? - Was it next to Jongmyo?

1632
01:10:16,717 --> 01:10:18,237
- I think it was. - Yes. That's right.

1633
01:10:18,917 --> 01:10:20,117
Have you visited there before?

1634
01:10:20,317 --> 01:10:21,926
- I'm going to. - You haven't?

1635
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:23,187
- With you. - "With you."

1636
01:10:23,927 --> 01:10:25,056
- Today? - No.

1637
01:10:25,057 --> 01:10:27,796
I was surprised. I thought we were going to Seosulla-gil...

1638
01:10:27,797 --> 01:10:29,127
after this.

1639
01:10:29,327 --> 01:10:31,736
No, that's not the case. Let's take some photos over there.

1640
01:10:31,737 --> 01:10:32,997
I want to save this memory.

1641
01:10:33,267 --> 01:10:34,667
- What do you say? - Let's do that.

1642
01:10:35,107 --> 01:10:36,606
I'm really good at taking photos.

1643
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:37,706
- You are? - Yes.

1644
01:10:37,707 --> 01:10:38,977
(Staying close together)

1645
01:10:39,477 --> 01:10:40,506
(He's so sweet. He blocks the sun for her.)

1646
01:10:40,507 --> 01:10:42,706
Look at this couple. They're so sweet.

1647
01:10:42,707 --> 01:10:43,846
This is unexpected.

1648
01:10:43,847 --> 01:10:45,007
You should take it like this.

1649
01:10:45,317 --> 01:10:46,947
Things are going so smoothly.

1650
01:10:47,177 --> 01:10:48,717
They seem so close to each other.

1651
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,217
I can't see it.

1652
01:10:50,387 --> 01:10:51,586
I hope things will go well between them.

1653
01:10:51,587 --> 01:10:53,116
(They take a selfie before the locks like in Ji Won's old photo.)

1654
01:10:53,117 --> 01:10:54,277
I'm rooting for the director.

1655
01:10:58,797 --> 01:11:01,727
(She came to Mount Nam alone when she was having a hard time.)

1656
01:11:02,067 --> 01:11:03,426
In the future, I can compare this...

1657
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:05,566
- to my old photo... - You can compare the photos.

1658
01:11:05,567 --> 01:11:07,707
- Sang Won caters to her too. - Right.

1659
01:11:07,737 --> 01:11:09,736
I hope I can come back here very soon.

1660
01:11:09,737 --> 01:11:12,037
Really? Will you let me come with you?

1661
01:11:12,077 --> 01:11:13,713
- Yes. We should come together. - Really?

1662
01:11:13,737 --> 01:11:15,537
I can't come here alone because it's too far.

1663
01:11:16,477 --> 01:11:17,616
Let's go up there.

1664
01:11:17,617 --> 01:11:19,216
- Can we go up there? - Yes.

1665
01:11:19,217 --> 01:11:20,887
What are we going to do next?

1666
01:11:21,317 --> 01:11:22,616
Do you like pork cutlet?

1667
01:11:22,617 --> 01:11:24,587
- I love it. Most men like it. - Oh, I see.

1668
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:29,557
The view is amazing.

1669
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,856
I've never heard about this place.

1670
01:11:31,857 --> 01:11:32,857
(The restaurant on top of Mount Nam with a wide-open view)

1671
01:11:32,858 --> 01:11:33,957
- It's beautiful. - Right.

1672
01:11:40,907 --> 01:11:42,536
(Hesitating)

1673
01:11:42,537 --> 01:11:44,497
I'm not sure if it's okay for me to ask you this.

1674
01:11:46,337 --> 01:11:47,876
Was each of you allowed to put in only one photo?

1675
01:11:47,877 --> 01:11:49,547
- Or several photos? - Only one photo.

1676
01:11:49,647 --> 01:11:50,877
- Really? - Yes.

1677
01:11:51,817 --> 01:11:52,846
- I put this in your drawer. - I see.

1678
01:11:52,847 --> 01:11:55,347
- You put it in my drawer? - Yes, I put it in there myself.

1679
01:11:55,687 --> 01:11:58,716
We were told you put our old photos in the drawer...

1680
01:11:58,717 --> 01:12:01,426
of the man we wanted to go on a date with.

1681
01:12:01,427 --> 01:12:03,456
(Sang Won found out that Ji Won chose him.)

1682
01:12:03,457 --> 01:12:05,697
- Oh, that's how it was decided. - Yes, that's how...

1683
01:12:06,327 --> 01:12:08,197
Did you have one photo in your drawer?

1684
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:11,197
There were two photos in my drawer.

1685
01:12:12,237 --> 01:12:13,266
There were two photos in my drawer.

1686
01:12:13,267 --> 01:12:14,436
(Realizing)

1687
01:12:14,437 --> 01:12:16,283
- Ji Won is smart. - I decided to come to Mount Nam.

1688
01:12:16,307 --> 01:12:18,187
She asked if there was one photo in his drawer.

1689
01:12:18,477 --> 01:12:21,076
I wasn't surprised that he received more than one photo...

1690
01:12:21,077 --> 01:12:22,377
since he was a popular type.

1691
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:26,017
I tried to think of some things I could do...

1692
01:12:26,577 --> 01:12:27,987
to make him find me attractive.

1693
01:12:28,887 --> 01:12:31,617
I think it was Ye Eun.

1694
01:12:32,287 --> 01:12:33,757
I didn't ask him who it was,

1695
01:12:34,957 --> 01:12:36,187
but I knew it was her.

1696
01:12:38,157 --> 01:12:39,196
Here's your food.

1697
01:12:39,197 --> 01:12:40,526
- Thank you. - Yes. Thank you.

1698
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:41,896
- Is this diet soda? - Yes, that's diet soda.

1699
01:12:41,897 --> 01:12:44,067
- Thanks. Yes, thank you. - Thank you.

1700
01:12:44,397 --> 01:12:46,537
- Let's clink our cups. - Let's do that.

1701
01:12:47,097 --> 01:12:48,137
Cheers.

1702
01:12:50,507 --> 01:12:51,776
- Do you prefer regular cola? - Yes.

1703
01:12:51,777 --> 01:12:52,836
Really?

1704
01:12:52,837 --> 01:12:54,506
Isn't this your first time drinking regular soda since the show began?

1705
01:12:54,507 --> 01:12:55,507
That's right.

1706
01:12:56,207 --> 01:12:57,507
- Soda with sugar. - Right.

1707
01:12:58,117 --> 01:12:59,217
You should've said so.

1708
01:13:00,077 --> 01:13:01,987
If you go grocery shopping next time,

1709
01:13:02,447 --> 01:13:05,217
- You want regular Coke? - pick up some regular Coke for me.

1710
01:13:05,357 --> 01:13:07,987
I heard you had a really good memory.

1711
01:13:08,057 --> 01:13:09,127
- Yes, I do. - Right.

1712
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:12,626
That you remember other people's preferences and things like that.

1713
01:13:12,627 --> 01:13:13,927
I heard that.

1714
01:13:14,797 --> 01:13:19,136
(The day when Sang Won bought wasabi that Ye Eun liked)

1715
01:13:19,137 --> 01:13:20,866
I think I ate all the wasabi here.

1716
01:13:20,867 --> 01:13:22,767
- She's a wasabi lover. - I'm glad I bought it.

1717
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:26,907
(Ji Won remembered Sang Won's thoughtfulness.)

1718
01:13:27,337 --> 01:13:29,377
- I like to take care of others. - I see.

1719
01:13:29,747 --> 01:13:31,977
And to take care of someone I like, in my opinion,

1720
01:13:32,477 --> 01:13:36,617
I should memorize what she likes...

1721
01:13:36,747 --> 01:13:38,817
and what she needs.

1722
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:41,257
So I put in some effort.

1723
01:13:42,787 --> 01:13:44,187
I now know you prefer regular Coke.

1724
01:13:44,697 --> 01:13:46,997
Once I memorize something, I never forget.

1725
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:48,267
Really?

1726
01:13:48,527 --> 01:13:50,226
(Smiling happily)

1727
01:13:50,227 --> 01:13:52,536
"I heard you had a really good memory."

1728
01:13:52,537 --> 01:13:53,867
Ji Won said that.

1729
01:13:53,997 --> 01:13:55,966
I wonder why she brought that up.

1730
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,776
Do you think she was wary of Ye Eun?

1731
01:13:57,777 --> 01:14:00,677
Or do you think she didn't mean anything by that?

1732
01:14:01,177 --> 01:14:04,246
I think she said that to sound him out for many reasons.

1733
01:14:04,247 --> 01:14:05,616
- Oh, you do? - Yes, for many reasons.

1734
01:14:05,617 --> 01:14:07,716
So you think she was wary of Ye Eun.

1735
01:14:07,717 --> 01:14:09,947
Yes, and she wanted to hear from Sang Won...

1736
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:11,557
about why he did it.

1737
01:14:12,057 --> 01:14:13,416
She wanted to know if he was just kind to Ye Eun...

1738
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:15,226
or it was because he was interested in her.

1739
01:14:15,227 --> 01:14:17,657
I think she subtly sounded him out.

1740
01:14:17,997 --> 01:14:21,426
Sang Won answered her question quite wisely.

1741
01:14:21,427 --> 01:14:24,896
He said he always tried to memorize the preferences...

1742
01:14:24,897 --> 01:14:28,066
of someone he was interested in.

1743
01:14:28,067 --> 01:14:29,906
And then he said he had memorized that...

1744
01:14:29,907 --> 01:14:30,907
- she prefered regular Coke. - He memorized it.

1745
01:14:30,908 --> 01:14:33,336
He promised to get regular Coke for her in the future.

1746
01:14:33,337 --> 01:14:36,376
So if he buys regular Coke, Ji Won will wonder...

1747
01:14:36,377 --> 01:14:38,816
if he bought it for her.

1748
01:14:38,817 --> 01:14:41,486
- She'll know he cares about her. - He made her think that way.

1749
01:14:41,487 --> 01:14:44,017
I'm worried he might buy both regular Coke and wasabi.

1750
01:14:44,517 --> 01:14:46,356
- There may be more items to buy. - Exactly.

1751
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:48,226
- Wasabi, regular Coke, and... - That'll drive the girls crazy.

1752
01:14:48,227 --> 01:14:51,657
Right. That's what worries me, but...

1753
01:14:53,027 --> 01:14:54,626
- It looks good. - Actually...

1754
01:14:54,627 --> 01:14:56,627
I haven't had this type of pork cutlet in a while.

1755
01:14:57,497 --> 01:14:58,937
(Having a bite)

1756
01:14:59,067 --> 01:15:01,437
(Impressed)

1757
01:15:04,107 --> 01:15:06,377
Didn't you say you'd do something regarding makgeolli?

1758
01:15:07,807 --> 01:15:10,677
Ye Eun and I made makgeolli together...

1759
01:15:11,217 --> 01:15:12,517
on the second day.

1760
01:15:13,177 --> 01:15:15,917
We were told to stir the makgeolli on the third day after making it.

1761
01:15:16,087 --> 01:15:17,686
(Bothered)

1762
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:19,557
Who takes that makgeolli then?

1763
01:15:20,257 --> 01:15:22,057
I guess we will each take one.

1764
01:15:23,027 --> 01:15:24,087
Shouldn't we do that?

1765
01:15:24,827 --> 01:15:26,296
I can't take all.

1766
01:15:26,297 --> 01:15:27,596
- Are there 2 bottles? - Yes, there are 2 bottles.

1767
01:15:27,597 --> 01:15:29,267
- There are 2 bottles. - We each made 1.

1768
01:15:29,367 --> 01:15:31,236
Right. You didn't know that we each made one.

1769
01:15:31,237 --> 01:15:32,237
No.

1770
01:15:32,997 --> 01:15:35,066
Sang Won, while you're here,

1771
01:15:35,067 --> 01:15:39,177
is there anyone else you want to...

1772
01:15:41,177 --> 01:15:42,177
get to know?

1773
01:15:44,347 --> 01:15:46,067
I think he's going to say there is someone.

1774
01:15:47,477 --> 01:15:49,686
- The nightmare of a test. - I think he's going to say it.

1775
01:15:49,687 --> 01:15:50,727
- It's a nightmare. - Yes.

1776
01:15:52,017 --> 01:15:54,217
To be honest, there was someone I wanted to talk to.

1777
01:15:55,227 --> 01:15:59,757
Right now, it's a mere curiosity.

1778
01:15:59,857 --> 01:16:00,997
That's about it.

1779
01:16:01,827 --> 01:16:04,667
But there isn't much time left,

1780
01:16:04,967 --> 01:16:08,567
so I mean to resolve that curiosity as soon as I can.

1781
01:16:09,407 --> 01:16:12,106
That way, I can communicate my emotion in a more stable manner.

1782
01:16:12,107 --> 01:16:13,987
That's what I've been thinking since yesterday.

1783
01:16:14,577 --> 01:16:15,607
I don't want to be lost.

1784
01:16:19,147 --> 01:16:22,616
(While they're on a date, )

1785
01:16:22,617 --> 01:16:27,117
(another person waits for Sang Won.)

1786
01:16:27,587 --> 01:16:32,097
(What will happen to their relationships next?)

1787
01:16:33,497 --> 01:16:36,767
(Sang Won has the second Memory Location Date with Ye Eun.)

1788
01:16:38,097 --> 01:16:39,997
(Did you know I was going to be on two dates?)

1789
01:16:41,307 --> 01:16:43,537
(I hoped you wouldn't go on two dates.)

1790
01:16:44,537 --> 01:16:47,106
(After going on dates with the two, )

1791
01:16:47,107 --> 01:16:49,177
(I felt the difference instantly.)

1792
01:16:49,507 --> 01:16:51,476
(What I loved about...)

1793
01:16:51,477 --> 01:16:53,047
(today's dates is...)

1794
01:16:53,777 --> 01:16:57,247
(that I got to compare them instantly.)

1795
01:16:57,817 --> 01:17:00,716
(Did you not talk to Sang Won?)

1796
01:17:00,717 --> 01:17:03,587
(About how he studied?)

1797
01:17:04,057 --> 01:17:06,557
(I didn't ask him about it in detail.)

1798
01:17:07,597 --> 01:17:11,137
(After the date, they start keeping each other in check.)

1799
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:15,566
(Honestly, )

1800
01:17:15,567 --> 01:17:16,807
(I am not too happy about it.)

1801
01:17:17,067 --> 01:17:18,337
Knock, knock.

1802
01:17:19,107 --> 01:17:26,077
(Ji Won appears, and their conversation stops.)

1803
01:17:27,417 --> 01:17:28,887
(Sighing)

1804
01:17:29,547 --> 01:17:33,487
(We share the same struggles, )

1805
01:17:35,087 --> 01:17:37,387
(and we are also rivals, fighting with good intentions.)

1806
01:17:38,097 --> 01:17:40,527
(Sang Won will make the decision.)

1807
01:17:41,827 --> 01:17:44,697
(Who will Sang Won's heart lean toward?)
