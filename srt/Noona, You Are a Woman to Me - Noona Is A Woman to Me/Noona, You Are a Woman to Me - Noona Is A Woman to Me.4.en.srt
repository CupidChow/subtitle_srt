1
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:08,985
(A new younger man has appeared in Yeon House.)

2
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:10,955
- Hi.
- Hi.

3
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:15,865
(The new younger man has caught the older women's attention.)

4
00:00:16,195 --> 00:00:18,595
(My name is Yang Ji Yung.)

5
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:24,105
(An odd tension hangs in Yeon House.)

6
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:26,605
(Relaxed)

7
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,275
(Tonight, reveal your job.)

8
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:32,744
(With the appearance of the new man, )

9
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:35,085
(everyone must reveal their occupations.)

10
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:37,315
(I'm a doctor working at an aesthetic clinic.)

11
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:39,015
(What?)

12
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:40,315
What is it?

13
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:42,355
I'm...

14
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:43,825
(I'm a public servant.)

15
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:49,365
(The men who only appeared young have unexpected jobs.)

16
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:53,495
(I'm a dentist.)

17
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,234
(From a dentist...)

18
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:56,765
(who graduated from SKY universities, )

19
00:00:57,405 --> 00:00:59,204
(to the principal ballerina of the Korean National Ballet, )

20
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:01,574
(and even a veteran photographer)

21
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:03,305
(I'm a photographer.)

22
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:06,675
(That's cool.)

23
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:09,414
(After revealing their jobs, )

24
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:12,155
(the atmosphere in Yeon House changed.)

25
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:15,024
(With the late-night date as a benefit, )

26
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:17,755
(Ji Yung chooses Bon Hee.)

27
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:20,964
(Your skin...)

28
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:23,295
(By the way, your skin is amazing.)

29
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:26,294
(Even though it's their first encounter, )

30
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,635
(Ji Yung moves forward without hesitation.)

31
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:32,105
(The older women check the younger men's feelings for the first time.)

32
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:36,944
(Ji Won wasn't chosen by any of the younger men.)

33
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:39,275
(Ye Eun wasn't either.)

34
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:41,444
(You have received four Love QR message.)

35
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:44,984
(Meanwhile, the one who received 4 Love QR messages...)

36
00:01:44,985 --> 00:01:46,854
(is Bon Hee.)

37
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:49,654
(I felt happy, and at the same time, )

38
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:51,495
(I felt confused.)

39
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:54,994
(Bon Hee, who received 4 votes, )

40
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:58,965
(is now being pursued by 4 younger men.)

41
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:01,665
(And Sang Hyeon makes the first move.)

42
00:02:02,865 --> 00:02:05,205
(No matter how it ends, )

43
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:07,705
(I should express my feelings even if it's subtle.)

44
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:10,744
(Sang Hyeon musters his courage for Bon Hee, )

45
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:12,415
(but how does Bon Hee feel?)

46
00:02:13,545 --> 00:02:17,015
(That night, after checking the Love QR)

47
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:22,424
(Bon Hee was chosen by 4 out of 5 men.)

48
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:24,255
- The Secret Room?
- The Secret Room?

49
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:27,154
(It only opens for the one...)

50
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:29,365
(who received the most Love QR messages.)

51
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:34,265
(Secret Room)

52
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:37,434
(Open the drawer and guess the age of the person you're interested in.)

53
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:38,835
(What you find out is a secret.)

54
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:41,874
- It's because of that.
- The votes.

55
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,004
Yes, she got many votes.

56
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:44,944
(Bon Hee received 4 Love QR messages...)

57
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:47,075
(from Mu Jin, Sang Won, Sang Hyeon, and Ji Yung.)

58
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:53,314
(Bon Hee, who got the majority of votes)

59
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:54,355
Let's see.

60
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:57,125
Whose photo will she check?

61
00:02:58,855 --> 00:03:02,065
(Mu Jin, whom she had her first date with?)

62
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,794
You didn't seem much older...

63
00:03:04,795 --> 00:03:07,734
(Or Ji Yung, the newly joined catfish?)

64
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:09,664
(Or those who sent unexpected messages, )

65
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:11,935
(Sang Hyeon and Sang Won?)

66
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,405
(Looking around)

67
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:19,744
(She heads to one drawer without hesitation.)

68
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:21,045
She didn't hesitate at all.

69
00:03:21,415 --> 00:03:23,245
(Impressed)

70
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,084
- She's so happy.
- Isn't she smiling too much?

71
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:29,355
(Whose photo did Bon Hee look at?)

72
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:35,095
(A cute child with chubby cheeks)

73
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:37,664
- What?
- What? Who is that?

74
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:38,865
(Whose childhood photo is it?)

75
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:43,334
(The child with the cute chubby cheeks is...)

76
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:46,835
Mu Jin used to be cute and chubby.

77
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:49,144
(How cute.)

78
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,215
I really liked our first date,

79
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:54,545
and I'm more and more interested in Mu Jin.

80
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:57,585
That's why I wanted to know about him.

81
00:03:59,455 --> 00:04:00,514
How cute.

82
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:03,524
(Mu Jin's photo is...)

83
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:05,154
What? The date?

84
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:07,255
(from 2007.)

85
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:09,895
- Is the date on it?
- He was such a baby in 2007?

86
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:12,035
(SOOBIN)

87
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:13,694
Then how old is he?

88
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:16,004
How old do you think he was back then?

89
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,104
Ten or eleven.

90
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:18,435
- Ten or eleven?
- That's what I think.

91
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,075
Maybe upper elementary school.

92
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:25,414
If we guess he was about 10 or 11...

93
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:26,915
Let's go back to 2007.

94
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:30,955
In 2007, I was working as a model in the US.

95
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:32,814
I had been a model for eight years.

96
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:35,485
Seul Hye would've been 29 years old.

97
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:37,654
Didn't you debut the next year in "Crush and Blush?"

98
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:39,825
- Correct, that's when I debuted.
- What about you, Woo Young?

99
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:41,364
I was 19.

100
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,494
(Mu Jin in 2007)

101
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:44,335
- A trainee?
- I was training to be in 2PM.

102
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:46,434
Is he about the same age...

103
00:04:46,435 --> 00:04:47,635
- as SOOBIN?
- Let's not ask him.

104
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:50,774
We already have a big age difference.

105
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:53,335
I had started elementary school, so I was eight years old.

106
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:55,145
I told you we shouldn't ask, Seul Hye.

107
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:57,445
That means he's older than SOOBIN, right?

108
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,474
Don't you think he's about two years older than me?

109
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:01,545
- Right?
- Yes.

110
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:06,254
Last time Mu Jin saw Bon Hee's photo,

111
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:09,055
- she was wearing a duffle coat.
- Yes.

112
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:11,155
That photo was taken in 2004.

113
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:13,354
Wasn't she in high school back then?

114
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,824
- If you put it like that...
- Back then,

115
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:16,324
- A high school student?
- we thought she was in high school.

116
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:17,934
A high school student in 2004.

117
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:19,394
(Mu Jin in 2007, Bon Hee in 2004)

118
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:21,765
If he was that young even though her photo is from three years back...

119
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:23,004
Could there be a ten-year age gap?

120
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:24,005
The gap might be bigger than we thought.

121
00:05:24,006 --> 00:05:25,505
This couple is at risk.

122
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:27,035
Hold on a second.

123
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,204
Last episode ended with Sang Hyeon asking to talk to...

124
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,514
- Bon Hee.
- Yes.

125
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:33,174
I was dying to know what they talked about.

126
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:34,215
Right?

127
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:38,355
(At that time, in the men's room)

128
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:42,725
(Sang Hyeon is deep in thought.)

129
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,055
(Sighing)

130
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:50,965
(Sang Hyeon heads to the women's room?)

131
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:53,634
(She spots Sang Hyeon.)

132
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:55,334
- It's over.
- Sorry?

133
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:56,534
Everyone has left.

134
00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:58,975
I actually want to talk to Bon Hee.

135
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:01,544
Can you tell her I'll be waiting on the first floor?

136
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:02,545
Sure thing.

137
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:05,774
(Sang Hyeon asked to talk to Bon Hee for the first time.)

138
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:07,275
(Sighing)

139
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,245
- Bon Hee, - Yes?

140
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:12,414
Sang Hyeon wants to talk to you on the first floor.

141
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,285
- Sang Hyeon?
- He's waiting.

142
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:15,985
- On the first floor?
- Yes.

143
00:06:15,985 --> 00:06:16,985
Got it.

144
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,795
Sang Hyeon?

145
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:25,834
Bon Hee is slightly surprised.

146
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:27,365
Yes, she's like, "Sang Hyeon?"

147
00:06:30,535 --> 00:06:35,874
(Sang Hyeon is waiting for Bon Hee with excitement.)

148
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,245
(Sighing)

149
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:41,915
I should express my feelings even if it's subtle.

150
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:45,355
Whatever happens,

151
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:50,325
I thought I should talk to her. So I went to her...

152
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:52,594
and talked to her.

153
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:54,865
(Sang Hyeon gathers his courage to express his feelings.)

154
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:57,364
Bon Hee must be feeling confused too.

155
00:06:57,365 --> 00:06:58,434
(Bon Hee walks toward Sang Hyeon.)

156
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:00,035
- She's bewildered.
- Exactly.

157
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:02,035
(Surprised)

158
00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:05,675
- Where do you want to go?
- I...

159
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:08,544
- Outside?
- Outside?

160
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:10,105
- I don't think it's too hot.
- Right.

161
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:12,875
- The weather was actually nice.
- Right.

162
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:18,014
(Sang Hyeon and Bon Hee sit on the terrace.)

163
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,114
What? Are they talking somewhere with no cameras?

164
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:21,825
(Sang Hyeon and Bon Hee sit on the terrace.)

165
00:07:23,155 --> 00:07:24,494
(Thinking)

166
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:25,725
What will he say?

167
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,894
(Laughing)

168
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:29,025
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

169
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:33,765
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Right.

170
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:34,835
I am...

171
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,775
not the type to talk in front of everyone.

172
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:41,745
I felt sorry about it, so I asked you to talk in private.

173
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:48,615
I really liked the first impression I had of you.

174
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:51,955
But expressing my feelings right away...

175
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:54,325
would have been too sudden.

176
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:59,294
I thought it was better to be sure of my feelings...

177
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:02,765
and show them to you step by step.

178
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,535
That's why...

179
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:08,404
I wanted to have a date with you today.

180
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,964
- You did?
- Yes.

181
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:11,975
(I wanted to have a date with you today.)

182
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,934
But I wasn't expressive at all.

183
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:17,175
I slowly realized how bad I was at showing my feelings.

184
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:21,385
I thought you probably had no idea.

185
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:24,754
I wanted to have a light chat...

186
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,754
without putting any pressure on you.

187
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:30,185
But to be clear, my feelings aren't light.

188
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:34,694
Thank you for being honest with me.

189
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:36,265
But it never crossed my mind.

190
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,035
I never thought this could happen.

191
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:40,835
That's why I was a little surprised,

192
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:42,905
so I just listened.

193
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:48,975
Do you know how INFPs flirt?

194
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:50,175
How?

195
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:53,575
They hang around that person while being dressed up.

196
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:58,714
But it really never crossed my mind.

197
00:08:58,715 --> 00:09:00,215
When did you hang around me?

198
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:03,784
The first time we sat together, I sat across from you.

199
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:04,895
- At first?
- Yes.

200
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:07,994
When our eyes met and we burst out laughing...

201
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:09,095
while you were eating apples?

202
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:12,664
- Was it Sang Hyeon?
- Yes, Sang Hyeon.

203
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:15,234
- What's your name?
- I'm Gu Bon Hee.

204
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:17,364
(On their 1st encounter and on the 1st night, )

205
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:19,535
(he sat across from Bon Hee.)

206
00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:21,504
(Glancing)

207
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:22,674
(Sang Hyeon secretly watched Bon Hee.)

208
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:24,515
Sang Hyeon was already doing his best.

209
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:26,815
It's just that Bon Hee had no idea.

210
00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:33,314
(Embarrassed when their eyes met, Sang Hyeon laughed it off.)

211
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:35,625
(Flustered)

212
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:38,125
I guess I am sitting too directly across you.

213
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:39,394
(Sang Hyeon was quietly staying near Bon Hee.)

214
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:40,625
Stop staring at him.

215
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:43,024
(Happy)

216
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:44,025
He's serious.

217
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:47,804
It simply didn't reach you.

218
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:48,865
Is that so?

219
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:51,875
I see.

220
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,205
Did you get the text message?

221
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:56,645
What text message? The...

222
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:58,515
Among the many text messages,

223
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:00,645
was this one in there?

224
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,815
(Realizing)

225
00:10:05,115 --> 00:10:06,185
It was me.

226
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:07,984
I had no idea.

227
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:10,555
And I never thought you would be the one who sent it.

228
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:14,394
- You keep going out.
- What?

229
00:10:14,395 --> 00:10:15,725
You keep going out.

230
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,065
That...

231
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:21,865
You kept going out. I wanted to talk to you, but you kept leaving.

232
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,735
Please come back.

233
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:26,275
That's what it meant.

234
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,475
Come back.

235
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,245
Please stay at home.

236
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:34,645
When you said dating an older woman was a challenge,

237
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:37,584
- I thought maybe you weren't...
- Interested?

238
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:39,555
interested at all.

239
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,355
Are you okay with someone much older than you?

240
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:46,225
- Than me?
- Much older.

241
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:47,525
- Much older?
- Yes.

242
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:49,095
Much older.

243
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:55,665
My feelings won't change.

244
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:57,775
Just be you.

245
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:01,605
I hope we can go on a date.

246
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:04,945
Shall we spend each day meaningfully?

247
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:06,615
Of course.

248
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:13,484
Wash up and go to sleep. I'm sure there's an event tomorrow.

249
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:14,485
For sure.

250
00:11:14,486 --> 00:11:16,754
- Goodnight.
- You too. Goodnight.

251
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:17,795
Bye.

252
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:29,334
(Their chat ended after everyone had gone to bed.)

253
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:30,765
Bon Hee must be happy.

254
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,915
My head was full of thoughts and became a mess.

255
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:42,145
He's quite bold.

256
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:46,285
I was just as grateful as the courage he showed me.

257
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:48,325
And because of it,

258
00:11:48,655 --> 00:11:50,825
I wanted to know more about him.

259
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:53,925
She wants to know more.

260
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:56,895
(Did Sang Hyeon's bravery touch Bon Hee's heart?)

261
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,995
(Amazed)

262
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:00,864
She wants to know about him?

263
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:02,505
Wanting to know about him...

264
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:04,435
means progress.

265
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:07,375
What was it earlier? INFP flirting?

266
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:09,504
- FP?
- Who's MBTI is INFP here?

267
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:10,505
Not me.

268
00:12:10,705 --> 00:12:11,945
Why the straight face?

269
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:14,175
How is that flirting?

270
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:15,484
(That's true.)

271
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,014
It's my first time seeing someone express their feelings like that.

272
00:12:19,015 --> 00:12:21,555
It felt like he was beating around the bush at first.

273
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:23,424
But it was actually straightforward.

274
00:12:23,425 --> 00:12:24,724
Totally, it was straightforward.

275
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:26,094
"Do you know..."

276
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:27,294
- "what I did next to you?" - Right.

277
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:28,665
"I've been doing this the whole time."

278
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:30,195
It was like a confession.

279
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:31,234
- Yes.
- Really?

280
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:34,034
Honestly, I thought hanging around while being dressed up...

281
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:35,335
was kind of weak.

282
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:38,634
But by telling Bon Hee that this was his way of flirting,

283
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:41,204
it opened the door for her to wonder,

284
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:43,274
- "Is he flirting with me?" - Something like, "Is he?"

285
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:45,845
When he's dressed up and hanging around near her.

286
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:47,645
Bon Hee will definitely be aware of it...

287
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:49,915
- For sure.
- from now on.

288
00:12:50,345 --> 00:12:51,715
(That's possible.)

289
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:53,454
I only have one.

290
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:54,455
(How does Hye Jin flirt?)

291
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:55,625
(Curious)

292
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:57,585
I buy him expensive drinks.

293
00:12:57,825 --> 00:12:58,925
- You do?
- Yes.

294
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,755
Expensive food and drinks.

295
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:02,125
- I think it's...
- That's so cool.

296
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:03,794
Remember how I paid for our get-together?

297
00:13:03,795 --> 00:13:04,865
That's right!

298
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:07,635
We drank soju-beer cocktails that day.

299
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:09,764
- Come on.
- What?

300
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:10,805
Nobody told you to.

301
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:13,735
Okay.

302
00:13:13,736 --> 00:13:14,745
(Got it.)

303
00:13:15,405 --> 00:13:16,704
(After the confusing night)

304
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:18,075
It really was confusing.

305
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:19,545
(The morning of day 3)

306
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:20,944
- Day 3.
- It's only day 3,

307
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:21,985
but it's already a war.

308
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:25,015
(Breathing heavily)

309
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:26,655
(Breathing heavily)

310
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:28,155
Someone is working out.

311
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:33,124
It's Ji Yung.

312
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,625
(Ji Yung is back from a run.)

313
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,234
(Workout equipment zone)

314
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,995
Ji Yung is very diligent.

315
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:47,774
Since he's a professional athlete,

316
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:51,075
he must have a set daily routine.

317
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:54,014
(Breathing heavily)

318
00:13:54,015 --> 00:13:57,714
His body is different from someone who just works out at a regular gym.

319
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:59,255
- Right?
- It's the body of a warrior.

320
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:05,025
(Teto-guy Ji Yung starts his day with a workout.)

321
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:11,195
(His muscles are pumped up.)

322
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:13,634
(Impressed)

323
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,034
- That's wild.
- Unbelievable.

324
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:16,264
Oh, my.

325
00:14:16,265 --> 00:14:18,135
(Mesmerized)

326
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:21,545
(Meanwhile, in the older women's room, )

327
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:27,775
(Yeong Gyeong and Ye Eun are finally up.)

328
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:31,415
- No one came by, did they?
- What?

329
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:34,155
No, nobody stopped by.

330
00:14:35,385 --> 00:14:37,995
Yeong Gyeong, are you interested in anyone?

331
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,594
Honestly, the only person I've talked to...

332
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:44,695
is Hyeon Jun.

333
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:49,305
- True.
- So he's someone I'm interested in.

334
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:55,444
But I never got the chance...

335
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:59,275
to talk to the others.

336
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:02,185
I'm curious.

337
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:04,715
I want to talk to them.

338
00:15:05,315 --> 00:15:08,654
- She wants to talk to the others.
- She's curious.

339
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:09,885
In this situation,

340
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:12,195
it's likely she'll switch to another guy.

341
00:15:13,155 --> 00:15:14,624
She's likely to find someone else.

342
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,895
(It'll be interesting.)

343
00:15:16,595 --> 00:15:19,065
How many men do you want to talk to?

344
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:21,135
- Me?
- Yes.

345
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,864
About two?

346
00:15:22,865 --> 00:15:24,364
"About two?"

347
00:15:24,365 --> 00:15:25,405
(Laughing)

348
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:27,004
- Right.
- If it's two people...

349
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:28,644
They should talk to the others too.

350
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:29,905
- It's too early in the game.
- Exactly.

351
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:32,874
(The room shared by Bon Hee, who got the most votes, )

352
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,115
(and Ji Won, who got 0)

353
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:37,945
Ji Yung wanted to go running in the morning.

354
00:15:38,515 --> 00:15:39,954
He asked, "Will you join?"

355
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:42,025
But I said, "I can't in the morning."

356
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:43,485
Doing that...

357
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:46,195
Do you have no interest in Ji Yung?

358
00:15:47,295 --> 00:15:48,724
- Ji Yung?
- Yes.

359
00:15:48,725 --> 00:15:50,525
I think he's a nice person.

360
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:52,835
The girls in this room are very honest.

361
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:56,065
He seems bright...

362
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:58,404
and confident.

363
00:15:58,405 --> 00:16:00,005
- You're totally right.
- Right?

364
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:03,805
I think you should talk to him. It was nice when I did last night.

365
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:07,074
The thing is, I'm currently thinking,

366
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:10,185
"How do I get through this when I got zero votes?"

367
00:16:11,685 --> 00:16:13,055
I don't know.

368
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:17,085
Be yourself.

369
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:18,825
- Be myself?
- Be yourself.

370
00:16:21,155 --> 00:16:22,325
That's the hardest.

371
00:16:24,665 --> 00:16:29,165
(Ji Won, who is usually cheerful, now has a lot on her mind.)

372
00:16:29,265 --> 00:16:32,334
- I'll talk to him if I can today.
- You should.

373
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:33,775
(Knocking)

374
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:36,804
- Yes?
- You two chat a lot.

375
00:16:36,805 --> 00:16:37,805
- You could hear?
- Yes.

376
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:38,875
I want to stretch here.

377
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:40,144
- Go ahead.
- Come in.

378
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:41,615
We talk a lot.

379
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:45,355
(Ye Eun, another zero-vote participant, joins the chat.)

380
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:47,054
You're not going to stop talking just because I'm here, are you?

381
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:48,055
- Not at all.
- No.

382
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:49,384
- We're like...
- Are we best friends?

383
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:50,754
- It was about Ji Yung.
- You're best friends?

384
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:53,755
We were talking about Ji Yung. She and I just get along well.

385
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:57,625
- I'm kind of...
- Yes?

386
00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:01,265
- Here's what I'm worried about.
- Okay.

387
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:03,435
Am I too baby-like?

388
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:06,005
- Baby-like?
- Am I like that?

389
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:08,035
- Why?
- It's just that...

390
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:10,505
I'm not like that at all.

391
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:13,475
- My usual image is...
- Yes?

392
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:17,345
completely different from how I am now.

393
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:19,714
- Did you change?
- Aren't you usually sharper?

394
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:21,984
- I imagine you're more charismatic.
- Exactly.

395
00:17:21,985 --> 00:17:24,025
- When I moved in, - Yes?

396
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:26,725
- I set my mind on something.
- I see.

397
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:29,795
If I acted sharp like I usually do,

398
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,934
it would have been the end for me.

399
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:35,705
But...

400
00:17:36,465 --> 00:17:39,605
did being bright and cheerful backfire?

401
00:17:39,735 --> 00:17:41,844
That was what crossed my mind.

402
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:43,045
It's exactly...

403
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:45,015
I had the same thought.

404
00:17:45,675 --> 00:17:48,345
Either way, while being here...

405
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:51,585
At first, people were all awkward.

406
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:53,984
So, the things I did...

407
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:55,525
to lighten the mood...

408
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,994
wouldn't have seemed so attractive to men.

409
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,895
That thought occurred to me.

410
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:05,264
Last night, I thought really hard...

411
00:18:05,265 --> 00:18:08,265
about whether I was doing something wrong.

412
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:11,235
- Ji Won felt the same.
- She felt the same.

413
00:18:11,935 --> 00:18:14,975
I think it's just part of the process.

414
00:18:15,645 --> 00:18:16,974
The process of learning about myself.

415
00:18:16,975 --> 00:18:18,845
That's what we're here for, after all.

416
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:21,445
I have to follow my heart so that I won't regret anything.

417
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:24,384
I believe that I should keep focusing on my feelings.

418
00:18:24,385 --> 00:18:26,414
If you feel more comfortable laughing at that moment,

419
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:27,685
you really laugh.

420
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:30,155
(Can I do that?)

421
00:18:30,455 --> 00:18:31,894
If you don't think laughing is necessary,

422
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:33,654
you don't have to laugh.

423
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,325
(The older women still have worries when it comes to love.)

424
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:37,565
(Meanwhile, in the kitchen on the 1st floor, )

425
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:41,435
(Sang Hyeon and Ji Yung are preparing breakfast.)

426
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:43,305
(Looking)

427
00:18:43,565 --> 00:18:45,075
(Hesitant)

428
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:50,545
Did you have a long chat with Bon Hee yesterday?

429
00:18:51,245 --> 00:18:52,445
He's checking on them.

430
00:18:52,775 --> 00:18:54,615
We did.

431
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:57,745
Was your first impression of her the best among them?

432
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:00,685
(Sang Hyeon wants to know what's on Ji Yung's mind.)

433
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:02,885
She's very responsive.

434
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:06,295
I thought we were on the same wavelength.

435
00:19:10,595 --> 00:19:12,665
Is there anyone else you want to talk to?

436
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:14,195
Me?

437
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:16,565
Other than Bon Hee.

438
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:18,535
I...

439
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:24,205
(Pondering)

440
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:28,445
Appearance-wise, maybe Yeong Gyeong.

441
00:19:28,945 --> 00:19:30,644
It's Yeong Gyeong, appearance-wise.

442
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:31,715
Good for Sang Hyeon.

443
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:34,985
Good morning.

444
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:39,655
(The younger men will make breakfast today.)

445
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:42,695
(Pulling)

446
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,594
(Setting the table for the older women)

447
00:19:46,595 --> 00:19:48,264
Can I use this?

448
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:50,534
(Ji Won and Mu Jin were cleaning up the kitchen.)

449
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:52,175
(Looking over)

450
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:56,705
Where's Bon Hee?

451
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,275
She's upstairs. She'll be down shortly.

452
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,075
She'll come downstairs soon.

453
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:03,985
(Grinning)

454
00:20:05,015 --> 00:20:06,254
- Bon Hee...
- Paris Baguette.

455
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:07,384
(He gets the bagels, hearing that she'll be down soon.)

456
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:08,385
Butter?

457
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:11,185
- Or...
- Something else with cheese?

458
00:20:11,455 --> 00:20:12,455
Will she like that?

459
00:20:12,455 --> 00:20:13,455
(Selecting the bagels for Bon Hee)

460
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:14,794
I'll take that.

461
00:20:14,795 --> 00:20:16,524
- Hi, Bon Hee.
- Good morning.

462
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:19,034
- Did you sleep well?
- Hi, Bon Hee.

463
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:21,035
- Did you sleep well?
- Bon Hee, we have bagels.

464
00:20:21,235 --> 00:20:23,705
Which one do you want? Is that all right?

465
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:25,574
- We can put two.
- This is also a good one.

466
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:26,674
- What else do we have?
- We have jambon beurre.

467
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:28,235
You can have that. I'll eat the one in the oven.

468
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:30,344
I'll eat the one in the oven, so you can eat the jambon beurre.

469
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:31,444
The jambon beurre?

470
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:33,245
(Pleased)

471
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,114
I'll go and eat first.

472
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:36,115
Sure.

473
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:40,085
I should drink milk with it.

474
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:42,555
(Pushing)

475
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:45,295
(Give me some milk, please.)

476
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:47,855
- He said, "I should drink milk." - Why?

477
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:51,095
Why? What about it?

478
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:54,435
It was cute. He was like, "Give me some."

479
00:20:54,595 --> 00:20:55,804
(That was too much.)

480
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:58,374
- "Give me milk, please." - It's time to get over Mu Jin.

481
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,475
That's not it.

482
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:01,174
- What will you do?
- "Give me."

483
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:02,175
(She's just happy to see him.)

484
00:21:02,505 --> 00:21:04,545
I should drink milk with it.

485
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:07,015
(Pushing)

486
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:09,715
(Give me some milk, please.)

487
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:13,715
(Bon Hee pours Mu Jin a glass of milk.)

488
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:17,584
(And Mu Jin puts Bon Hee's bagels on a plate.)

489
00:21:17,585 --> 00:21:19,195
It's so nice to see.

490
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:22,224
There are small plates,

491
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:23,625
- so we can take these.
- Okay.

492
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:27,935
- Good morning.
- Hi.

493
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,905
- Hi.
- Morning!

494
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:31,975
Are you not eating any bread?

495
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:34,535
He said he'd bring them.

496
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:39,174
(Mu Jin brings a pile of bread for Bon Hee.)

497
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:41,045
Oh, there aren't any plates. Is there?

498
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:49,924
(He only takes care of Bon Hee openly.)

499
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,425
That's no joke.

500
00:21:52,555 --> 00:21:54,194
He's making a move.

501
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:58,995
(And the younger men, who chose Bon Hee last night, watch him.)

502
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:00,435
Thanks.

503
00:22:00,436 --> 00:22:02,204
There's no cutlery.

504
00:22:02,205 --> 00:22:03,405
Oh, right.

505
00:22:03,835 --> 00:22:06,105
(Handing one over)

506
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:07,275
This is good.

507
00:22:09,045 --> 00:22:13,845
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin seem closer than yesterday.)

508
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:18,854
(Will anyone be able to come between them?)

509
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:20,515
(Glancing)

510
00:22:21,185 --> 00:22:23,284
This is giving me a headache.

511
00:22:23,285 --> 00:22:26,255
(How will their feelings for each other change?)

512
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:29,394
- We got something.
- We got a text.

513
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:31,095
- Really?
- What does it say?

514
00:22:32,095 --> 00:22:35,705
(Only the older women got a text after breakfast.)

515
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:39,034
"You have What's in My Bag Dates today."

516
00:22:39,035 --> 00:22:41,275
"All females will gather in the living room now."

517
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:42,845
What's in My Bag Date?

518
00:22:44,605 --> 00:22:48,745
(What's in My Bag Date awaits the older women?)

519
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,785
Oh, bags.

520
00:22:54,785 --> 00:22:56,484
They're the men's bags.

521
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:57,525
They're the men's.

522
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:02,225
It says, "Pick a bag that suits your preference."

523
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:04,365
Oh, they can see them first.

524
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:07,294
They can guess whose bag it is.

525
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:11,635
Yes, they must guess and find the one they want.

526
00:23:12,035 --> 00:23:14,334
You can check their taste from their belongings.

527
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:15,504
- You could.
- Yes.

528
00:23:15,505 --> 00:23:16,604
(They can get a glimpse of their taste.)

529
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:18,815
Do we have to pick a bag each?

530
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:21,415
One of the men won't be going on a date, then.

531
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:25,315
(There are 5 bags and 4 women.)

532
00:23:25,415 --> 00:23:27,484
(In the men's room in the meantime)

533
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:29,124
You didn't get any text messages, did you?

534
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,125
- No, not yet.
- Not me.

535
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:32,555
I didn't.

536
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,195
The women must be picking their dates, right?

537
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:38,224
Maybe they're doing something downstairs.

538
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:39,465
That's what I think.

539
00:23:39,735 --> 00:23:40,995
Will one of us stay at home, then?

540
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:42,765
(Inhaling sharply)

541
00:23:42,865 --> 00:23:44,205
I'm the only one sitting apart.

542
00:23:44,935 --> 00:23:45,935
Wait.

543
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:49,445
Leaving one behind sounds so sad, though.

544
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:51,404
I'm all ready to go.

545
00:23:51,405 --> 00:23:55,145
(Sang Won is worried about everything for some reason.)

546
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,914
Should I open this one first?

547
00:23:57,915 --> 00:23:59,055
Sure.

548
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:04,124
In the first bag, there's a cap.

549
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,125
(A pink cap in the first bag)

550
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:07,994
- A pink cap.
- There's a cap.

551
00:24:07,995 --> 00:24:08,995
(A pink cap?)

552
00:24:08,996 --> 00:24:10,865
(Whose would it be?)

553
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:13,894
- Cologne.
- It's a Tom Ford.

554
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:16,505
- It's Oud Wood.
- Woody scent.

555
00:24:17,365 --> 00:24:18,365
And...

556
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:22,845
this looks like a band for working out.

557
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:25,315
You can probably tell whose this is.

558
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:27,974
- Doesn't it remind you of rugby?
- It's a Tom Ford.

559
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:29,444
(The belongings remind them of someone.)

560
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:31,485
I also think it's Ji Yung's bag.

561
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:35,225
Everything's so big.

562
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:36,684
Even the bag is.

563
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:38,124
- Yes.
- Right.

564
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,524
- And they're related to sports.
- Yes.

565
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:42,095
And they're fancy.

566
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,795
But the pink cap doesn't suit him.

567
00:24:45,195 --> 00:24:46,735
- Am I the only one?
- I agree.

568
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:49,335
Whose bag do you think it is?

569
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:51,704
- With the pink cap.
- Ji Yung is the best guess.

570
00:24:51,705 --> 00:24:54,105
But Sang Hyeon also works out.

571
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:56,574
It might be Sang Hyeon's.

572
00:24:56,575 --> 00:24:58,105
- Either Sang Hyeon or Ji Yung.
- Sang Hyeon.

573
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,375
I also think it's Sang Hyeon's.

574
00:25:00,475 --> 00:25:01,815
He also works out,

575
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:04,815
and I think the pink cap will look better on Sang Hyeon than Ji Yung.

576
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:07,784
I expect to see scarier exercise equipment...

577
00:25:07,785 --> 00:25:09,055
in Ji Yung's bag.

578
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,955
I honestly can't tell.

579
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:14,524
Who does the feminine bag belong to?

580
00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:16,395
- I'll open it.
- Sure.

581
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:18,365
The second bag is feminine.

582
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:22,305
- A wallet.
- Wallet.

583
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,704
- Cologne.
- Cologne.

584
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:26,135
(His second item, cologne)

585
00:25:29,345 --> 00:25:30,545
- A bandana?
- A bandana?

586
00:25:30,975 --> 00:25:32,645
- A handkerchief?
- What?

587
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:34,145
Isn't it a bandana?

588
00:25:34,515 --> 00:25:36,085
- A handkerchief?
- A handkerchief?

589
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:38,815
Not many men carry handkerchiefs nowadays.

590
00:25:40,985 --> 00:25:42,324
Most of them wear it on their heads.

591
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:44,325
That's so cute. Can you keep that on?

592
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,625
It's so cute.

593
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:47,194
Who are you?

594
00:25:47,195 --> 00:25:48,824
(A younger man who carries a handkerchief?)

595
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:51,095
Judging from the style of the bag...

596
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:53,494
- Mu Jin.
- Mu Jin?

597
00:25:53,495 --> 00:25:55,634
I can't imagine Mu Jin...

598
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:57,834
carrying such a slouchy bag.

599
00:25:57,835 --> 00:25:59,934
Oh, really?

600
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,734
The fabric tells me that it's Sang Won's.

601
00:26:01,735 --> 00:26:03,275
- I see.
- Because of the material.

602
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:07,215
He does have that image of a delicate man.

603
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:09,884
I still think it's Mu Jin's.

604
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:12,455
- Mu Jin's? Okay.
- I have a feeling.

605
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:16,055
I can't tell at all.

606
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:18,054
(The feminine bag belongs to...)

607
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:21,194
Isn't that what Hyeon Jun wears when he's cooking?

608
00:26:21,195 --> 00:26:22,725
I thought the same thing.

609
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,265
Should we open this one?

610
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:28,534
First of all, I love the color of the bag.

611
00:26:28,535 --> 00:26:30,705
(The third bag is khaki-colored and big.)

612
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:31,865
Glasses?

613
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:34,234
- Sunglasses.
- Sunglasses.

614
00:26:34,235 --> 00:26:35,305
Should I open it?

615
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:36,975
Let's see what type he wears.

616
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:39,975
It's a little see-through.

617
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:42,985
Like this. It's translucent.

618
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:45,855
(Intrigued)

619
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:48,355
- What?
- Another pair?

620
00:26:49,385 --> 00:26:52,455
(He carries two pairs of sunglasses?)

621
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:54,495
Are you okay with this color?

622
00:26:54,895 --> 00:26:56,894
(Two pairs of sunglasses with different designs)

623
00:26:56,895 --> 00:26:58,165
Those are Mu Jin's.

624
00:26:58,525 --> 00:26:59,534
No.

625
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,594
Yes, I think Mu Jin wears those types of glasses.

626
00:27:01,595 --> 00:27:02,634
Mu Jin would.

627
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:04,304
Have you ever seen government employees...

628
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:05,875
going to work wearing sunglasses?

629
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:07,705
Mu Jin would.

630
00:27:07,805 --> 00:27:10,845
No. Never. It's either Sang Won or Hyeon Jun.

631
00:27:11,675 --> 00:27:12,875
No, it's Ji Yung's.

632
00:27:14,775 --> 00:27:16,185
It must be Mu Jin's bag.

633
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:17,544
- Really?
- Do you think so?

634
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:20,455
I was thinking of Hyeon Jun because of the bag.

635
00:27:21,115 --> 00:27:23,624
I thought the sunglasses belonged to Hyeon Jun.

636
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:24,625
Is this...

637
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:30,395
And lip balm for lip care.

638
00:27:31,225 --> 00:27:33,235
- Hang on.
- Lip balm.

639
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:35,165
Mu Jin or...

640
00:27:35,935 --> 00:27:38,534
And a mouth spray. It's a must-have item.

641
00:27:38,535 --> 00:27:39,734
Maybe it's Mu Jin's.

642
00:27:39,735 --> 00:27:42,175
I have a feeling it's Mu Jin's.

643
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:46,145
I believe it's Mu Jin's.

644
00:27:46,945 --> 00:27:47,974
Yes, I think so too.

645
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:51,145
He carries this type of stuff.

646
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,285
So, he's considerate.

647
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:54,754
- He must be.
- Yes.

648
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:56,624
- That's the feeling I get.
- It looks like Mu Jin's.

649
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:57,625
Yes.

650
00:27:58,525 --> 00:27:59,595
And...

651
00:28:00,455 --> 00:28:02,724
This one has a lot of stuff.

652
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:03,725
Here...

653
00:28:04,495 --> 00:28:06,694
- A flower wallet.
- Oh, my.

654
00:28:06,695 --> 00:28:07,865
A flower wallet?

655
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,534
(What's this?)

656
00:28:10,535 --> 00:28:11,565
Soothing cream.

657
00:28:11,835 --> 00:28:13,305
- Soothing cream?
- Soothing cream?

658
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,344
BB cream for skin cover.

659
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:18,914
(A bunch of cosmetics)

660
00:28:18,915 --> 00:28:20,174
Sunscreen.

661
00:28:20,175 --> 00:28:21,515
Why are there so many sunscreens?

662
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:23,584
Why are there so many sunscreens?

663
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:25,215
He must care a lot about his skin.

664
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,854
- Sang Won?
- Sang Won?

665
00:28:27,855 --> 00:28:29,055
Oil-absorbing sheets.

666
00:28:29,285 --> 00:28:31,124
- Oil-absorbing sheets?
- I think it's Sang Hyeon's.

667
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,125
Sang Hyeon?

668
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:33,625
- Sang Hyeon?
- Sang Hyeon.

669
00:28:34,395 --> 00:28:36,965
- And lip balm.
- Lip balm.

670
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:40,135
Sang Hyeon is...

671
00:28:40,195 --> 00:28:42,334
- quite interested in skincare.
- Yes, I think it's Sang Hyeon's.

672
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:43,635
(He's known for his expertise in skincare.)

673
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,904
(They think it's Sang Hyeon and not Sang Won.)

674
00:28:45,905 --> 00:28:48,205
Because Sang Won said...

675
00:28:48,405 --> 00:28:50,074
that he forgot to bring any.

676
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:52,174
(Flower wallet, eye drop, sunscreen, soothing cream...)

677
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:53,945
(Is this bag Sang Hyeon's, the Golden Retriever who does skincare?)

678
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,745
Should we open this one?

679
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,715
(Surprised)

680
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:01,054
(They come across dental floss for the first time.)

681
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:02,884
- Dental floss?
- Someone mentioned floss.

682
00:29:02,885 --> 00:29:03,925
Sang Hyeon!

683
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,424
- It was Sang Hyeon.
- Sang Hyeon?

684
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:06,894
He said he let them use it.

685
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:07,994
It's Sang Hyeon again?

686
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:10,065
Last night, Mu Jin came...

687
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,824
and asked for dental floss,

688
00:29:11,825 --> 00:29:13,335
but no one had any. I said,

689
00:29:13,695 --> 00:29:15,464
- "Yeong Gyeong might have one." - I do.

690
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:16,735
- I told him that.
- I'll let you use it.

691
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:18,605
I also have it. I'll lend it to you.

692
00:29:18,635 --> 00:29:19,675
(Speaking softly)

693
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:23,005
I remember. I have a pretty good memory.

694
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:25,304
(The item that follows dental floss)

695
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,375
Hand soap.

696
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:28,744
Bidet?

697
00:29:28,745 --> 00:29:30,414
- Who else is left?
- Bidet tissues?

698
00:29:30,415 --> 00:29:32,085
(They burst into laughter as they never expected it.)

699
00:29:32,255 --> 00:29:33,854
You've got to be lying.

700
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,085
Bidet tissues.

701
00:29:35,755 --> 00:29:37,524
- Okay.
- It's privacy.

702
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,785
Let's just say they're wet tissues.

703
00:29:38,955 --> 00:29:42,695
There was a pack of very soft wet tissues.

704
00:29:42,765 --> 00:29:44,395
I found out...

705
00:29:44,765 --> 00:29:49,134
that it was used in the bathroom.

706
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:52,575
The fact that he had that in his bag...

707
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,304
whetted my curiosity.

708
00:29:55,305 --> 00:29:56,805
I thought,

709
00:29:57,705 --> 00:29:59,344
"Does it belong to a funny guy..."

710
00:29:59,345 --> 00:30:01,344
"or a little crazy guy?"

711
00:30:01,345 --> 00:30:05,014
It made me look forward to finding out who he was.

712
00:30:05,015 --> 00:30:06,115
(Is the bag with dental floss and bidet tissues Sang Hyeon's?)

713
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,284
This must be Hyeon Jun's.

714
00:30:08,285 --> 00:30:10,125
- I can't guess them at all.
- Then, this must be...

715
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:11,584
- Hyeon Jun's.
- Hyeon Jun's.

716
00:30:11,585 --> 00:30:13,455
(So, the cosmetics bag belongs to Hyeon Jun, not Sang Hyeon?)

717
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,925
- Should we pick them now?
- Yes.

718
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:17,424
Let's see.

719
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:18,464
(They randomly pick a number to decide on the order.)

720
00:30:18,465 --> 00:30:20,295
- It might change things.
- Who's number one?

721
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:22,235
I'm number one.

722
00:30:22,535 --> 00:30:23,835
- I'm number 4.
- Number 3.

723
00:30:24,335 --> 00:30:25,464
I'm number two.

724
00:30:25,465 --> 00:30:26,705
(Number 2, Yeong Gyeong)

725
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,575
- This is tough.
- It is tough.

726
00:30:28,775 --> 00:30:31,404
(It's harder to choose for the first one.)

727
00:30:31,405 --> 00:30:32,575
This is difficult.

728
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:34,445
I'll pick this one.

729
00:30:34,945 --> 00:30:36,545
- This one?
- Okay.

730
00:30:36,785 --> 00:30:37,845
Great.

731
00:30:39,315 --> 00:30:41,715
I wanted to have one more chat with Mu Jin.

732
00:30:42,555 --> 00:30:43,655
Mu Jin.

733
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,154
I saw lip balm in one of the bags,

734
00:30:47,155 --> 00:30:49,594
and I thought I remembered seeing it.

735
00:30:49,595 --> 00:30:51,494
All the other items in that bag didn't look like Mu Jin's,

736
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:53,065
but I was certain about the lip balm.

737
00:30:54,565 --> 00:30:57,635
So, I was really torn before I picked that.

738
00:30:58,205 --> 00:30:59,635
No, that's Ji Yung's.

739
00:31:01,135 --> 00:31:02,505
I'm 100 percent sure it belongs to Mu Jin.

740
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:04,544
No, it can never be Mu Jin.

741
00:31:04,545 --> 00:31:07,414
Mu Jin may be a government employee, but he's got style.

742
00:31:07,415 --> 00:31:09,845
No government employee wears orange sunglasses.

743
00:31:10,385 --> 00:31:12,214
- They're different these days.
- Right.

744
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:13,714
But those glasses would look good on Mu Jin.

745
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:14,854
Even his bag is well-organized.

746
00:31:14,855 --> 00:31:15,855
(She has a point.)

747
00:31:16,285 --> 00:31:17,824
(Yeong Gyeong will pick a bag next.)

748
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:18,855
I...

749
00:31:19,555 --> 00:31:20,695
I'll pick this one.

750
00:31:21,225 --> 00:31:23,925
(She picks one without hesitation.)

751
00:31:24,395 --> 00:31:27,965
There was a bag with dental floss inside.

752
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:29,935
I had a feeling...

753
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:32,975
it would be Sang Hyeon's.

754
00:31:33,905 --> 00:31:34,905
(The evening on day 1)

755
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:36,675
(How much liquor can you hold?)

756
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:39,574
(I can drink one glass...)

757
00:31:39,575 --> 00:31:40,674
(of soju-beer cocktail.)

758
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:42,114
- One glass?
- One glass?

759
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:43,544
(Bursting into laughter)

760
00:31:43,545 --> 00:31:46,215
The one I wanted to talk to most...

761
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:48,185
was Sang Hyeon.

762
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:50,455
Why?

763
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:54,895
He talks calmly,

764
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:58,325
and I could feel from the moment we met...

765
00:31:58,925 --> 00:32:01,934
that he was a delicate guy.

766
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:03,305
(She's been interested in him from the first moment.)

767
00:32:03,665 --> 00:32:05,605
I want to get to know him better.

768
00:32:08,305 --> 00:32:10,775
I genuinely hope it's Sang Hyeon's bag.

769
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:12,644
(Ye Eun will go third.)

770
00:32:12,645 --> 00:32:13,715
Ye Eun.

771
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:17,914
I'll choose solely based on the items in the bag.

772
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:19,284
That's a good idea.

773
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:23,684
Solely based on the items in the bag.

774
00:32:23,685 --> 00:32:26,524
(The feminine bag that everyone guessed was Sang Won's)

775
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:27,725
Sang Won.

776
00:32:28,925 --> 00:32:31,595
I went on a date with him last time,

777
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:35,535
and I wanted to get to know him.

778
00:32:37,465 --> 00:32:40,035
Then, I'll pick this one.

779
00:32:40,205 --> 00:32:42,205
(Impressed)

780
00:32:42,745 --> 00:32:45,304
(The bag with lifting straps)

781
00:32:45,305 --> 00:32:46,345
Ji Yung.

782
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:49,815
There were straps for workouts,

783
00:32:50,045 --> 00:32:53,615
so I picked it, thinking it would belong to Ji Yung.

784
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:56,954
(From the moment Ji Won met Ji Yung, )

785
00:32:56,955 --> 00:32:59,355
(she felt a strong attraction.)

786
00:32:59,925 --> 00:33:00,925
Yes.

787
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:02,624
- What do we do with the other one?
- One bag is left.

788
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,765
Oh, no.

789
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:05,564
- Was it this one?
- Yes.

790
00:33:05,565 --> 00:33:07,834
- This one.
- He has moisturizing cream,

791
00:33:07,835 --> 00:33:09,534
- He's not chosen by anyone.
- sunscreen,

792
00:33:09,535 --> 00:33:11,165
and everything.

793
00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:13,074
What do we do?

794
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:14,805
(Who are the younger men that were picked?)

795
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:18,345
In the end, one of them will be left behind.

796
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:20,575
- Is it bad?
- No, it's cute.

797
00:33:21,245 --> 00:33:22,485
That's not what I'm going for.

798
00:33:23,345 --> 00:33:25,115
(Disappointed)

799
00:33:26,955 --> 00:33:28,054
It looks nice.

800
00:33:28,055 --> 00:33:32,085
(He takes it off, hearing that it's cute.)

801
00:33:33,655 --> 00:33:35,495
(Throwing it away)

802
00:33:36,595 --> 00:33:38,124
(Sang Hyeon and Hyeon Jun's room)

803
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,335
(Sighing deeply)

804
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:43,204
(Sang Hyeon stood in front of the mirror to doll up.)

805
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:45,975
He's at it again. He's applying something.

806
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:48,035
"Get Ready with Sang Hyeon."

807
00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:50,875
(Wiping)

808
00:33:52,145 --> 00:33:56,545
(His touches are rough yet meticulous.)

809
00:33:57,145 --> 00:34:01,485
(Getting perfectly ready for the date)

810
00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:04,455
(He doesn't forget to style the back hair.)

811
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:09,764
Do you have the brows?

812
00:34:09,765 --> 00:34:11,395
- Do you want to use mine?
- What?

813
00:34:11,895 --> 00:34:13,094
Eyebrows?

814
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:14,735
Do they mean the eyebrow razor?

815
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:16,304
It's just a pencil.

816
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,464
- Is that all right?
- Yes, that's fine.

817
00:34:17,465 --> 00:34:18,634
- Can I use it?
- Of course.

818
00:34:18,635 --> 00:34:19,875
- Thank you.
- I'll clean it first.

819
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:21,304
- Here.
- Thank you.

820
00:34:21,305 --> 00:34:22,844
The tip is a little sharp because it broke,

821
00:34:22,845 --> 00:34:24,045
so be careful.

822
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:29,145
What's going on?

823
00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:30,914
- He's drawing them.
- It's not a razor?

824
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:33,315
- Oh, my goodness.
- Gosh.

825
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:35,015
He wasn't a teto-guy, after all!

826
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:36,685
He must know how to use it.

827
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:39,424
Gen Z is certainly different.

828
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:41,255
(Astonished at how much things have changed)

829
00:34:42,055 --> 00:34:44,425
(Drawing)

830
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:48,435
(His draws the eyebrows while showing off his forearms.)

831
00:34:49,735 --> 00:34:53,235
(Ready to look pretty in front of the older women)

832
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,734
(Their partners are chosen by which bags they pick.)

833
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:56,845
I can't wait to find out.

834
00:34:57,505 --> 00:35:00,974
I hope it's a partner they want.

835
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,644
(With the bags they chose, )

836
00:35:02,645 --> 00:35:03,884
(the older women wait for the younger men.)

837
00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:06,214
They're all dolled up nicely.

838
00:35:06,215 --> 00:35:07,255
They are.

839
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:13,125
(Will they go on a date with the younger men they wanted?)

840
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:19,464
(The gate finally opens, )

841
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,134
(and the first younger man comes out.)

842
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:22,735
They're getting in that car?

843
00:35:23,105 --> 00:35:25,564
- How does this go?
- It's Mu Jin. Is it Mu Jin?

844
00:35:25,565 --> 00:35:27,675
(The first younger guy, Mu Jin)

845
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:31,974
(Looking forward to it)

846
00:35:31,975 --> 00:35:34,574
Bon Hee picked the bag, thinking it belonged...

847
00:35:34,575 --> 00:35:36,314
- to Mu Jin.
- She did.

848
00:35:36,315 --> 00:35:38,884
We can find out if she was right...

849
00:35:38,885 --> 00:35:40,554
from which car...

850
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,355
- Mu Jin gets into, right?
- Yes.

851
00:35:42,555 --> 00:35:43,755
This is brutal.

852
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:45,684
He might take the car behind her...

853
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,895
- in the end.
- He could.

854
00:35:47,095 --> 00:35:48,355
She'd be so shocked.

855
00:35:48,955 --> 00:35:51,464
Do you have to own a driver's license and a car...

856
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:52,835
to be a participant in the show?

857
00:35:53,065 --> 00:35:55,265
(Laughing)

858
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:00,534
(He goes straight to his woman.)

859
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:03,374
All the doors are on that side,

860
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:04,904
so we don't know whose car he's getting into.

861
00:36:04,905 --> 00:36:08,775
(Whose car will he take?)

862
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:11,245
Oh, no.

863
00:36:12,315 --> 00:36:14,954
(Bon Hee)

864
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:16,185
- No way.
- He passed by?

865
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:18,684
- No, he hasn't gone yet.
- He walked past it.

866
00:36:18,685 --> 00:36:19,754
No, he didn't.

867
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:21,855
- See? He's going to...
- Is he taking the first car?

868
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:23,124
He walked by it!

869
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,225
No!

870
00:36:24,895 --> 00:36:26,065
(Surprised)

871
00:36:26,265 --> 00:36:27,964
(Ye Eun's What's in My Bag Date is...)

872
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:29,634
- Hello.
- Hi.

873
00:36:29,635 --> 00:36:30,905
(Mu Jin.)

874
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:32,434
Ye Eun!

875
00:36:32,435 --> 00:36:33,435
(It can't be.)

876
00:36:33,436 --> 00:36:35,104
- Sang Won...
- Ye Eun thought...

877
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:37,445
- she had picked Sang Won's bag.
- You're right.

878
00:36:38,705 --> 00:36:40,414
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

879
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:42,915
- Look at her face!
- Bon Hee!

880
00:36:43,045 --> 00:36:44,844
- Nice to see you.
- Hi.

881
00:36:44,845 --> 00:36:46,185
(Laughing)

882
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:48,915
I was so surprised.

883
00:36:49,255 --> 00:36:52,384
But I randomly got a chance...

884
00:36:52,385 --> 00:36:55,155
to have a chat with him,

885
00:36:55,455 --> 00:36:57,265
so I thought it was good.

886
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:01,065
Though I was surprised,

887
00:37:01,465 --> 00:37:03,735
she was one of the women...

888
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:07,905
that I wanted to have a chat with other than Bon Hee.

889
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:11,105
So, I was slightly relieved.

890
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,874
He was also interested in Ye Eun.

891
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,185
Did you have to pick something?

892
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:18,985
- This bag.
- Oh, my bag?

893
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:22,115
Did you know it was mine?

894
00:37:22,415 --> 00:37:25,155
I never knew it was yours, so I was startled.

895
00:37:26,895 --> 00:37:28,225
Were you expecting someone else?

896
00:37:29,055 --> 00:37:30,565
Well...

897
00:37:31,325 --> 00:37:33,435
I wouldn't say I was expecting anyone.

898
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:35,595
I just liked the items in that bag the most.

899
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:37,734
They were my type.

900
00:37:37,735 --> 00:37:39,775
(They were my type.)

901
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:41,504
- TMT?
- What?

902
00:37:41,505 --> 00:37:42,605
"Totally my type?"

903
00:37:44,505 --> 00:37:46,914
Ye Eun and Mu Jin look cute together.

904
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:48,545
- What do I do?
- They'll be a lovely couple.

905
00:37:49,215 --> 00:37:50,345
I think they'll be pretty lovey-dovey.

906
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:53,214
- Gosh, seriously.
- Oh, no.

907
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:54,284
She seems sad.

908
00:37:54,285 --> 00:37:55,285
Oh, gosh.

909
00:37:57,885 --> 00:38:01,724
I realized that my hunch was right when I found it odd.

910
00:38:01,725 --> 00:38:04,594
I mean, he wouldn't wear sunglasses with orange lenses like those.

911
00:38:04,595 --> 00:38:05,695
Exactly.

912
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,064
Who could it be?

913
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:10,305
(If it's not Mu Jin...)

914
00:38:11,065 --> 00:38:14,635
(Who could be the second younger man to go on a date?)

915
00:38:14,735 --> 00:38:17,544
(Yeon House)

916
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,174
(The second younger man, Sang Hyeon)

917
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:21,844
Yeong Gyeong picked the bag...

918
00:38:21,845 --> 00:38:23,044
- thinking that it was Sang Hyeon's.
- That's right.

919
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:24,215
Let's find out if she was right.

920
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:26,155
(Smiling)

921
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,255
(He walks straight to the car without hesitating.)

922
00:38:29,855 --> 00:38:32,224
(Who picked Sang Hyeon's bag?)

923
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:34,454
- Is he going toward Yeong Gyeong?
- It's Yeong Gyeong.

924
00:38:34,455 --> 00:38:35,995
(Is it Yeong Gyeong who wanted Sang Hyeon?)

925
00:38:36,095 --> 00:38:39,165
(Or is it Bon Hee that Sang Hyeon wanted?)

926
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:45,204
It's Yeong Gyeong. Or not?

927
00:38:45,205 --> 00:38:46,305
It's Yeong Gyeong.

928
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:47,905
Oh, hello.

929
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:52,844
(As Yeong Gyeong hoped, )

930
00:38:52,845 --> 00:38:53,944
(Sang Hyeon gets in her car.)

931
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:54,945
Hello.

932
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:56,645
(Nice. She guessed right.)

933
00:38:56,815 --> 00:38:58,744
- That's good.
- He went to the right person.

934
00:38:58,745 --> 00:39:00,555
That's good. It went as she hoped it would.

935
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:01,585
Exactly.

936
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:06,994
- I didn't expect you to be here.
- It's hot, isn't it?

937
00:39:06,995 --> 00:39:08,024
No, I'm fine.

938
00:39:08,025 --> 00:39:10,295
(He's taken aback as he didn't expect it.)

939
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:13,235
By any chance, did you choose my bag?

940
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:15,235
- Here's your bag.
- Oh, I see.

941
00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:17,705
- I'm returning it to you.
- Thank you.

942
00:39:18,605 --> 00:39:21,905
I wanted to apply it... I had everything in this bag.

943
00:39:23,305 --> 00:39:24,475
Excuse me for a second.

944
00:39:25,005 --> 00:39:26,114
I won't watch you.

945
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:27,315
I wanted to apply it.

946
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:28,674
Oh, my.

947
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:31,785
(He turns his head around and applies his lip balm.)

948
00:39:32,015 --> 00:39:35,415
Sang Hyeon seems taken aback.

949
00:39:35,855 --> 00:39:37,255
Were you surprised?

950
00:39:38,385 --> 00:39:40,025
- A little bit.
- A little bit?

951
00:39:40,655 --> 00:39:42,624
(Chuckling)

952
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:43,625
Well, I...

953
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:45,664
(Half awkward, half excited. How will their first date be?)

954
00:39:45,665 --> 00:39:46,895
That's understandable.

955
00:39:49,635 --> 00:39:53,704
(The third younger man to go on a date)

956
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:57,105
(Ji Yung)

957
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:02,744
Ji Won picked the bag thinking it was Ji Yung's.

958
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:04,084
There's a 50-50 chance.

959
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:08,655
(Only Bon Hee and Ji Won's cars are left now.)

960
00:40:09,285 --> 00:40:11,385
(Curious)

961
00:40:11,685 --> 00:40:14,725
(Excited)

962
00:40:22,435 --> 00:40:23,604
Why is he getting in the backseat?

963
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:24,735
It's not a taxi.

964
00:40:25,765 --> 00:40:28,274
(Surprised)

965
00:40:28,275 --> 00:40:29,475
Really?

966
00:40:30,605 --> 00:40:33,445
Looks like all our guesses were wrong.

967
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:35,215
This is unexpected.

968
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:37,884
Who is it? It seems like it's Bon Hee.

969
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:38,885
I think it's Bon Hee.

970
00:40:39,885 --> 00:40:40,914
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

971
00:40:40,915 --> 00:40:42,484
(The bag that Bon Hee picked belongs to...)

972
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:43,825
- My, this is so unexpected.
- I can't believe this.

973
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:46,655
It's their second date following the night before.

974
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:49,695
I thought I should get in the backseat for a moment.

975
00:40:50,265 --> 00:40:51,964
I was so surprised as you were getting in the backseat.

976
00:40:51,965 --> 00:40:53,294
Exactly. We meet again.

977
00:40:53,295 --> 00:40:54,365
I know, right?

978
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:56,904
You're wearing denim, not linen.

979
00:40:56,905 --> 00:40:57,965
Right. I chose denim today.

980
00:40:58,435 --> 00:41:00,004
- You look even younger.
- Do I?

981
00:41:00,005 --> 00:41:01,135
You look even younger.

982
00:41:02,435 --> 00:41:03,844
Did you choose me?

983
00:41:03,845 --> 00:41:05,074
I chose your bag.

984
00:41:05,075 --> 00:41:07,275
- Oh, you chose my bag?
- Yes.

985
00:41:08,775 --> 00:41:10,484
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, boy.

986
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:11,514
(Ji Won picked the bag thinking it was Ji Yung's.)

987
00:41:11,515 --> 00:41:13,784
"What a shame. I don't get to talk to him."

988
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:14,915
That's what I was thinking.

989
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:20,325
The men who are left in the house are...

990
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:22,695
Hyeon Jun and Sang Won.

991
00:41:23,165 --> 00:41:27,935
(Is the last younger man Hyeon Jun or Sang Won?)

992
00:41:28,365 --> 00:41:29,365
(Surprised)

993
00:41:29,366 --> 00:41:30,405
Oh, my goodness.

994
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:35,162
The men who are left in the house are Hyeon Jun and Sang Won.

995
00:41:35,832 --> 00:41:40,432
(Is the last younger man Hyeon Jun or Sang Won?)

996
00:41:40,902 --> 00:41:41,931
(Surprised)

997
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:42,972
Oh, my goodness.

998
00:41:43,972 --> 00:41:47,272
(Who's the younger man who will sit next to Ji Won?)

999
00:41:48,402 --> 00:41:50,341
(The last younger man, Hyeon Jun)

1000
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:51,712
- It's Hyeon Jun.
- It's Hyeon Jun.

1001
00:41:52,312 --> 00:41:54,942
That means Sang Won wasn't chosen by any of the women.

1002
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,112
This is bad. Oh, my goodness.

1003
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:01,382
Oh, Hyeon Jun came out.

1004
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:03,392
Oh, my. Hold on.

1005
00:42:04,552 --> 00:42:06,992
- Sang Won is left alone, right?
- Yes.

1006
00:42:08,462 --> 00:42:09,562
That's right.

1007
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:13,102
(The last younger man turned out to be Hyeon Jun.)

1008
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:17,272
(Yeong Gyeong spots Hyeon Jun.)

1009
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:22,942
(Watching him going to another car makes her feel strange.)

1010
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:29,912
- Hello.
- Hello.

1011
00:42:30,552 --> 00:42:32,551
- It must be quite tight for you.
- I'll push it back a little bit.

1012
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:33,752
Sure. Go ahead.

1013
00:42:33,782 --> 00:42:35,082
He seems as if he thinks, "This car suits me."

1014
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,521
(Chuckling)

1015
00:42:36,522 --> 00:42:38,552
- I'll push it back all the way.
- Yes, go ahead.

1016
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,561
Is it too tight?

1017
00:42:40,562 --> 00:42:41,721
No, it's fine.

1018
00:42:41,722 --> 00:42:43,031
Can you push it back further?

1019
00:42:43,032 --> 00:42:44,531
- This is as far as it can get.
- Really?

1020
00:42:44,532 --> 00:42:46,231
I think it's because there's a bag in the back.

1021
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:47,502
- It's okay.
- Is it?

1022
00:42:48,932 --> 00:42:50,031
(The 4 younger men have gotten in the cars.)

1023
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:52,042
Except Bon Hee and Ji Yung,

1024
00:42:52,342 --> 00:42:55,142
everyone got paired up with an unexpected person.

1025
00:42:55,642 --> 00:42:56,642
It's a mess.

1026
00:42:57,042 --> 00:42:58,411
Don't think that way.

1027
00:42:58,412 --> 00:42:59,941
- This gives us a chance...
- It's interesting.

1028
00:42:59,942 --> 00:43:01,881
to see new combinations.

1029
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:04,482
I believe this is a good thing even though it was unexpected.

1030
00:43:04,552 --> 00:43:06,151
After the date,

1031
00:43:06,152 --> 00:43:08,382
some of them could find their partners attractive.

1032
00:43:08,522 --> 00:43:10,591
- I hope that will happen.
- If that happens...

1033
00:43:10,592 --> 00:43:11,592
Right.

1034
00:43:11,593 --> 00:43:12,761
It will become chaotic.

1035
00:43:12,762 --> 00:43:14,261
(Will the new combinations bring chaos?)

1036
00:43:14,262 --> 00:43:15,562
I wonder how this will turn out.

1037
00:43:16,692 --> 00:43:17,692
Shall we get going now?

1038
00:43:17,693 --> 00:43:19,232
(With hopes and excitement, )

1039
00:43:20,302 --> 00:43:24,572
(What's in My Bag Date begins, which will bring changes.)

1040
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:26,641
(Meanwhile, Sang Won is still waiting in the room.)

1041
00:43:26,642 --> 00:43:28,502
- Oh, no. Oh, gosh.
- Poor Sang Won.

1042
00:43:29,112 --> 00:43:30,212
I feel bad for him.

1043
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,512
(When will I leave?)

1044
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:36,552
My goodness.

1045
00:43:36,812 --> 00:43:38,082
He's wondering what's going on.

1046
00:43:49,632 --> 00:43:55,632
(Sang Won, you have no matches for today's date.)

1047
00:43:55,902 --> 00:43:58,501
This is his second time being chosen by no one.

1048
00:43:58,502 --> 00:43:59,801
He wasn't chosen by anyone on the first day either.

1049
00:43:59,802 --> 00:44:00,972
(Was it because his bag had too many skincare products?)

1050
00:44:01,802 --> 00:44:04,541
(Why are bad feelings...)

1051
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:08,212
(always right?)

1052
00:44:09,182 --> 00:44:10,651
At first, I thought it was okay and that it was understandable...

1053
00:44:10,652 --> 00:44:12,322
since it was still the beginning of the show.

1054
00:44:13,922 --> 00:44:16,452
But being left alone in the house made me feel strange.

1055
00:44:17,192 --> 00:44:18,521
I was upset and confused.

1056
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:19,922
Of course, he's upset.

1057
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:22,691
What should I do while they're gone?

1058
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:26,032
(Sang Won is left alone in Yeon House.)

1059
00:44:26,302 --> 00:44:28,971
Sang Won got zero votes before.

1060
00:44:28,972 --> 00:44:30,302
This time, he's left alone.

1061
00:44:30,632 --> 00:44:32,401
He's really unlucky.

1062
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:34,272
- Bad luck follows him.
- Exactly.

1063
00:44:34,742 --> 00:44:37,612
I hope Sang Won won't...

1064
00:44:37,912 --> 00:44:40,641
- I mean, it's not his fault.
- Right. They were randomly chosen.

1065
00:44:40,642 --> 00:44:43,552
It shouldn't make him feel timid. But the situation is not good.

1066
00:44:43,952 --> 00:44:45,921
What is he supposed to do alone at home?

1067
00:44:45,922 --> 00:44:47,052
- He'll just rest.
- Cleaning?

1068
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,822
- Cleaning?
- Tidying up the house.

1069
00:44:52,762 --> 00:44:54,062
The weather is so nice.

1070
00:44:54,562 --> 00:44:57,191
It's been like this since you came. Are you a weather fairy?

1071
00:44:57,192 --> 00:44:58,691
Yes, I'm a weather fairy.

1072
00:44:58,692 --> 00:45:00,162
(Proud)

1073
00:45:01,362 --> 00:45:02,632
You see...

1074
00:45:03,102 --> 00:45:06,072
Among the ladies, you're the one...

1075
00:45:06,742 --> 00:45:08,142
I've talked to the most.

1076
00:45:09,272 --> 00:45:10,471
Although it was brief.

1077
00:45:10,472 --> 00:45:13,012
So I think you know me better than anyone else.

1078
00:45:13,412 --> 00:45:15,912
How do you think of me? Is it different from the first impression?

1079
00:45:16,952 --> 00:45:18,351
- Do you think...
- You seemed much better...

1080
00:45:18,352 --> 00:45:19,381
after I talked to you.

1081
00:45:19,382 --> 00:45:20,722
- Really?
- Yes.

1082
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:23,991
Did I seem like a thug when you first saw me?

1083
00:45:23,992 --> 00:45:25,191
As for my first impression of you...

1084
00:45:25,192 --> 00:45:27,092
You have such a muscular body, which was very impressive.

1085
00:45:28,662 --> 00:45:30,362
It was like, "Pop."

1086
00:45:30,662 --> 00:45:31,691
- "Pop?" - "Pop?"

1087
00:45:31,692 --> 00:45:32,962
That was my first impression of you.

1088
00:45:33,062 --> 00:45:34,902
- When you introduced yourself, - Yes.

1089
00:45:36,202 --> 00:45:39,642
you seemed to have a sense of responsibility for your work.

1090
00:45:40,602 --> 00:45:43,871
You came across as prudent and reserved.

1091
00:45:43,872 --> 00:45:45,142
That's how you seemed to me.

1092
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,611
But at the same time, you have a good sense of humor.

1093
00:45:47,612 --> 00:45:48,642
Really?

1094
00:45:49,382 --> 00:45:52,052
As a professional athlete, you're supposed to work hard.

1095
00:45:52,222 --> 00:45:53,781
- That's only right.
- Exactly.

1096
00:45:53,782 --> 00:45:56,191
But you didn't make it sound only serious,

1097
00:45:56,192 --> 00:45:58,022
which showed your sense of humor. You know what I mean, right?

1098
00:45:58,452 --> 00:45:59,962
- So...
- You noticed that?

1099
00:46:00,192 --> 00:46:01,492
You're observant.

1100
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:04,691
So I found out that you were mentally relaxed.

1101
00:46:04,692 --> 00:46:05,832
(He's even mentally relaxed too.)

1102
00:46:05,932 --> 00:46:09,771
Some people get less attractive as you talk to them.

1103
00:46:09,772 --> 00:46:11,972
But you became more charming as I talked to you.

1104
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:15,241
What you just said makes me feel more confident.

1105
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:17,011
- Really?
- Yes, it makes me feel...

1106
00:46:17,012 --> 00:46:18,072
(Bon Hee keeps Ji Yung's self-esteem up.)

1107
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,812
(Thanks to her, Ji Yung's confidence level rose.)

1108
00:46:23,282 --> 00:46:24,682
Do you want to get married?

1109
00:46:25,252 --> 00:46:27,051
I do now. I didn't want that before.

1110
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:28,082
You didn't want that before?

1111
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:29,652
Now I want to get married.

1112
00:46:30,992 --> 00:46:32,362
If I find a good man,

1113
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:36,162
I think I could live a happy married life.

1114
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:40,161
It'd be the best if I could live with a companion...

1115
00:46:40,162 --> 00:46:41,232
like a best friend.

1116
00:46:42,372 --> 00:46:45,272
Right. I have the same perspective on marriage.

1117
00:46:45,372 --> 00:46:47,242
I share the same idea of marriage.

1118
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:49,771
If I meet the right person for me,

1119
00:46:49,772 --> 00:46:52,311
I think I would get married right away.

1120
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:53,442
- Following your gut feelings?
- Yes.

1121
00:46:55,442 --> 00:46:56,711
(Holding back a smile)

1122
00:46:56,712 --> 00:46:58,612
I can't wait to find out the ages.

1123
00:47:01,482 --> 00:47:02,892
I think Sang Won is the oldest among the guys.

1124
00:47:03,422 --> 00:47:04,551
- I see.
- Sang Won?

1125
00:47:04,552 --> 00:47:07,062
I have a feeling that he is, which would be unexpected.

1126
00:47:08,462 --> 00:47:10,332
And I think Mu Jin is the youngest of all.

1127
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,271
(Another couple heading to their dating place)

1128
00:47:16,272 --> 00:47:19,672
The weather is so nice. I love it when it's sunny like this.

1129
00:47:21,302 --> 00:47:22,372
Are you good at driving?

1130
00:47:23,612 --> 00:47:27,112
I drove a convertible before I got this car.

1131
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:30,111
The only way I relieve stress is...

1132
00:47:30,112 --> 00:47:32,082
to drive with the roof open.

1133
00:47:32,752 --> 00:47:34,952
That makes me feel so good.

1134
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,322
Do you mind if I go faster?

1135
00:47:37,992 --> 00:47:40,462
(He holds the handle, being playful.)

1136
00:47:40,862 --> 00:47:42,731
(Raising the other hand)

1137
00:47:42,732 --> 00:47:43,862
That's so cute.

1138
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,902
(She finds him cute.)

1139
00:47:47,102 --> 00:47:48,302
She said it was cute.

1140
00:47:49,802 --> 00:47:51,972
- It's game over.
- She just said it out loud.

1141
00:47:52,702 --> 00:47:54,001
- It's game over.
- She finds him cute.

1142
00:47:54,002 --> 00:47:55,002
(Is that cute?)

1143
00:47:55,242 --> 00:47:57,171
(Raising the other hand)

1144
00:47:57,172 --> 00:47:58,272
That's so cute.

1145
00:47:59,512 --> 00:48:01,312
(She finds him cute.)

1146
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,982
(Mu Jin's prank lightened the mood.)

1147
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:05,851
The car might explode.

1148
00:48:05,852 --> 00:48:07,122
(Joking)

1149
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:14,462
When you chose the bag, did you wish it belonged to someone particular?

1150
00:48:15,262 --> 00:48:17,192
Well... To be honest,

1151
00:48:17,292 --> 00:48:22,062
there were a few men I wanted to talk to at first.

1152
00:48:23,832 --> 00:48:26,002
And you were one of them.

1153
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:27,471
He was one of them?

1154
00:48:27,472 --> 00:48:29,472
One of the men you wanted to talk to?

1155
00:48:30,472 --> 00:48:32,012
(Thinking)

1156
00:48:32,782 --> 00:48:35,512
I wanted to talk to you, but...

1157
00:48:36,082 --> 00:48:37,682
But...

1158
00:48:37,912 --> 00:48:40,252
you seemed to be so clear about whom you liked.

1159
00:48:40,882 --> 00:48:45,222
So it was a bit difficult for me to approach you.

1160
00:48:45,662 --> 00:48:46,791
And... Well...

1161
00:48:46,792 --> 00:48:48,291
(Hesitating)

1162
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,831
What...

1163
00:48:49,832 --> 00:48:50,961
(Embarrassed)

1164
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:54,432
I made eye contact with you many times.

1165
00:48:54,732 --> 00:48:55,932
(Realizing)

1166
00:48:57,802 --> 00:48:59,502
That's good. Ye Eun, you're doing great.

1167
00:49:00,202 --> 00:49:02,272
Why doesn't Mu Jin respond to that?

1168
00:49:03,072 --> 00:49:07,112
I mean... I got this feeling when I saw you.

1169
00:49:07,312 --> 00:49:09,811
- What?
- The one I felt attracted to...

1170
00:49:09,812 --> 00:49:11,112
among all the guys.

1171
00:49:11,512 --> 00:49:14,482
And you were the one I got that feeling about.

1172
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:17,492
You got that feeling?

1173
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:20,522
I found you attractive when I first saw you.

1174
00:49:21,422 --> 00:49:24,461
Expressing your feelings like that...

1175
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,731
helps you get him interested.

1176
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:26,732
(Smiling)

1177
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:30,972
Was there a particular reason you wanted to talk to me?

1178
00:49:32,442 --> 00:49:34,972
I liked your fashion style.

1179
00:49:35,302 --> 00:49:36,972
(Realizing)

1180
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:40,012
And your belongings in the bag...

1181
00:49:41,542 --> 00:49:43,112
I liked those too.

1182
00:49:43,312 --> 00:49:44,412
I liked everything.

1183
00:49:49,522 --> 00:49:52,152
Who did you want to be in the car?

1184
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:55,322
- The person I wanted to be with?
- Yes.

1185
00:49:57,762 --> 00:49:59,332
- Do you want to know?
- Yes.

1186
00:49:59,762 --> 00:50:01,601
(Mu Jin is contemplating.)

1187
00:50:01,602 --> 00:50:02,872
I think there's an answer she wants to hear.

1188
00:50:04,772 --> 00:50:05,802
It's a secret.

1189
00:50:08,042 --> 00:50:10,312
- I knew it.
- Good job.

1190
00:50:12,072 --> 00:50:13,382
Why won't you tell me?

1191
00:50:15,082 --> 00:50:17,212
(Smiling)

1192
00:50:17,852 --> 00:50:20,221
(Hesitating)

1193
00:50:20,222 --> 00:50:22,422
Do I seem high-spirited?

1194
00:50:23,292 --> 00:50:24,322
- Do you seem high-spirited?
- Yes.

1195
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,591
You don't seem very calm.

1196
00:50:26,592 --> 00:50:27,762
- Really?
- Yes.

1197
00:50:28,622 --> 00:50:31,832
The thing is... That's why...

1198
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:36,071
I don't usually act cute.

1199
00:50:36,072 --> 00:50:40,001
But as I tried to be friendly and outgoing,

1200
00:50:40,002 --> 00:50:42,912
I found myself acting cute more than I thought I would.

1201
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:44,741
I realized that.

1202
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:48,041
And that made me worry...

1203
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:49,511
(Because she acted more cheerful to bond with the others...)

1204
00:50:49,512 --> 00:50:51,712
if the guys thought I was too childish.

1205
00:50:52,212 --> 00:50:55,151
The thought crossed my mind...

1206
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,452
and worried me a little bit.

1207
00:50:58,122 --> 00:51:01,561
It's not who I am, but just a side of me.

1208
00:51:01,562 --> 00:51:06,101
I was afraid you guys might think of me that way.

1209
00:51:06,102 --> 00:51:07,502
It worried me.

1210
00:51:07,862 --> 00:51:09,772
But I think that's what makes you charming.

1211
00:51:10,802 --> 00:51:11,802
What makes me charming?

1212
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,472
- The way you act cute.
- I see.

1213
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:15,572
And you're good with words.

1214
00:51:16,142 --> 00:51:18,412
You're bubbly and cheerful.

1215
00:51:18,872 --> 00:51:20,912
You caught my attention because of that.

1216
00:51:22,582 --> 00:51:25,352
(Ye Eun smiles happily.)

1217
00:51:25,952 --> 00:51:28,251
- They look great together.
- Right.

1218
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,922
(It'll be fun to watch their unique chemistry.)

1219
00:51:31,452 --> 00:51:34,561
(Yeong Gyeong and Sang Hyeon are heading to a restaurant.)

1220
00:51:34,562 --> 00:51:36,431
I also have a tendency to do that.

1221
00:51:36,432 --> 00:51:39,862
You seem to be very cautious about what you say.

1222
00:51:40,262 --> 00:51:41,432
- Oh, me?
- Yes.

1223
00:51:41,802 --> 00:51:44,071
- Oh, I see.
- Those who talk slowly,

1224
00:51:44,072 --> 00:51:46,442
including myself, have something in common.

1225
00:51:46,972 --> 00:51:50,311
Even when we talk a lot, people don't really notice it.

1226
00:51:50,312 --> 00:51:52,041
- Oh, I get it.
- Don't you think so?

1227
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,782
- That's right.
- I talked quite a lot,

1228
00:51:54,882 --> 00:51:57,682
but people think I'm a quiet person.

1229
00:51:58,182 --> 00:51:59,921
They say I don't talk much.

1230
00:51:59,922 --> 00:52:02,892
That's right. Also, since we speak slowly,

1231
00:52:03,252 --> 00:52:06,062
when there are many people around me,

1232
00:52:06,492 --> 00:52:09,661
they would jump in...

1233
00:52:09,662 --> 00:52:11,732
- while I'm talking.
- Right.

1234
00:52:11,832 --> 00:52:13,561
So I guess that naturally makes me...

1235
00:52:13,562 --> 00:52:15,832
- talk less.
- Right.

1236
00:52:16,102 --> 00:52:17,172
Absolutely.

1237
00:52:17,732 --> 00:52:19,271
Things are going well between them.

1238
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:20,402
- They're alike.
- It's going well between them.

1239
00:52:21,602 --> 00:52:24,741
I wanted to talk to you when we first met...

1240
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:25,742
Yes.

1241
00:52:25,772 --> 00:52:29,812
Well... Because I like a man who is caring and sincere...

1242
00:52:30,152 --> 00:52:33,851
and who has a gentle, mild nature.

1243
00:52:33,852 --> 00:52:36,322
- I see. Yes.
- Such a man suits my personality.

1244
00:52:36,952 --> 00:52:41,962
On the first day, I saw that you had hurt your hand.

1245
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,032
Yes, I did.

1246
00:52:45,132 --> 00:52:46,962
(When they were having apples that Sang Hyeon peeled...)

1247
00:52:47,162 --> 00:52:49,402
(Did you get hurt while peeling the apples?)

1248
00:52:49,672 --> 00:52:53,802
(Yeong Gyeong spotted the wound, which no one else noticed.)

1249
00:52:54,042 --> 00:52:58,211
Seeing that you hurt your hand while peeling the apples...

1250
00:52:58,212 --> 00:52:59,782
for everyone,

1251
00:53:00,112 --> 00:53:03,411
- I thought you were thoughtful.
- Really?

1252
00:53:03,412 --> 00:53:05,552
That crossed my mind.

1253
00:53:05,652 --> 00:53:07,622
(Surprised)

1254
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:12,862
(Yeong Gyeong expresses her feelings honestly.)

1255
00:53:13,762 --> 00:53:16,792
(Her compliments make him smile.)

1256
00:53:17,492 --> 00:53:20,562
(While getting to know each other, they arrive at the destination.)

1257
00:53:22,772 --> 00:53:26,142
(The date planned by Yeong Gyeong)

1258
00:53:28,902 --> 00:53:31,541
- That place is beautiful.
- It's nice.

1259
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,572
(A French restaurant with exotic vibes)

1260
00:53:39,552 --> 00:53:40,952
(Impressed)

1261
00:53:41,682 --> 00:53:43,291
This is such an elegant place.

1262
00:53:43,292 --> 00:53:46,191
- "Elegant?" That's funny.
- Why would you say that?

1263
00:53:46,192 --> 00:53:47,622
(Smiling)

1264
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:50,662
- It's beautiful, right?
- Yes, it's beautiful.

1265
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:53,232
(Flustered)

1266
00:53:55,972 --> 00:53:59,772
(He pours water into a glass for Yeong Gyeong first.)

1267
00:54:00,472 --> 00:54:01,742
(Glancing)

1268
00:54:03,442 --> 00:54:04,772
(Chuckling)

1269
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,042
Why?

1270
00:54:08,742 --> 00:54:12,452
Should I tuck this into my collar or spread it on my lap?

1271
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:16,521
(Chuckling)

1272
00:54:16,522 --> 00:54:18,022
- Here?
- Is that right?

1273
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:20,792
Is that right? Should I tuck it into my collar?

1274
00:54:21,822 --> 00:54:23,231
You should tuck it into the collar.

1275
00:54:23,232 --> 00:54:24,662
(Joking)

1276
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:27,931
(He does as she says.)

1277
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,032
Is this right, really?

1278
00:54:29,372 --> 00:54:31,571
- He's so cute.
- Come on, Yeong Gyeong.

1279
00:54:31,572 --> 00:54:32,572
(Only SOOBIN has no opinion on it.)

1280
00:54:32,573 --> 00:54:34,401
That is so cute.

1281
00:54:34,402 --> 00:54:35,542
(My, he's so cute.)

1282
00:54:36,242 --> 00:54:38,711
(He does as she says.)

1283
00:54:38,712 --> 00:54:39,812
Is this right, really?

1284
00:54:40,512 --> 00:54:42,582
(She finds him cute.)

1285
00:54:43,752 --> 00:54:45,251
(Taken aback)

1286
00:54:45,252 --> 00:54:47,282
- Oh, this should be... Okay.
- Spread it on your lap.

1287
00:54:48,382 --> 00:54:49,522
That was cute.

1288
00:54:49,892 --> 00:54:51,421
That was cute.

1289
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:52,921
(Shy)

1290
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,462
He tucked it into his collar.

1291
00:54:56,832 --> 00:55:01,302
It was a new side of him. I found him so cute.

1292
00:55:01,802 --> 00:55:06,201
I thought, "He sure is a younger man."

1293
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,272
(He sure is a younger man.)

1294
00:55:08,202 --> 00:55:10,472
I don't go to a fancy restaurant like this often.

1295
00:55:10,972 --> 00:55:12,011
Really?

1296
00:55:12,012 --> 00:55:14,612
Of course. Only when I go on a date...

1297
00:55:14,682 --> 00:55:18,052
I only go to such a place on a special date.

1298
00:55:20,922 --> 00:55:23,752
(Looking around)

1299
00:55:24,092 --> 00:55:26,092
- This place suits you.
- Sorry?

1300
00:55:26,522 --> 00:55:28,261
Your outfit suits the place too.

1301
00:55:28,262 --> 00:55:29,531
(He compliments her without looking at her, which is his specialty.)

1302
00:55:29,532 --> 00:55:32,091
- Oh, the place suits me?
- Yes, it suits you well.

1303
00:55:32,092 --> 00:55:33,662
- Because of my outfit?
- Yes.

1304
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:37,802
This place suits you very well.

1305
00:55:39,972 --> 00:55:41,072
You picked a nice place.

1306
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:43,772
(He's talking to the air as he feels shy.)

1307
00:55:47,282 --> 00:55:48,282
Thank you.

1308
00:55:48,283 --> 00:55:49,951
(Meanwhile, bread is served as an appetizer.)

1309
00:55:49,952 --> 00:55:51,182
Eat a lot.

1310
00:55:51,252 --> 00:55:52,412
Shall I give you one?

1311
00:55:53,882 --> 00:55:55,122
- I haven't used these yet.
- Sure.

1312
00:55:55,622 --> 00:55:56,651
That's nice of you.

1313
00:55:56,652 --> 00:55:57,752
(Surprised)

1314
00:55:59,562 --> 00:56:00,622
What are you doing?

1315
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:03,632
- You basically threw it.
- That wasn't my intention. Sorry.

1316
00:56:03,732 --> 00:56:06,731
I'm not used to these things. I'd appreciate it if you find it cute.

1317
00:56:06,732 --> 00:56:09,032
He said, "I'd appreciate if you find it cute."

1318
00:56:09,832 --> 00:56:12,632
- I'll enjoy it. Thank you.
- I'm not used to these things.

1319
00:56:13,502 --> 00:56:15,402
The butter is cut nicely.

1320
00:56:16,442 --> 00:56:18,012
Shall I put it on the bread so that it melts?

1321
00:56:19,612 --> 00:56:21,482
(Skillful)

1322
00:56:21,582 --> 00:56:24,712
(Unlike Yeong Gyeong, who's used to it, Sang Hyeon...)

1323
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,221
(He doesn't know what to do.)

1324
00:56:26,222 --> 00:56:27,581
He can use his hands.

1325
00:56:27,582 --> 00:56:29,381
I guess he can't use his hands thinking it's bad manners.

1326
00:56:29,382 --> 00:56:30,392
He's doing as she does.

1327
00:56:30,892 --> 00:56:32,722
He watches Yeong Gyeong and copies her.

1328
00:56:34,422 --> 00:56:36,162
Oh, my. It's good.

1329
00:56:37,262 --> 00:56:39,962
I didn't even know how to put the fork down.

1330
00:56:40,562 --> 00:56:43,932
I didn't know if I should use the butter knife...

1331
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:46,872
or the other knife on the table.

1332
00:56:47,702 --> 00:56:49,342
Since I didn't even know that,

1333
00:56:49,642 --> 00:56:51,741
I thought, "We're different."

1334
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,112
(He realized that he's had different experiences from her.)

1335
00:56:53,382 --> 00:56:56,112
I meant to dress up and look nice.

1336
00:56:56,782 --> 00:57:00,851
But I just put on a shirt, which looks quite casual.

1337
00:57:00,852 --> 00:57:04,692
She was wearing a two-piece outfit. She was like a city girl,

1338
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:08,091
and I was like a country boy. A country bumpkin.

1339
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:09,932
That's how it was.

1340
00:57:10,032 --> 00:57:13,932
And the city girl took me to a French restaurant.

1341
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:17,201
(The city girl and country boy went to a French restaurant.)

1342
00:57:17,202 --> 00:57:18,272
It's good.

1343
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:20,472
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1344
00:57:21,402 --> 00:57:23,511
(After checking Sang Hyeon, )

1345
00:57:23,512 --> 00:57:25,642
(Yeong Gyeong takes a bite too.)

1346
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,742
(Peeking)

1347
00:57:30,012 --> 00:57:32,882
I think it's our first time to talk face-to-face.

1348
00:57:34,852 --> 00:57:37,152
It's the first time. Yes.

1349
00:57:38,692 --> 00:57:41,162
We didn't have a chance to talk.

1350
00:57:41,662 --> 00:57:43,861
It's me too.

1351
00:57:43,862 --> 00:57:46,162
I become like a robot, you see.

1352
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:51,102
When I feel awkward, I become like a robot.

1353
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,542
Do you feel awkward?

1354
00:57:54,742 --> 00:57:57,342
(Giggling)

1355
00:57:57,572 --> 00:57:58,841
(Staring)

1356
00:57:58,842 --> 00:57:59,942
Oh, dear.

1357
00:58:00,942 --> 00:58:01,981
(Eyes fixed on him)

1358
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:03,612
He won't look her in the eye.

1359
00:58:04,852 --> 00:58:07,981
When he was with Ye Eun, he couldn't look at her either.

1360
00:58:07,982 --> 00:58:09,022
Right.

1361
00:58:09,322 --> 00:58:11,491
(When he went on his first date, )

1362
00:58:11,492 --> 00:58:14,522
(Sang Hyeon couldn't look at his date either.)

1363
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:17,032
It's the third day, you know.

1364
00:58:17,462 --> 00:58:18,661
Since it's the third day,

1365
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:21,632
I want him to be more aggressive.

1366
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:23,501
But he's just too shy.

1367
00:58:23,502 --> 00:58:24,702
- Who is?
- And it frustrates me a little.

1368
00:58:24,932 --> 00:58:26,201
- Sang Hyeon?
- Yes.

1369
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:27,772
I want him to be a little more aggressive.

1370
00:58:27,842 --> 00:58:29,672
- Are you frustrated?
- A little.

1371
00:58:30,712 --> 00:58:32,642
(Amazed)

1372
00:58:32,982 --> 00:58:34,742
- It looks so good.
- I know.

1373
00:58:34,842 --> 00:58:38,011
I haven't had a good steak like this in a long time.

1374
00:58:38,012 --> 00:58:39,512
- Is that right?
- A thick one.

1375
00:58:39,822 --> 00:58:41,052
Do you like it?

1376
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:42,951
I love it, of course.

1377
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,321
Can I dig in? Should we eat together?

1378
00:58:44,322 --> 00:58:45,452
Go ahead.

1379
00:58:46,052 --> 00:58:47,162
Eat a lot.

1380
00:58:47,192 --> 00:58:48,322
(Shaking)

1381
00:58:48,822 --> 00:58:50,992
(Slicing)

1382
00:58:51,792 --> 00:58:54,531
(Yeong Gyeong watches Sang Hyeon slicing the steak.)

1383
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:56,472
(Staring)

1384
00:58:58,102 --> 00:58:59,102
(Peeking)

1385
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,072
Why are you staring at me?

1386
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,941
(Giggling)

1387
00:59:03,942 --> 00:59:05,812
I wanted to see if you were eating well.

1388
00:59:06,212 --> 00:59:07,312
It's good.

1389
00:59:07,882 --> 00:59:09,282
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1390
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:12,382
(She keeps staring.)

1391
00:59:13,252 --> 00:59:14,821
Please stop. You should eat too.

1392
00:59:14,822 --> 00:59:15,922
- "Please stop." - Okay.

1393
00:59:16,622 --> 00:59:17,722
Enjoy.

1394
00:59:17,952 --> 00:59:19,762
Enjoy.

1395
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:26,502
(Finally, Yeong Gyeong eats the steak.)

1396
00:59:27,302 --> 00:59:28,531
Look at this tiny cabbage.

1397
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:29,562
(Fascinated)

1398
00:59:29,802 --> 00:59:32,132
That's grilled, so it must be really yummy.

1399
00:59:32,572 --> 00:59:33,772
Savory and sweet.

1400
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,411
(Yum)

1401
00:59:37,412 --> 00:59:38,512
It's good.

1402
00:59:39,912 --> 00:59:41,382
Do you want to eat mine too?

1403
00:59:42,382 --> 00:59:44,551
(The country bumpkin likes it.)

1404
00:59:44,552 --> 00:59:46,622
Is your hobby making someone eat good food?

1405
00:59:47,252 --> 00:59:49,222
- Yes.
- Really?

1406
00:59:50,252 --> 00:59:51,952
I'm very pleased right now.

1407
00:59:52,252 --> 00:59:53,692
I'm happy that you're enjoying it.

1408
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:56,022
It's really good.

1409
00:59:56,932 --> 00:59:59,431
I love going to a good restaurant.

1410
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:00,432
Do you?

1411
01:00:01,532 --> 01:00:04,931
If the person I went to the restaurant with...

1412
01:00:04,932 --> 01:00:07,602
enjoys the food, that makes me happy.

1413
01:00:08,642 --> 01:00:10,212
I love being happy...

1414
01:00:10,772 --> 01:00:13,442
with the person I'm with.

1415
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:18,582
So it's important to me that the other person is happy.

1416
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,152
I'm happy right now.

1417
01:00:21,252 --> 01:00:22,882
- You look happy.
- I am really happy.

1418
01:00:23,822 --> 01:00:24,922
This is so good.

1419
01:00:26,592 --> 01:00:27,692
I'm glad to hear that.

1420
01:00:28,022 --> 01:00:31,662
Everything Yeong Gyeong says shows how thoughtful she is.

1421
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:35,101
She's different from when she's with Hyeon Jun.

1422
01:00:35,102 --> 01:00:36,102
- Right.
- She's different.

1423
01:00:36,103 --> 01:00:37,472
- She adores him.
- Yes.

1424
01:00:37,802 --> 01:00:39,742
What would you do if you were in that situation?

1425
01:00:40,072 --> 01:00:42,241
Imagine the girl you're on a date with keeps staring at you...

1426
01:00:42,242 --> 01:00:43,542
without eating.

1427
01:00:43,642 --> 01:00:47,112
I wouldn't be as uncomfortable as Sang Hyeon.

1428
01:00:47,642 --> 01:00:49,011
- I would be...
- Not too uncomfortable.

1429
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,451
I would just think it pleases her to see me eat.

1430
01:00:50,452 --> 01:00:52,111
And that would make me happy.

1431
01:00:52,112 --> 01:00:54,481
"It pleases her to see me eat" sounds a bit strange, doesn't it?

1432
01:00:54,482 --> 01:00:56,521
- What's wrong with that?
- "Pleases her"?

1433
01:00:56,522 --> 01:00:57,891
You should apologize to her.

1434
01:00:57,892 --> 01:00:59,452
That's not it.

1435
01:00:59,552 --> 01:01:00,661
When you say it pleases her,

1436
01:01:00,662 --> 01:01:03,132
it makes the older woman flinch a little.

1437
01:01:03,492 --> 01:01:05,531
Does it make you seem like his superior?

1438
01:01:05,532 --> 01:01:07,301
Right.

1439
01:01:07,302 --> 01:01:08,402
It's difficult.

1440
01:01:11,132 --> 01:01:12,401
That's how sensitive they are.

1441
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:13,802
(I should be careful.)

1442
01:01:14,242 --> 01:01:17,412
I wanted to hear...

1443
01:01:18,372 --> 01:01:19,882
more about what you do.

1444
01:01:20,312 --> 01:01:23,712
I thought hard about how to introduce my job.

1445
01:01:24,082 --> 01:01:26,581
(Focused)

1446
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:27,852
I will put it easily.

1447
01:01:27,952 --> 01:01:31,491
There must be a record about what stocks you've bought.

1448
01:01:31,492 --> 01:01:33,792
You need to keep that record somewhere.

1449
01:01:34,222 --> 01:01:38,832
And someone has to manage that record.

1450
01:01:39,432 --> 01:01:41,731
My job is to manage...

1451
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:43,901
those data.

1452
01:01:43,902 --> 01:01:47,201
- That's so easily put.
- Database management.

1453
01:01:47,202 --> 01:01:50,642
The person who manages it is called a database administrator.

1454
01:01:50,942 --> 01:01:53,182
And it's shortened as DBA.

1455
01:01:53,582 --> 01:01:55,582
That's what I do.

1456
01:01:56,342 --> 01:01:57,512
Mr. DBA.

1457
01:01:59,712 --> 01:02:02,252
It's my first time to explain my job this way.

1458
01:02:02,982 --> 01:02:04,951
- You explained it well.
- I did well, didn't I?

1459
01:02:04,952 --> 01:02:06,821
It was very easy to understand.

1460
01:02:06,822 --> 01:02:07,991
I'm proud of myself.

1461
01:02:07,992 --> 01:02:09,392
(He's proud of himself.)

1462
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,332
I understood it perfectly.

1463
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:13,662
I love being complimented.

1464
01:02:14,662 --> 01:02:15,862
- You do?
- Yes.

1465
01:02:16,102 --> 01:02:17,802
(He's cute.)

1466
01:02:18,202 --> 01:02:19,432
I'm very proud.

1467
01:02:20,372 --> 01:02:22,772
You clearly sound like an INFP person.

1468
01:02:26,412 --> 01:02:29,781
One of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is...

1469
01:02:29,782 --> 01:02:30,812
Yes.

1470
01:02:31,212 --> 01:02:34,121
When I do the MBTI compatibility test,

1471
01:02:34,122 --> 01:02:35,122
Yes.

1472
01:02:35,123 --> 01:02:37,252
it always says that I'm most compatible...

1473
01:02:38,022 --> 01:02:40,121
with an INFP person.

1474
01:02:40,122 --> 01:02:41,392
- Really?
- Yes.

1475
01:02:41,862 --> 01:02:42,962
Are you type ENFJ?

1476
01:02:44,532 --> 01:02:45,632
I am type ENFJ.

1477
01:02:46,962 --> 01:02:48,662
What was your ideal type again?

1478
01:02:51,472 --> 01:02:54,242
Someone who looks cold, someone who looks like a cat.

1479
01:02:55,002 --> 01:02:56,172
I think that's my type.

1480
01:02:56,872 --> 01:03:00,542
I don't mind it if she's picky and particular.

1481
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:04,251
I'm the type of person who's okay with everything.

1482
01:03:04,252 --> 01:03:07,222
I tend to be like that.

1483
01:03:07,882 --> 01:03:11,192
So I can go along with how she is.

1484
01:03:12,192 --> 01:03:15,422
You seem to be a very understanding person.

1485
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:18,632
(Shy)

1486
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:20,902
How about you, Yeong Gyeong?

1487
01:03:21,202 --> 01:03:22,302
- Me?
- Yes.

1488
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:26,542
When I'm in a relationship,

1489
01:03:26,642 --> 01:03:27,972
I give my everything to it.

1490
01:03:28,302 --> 01:03:30,011
But when it's over,

1491
01:03:30,012 --> 01:03:33,812
I have no regrets, and no holding back.

1492
01:03:35,082 --> 01:03:36,212
That's amazing.

1493
01:03:36,912 --> 01:03:38,012
She's amazing.

1494
01:03:40,422 --> 01:03:41,782
Are you okay dating a younger man?

1495
01:03:42,722 --> 01:03:44,022
A younger man?

1496
01:03:46,562 --> 01:03:49,792
I don't think age matters much.

1497
01:03:50,762 --> 01:03:52,431
I wouldn't like or not like someone...

1498
01:03:52,432 --> 01:03:55,062
just because he's younger.

1499
01:03:55,302 --> 01:03:56,362
Whether...

1500
01:03:56,872 --> 01:04:00,501
he is meant for me or not is more important.

1501
01:04:00,502 --> 01:04:02,942
(Whether he is meant for me or not is more important.)

1502
01:04:05,312 --> 01:04:07,012
You are a deep person.

1503
01:04:07,482 --> 01:04:08,612
You have the power...

1504
01:04:09,782 --> 01:04:11,982
- Me?
- to draw someone in.

1505
01:04:12,752 --> 01:04:14,022
Did he just say that?

1506
01:04:14,252 --> 01:04:15,652
But he still can't look at her.

1507
01:04:18,992 --> 01:04:23,592
I loved that I got to talk to him.

1508
01:04:24,892 --> 01:04:29,102
I found everything about him to be cute.

1509
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:31,932
I felt very comfortable.

1510
01:04:33,442 --> 01:04:35,772
It made me want to...

1511
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,612
get to know him more.

1512
01:04:39,912 --> 01:04:43,182
It looks like Sang Hyeon is starting to have feelings for her.

1513
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:44,581
- I don't think so.
- Really?

1514
01:04:44,582 --> 01:04:46,351
Compared to the first time.

1515
01:04:46,352 --> 01:04:47,722
He had no interest in her at all.

1516
01:04:48,022 --> 01:04:49,551
- He had zero interest.
- Here's what I think.

1517
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,452
Yeong Gyeong got who she wanted,

1518
01:04:51,892 --> 01:04:54,521
so she must've been very happy with the date.

1519
01:04:54,522 --> 01:04:57,292
- Yes.
- I think, honestly, she wasn't...

1520
01:04:57,862 --> 01:05:01,502
the date Sang Hyeon wanted.

1521
01:05:02,202 --> 01:05:04,602
I thought Sang Hyeon...

1522
01:05:04,972 --> 01:05:08,172
didn't have much interest in her.

1523
01:05:08,772 --> 01:05:11,211
I couldn't tell if this was a date or a business meeting.

1524
01:05:11,212 --> 01:05:12,442
He didn't...

1525
01:05:13,212 --> 01:05:14,881
ask about her type,

1526
01:05:14,882 --> 01:05:18,011
her taste, or her hobby.

1527
01:05:18,012 --> 01:05:19,912
He wasn't curious about her at all.

1528
01:05:20,252 --> 01:05:22,181
- Right.
- He talked about his job.

1529
01:05:22,182 --> 01:05:23,722
- He wasn't curious about her.
- Right.

1530
01:05:23,822 --> 01:05:25,322
He didn't ask questions.

1531
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:28,222
I think only Yeong Gyeong was curious about her date.

1532
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:30,291
- You're right. Sang Hyeon wasn't.
- They weren't questions...

1533
01:05:30,292 --> 01:05:31,561
- you would ask a woman you like.
- Right.

1534
01:05:31,562 --> 01:05:34,261
They weren't questions you would ask a woman you are interested in.

1535
01:05:34,262 --> 01:05:35,262
Right.

1536
01:05:36,772 --> 01:05:37,902
It's here.

1537
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:40,001
I said I was craving grilled tripe.

1538
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:41,202
- Grilled tripe?
- Yes.

1539
01:05:42,242 --> 01:05:44,041
- I am so curious...
- Should we sit here?

1540
01:05:44,042 --> 01:05:45,372
- about how they would turn out.
- Sounds good.

1541
01:05:46,612 --> 01:05:48,242
Let's take a seat.

1542
01:05:49,282 --> 01:05:51,412
You were craving meat yesterday.

1543
01:05:51,552 --> 01:05:52,582
Yes.

1544
01:05:53,012 --> 01:05:54,221
I really wanted to eat meat.

1545
01:05:54,222 --> 01:05:55,352
- Really?
- Yes.

1546
01:05:55,782 --> 01:05:57,452
I didn't think of tripe though.

1547
01:05:58,792 --> 01:06:00,322
You've had it before, right?

1548
01:06:00,492 --> 01:06:01,922
- I've had it before.
- Right?

1549
01:06:03,122 --> 01:06:05,362
- So you like tripe.
- Tripe?

1550
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:07,261
It's good.

1551
01:06:07,262 --> 01:06:08,962
I thought you wouldn't eat something like that.

1552
01:06:09,462 --> 01:06:11,171
No, I like it.

1553
01:06:11,172 --> 01:06:12,732
(Shy)

1554
01:06:13,872 --> 01:06:17,441
Why do you carry that hat in your bag?

1555
01:06:17,442 --> 01:06:19,072
It's the hat I wear the most often.

1556
01:06:19,972 --> 01:06:21,642
Did it surprise you that it's pink?

1557
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:24,312
I just thought, "It's colorful."

1558
01:06:24,552 --> 01:06:25,982
You didn't smell it, did you?

1559
01:06:26,312 --> 01:06:29,682
I didn't.

1560
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:31,692
It doesn't smell though.

1561
01:06:32,152 --> 01:06:33,791
I wash my hair before wearing a hat.

1562
01:06:33,792 --> 01:06:35,321
The hat looked clean.

1563
01:06:35,322 --> 01:06:36,421
- Did it?
- Yes.

1564
01:06:36,422 --> 01:06:38,332
(Relieved)

1565
01:06:39,032 --> 01:06:40,962
Thank you.

1566
01:06:41,362 --> 01:06:43,832
It was pre-cooked, so we can eat it.

1567
01:06:44,772 --> 01:06:47,542
Do you usually eat tripe in the daytime?

1568
01:06:47,672 --> 01:06:48,772
- No.
- In dinnertime, right?

1569
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:49,872
Yes.

1570
01:06:51,042 --> 01:06:52,712
I'm going to remember this.

1571
01:06:54,512 --> 01:06:56,951
- Right?
- I never imagined eating it now.

1572
01:06:56,952 --> 01:06:58,012
I know.

1573
01:06:59,452 --> 01:07:02,552
Is there any date you want to go on?

1574
01:07:04,192 --> 01:07:05,922
I want to go on a cooking date.

1575
01:07:07,192 --> 01:07:08,962
- Cooking together?
- Getting groceries and cooking.

1576
01:07:09,422 --> 01:07:10,562
That's nice.

1577
01:07:11,362 --> 01:07:13,762
(Hyeon Jun wants to show off his cooking skill.)

1578
01:07:14,032 --> 01:07:18,671
Is there anyone else you want to get to know...

1579
01:07:18,672 --> 01:07:20,502
and talk to?

1580
01:07:20,902 --> 01:07:21,972
That's a frequently asked question.

1581
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:23,871
There is, but it's a secret.

1582
01:07:23,872 --> 01:07:24,972
Really?

1583
01:07:26,012 --> 01:07:27,082
Well done.

1584
01:07:28,412 --> 01:07:29,442
I see.

1585
01:07:29,582 --> 01:07:31,051
I have a lot of secrets.

1586
01:07:31,052 --> 01:07:32,812
(When it's a difficult question, he just says it's a secret.)

1587
01:07:33,782 --> 01:07:37,821
(Hyeon Jun won't reveal what he's thinking to Ji Won.)

1588
01:07:37,822 --> 01:07:41,791
- It's not easy for Hyeon Jun.
- Why is it not easy?

1589
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:45,131
It's always been Yeong Gyeong for Hyeon Jun until now.

1590
01:07:45,132 --> 01:07:46,132
Right.

1591
01:07:46,133 --> 01:07:47,962
(Hyeon Jun had been after Yeong Gyeong consistently.)

1592
01:07:54,142 --> 01:07:55,772
- Hyeon Jun, look.
- Yes?

1593
01:08:00,182 --> 01:08:02,042
- I have something to tell you.
- What is it?

1594
01:08:03,142 --> 01:08:04,982
(Hesitating)

1595
01:08:05,612 --> 01:08:07,881
I don't know if you remember.

1596
01:08:07,882 --> 01:08:09,052
What? Remember?

1597
01:08:09,222 --> 01:08:10,552
Something must've happened between the two.

1598
01:08:11,992 --> 01:08:13,492
But I know you.

1599
01:08:14,162 --> 01:08:15,721
- You do?
- Yes.

1600
01:08:15,722 --> 01:08:16,762
How do you know me?

1601
01:08:18,492 --> 01:08:20,091
(Ji Won and Hyeon Jun know each other?)

1602
01:08:20,092 --> 01:08:21,202
How does she know him?

1603
01:08:22,697 --> 01:08:23,997
But I know you.

1604
01:08:24,797 --> 01:08:26,336
- You do?
- Yes.

1605
01:08:26,337 --> 01:08:27,337
How do you know me?

1606
01:08:28,967 --> 01:08:30,776
(Ji Won and Hyeon Jun know each other?)

1607
01:08:30,777 --> 01:08:31,877
How does she know him?

1608
01:08:35,747 --> 01:08:37,017
I once asked...

1609
01:08:38,017 --> 01:08:40,017
for your number.

1610
01:08:42,757 --> 01:08:45,287
(Everyone freezes.)

1611
01:08:45,357 --> 01:08:46,387
What?

1612
01:08:50,457 --> 01:08:53,166
(I once asked...)

1613
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:56,297
(for your number.)

1614
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:01,067
(Flustered)

1615
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,166
(Right.)

1616
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:03,207
Yes.

1617
01:09:04,007 --> 01:09:05,807
Are you still there then?

1618
01:09:06,277 --> 01:09:07,277
Yes.

1619
01:09:07,347 --> 01:09:11,077
I live in the area. I was very surprised too.

1620
01:09:11,777 --> 01:09:12,887
Yes.

1621
01:09:13,687 --> 01:09:17,157
I asked for your number myself.

1622
01:09:17,417 --> 01:09:19,487
At the time, I was...

1623
01:09:20,587 --> 01:09:23,727
interested in you, so I asked for your number.

1624
01:09:24,697 --> 01:09:26,126
(Nodding)

1625
01:09:26,127 --> 01:09:27,197
Right.

1626
01:09:28,967 --> 01:09:31,437
You might not remember me.

1627
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:33,937
- So that's what happened.
- Yes. I was so surprised.

1628
01:09:34,867 --> 01:09:36,207
How can the world be so small?

1629
01:09:36,907 --> 01:09:38,537
- It's a small world, isn't it?
- It is.

1630
01:09:41,107 --> 01:09:46,417
(What's the story of Ji Won and Hyeon Jun?)

1631
01:09:47,447 --> 01:09:50,487
- I was working out at a gym.
- At a gym?

1632
01:09:50,757 --> 01:09:53,526
And appearance-wise, he was...

1633
01:09:53,527 --> 01:09:55,457
completely my type.

1634
01:09:55,887 --> 01:09:58,797
So I asked for his number.

1635
01:09:59,397 --> 01:10:01,667
But it didn't turn into...

1636
01:10:01,967 --> 01:10:04,866
a relationship.

1637
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,106
So they talked.

1638
01:10:06,107 --> 01:10:09,906
I just knew his name.

1639
01:10:09,907 --> 01:10:12,506
He didn't turn her down, but things didn't work out.

1640
01:10:12,507 --> 01:10:15,377
(After time passed, they met again by chance.)

1641
01:10:15,707 --> 01:10:17,516
- Hello.
- Hello.

1642
01:10:17,517 --> 01:10:19,276
- Hello.
- Hello.

1643
01:10:19,277 --> 01:10:22,347
There was someone tall and handsome.

1644
01:10:22,987 --> 01:10:24,357
Our eyes locked,

1645
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:28,457
and I couldn't believe we met here again.

1646
01:10:29,057 --> 01:10:31,297
I was flustered and surprised.

1647
01:10:31,357 --> 01:10:33,197
Honestly, I panicked a little.

1648
01:10:33,227 --> 01:10:34,866
That must've been shocking.

1649
01:10:34,867 --> 01:10:37,567
She said she asked for my number.

1650
01:10:39,437 --> 01:10:40,467
Actually,

1651
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:43,006
that's when I realized it.

1652
01:10:43,007 --> 01:10:46,247
That she was that lady.

1653
01:10:46,447 --> 01:10:49,007
It ended as a happening.

1654
01:10:52,547 --> 01:10:53,587
That's why...

1655
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:58,616
I couldn't talk to you when we were in the house.

1656
01:10:58,617 --> 01:10:59,656
That's why...

1657
01:10:59,657 --> 01:11:00,826
(Ji Won couldn't approach him.)

1658
01:11:00,827 --> 01:11:02,027
- Hold on.
- Yes.

1659
01:11:02,687 --> 01:11:05,796
I had to think about how to tell you about it.

1660
01:11:05,797 --> 01:11:07,397
- Right, it's hard.
- I had to think about it.

1661
01:11:07,827 --> 01:11:09,426
So, yes.

1662
01:11:09,427 --> 01:11:12,867
(Ji Won used this chance to bring it up.)

1663
01:11:12,937 --> 01:11:14,807
- So that's what happened.
- I think it made things awkward.

1664
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:16,377
Let's be the same.

1665
01:11:16,837 --> 01:11:19,006
Let's not be embarrassed.

1666
01:11:19,007 --> 01:11:21,106
You should just do what you want to do.

1667
01:11:21,107 --> 01:11:22,346
- Okay.
- Okay.

1668
01:11:22,347 --> 01:11:23,847
- I will do that.
- That happened before.

1669
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:25,617
- Right.
- That happened then.

1670
01:11:26,887 --> 01:11:29,047
Great. Eat some more.

1671
01:11:29,957 --> 01:11:30,957
Okay.

1672
01:11:31,087 --> 01:11:32,887
- I lost my appetite suddenly.
- We are from the same place.

1673
01:11:34,927 --> 01:11:38,656
(Their paths crossed in the past. What's going to happen to them?)

1674
01:11:38,657 --> 01:11:40,197
- Now you know.
- Yes.

1675
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,627
How can this happen?

1676
01:11:44,037 --> 01:11:46,466
The two people whose paths crossed in the past...

1677
01:11:46,467 --> 01:11:49,067
- came to meet again.
- What a small world.

1678
01:11:49,877 --> 01:11:52,837
Should we say it's fate?

1679
01:11:53,347 --> 01:11:55,246
- It can be fate.
- Or is it a bad connection?

1680
01:11:55,247 --> 01:11:56,547
It can be fate.

1681
01:11:57,077 --> 01:11:59,546
I think Hyeon Jun could be a little flustered.

1682
01:11:59,547 --> 01:12:02,417
But when someone is that honest with him...

1683
01:12:02,957 --> 01:12:05,986
"Hyeon Jun,"

1684
01:12:05,987 --> 01:12:08,127
"I had an interest in you."

1685
01:12:08,627 --> 01:12:09,727
In a way,

1686
01:12:10,027 --> 01:12:11,757
Ji Won made a bold move.

1687
01:12:11,897 --> 01:12:14,397
It's an all-or-nothing situation.

1688
01:12:14,527 --> 01:12:16,296
I never expected this.

1689
01:12:16,297 --> 01:12:17,297
(What will happen to the two who crossed paths in the past?)

1690
01:12:17,497 --> 01:12:19,806
(The random dates of the younger men and women continue.)

1691
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:21,607
I've been wanting to talk to Mu Jin.

1692
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:24,236
Ye Eun was one of the girls...

1693
01:12:24,237 --> 01:12:26,547
I wanted to talk to, so it felt good.

1694
01:12:26,907 --> 01:12:29,176
(They feel the happy flutter they haven't felt in a while.)

1695
01:12:29,177 --> 01:12:32,777
I wanted to talk to him.

1696
01:12:33,717 --> 01:12:35,887
(New emotions rise.)

1697
01:12:38,317 --> 01:12:40,627
(Excuse me.)

1698
01:12:40,657 --> 01:12:41,986
(A new older woman comes...)

1699
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:44,357
(to the empty Yeon House.)

1700
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,167
She's on another level.

1701
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:50,337
(I've never seen someone like that in my life.)

1702
01:12:50,637 --> 01:12:51,897
(She's closest to being my type.)

1703
01:12:52,037 --> 01:12:53,637
(Finally, it's today.)

1704
01:12:54,107 --> 01:12:55,707
(I was bothered.)

1705
01:12:56,207 --> 01:12:59,907
(Subtle tension arises among the ladies.)

1706
01:13:01,307 --> 01:13:02,447
It's getting more confusing.

1707
01:13:03,317 --> 01:13:04,417
I'm puzzled.

1708
01:13:04,717 --> 01:13:07,816
I was always...

1709
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:09,757
into Bon Hee.

1710
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:16,727
But these two are already too solid.

1711
01:13:16,757 --> 01:13:18,256
- It's not like that.
- It's not like that.

1712
01:13:18,257 --> 01:13:20,497
We are close, but we are competing.

1713
01:13:21,067 --> 01:13:26,207
(As time passes, the younger men starts to reveal their feelings.)
