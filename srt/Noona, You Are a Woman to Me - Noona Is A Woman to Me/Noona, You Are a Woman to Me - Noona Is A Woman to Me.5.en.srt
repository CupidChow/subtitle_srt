1
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:08,894
(For the first time, Sang Hyeon asked to talk to Bon Hee.)

2
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:12,703
(I felt sorry about it,)

3
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:14,274
(so I asked you to talk in private.)

4
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:18,674
(I wanted to have a date with you today.)

5
00:00:18,904 --> 00:00:20,773
(I was just as grateful...)

6
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:23,014
(as the courage he showed me.)

7
00:00:23,244 --> 00:00:25,113
(And because of it,)

8
00:00:25,114 --> 00:00:26,784
(I wanted to know more about him.)

9
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:30,124
(Preference-based date, What's In My Bag)

10
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:32,584
(The older women chose their date according to the men's belongings.)

11
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:35,094
(I'll pick this one.)

12
00:00:35,824 --> 00:00:38,964
(Yeong Gyeong chose, hoping it was Sang Hyeon.)

13
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,494
(Ji Won chose, thinking it was Ji Yung.)

14
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:44,704
I'll choose solely based on the items in the bag.

15
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:48,034
(Ye Eun chose, hoping it was Sang Won.)

16
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,503
(All the other items in that bag didn't look like Mu Jin's,)

17
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:52,604
(but I was certain about the lip balm.)

18
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,844
(So, I was really torn before I picked that.)

19
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:57,613
(Hoping it was Mu Jin's,)

20
00:00:57,614 --> 00:00:59,784
(she chose the khaki-colored bag.)

21
00:01:00,614 --> 00:01:02,453
(The older women hope the younger men they have in mind...)

22
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:03,984
(get in their cars.)

23
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:08,254
(Sang Hyeon, whom Yeong Gyeong dearly hoped for)

24
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:11,994
(As she hoped, he was her match!)

25
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:14,534
(I hope it's Ji Yung.)

26
00:01:14,764 --> 00:01:16,603
(However, after that,)

27
00:01:16,604 --> 00:01:19,564
(all the guesses were off.)

28
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:22,733
(The one who chose Mu Jin's bag...)

29
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:26,174
(was Ye Eun, not Bon Hee.)

30
00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:28,374
(Bummed out)

31
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:30,783
(The owner of the bag Bon Hee chose...)

32
00:01:30,784 --> 00:01:33,184
(was Ji Yung.)

33
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:36,384
- Hi.
- Hi.

34
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:39,124
(I was so surprised.)

35
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:41,524
(I thought it was good.)

36
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:46,834
(The feeling of excitement from the unexpected encounter)

37
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:49,804
(The successfully predicted date of Yeong Gyeong and Sang Hyeon)

38
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:52,433
(Sang Hyeon's younger-man moment...)

39
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:53,834
(of finding fine dining awkward)

40
00:01:54,134 --> 00:01:55,734
(Joking)

41
00:01:58,774 --> 00:02:00,214
(That was cute.)

42
00:02:02,614 --> 00:02:04,614
(The unexpected match date of Ji Won and Hyeon Jun)

43
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,754
(Hyeon Jun, look.)

44
00:02:08,454 --> 00:02:10,223
(I know you.)

45
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:11,224
How do you know me?

46
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:12,623
(I once asked...)

47
00:02:12,624 --> 00:02:14,494
(for your number.)

48
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:19,193
(Ji Won had asked for Hyeon Jun's number at the gym.)

49
00:02:19,194 --> 00:02:20,393
- It's a small world, isn't it?
- It is.

50
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:26,204
(What will happen to the two who have already met?)

51
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:28,773
All right, with every episode,

52
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,774
the relationships are getting more and more complicated.

53
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:32,804
We were taken aback too,

54
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:34,243
but Ji Won...

55
00:02:34,244 --> 00:02:35,743
(Hwangwoo Seul Hye)

56
00:02:35,744 --> 00:02:37,944
- She made a shocking statement.
- Yes.

57
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:40,014
It's an honesty...

58
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:42,183
that's rare to see on a dating reality show.

59
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:43,483
- True.
- Whether...

60
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:46,253
- You're right.
- that will help...

61
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:48,824
or harm the relationship...

62
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:50,763
is something to watch for.

63
00:02:50,764 --> 00:02:53,233
Yes, and Mu Jin, Bon Hee, and Sang Hyeon...

64
00:02:53,234 --> 00:02:54,763
are in a love triangle.

65
00:02:54,764 --> 00:02:56,064
- That's right.
- Yes.

66
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:58,103
It seemed like Yeong Gyeong...

67
00:02:58,104 --> 00:03:00,303
became interested in Sang Hyeon after the date.

68
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:03,073
I know, right? Things are constantly twisting and turning,

69
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:04,604
and they'll only get messier with time.

70
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,144
This seems like just the beginning.

71
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:07,614
Exactly.

72
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:11,013
(What's In My Bag Date: Ye Eun and Mu Jin)

73
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:13,083
It's my first time in Bukchon.

74
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:14,984
- Really?
- It's my first time ever here.

75
00:03:16,854 --> 00:03:18,884
The two look good together.

76
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:20,854
- I'm starving.
- Same here.

77
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:26,564
(The date course prepared by Ye Eun)

78
00:03:27,194 --> 00:03:28,293
(A modern yet traditional Korean dining)

79
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:29,493
What a pretty place.

80
00:03:29,494 --> 00:03:31,003
(A modern yet traditional Korean dining)

81
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:32,064
You're right.

82
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:33,804
That's so pretty.

83
00:03:33,904 --> 00:03:36,674
(Looking around)

84
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:38,503
(Smiling)

85
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:39,914
How did you find this place?

86
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:42,814
I searched like crazy online.

87
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:45,214
You found a nice one.

88
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:47,714
- I love places like these.
- You do?

89
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:51,084
Do you?

90
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:52,784
I do too.

91
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,364
(Feeling proud)

92
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:05,503
(Fusion Korean menu that Ye Eun chose)

93
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,634
It's beautiful.

94
00:04:08,574 --> 00:04:09,704
Cheers.

95
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:17,344
(Groaning)

96
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:20,714
(Impressed)

97
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:22,414
It's good.

98
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:24,954
(How cute.)

99
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,294
- Dig in.
- Enjoy.

100
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:31,324
(Stopping)

101
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:33,664
- It's too big.
- It's huge.

102
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:35,564
(Glancing)

103
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:39,134
I won't look.

104
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:42,474
That's witty of him. "I won't look."

105
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:45,373
I'm kind of shocked.

106
00:04:45,374 --> 00:04:46,943
- How heart-fluttering.
- Just don't look.

107
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:48,473
There's no need to say it.

108
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:50,344
(I know, right?)

109
00:04:51,644 --> 00:04:53,044
I won't look.

110
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:54,413
(Eating)

111
00:04:54,414 --> 00:04:56,554
But it's really too big.

112
00:04:58,054 --> 00:04:59,353
Cut it into pieces.

113
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:01,354
(Mu Jin looks away on purpose.)

114
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:06,124
(She eats it whole, thanks to Mu Jin being thoughtful.)

115
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:12,233
(Amazed)

116
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:13,304
It's really good.

117
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:16,274
- Is it?
- Yes.

118
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:20,674
Are you fine with a used fork?

119
00:05:21,814 --> 00:05:25,084
(Mu Jin helps Ye Eun to some food.)

120
00:05:25,884 --> 00:05:27,484
What was your ideal type again?

121
00:05:29,254 --> 00:05:30,354
My ideal type?

122
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:32,924
Appearance-wise?

123
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:34,394
Both.

124
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:39,094
Appearance-wise, I remember saying I liked someone pretty.

125
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:42,194
What do you mean by pretty? Be more specific.

126
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:43,603
Specific?

127
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:45,564
(Laughing)

128
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:48,934
I'm not sure. I guess it's just...

129
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:50,974
the feeling I get.

130
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,914
Are you the aggressive type or not?

131
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:57,313
- Me?
- Yes.

132
00:05:57,314 --> 00:05:58,444
(Laughing)

133
00:05:59,714 --> 00:06:01,854
(Thinking)

134
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:04,824
If I'm certain,

135
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:07,124
I become very aggressive.

136
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:11,194
Isn't being aggressive good?

137
00:06:12,364 --> 00:06:13,994
Did you ask if being aggressive is good?

138
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:15,894
I like aggressive people.

139
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:17,933
(Laughing)

140
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:20,074
(Exclaiming)

141
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:23,744
How long do you get to know people?

142
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:25,544
When dating someone?

143
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:29,144
I don't drag it out too long.

144
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:33,083
The first impression...

145
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:35,654
and the feeling I get are quite powerful.

146
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:41,253
It doesn't really take that long for me to build it into a relationship.

147
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:42,794
(Mu Jin instantly makes a move when it feels right.)

148
00:06:44,364 --> 00:06:46,394
I've always wanted to talk to you.

149
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:50,264
Earlier, as I said in the car,

150
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:52,134
I had...

151
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:54,704
this feeling.

152
00:06:55,304 --> 00:06:56,434
What kind of feeling?

153
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:01,573
(Eyes eager for an answer)

154
00:07:01,574 --> 00:07:04,083
(Flustered)

155
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:05,643
I just wanted to talk to you...

156
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:07,284
when I got the chance.

157
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:09,883
(I see.)

158
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:10,884
Little did I...

159
00:07:11,484 --> 00:07:13,054
expect us to go on a date today.

160
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:16,093
It was either the 1st or 2nd day.

161
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:17,964
I received a video,

162
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:21,594
and it looked like it was...

163
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:24,104
from you.

164
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:25,333
Maybe not.

165
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:26,733
(Embarrassed)

166
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:28,304
He's got the wrong person.

167
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:30,443
(Out of the 2 Love QR Codes...)

168
00:07:30,444 --> 00:07:31,704
(Mu Jin received on the first day)

169
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:35,613
(Believing that the one from Ji Won was from Ye Eun)

170
00:07:35,614 --> 00:07:37,344
But do you know what that means?

171
00:07:38,114 --> 00:07:40,113
Because he's interested in her,

172
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:41,114
Is he flattering himself?

173
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:44,154
Mu Jin wishes Ye Eun had sent it.

174
00:07:45,584 --> 00:07:47,423
"I wonder who sent this."

175
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:49,293
"I know who one is from, but not the other."

176
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:50,693
At times like that, you think of...

177
00:07:50,694 --> 00:07:52,663
- the person you're interested in.
- Yes.

178
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:53,664
- That's likely.
- Right?

179
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:55,633
He has this little hope inside him.

180
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:56,933
(Mu Jin's guess based on his hope?)

181
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,504
And he unconsciously thought of her.

182
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:01,373
He didn't deduce it.

183
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:03,473
That girl just popped into his head.

184
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:05,403
Because he wants it to be that person.

185
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:07,873
Yes. Instinctively thinking of her means...

186
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:09,044
he's interested in her.

187
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:10,314
And since day one.

188
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:11,584
(That's possible.)

189
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:14,014
In that position...

190
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:17,383
And it felt like we made eye contact a few times.

191
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:19,124
- So I wondered if it was you.
- See?

192
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:20,554
Their eyes met.

193
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:22,494
I can't tell you.

194
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:24,963
- Is it a secret?
- Ye Eun is slightly taken aback.

195
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,723
- Totally.
- We had to make it so that...

196
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:27,864
it wasn't obvious.

197
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:30,534
We made sure the videos were hard to guess.

198
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:32,304
Is it a forever secret?

199
00:08:33,064 --> 00:08:35,234
Yes. After all, I can't tell you.

200
00:08:37,704 --> 00:08:39,174
She dodged it well.

201
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:40,843
(Laughing)

202
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:41,874
(I see.)

203
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:46,514
The girls guessed based on the bags.

204
00:08:47,084 --> 00:08:49,014
I'm curious. How did it go?

205
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:52,453
Who do you think the girls thought...

206
00:08:52,454 --> 00:08:53,954
your bag belonged to?

207
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:55,523
Did they think it was me?

208
00:08:55,524 --> 00:08:56,693
- No.
- Not at all?

209
00:08:56,694 --> 00:08:57,764
Not a single bit.

210
00:08:58,564 --> 00:08:59,764
Who did you think it belonged to?

211
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:00,994
Your bag...

212
00:09:02,594 --> 00:09:06,004
Sang Won.

213
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:07,434
- Sang Won?
- Yes.

214
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:09,474
(Disappointed)

215
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:12,744
Thinking it was Sang Won's,

216
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:14,613
- She had Sang Won in mind.
- I chose it.

217
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:16,144
(Exclaiming)

218
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:20,414
And the khaki-colored bag.

219
00:09:21,714 --> 00:09:23,084
- They thought that was mine?
- Yes.

220
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:25,884
(Thinking)

221
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:30,464
We thought that bag belonged to you.

222
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:32,394
- So that was what happened.
- Yes.

223
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:34,163
Oh, no.

224
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:37,404
(Mu Jin realizes he wasn't Ye Eun's 1st choice.)

225
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:43,474
- It's now our third day here.
- Yes.

226
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:48,614
Have your feelings...

227
00:09:49,474 --> 00:09:50,813
for a guy grown?

228
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:53,414
Do you have feelings for someone?

229
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:55,483
(Thinking hard)

230
00:09:55,484 --> 00:09:57,424
(Contemplating)

231
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:01,894
Rather than a guy my feelings have grown for,

232
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:06,763
I do have someone I'm interested in.

233
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:08,293
Since she mentioned Sang Won earlier,

234
00:10:08,294 --> 00:10:10,163
wouldn't he immediately think it's Sang Won?

235
00:10:10,164 --> 00:10:11,164
(I see.)

236
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:16,604
Have your feelings for someone grown?

237
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:18,304
I'm talking about you.

238
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:22,574
Somewhat.

239
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:28,614
I was surprised. We're only on day three.

240
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:32,654
But to think that my feelings could grow so much.

241
00:10:34,854 --> 00:10:36,554
- To even...
- I can tell.

242
00:10:36,824 --> 00:10:37,863
(Laughing)

243
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:40,124
You can? Is it obvious?

244
00:10:40,194 --> 00:10:41,234
It's very obvious.

245
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:45,734
Come on. Is it that obvious?

246
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:50,004
(Embarrassed)

247
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:52,174
To drive the point home like that?

248
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:54,074
That's practically drawing a line.

249
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:58,083
When Ye Eun and Mu Jin had just set off earlier,

250
00:10:58,084 --> 00:11:01,113
she mentioned Mu Jin was one of the guys...

251
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:02,314
she was interested in.

252
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:07,854
At first, the guys I wanted to talk to...

253
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:10,364
(You were one of them.)

254
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:14,634
Someone I was drawn to among the guys.

255
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:15,863
She even said that.

256
00:11:15,864 --> 00:11:18,804
There were moments they could've hit it off.

257
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:20,504
But, out of the blue,

258
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:23,233
Mu Jin confessed how surprised he was at the depth...

259
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:25,044
of his feelings in just three days.

260
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,973
In short, he's saying, "I only have eyes..."

261
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:29,143
"for her."

262
00:11:29,144 --> 00:11:30,244
- It's cool.
- Yes.

263
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:32,243
- He's really cool.
- Right?

264
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:33,684
- It's cool, but...
- No, it's not cool.

265
00:11:34,054 --> 00:11:35,553
We are polar opposites.

266
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:36,884
- I hate it.
- Honestly,

267
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:39,253
Ye Eun kept showing her interest...

268
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:40,993
- in Mu Jin.
- Right.

269
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:42,753
- But Mu Jin already clearly has...
- True.

270
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:44,094
someone in his heart.

271
00:11:44,394 --> 00:11:46,263
If he were to go with the flow...

272
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:48,133
and talk as if he feels the same,

273
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:49,733
- I'm worried about...
- Same.

274
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:50,864
how badly Ye Eun would get hurt in the future.

275
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:52,463
- That's why I think...
- I agree.

276
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:53,703
it's a good idea to make it clear...

277
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:56,003
that his feelings are set in stone.

278
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:57,043
(I think so too.)

279
00:11:57,044 --> 00:11:58,144
That's the cool part.

280
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:05,944
Did you think you'd go all-in...

281
00:12:06,514 --> 00:12:09,113
if you found someone interesting...

282
00:12:09,114 --> 00:12:10,384
after moving into Yeon House?

283
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:13,454
I think I did.

284
00:12:13,624 --> 00:12:15,094
First impressions...

285
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,524
play a big role for me.

286
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:20,064
First impressions...

287
00:12:21,864 --> 00:12:25,134
mean a great deal to me and strongly affect me.

288
00:12:27,134 --> 00:12:31,644
(Mu Jin answers that first impressions are crucial.)

289
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:34,414
It seems like it.

290
00:12:34,574 --> 00:12:37,684
I guess our timings were off.

291
00:12:38,144 --> 00:12:40,653
Had my first date...

292
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:42,554
been with Mu Jin,

293
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:47,154
things might've been different.

294
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,854
But that wasn't the case.

295
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:52,094
Oh, no.

296
00:12:52,964 --> 00:12:55,864
(Did the two have bad timing?)

297
00:12:57,904 --> 00:12:59,363
I love the interior design of this place.

298
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:00,934
(What's In My Bag Date: Bon Hee and Ji Yung)

299
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:03,774
- Thank you.
- Here.

300
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:08,873
Earlier, I saw two pairs of sunglasses in your bag.

301
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:09,874
Yes.

302
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,814
One was tinted orange.

303
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:18,183
(A pair of orange sunglasses came out of Ji Yung's bag.)

304
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:19,284
It must be Mu Jin's bag.

305
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:20,853
- Really?
- Do you think so?

306
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:22,393
(Bewildered)

307
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:25,663
The weird gut feeling I had at first was right.

308
00:13:25,664 --> 00:13:28,434
Mu Jin wouldn't wear orange-tinted sunglasses.

309
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:31,363
I wear it before getting in a car.

310
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:32,364
(The real owner of the sunglasses)

311
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:35,473
(Embarrassed)

312
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:36,504
Does it not suit me?

313
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:39,443
It's just that the orange color is very bright.

314
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,574
Yes, it's bright orange.

315
00:13:41,214 --> 00:13:42,214
It blocks everything.

316
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:43,214
(She can't feed a line.)

317
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:44,644
- So it's functional.
- Yes.

318
00:13:44,914 --> 00:13:46,413
- Pardon me.
- That was fast.

319
00:13:46,414 --> 00:13:48,114
(The dish is ready just in time.)

320
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:49,853
(Amazed)

321
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:51,184
It looks delicious.

322
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:52,953
This looks incredible.

323
00:13:52,954 --> 00:13:54,424
- Where is that?
- That looks good.

324
00:13:54,454 --> 00:13:56,324
- Enjoy.
- You too.

325
00:13:56,694 --> 00:13:58,064
Is the meat not too big?

326
00:13:58,364 --> 00:13:59,664
No, it's okay.

327
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:01,864
I like my meat big.

328
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:03,864
Meat is best in big pieces.

329
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,134
You're right.

330
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:06,134
(Eating)

331
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:08,334
(Ji Yung eats a big piece of meat.)

332
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:10,543
It does look good.

333
00:14:10,544 --> 00:14:11,544
(Bon Hee does too.)

334
00:14:11,545 --> 00:14:13,073
(Satisfied)

335
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:16,614
(The two have similar appetites.)

336
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:18,713
Do you like watching movies?

337
00:14:18,714 --> 00:14:20,814
Yes, I'm a big fan of movies.

338
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:22,613
What genres do you like?

339
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:25,954
I'm not picky when it comes to genres.

340
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:30,494
But my favorites would be about F1. Do you know "Top Gun?"

341
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:32,923
- The "Mission: Impossible" series?
- Exactly.

342
00:14:32,924 --> 00:14:34,394
I love such series.

343
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:37,304
- Can you also watch "Mad Max?" - It's one of my favorites.

344
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:39,663
I've watched a lot of animations.

345
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:41,333
- Studio Ghibli.
- Studio Ghibli.

346
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:42,604
I watched a lot of it.

347
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:45,144
I love "Howl's Moving Castle."

348
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:46,843
Me too. "Spirited Away..."

349
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,244
- and "Howl's Moving Castle." - Yes.

350
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:50,713
Studio Ghibli's animations...

351
00:14:50,714 --> 00:14:52,814
- It has its own vibe, no?
- That vibe is...

352
00:14:54,014 --> 00:14:55,854
Nice. The two can keep a conversation going.

353
00:14:57,384 --> 00:14:59,454
In "Spirited Away,"

354
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:02,293
- the parents turn into pigs.
- Yes, they do.

355
00:15:02,294 --> 00:15:03,653
- Isn't that scene so sad...
- Right.

356
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:04,694
if you really get into it?

357
00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:07,734
- This is bad. He doesn't get it.
- Yes.

358
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:11,264
I hadn't thought that far.

359
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:14,034
That scene never struck me as sad.

360
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:17,204
(They have similar tastes but different tearjerking points.)

361
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:18,603
- Come on.
- He should have agreed with her.

362
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:21,214
How would Mu Jin have answered that question?

363
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:22,774
"It's a secret."

364
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:27,314
- "It's a secret." - Why do you keep imitating Mu Jin?

365
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:28,654
I won't look.

366
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:30,183
"I won't look."

367
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:31,223
"It's a secret."

368
00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:32,253
- "I won't look." - "I won't look."

369
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:33,254
The two are furious.

370
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:35,394
- I won't watch "Spirited Away." - I won't.

371
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:37,054
(That's hilarious.)

372
00:15:37,424 --> 00:15:39,364
What do you want to do the most with your boyfriend?"

373
00:15:41,094 --> 00:15:42,134
And I mean together.

374
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:44,003
Something like this. Getting a meal together,

375
00:15:44,004 --> 00:15:45,633
drinking coffee,

376
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:47,004
and going on trips.

377
00:15:49,134 --> 00:15:50,843
(Thinking)

378
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:53,774
Yesterday, you said you spend a long time getting to know a guy.

379
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,874
If you were to find...

380
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:58,114
a decent guy within a week,

381
00:15:58,844 --> 00:16:02,854
are you willing to date him? That's what I'd like to know.

382
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:04,384
(Exclaiming)

383
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:06,124
- I am.
- You are?

384
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:07,394
Later on...

385
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:09,594
So in short...

386
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:11,023
- Oh, dear. He's flustered.
- Gosh.

387
00:16:11,024 --> 00:16:13,664
I did some thinking.

388
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:17,334
I thought it was too short,

389
00:16:17,564 --> 00:16:18,703
but it's actually tightly packed.

390
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:20,363
We're together all the time.

391
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:21,534
True.

392
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:24,043
It's a tightly packed time, the same as keeping in touch...

393
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:25,543
for 2 to 3 months.

394
00:16:25,544 --> 00:16:27,004
You're right about that. For real.

395
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:32,713
That was why, at first, I wondered...

396
00:16:32,714 --> 00:16:36,084
if things could work out, if my feelings would grow, and such.

397
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:41,924
Now, I think it's possible.

398
00:16:42,954 --> 00:16:44,964
The two are feeling the same way.

399
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:50,804
I was very grateful to Ji Yung back then.

400
00:16:51,364 --> 00:16:53,734
Ji Yung must've felt it.

401
00:16:54,434 --> 00:16:56,073
I mentioned someone else...

402
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:59,144
and expressed my feelings in a roundabout way...

403
00:16:59,374 --> 00:17:02,144
so that he'd feel it indirectly.

404
00:17:02,774 --> 00:17:06,314
He's quick-witted and has a good hunch.

405
00:17:06,614 --> 00:17:08,513
I'm sure he asked more questions...

406
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:10,824
out of consideration.

407
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:13,423
The chat itself was relaxing.

408
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:16,024
He kept putting me at ease in a comfortable way.

409
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:18,993
It seems Bon Hee...

410
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:21,263
- has feelings for Mu Jin.
- For sure.

411
00:17:21,264 --> 00:17:24,764
But last night, Sang Hyeon made a sudden confession.

412
00:17:25,164 --> 00:17:28,433
I'm sure that must've stirred Bon Hee's feelings.

413
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:31,774
So she must not be in any position to also consider Ji Yung.

414
00:17:32,104 --> 00:17:33,144
Right.

415
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:37,944
(At Yeon House in the meantime)

416
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:46,123
- Is he asleep?
- He's sleeping?

417
00:17:46,124 --> 00:17:47,423
He's not thinking?

418
00:17:47,424 --> 00:17:48,424
(Doubting what they see)

419
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:49,993
Is he asleep?

420
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:51,593
He's even snoring.

421
00:17:51,594 --> 00:17:53,193
(Sang Won is snoring in his sleep.)

422
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:54,934
This isn't the time for that.

423
00:17:56,634 --> 00:17:58,834
(Tossing)

424
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:09,973
(Half asleep)

425
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:11,044
He's thinking again.

426
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:16,754
(I think I've been asleep for quite a while.)

427
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:20,653
(Time goes slower for him.)

428
00:18:20,654 --> 00:18:21,924
Stop sleeping. Get up now.

429
00:18:22,454 --> 00:18:23,724
Poor him.

430
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:30,194
(The outfit he chose for a date)

431
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:32,934
But it's not like he wasn't chosen.

432
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:34,933
He doesn't have to be so depressed.

433
00:18:34,934 --> 00:18:37,303
Why do such things only happen to Sang Won?

434
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:39,874
Getting zero votes and not being chosen.

435
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:44,113
I think he's going somewhere.

436
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:45,644
(Sang Won feels stuffy and leaves the house.)

437
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:51,124
(Where is he headed?)

438
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:53,623
(A grocery store?)

439
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:56,554
He probably didn't like the ingredients in the house.

440
00:18:59,394 --> 00:19:02,164
I was all by myself, and I got depressed.

441
00:19:02,764 --> 00:19:04,163
- Then, - He was depressed.

442
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:06,264
I remembered from the night before...

443
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:09,134
that everyone was hungry when they returned.

444
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:11,473
I had confidently told other participants...

445
00:19:11,474 --> 00:19:14,074
that I could make great suyuk, so I decided to make that.

446
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:16,913
Good.

447
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:18,513
(Buying suyuk ingredients for those outside)

448
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:20,613
He's really handsome, though.

449
00:19:20,614 --> 00:19:23,154
- Right.
- He really is.

450
00:19:24,524 --> 00:19:26,254
(Thinking)

451
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:29,353
(Looking around)

452
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:31,464
What does he want to do? What is he looking for?

453
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:35,664
Sir, are those all the wasabi products you have?

454
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:37,433
- What?
- Wasabi?

455
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:38,804
(Does that mean...)

456
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:40,364
Why is he getting wasabi?

457
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,504
Ye Eun said she liked it.

458
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:49,414
(Ye Eun said she liked wasabi on the previous date.)

459
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:53,284
Sir, are those all the wasabi products you have?

460
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:55,053
It's for Ye Eun?

461
00:19:55,054 --> 00:19:59,524
(Is he buying wasabi for Ye Eun?)

462
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:03,854
(While Sang Won is picking wasabi...)

463
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:11,533
- Wait. It's a new girl.
- Finally.

464
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:15,174
(Someone walks toward Yeon House.)

465
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:25,184
While everyone's gone?

466
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:34,188
While everyone's gone?

467
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:42,027
(A new woman quietly comes to empty Yeon House.)

468
00:20:42,028 --> 00:20:43,658
She's already beautiful from the side.

469
00:20:44,398 --> 00:20:45,897
(They can't wait to find out...)

470
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:49,328
(who the fifth girl is.)

471
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:52,868
So cool.

472
00:20:55,638 --> 00:20:56,777
She's tall.

473
00:20:56,778 --> 00:20:58,637
(The fifth woman...)

474
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:02,308
(naturally walks around the yard.)

475
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:06,948
(Go So Hyun)

476
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:08,548
She's pretty.

477
00:21:08,648 --> 00:21:09,918
(Amazed)

478
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:11,688
She's pretty.

479
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,727
(Surprised)

480
00:21:13,728 --> 00:21:15,627
- But...
- I know her!

481
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:16,628
- What?
- What?

482
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:19,597
- You know her?
- Yes.

483
00:21:19,598 --> 00:21:21,968
- Are you serious?
- This is amazing!

484
00:21:24,698 --> 00:21:26,138
I saw how my close friends...

485
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:30,608
found their partners and relied on them.

486
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:34,207
When I asked them to set me up with someone,

487
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,817
they said they didn't know who they should introduce to me,

488
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:38,778
and time kept passing.

489
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:42,948
When I ask them now, there's no one.

490
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:45,588
Men of my age are mostly married...

491
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:46,888
or already have children.

492
00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:50,058
I want to eat together,

493
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,798
share what we love, and laugh together.

494
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:58,097
I wish I also had someone whose life and mine...

495
00:21:58,098 --> 00:22:01,437
create synergy as we spent time together.

496
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:02,438
(The last newcomer of Yeon House)

497
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:11,078
(She checks the Love QR as soon as she arrives.)

498
00:22:12,178 --> 00:22:14,487
(Her QR code...)

499
00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:17,187
(leads to the information of the younger men.)

500
00:22:17,188 --> 00:22:18,587
Because she's the only one who doesn't know.

501
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:19,757
"In the food and beverage industry."

502
00:22:19,758 --> 00:22:21,257
- "A database administrator." - They should tell her.

503
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,427
Naturally.

504
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:23,498
"Government employee."

505
00:22:24,258 --> 00:22:25,758
"Dermatologist."

506
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:31,337
The ones I'm interested in are Sang Hyeon and Mu Jin.

507
00:22:31,338 --> 00:22:33,568
Sang Hyeon and Mu Jin.

508
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:35,508
But Mu Jin is taken.

509
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:37,277
Sang Hyeon and Mu Jin?

510
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:39,138
Not Mu Jin, though.

511
00:22:39,238 --> 00:22:41,548
- Mu Jin...
- Oh, no.

512
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:43,878
I'm so excited.

513
00:22:47,388 --> 00:22:53,828
(The last older woman enters Yeon House.)

514
00:22:55,828 --> 00:22:58,898
It's a big house.

515
00:23:00,768 --> 00:23:02,628
Is anyone here?

516
00:23:04,368 --> 00:23:06,937
When the older women enter...

517
00:23:06,938 --> 00:23:08,338
- They're composed.
- Right?

518
00:23:12,978 --> 00:23:14,978
(Excited and nervous)

519
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:20,048
(Sang Won returns from the grocery store.)

520
00:23:20,418 --> 00:23:21,487
(Very excited)

521
00:23:21,488 --> 00:23:23,218
- He's here.
- Right on time.

522
00:23:23,688 --> 00:23:25,787
The one I worry about the most!

523
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:28,757
Now, they can go on a date.

524
00:23:28,758 --> 00:23:30,457
What if he's so surprised that he tumbles?

525
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,198
(Being mean for no reason)

526
00:23:33,258 --> 00:23:35,867
(Without a clue,)

527
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:40,038
(he goes to the house.)

528
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:44,308
(So Hyun waits for other people.)

529
00:23:57,718 --> 00:23:58,818
It's their first encounter.

530
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:00,588
He's here.

531
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:08,398
He doesn't know!

532
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,468
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

533
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:13,467
(Surprised)

534
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,068
Did you just arrive?

535
00:24:17,108 --> 00:24:19,608
Yes, I'm new. Hi.

536
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:23,078
Oh, no.

537
00:24:23,848 --> 00:24:26,018
- Hi.
- Hi.

538
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:30,358
Give me a second. I'll put these down first.

539
00:24:31,058 --> 00:24:32,088
Just a second.

540
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:33,787
(Walking by)

541
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:34,858
Oh, my gosh.

542
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,128
(Peeking)

543
00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:37,598
He's peeking.

544
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:42,668
(Awkward)

545
00:24:45,238 --> 00:24:50,038
(Surprised Sang Won flees to the kitchen for now.)

546
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:57,078
(Nervous)

547
00:24:58,978 --> 00:25:02,648
(Restless)

548
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:05,918
(Peeking)

549
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:10,898
(He tries to calm down as he puts the groceries away.)

550
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:15,868
(So Hyun keeps feeling out of place.)

551
00:25:18,738 --> 00:25:21,238
(He soothes himself with a cup of cold water.)

552
00:25:22,508 --> 00:25:24,378
(Awkward and anxious)

553
00:25:28,248 --> 00:25:30,008
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hi.

554
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:32,377
Good luck, Sang Won.

555
00:25:32,378 --> 00:25:34,348
- Look at him.
- He's so glad.

556
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:35,448
Did you...

557
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:37,588
(His eyes open widely.)

558
00:25:38,888 --> 00:25:42,028
(Staring)

559
00:25:44,428 --> 00:25:47,668
I was sitting next to her,

560
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:50,498
and she was my type.

561
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:55,867
No way!

562
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:56,908
(Amazed)

563
00:25:57,778 --> 00:25:58,778
No way!

564
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:01,307
(Who were we worried about?)

565
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:02,707
- This is so tiring, SOOBIN.
- He's so..

566
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,618
- He's really simple.
- I'm so tired of him.

567
00:26:04,948 --> 00:26:06,518
- Awesome.
- It's so...

568
00:26:06,818 --> 00:26:08,948
We didn't have to worry about him.

569
00:26:09,248 --> 00:26:12,218
He loves and gets hurt, then he loves and gets hurt.

570
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,628
I think that's the charm of a younger man.

571
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:16,558
He's my type.

572
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:18,197
He's so transparent.

573
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:20,698
Oh, my gosh. Please don't hurt his feelings.

574
00:26:22,068 --> 00:26:24,268
I was sitting next to her,

575
00:26:25,598 --> 00:26:26,668
and she was my type.

576
00:26:28,768 --> 00:26:30,978
(Checking his looks)

577
00:26:31,308 --> 00:26:33,338
(Inhaling sharply)

578
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:38,118
While you were waiting by yourself,

579
00:26:38,478 --> 00:26:39,617
weren't you nervous?

580
00:26:39,618 --> 00:26:43,048
I didn't know what to do.

581
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:46,418
I just sat here, not doing anything.

582
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:50,698
I'm glad, though. I wasn't sure what I should do by myself.

583
00:26:51,628 --> 00:26:53,597
I prefer being with you,

584
00:26:53,598 --> 00:26:54,868
even though it can be a little awkward.

585
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:56,898
I thought I had to put the groceries away by myself.

586
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:01,638
A new male participant arrived yesterday.

587
00:27:02,508 --> 00:27:04,077
- Last night. The new one.
- The new one?

588
00:27:04,078 --> 00:27:05,138
Yes.

589
00:27:05,238 --> 00:27:07,977
We found out about each other's jobs for the first time.

590
00:27:07,978 --> 00:27:09,277
(He tells her what happened...)

591
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:10,848
(to help her adjust better.)

592
00:27:11,018 --> 00:27:12,748
- What's your name?
- Go So Hyun.

593
00:27:13,518 --> 00:27:14,647
- So Hyun?
- Yes.

594
00:27:14,648 --> 00:27:15,818
(I see.)

595
00:27:16,888 --> 00:27:18,188
You're Sang Won, right?

596
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:19,388
(His eyes shake.)

597
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,787
- Yes.
- I checked...

598
00:27:20,788 --> 00:27:22,888
- the QR code on the rooftop.
- Oh, I see.

599
00:27:23,388 --> 00:27:25,228
I memorized your name.

600
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:27,667
(Grinning)

601
00:27:27,668 --> 00:27:28,868
Please keep remembering.

602
00:27:29,228 --> 00:27:30,228
What?

603
00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:32,537
Please say that while looking into her eyes.

604
00:27:32,538 --> 00:27:34,608
(He can't even make eye contact.)

605
00:27:34,968 --> 00:27:36,977
- The aesthetic clinic...
- Yes, I'm a dermatologist.

606
00:27:36,978 --> 00:27:38,878
- A dermatologist?
- The type that you know.

607
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:40,878
- A dermatologist?
- Yes.

608
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:42,508
- Really?
- That's right.

609
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:44,448
He should tell her that he's the director.

610
00:27:45,378 --> 00:27:46,718
I wonder what you do.

611
00:27:46,988 --> 00:27:48,688
Me? Do you have any guesses?

612
00:27:50,618 --> 00:27:51,618
(Inhaling sharply)

613
00:27:51,818 --> 00:27:52,958
(Looking)

614
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:55,858
(Staring)

615
00:27:56,528 --> 00:27:58,158
(Shy)

616
00:27:58,258 --> 00:28:00,098
- You have such great skin.
- Me?

617
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:02,298
- I can tell.
- I'm wearing makeup.

618
00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:04,637
(Laughing awkwardly)

619
00:28:04,638 --> 00:28:06,167
- He's so in love.
- Oh, no.

620
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:07,437
This is so sweet.

621
00:28:07,438 --> 00:28:09,207
(Feeling shy)

622
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:10,907
I feel like you're a model.

623
00:28:10,908 --> 00:28:13,138
- You're tall, right?
- I'm not that tall.

624
00:28:13,238 --> 00:28:15,078
- You're not?
- I'm 168cm.

625
00:28:15,578 --> 00:28:17,817
- That's tall.
- Is it?

626
00:28:17,818 --> 00:28:19,348
That's a tall height.

627
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:21,417
Isn't it the height that most women prefer?

628
00:28:21,418 --> 00:28:22,488
You mean 168cm?

629
00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:23,687
- It's the most...
- I guess so.

630
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:24,857
- You know.
- You're right.

631
00:28:24,858 --> 00:28:26,987
- You'd look good in everything...
- Right.

632
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:29,628
- with that height.
- Yes.

633
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:31,027
(Pleased)

634
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:32,658
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

635
00:28:32,998 --> 00:28:35,098
Right. Such compliments work.

636
00:28:35,868 --> 00:28:37,367
(Feeling proud)

637
00:28:37,368 --> 00:28:40,408
I was all alone in the house earlier.

638
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:43,907
And it was too hot at noon to work out.

639
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:45,008
It was.

640
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:47,407
Do you work out?

641
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:48,708
Work out? I do.

642
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:52,348
I liked playing soccer, so I played soccer.

643
00:28:52,618 --> 00:28:54,587
Does he want to play soccer with her in the yard?

644
00:28:54,588 --> 00:28:55,787
(Soccer?)

645
00:28:55,788 --> 00:28:57,058
Do you drink?

646
00:28:57,218 --> 00:28:58,418
- Do I drink?
- Yes.

647
00:28:58,918 --> 00:29:00,658
I do, but...

648
00:29:01,028 --> 00:29:02,557
Korean, Chinese, and Western food.

649
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:04,427
Among those, my favorite is Korean.

650
00:29:04,428 --> 00:29:05,658
Do you like Japanese food?

651
00:29:05,858 --> 00:29:08,128
What's your favorite food?

652
00:29:08,228 --> 00:29:09,528
Do you have a hobby?

653
00:29:09,698 --> 00:29:11,468
You were working before this, right?

654
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:13,968
(Nodding)

655
00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:16,808
How deep does he want to dig?

656
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:18,008
(Laughing)

657
00:29:18,378 --> 00:29:20,008
He's practically giving her medical treatment.

658
00:29:20,978 --> 00:29:22,008
I know, right?

659
00:29:22,308 --> 00:29:23,377
(Tired all of a sudden)

660
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:25,518
The new woman does look tired.

661
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:28,118
(Standing up)

662
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:30,348
- I'll go to the bathroom.
- Sure.

663
00:29:31,318 --> 00:29:32,587
She's not running away from him, is she?

664
00:29:32,588 --> 00:29:34,927
She is. She's running.

665
00:29:34,928 --> 00:29:36,958
No, don't do that to Sang Won!

666
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,828
(Sighing)

667
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:42,628
(Sang Won is left alone once again.)

668
00:29:44,438 --> 00:29:45,668
At first...

669
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,737
(Exclaiming)

670
00:29:47,738 --> 00:29:49,608
I thought, "There are ups and downs in life."

671
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,407
I was depressed from buying groceries alone,

672
00:29:52,408 --> 00:29:54,148
and I was glad to get a second chance.

673
00:29:54,478 --> 00:29:55,947
But after talking to her, I wasn't sure...

674
00:29:55,948 --> 00:29:57,118
if we were getting closer.

675
00:29:58,078 --> 00:30:00,048
I didn't know what to do.

676
00:30:00,348 --> 00:30:02,788
I didn't make great use of the opportunity,

677
00:30:03,288 --> 00:30:05,318
- so I regret it.
- That's too bad.

678
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:08,458
It's just... How should I put it?

679
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:10,528
I could sense that he was kind.

680
00:30:11,298 --> 00:30:12,598
That's all we need to know.

681
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:15,467
(He feels like he could have done better.)

682
00:30:15,468 --> 00:30:16,598
Poor him.

683
00:30:18,868 --> 00:30:22,108
(Ji Won and Hyeon Jun return from their date.)

684
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:25,907
(Awkward)

685
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:28,908
(Reading his face)

686
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:31,747
(During their date earlier)

687
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,788
I don't know if you remember,

688
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:36,448
but I...

689
00:30:37,258 --> 00:30:39,588
once asked for your number.

690
00:30:41,158 --> 00:30:42,187
(Realizing)

691
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:43,228
I did.

692
00:30:43,828 --> 00:30:47,328
I actually asked for your number.

693
00:30:47,468 --> 00:30:48,897
It didn't go so well at the time.

694
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:50,637
(They met once again by chance...)

695
00:30:50,638 --> 00:30:52,468
(after some time.)

696
00:30:52,838 --> 00:30:55,438
- Hi, everyone.
- Hello.

697
00:30:55,908 --> 00:30:59,078
There was a tall guy.

698
00:30:59,438 --> 00:31:00,978
We made eye contact,

699
00:31:01,348 --> 00:31:03,207
and I thought,

700
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,078
"How did we meet here?"

701
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:09,018
I actually thought...

702
00:31:09,088 --> 00:31:10,888
this was a prank.

703
00:31:11,388 --> 00:31:14,488
My heart still races, thinking about it now.

704
00:31:14,988 --> 00:31:16,388
I'm like, "How did this happen?"

705
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:18,258
"How should I..."

706
00:31:18,928 --> 00:31:20,597
"continue being here?"

707
00:31:20,598 --> 00:31:21,868
I thought about that a lot.

708
00:31:23,368 --> 00:31:26,138
His appearance was obviously...

709
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,508
my type.

710
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:31,008
But I had met him before.

711
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:35,607
So, I couldn't send the code to say that I wanted...

712
00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:36,948
to talk to him.

713
00:31:37,448 --> 00:31:38,577
I was frustrated.

714
00:31:38,578 --> 00:31:42,888
That's why I couldn't exactly focus on getting to know others.

715
00:31:45,188 --> 00:31:49,458
(They got awkward after the date.)

716
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:56,468
How are the reservations in September?

717
00:31:56,828 --> 00:31:58,068
- September?
- Yes.

718
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,768
- The weekends are fully booked.
- Okay.

719
00:32:01,308 --> 00:32:05,008
But I blocked the reservations on weekdays because of this.

720
00:32:05,308 --> 00:32:06,707
On weekdays?

721
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:09,978
I didn't want to be bothered while I was on the show.

722
00:32:11,118 --> 00:32:14,188
We chatted on the drive home,

723
00:32:14,318 --> 00:32:17,418
but none of it was about dating.

724
00:32:17,758 --> 00:32:19,418
We only talked about our businesses.

725
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:22,388
- You were busy in August, right?
- Yes, I was very busy.

726
00:32:23,228 --> 00:32:25,157
I was equally busy on weekdays and weekends.

727
00:32:25,158 --> 00:32:26,728
(They stick to the work topic.)

728
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:28,428
I was surprised to see him...

729
00:32:29,098 --> 00:32:31,938
and couldn't believe what happened.

730
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:33,738
But as we talked,

731
00:32:34,608 --> 00:32:39,408
I realized that he wasn't interested in me.

732
00:32:39,978 --> 00:32:41,777
And I concluded...

733
00:32:41,778 --> 00:32:44,118
that he wasn't the one for me.

734
00:32:44,678 --> 00:32:48,318
I'll be able to focus on others more.

735
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:52,758
- It's been fun.
- Yes, I had a lot of fun.

736
00:32:56,188 --> 00:32:57,727
(Bon Hee and Ji Yung are the first ones to return.)

737
00:32:57,728 --> 00:32:59,327
We talked so much.

738
00:32:59,328 --> 00:33:00,398
Totally.

739
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:02,098
I feel much closer. Do you?

740
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:05,668
(But Sang Won hasn't been able to feel closer to So Hyun.)

741
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:07,508
You can go first.

742
00:33:10,408 --> 00:33:11,438
You can go first.

743
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:15,448
Hi, there.

744
00:33:16,348 --> 00:33:17,648
Just the two of you?

745
00:33:18,078 --> 00:33:19,248
I was here alone.

746
00:33:20,718 --> 00:33:21,948
We have a new participant.

747
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:23,448
Seriously?

748
00:33:23,848 --> 00:33:25,087
Really?

749
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,858
- I was here all by myself.
- Here?

750
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:29,458
When did the new one arrive?

751
00:33:29,728 --> 00:33:31,357
I went shopping for groceries...

752
00:33:31,358 --> 00:33:33,357
and came back, thinking about making suyuk,

753
00:33:33,358 --> 00:33:35,097
but she was sitting there.

754
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:36,228
So, I said hi.

755
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:37,468
Really?

756
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:40,368
Did you eat?

757
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:42,567
- Not yet.
- Still?

758
00:33:42,568 --> 00:33:44,077
- Did you have dinner?
- Yes.

759
00:33:44,078 --> 00:33:47,107
I'd say it was a late lunch. It was lunch.

760
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,778
- You ate as soon as you left.
- Yes.

761
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:50,778
How did you spend your time?

762
00:33:50,918 --> 00:33:52,117
I just slept.

763
00:33:52,118 --> 00:33:53,848
I literally slept. Then...

764
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,288
Poor Sang Won.

765
00:33:56,848 --> 00:33:58,057
She's here.

766
00:33:58,058 --> 00:33:59,058
(Stopping)

767
00:33:59,258 --> 00:34:00,488
Hello.

768
00:34:01,358 --> 00:34:02,628
- Hello.
- Hello.

769
00:34:02,658 --> 00:34:03,888
- Hello.
- He saw her.

770
00:34:05,298 --> 00:34:07,127
I'm a new participant.

771
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,798
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

772
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:11,998
He's glad.

773
00:34:12,198 --> 00:34:14,168
- Ji Yung likes her.
- Look at Ji Yung.

774
00:34:15,438 --> 00:34:18,338
- We'll be right back.
- I know who you are.

775
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:24,218
(Bon Hee recognizes her?)

776
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:26,418
(Bon Hee knows her?)

777
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:28,548
The women know.

778
00:34:28,718 --> 00:34:30,218
- Tell us.
- No.

779
00:34:31,118 --> 00:34:32,388
I can't spoil it.

780
00:34:33,858 --> 00:34:35,628
(How does she know her?)

781
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,158
What?

782
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,458
- You know her?
- Yes.

783
00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:40,398
- Hi.
- How?

784
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:42,398
- You know her?
- Yes.

785
00:34:44,568 --> 00:34:47,238
- I'm pleased to meet you.
- So am I.

786
00:34:47,638 --> 00:34:49,008
- Maybe a handshake.
- Sure.

787
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,477
Don't you have to put your purse away?

788
00:34:51,478 --> 00:34:52,478
I'm okay.

789
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:54,178
- I'll put my bag away first.
- Okay.

790
00:34:55,808 --> 00:34:57,078
So, you two know each other?

791
00:34:57,348 --> 00:34:59,878
I really admired her.

792
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:01,687
Thank you so much.

793
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:02,888
(Laughing)

794
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:06,088
- He's getting more curious.
- He's getting curious.

795
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:07,888
I wonder what she does for work.

796
00:35:10,628 --> 00:35:12,657
(The older women and younger men arrive one at a time.)

797
00:35:12,658 --> 00:35:14,368
There comes Mu Jin.

798
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,398
Sang Hyeon.

799
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:25,038
Wait. I hear people talking.

800
00:35:29,778 --> 00:35:30,847
There they are.

801
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:31,947
- Hello.
- Hello.

802
00:35:31,948 --> 00:35:33,648
(So Hyun was making dinner with Sang Won.)

803
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:36,718
He noticed her.

804
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,488
- Hello.
- Hello.

805
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:42,688
I assumed that there would be a new one.

806
00:35:43,158 --> 00:35:44,258
Who's...

807
00:35:44,628 --> 00:35:45,998
It's nice to meet you.

808
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,497
- Hello.
- Hello.

809
00:35:48,498 --> 00:35:49,868
Do you want to put your bags away and come back for a chat?

810
00:35:49,998 --> 00:35:51,167
- Sure.
- I'd like that.

811
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,567
I'll be here.

812
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:54,237
(She meets Sang Hyeon,)

813
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:56,368
(the one she liked the most, for the first time.)

814
00:35:58,078 --> 00:36:00,208
(So, that's Sang Hyeon.)

815
00:36:01,778 --> 00:36:03,208
See you in a bit.

816
00:36:06,218 --> 00:36:09,218
(Yeong Gyeong goes to Bon Hee's room.)

817
00:36:09,718 --> 00:36:11,018
Is someone here?

818
00:36:11,518 --> 00:36:13,118
We have a new woman.

819
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:14,587
- I know!
- Did you say hi?

820
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:16,158
I briefly said hi.

821
00:36:17,328 --> 00:36:18,357
No way!

822
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:20,898
I was cleaning up my stuff to make room for her.

823
00:36:21,528 --> 00:36:22,697
How was the date?

824
00:36:22,698 --> 00:36:23,967
No way!

825
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:25,867
I'll sleep here, and she'll sleep here.

826
00:36:25,868 --> 00:36:27,398
Oh, really?

827
00:36:28,568 --> 00:36:29,738
Do you recognize her?

828
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:31,708
I know who she is.

829
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:33,507
I know who she is too. I told her that I knew her.

830
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:34,707
Oh, really?

831
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,107
All the girls know who she is.

832
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:37,108
(Yeong Gyeong recognized So Hyun as well.)

833
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:39,178
- She must be famous.
- But the guys don't know her.

834
00:36:39,618 --> 00:36:43,387
"Oh, my. This could bring big changes."

835
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:45,118
The thought crossed my mind.

836
00:36:46,558 --> 00:36:51,298
And it made me nervous again like I was on the first day.

837
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:52,698
Oh, really?

838
00:36:54,398 --> 00:37:01,508
(There's subtle tension among the older women now.)

839
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:03,837
Is he cooking right now?

840
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:06,377
He's making suyuk.

841
00:37:06,378 --> 00:37:08,378
I thought something smelled good. I guess it was suyuk.

842
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:11,248
- Oh, my.
- But it's too big.

843
00:37:11,878 --> 00:37:13,477
Do you need help? I'll hold the plate.

844
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:14,718
I'll put this one on it.

845
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:16,388
It looks really good.

846
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:17,688
Sang Won, you should have it all.

847
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:19,917
- Exactly.
- Don't share it with anyone.

848
00:37:19,918 --> 00:37:21,158
My, it looks amazing.

849
00:37:22,888 --> 00:37:24,298
- Look how juicy it is.
- We left more food than we thought.

850
00:37:24,898 --> 00:37:26,358
- It's soft, right?
- You did a great job.

851
00:37:26,628 --> 00:37:27,698
- Did I?
- Let's put some here.

852
00:37:28,798 --> 00:37:30,398
Oh, right. He bought wasabi too.

853
00:37:30,698 --> 00:37:31,998
- Wasabi?
- Yes.

854
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:35,207
- Really?
- Yes, I did.

855
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,038
Really, Sang Won?

856
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:39,538
Yes, but I'm not sure if we have something to go with it.

857
00:37:40,138 --> 00:37:41,448
I want to eat it now.

858
00:37:42,548 --> 00:37:44,418
- Did you say you wanted it?
- Yes, I did.

859
00:37:45,118 --> 00:37:46,248
Does she have rhinitis?

860
00:37:46,648 --> 00:37:47,687
Don't be like that.

861
00:37:47,688 --> 00:37:48,747
(He's hilarious.)

862
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:51,887
I have rhinitis. Eating some wasabi...

863
00:37:51,888 --> 00:37:53,287
- relieves a stuffy nose.
- Seul Hye.

864
00:37:53,288 --> 00:37:54,728
(Excited)

865
00:37:55,128 --> 00:37:56,927
- That's amazing.
- It's over there.

866
00:37:56,928 --> 00:37:58,257
- Are you serious?
- She seems so excited.

867
00:37:58,258 --> 00:37:59,328
- She seems elated.
- Yes.

868
00:37:59,498 --> 00:38:01,467
- I'm so happy.
- "I'm so happy."

869
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:03,928
It's so nice of him to remember what she said and bought wasabi.

870
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:07,467
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it. It's nothing.

871
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:08,538
For the wasabi.

872
00:38:11,438 --> 00:38:12,477
She seems so happy.

873
00:38:12,478 --> 00:38:16,178
(Did Sang Won express his feelings by getting wasabi?)

874
00:38:16,908 --> 00:38:19,148
- It looks so good.
- Indeed.

875
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,487
It looks really juicy.

876
00:38:21,488 --> 00:38:22,587
It must be really tasty.

877
00:38:22,588 --> 00:38:23,888
Look. There's wasabi next to suyuk.

878
00:38:24,558 --> 00:38:25,658
- Cheers.
- It looks delicious.

879
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:28,587
- Welcome.
- It's nice to meet you all.

880
00:38:28,588 --> 00:38:30,528
(They throw So Hyun a welcome party with Sang Won's suyuk.)

881
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:34,997
Did you try the suyuk?

882
00:38:34,998 --> 00:38:37,298
(Surprised)

883
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,468
It's good.

884
00:38:38,998 --> 00:38:40,738
Oh, my. It's so good.

885
00:38:41,468 --> 00:38:42,468
Is it good?

886
00:38:42,468 --> 00:38:43,468
(Nodding)

887
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:45,178
- Oh, we have wasabi too.
- Yes.

888
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:47,178
I think someone was looking for it.

889
00:38:47,878 --> 00:38:49,478
- Is she a wasabi lover?
- In the middle.

890
00:38:50,278 --> 00:38:51,278
(Glancing)

891
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:52,948
(Happy)

892
00:38:53,518 --> 00:38:54,847
(Wasabi)

893
00:38:54,848 --> 00:38:56,488
She puts some wasabi on meat.

894
00:38:56,548 --> 00:38:58,717
(She eats meat with some wasabi, which Sang Won bought.)

895
00:38:58,718 --> 00:39:01,188
Don't you want to try something with me?

896
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:02,427
(Impressed)

897
00:39:02,428 --> 00:39:03,488
She likes it so much.

898
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:06,027
- It's so good.
- She likes it so much.

899
00:39:06,028 --> 00:39:07,928
It's good. It's really tasty.

900
00:39:08,568 --> 00:39:11,698
Indeed. He's good at cooking enough to brag about it.

901
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:14,508
(Embarrassed)

902
00:39:18,378 --> 00:39:20,078
You were surprised at first, right?

903
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:22,377
I was emotionally ready for it.

904
00:39:22,378 --> 00:39:24,718
We were joking about it. "It will be me."

905
00:39:26,118 --> 00:39:28,847
- All our guesses were wrong.
- All of them were wrong.

906
00:39:28,848 --> 00:39:32,417
My car was in the front, right?

907
00:39:32,418 --> 00:39:34,288
So I was watching through the side-view mirror.

908
00:39:34,428 --> 00:39:37,227
We guessed the owners of the bags.

909
00:39:37,228 --> 00:39:38,528
But all our guesses were wrong.

910
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:40,027
- But you guessed one right.
- Ye Eun, who did you think it was?

911
00:39:40,028 --> 00:39:41,268
Whom did you want to pick?

912
00:39:42,328 --> 00:39:43,867
(Taken aback)

913
00:39:43,868 --> 00:39:45,638
Tell him. Answer the question.

914
00:39:45,698 --> 00:39:47,807
You must've expected to be asked this question.

915
00:39:47,808 --> 00:39:49,508
Weren't you ready to answer it when you brought it up?

916
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:51,678
My, it's scary.

917
00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:53,708
Why are you all so scary?

918
00:39:54,378 --> 00:39:55,548
I just asked out of curiosity.

919
00:39:56,548 --> 00:39:57,718
She said it with a smile.

920
00:39:59,018 --> 00:40:01,587
The biggest reason I couldn't choose the person...

921
00:40:01,588 --> 00:40:02,588
that I wanted to choose...

922
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:04,358
was that we decided the order of picking a bag by drawing lots.

923
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:07,318
There must've been the bag you wanted to pick.

924
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:08,787
(He finally finds out why he couldn't go on a date.)

925
00:40:08,788 --> 00:40:10,858
- Oh, he didn't know that until now?
- The order of picking a bag.

926
00:40:11,398 --> 00:40:13,127
- He's smiling now.
- He's in a good mood now.

927
00:40:13,128 --> 00:40:14,128
(He finally finds out why he couldn't go on a date.)

928
00:40:15,768 --> 00:40:17,598
Did you tell the others about your occupation?

929
00:40:17,938 --> 00:40:20,668
- I haven't revealed it yet.
- Let's introduce ourselves again.

930
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:24,008
I am... How about you take a guess?

931
00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:27,178
I think you're in the same field as me.

932
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:29,178
Based on what?

933
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:30,548
Do you mean she's a rugby player?

934
00:40:30,549 --> 00:40:31,678
A yoga instructor.

935
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:34,618
I think she works in the TV industry.

936
00:40:34,718 --> 00:40:36,618
- Or a model?
- A show host.

937
00:40:36,988 --> 00:40:38,588
Oh, a show host?

938
00:40:40,658 --> 00:40:43,827
A model? I thought she was a fashion model.

939
00:40:43,828 --> 00:40:44,857
Is that a correct answer?

940
00:40:44,858 --> 00:40:45,858
(Shy)

941
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:46,998
- Yes.
- Oh, I see.

942
00:40:48,698 --> 00:40:49,798
It's nice to meet you all.

943
00:40:57,438 --> 00:41:00,607
I work in various fields including fashion photoshoots,

944
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:02,407
advertisements, and beauty contents...

945
00:41:02,408 --> 00:41:04,448
as a fashion model. My name is Go So Hyun.

946
00:41:04,918 --> 00:41:06,577
She's been in the modeling industry for a long time.

947
00:41:06,578 --> 00:41:08,117
- She's a very famous model.
- Yes.

948
00:41:08,118 --> 00:41:09,848
- She appeared in many ads.
- Yes.

949
00:41:11,258 --> 00:41:15,958
(Go So Hyun, fashion model)

950
00:41:18,658 --> 00:41:20,827
- Bon Hee gave me a hint.
- Oh, did I?

951
00:41:20,828 --> 00:41:23,298
- I knew who she was.
- How did you know her occupation?

952
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:27,267
She's such a cool model. She's not an amateur model.

953
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:28,468
She's a professional model with much experience.

954
00:41:29,368 --> 00:41:30,438
- I saw her there.
- That's right.

955
00:41:30,468 --> 00:41:31,607
- I knew who she was too.
- Did you know who she was?

956
00:41:31,608 --> 00:41:32,708
- I watched it.
- She's a real professional.

957
00:41:33,278 --> 00:41:34,708
I did quite a good job and stood out before.

958
00:41:34,948 --> 00:41:36,507
She did a great job.

959
00:41:36,508 --> 00:41:38,948
I used to stand out as a model.

960
00:41:40,218 --> 00:41:43,818
So Hyun seemed very relaxed.

961
00:41:43,988 --> 00:41:46,688
I wonder if I'll have a chance to get to know her.

962
00:41:47,658 --> 00:41:48,987
I'm so curious about her.

963
00:41:48,988 --> 00:41:51,058
- I hope it'll go well between them.
- Me too.

964
00:41:51,128 --> 00:41:52,598
So Hyun is really pretty.

965
00:41:53,298 --> 00:41:54,568
She seemed pretty.

966
00:41:56,828 --> 00:41:58,538
She seemed cheerful.

967
00:41:58,868 --> 00:42:00,498
She seemed like a nice person.

968
00:42:00,968 --> 00:42:03,108
I like a woman with simple features.

969
00:42:03,138 --> 00:42:04,808
And the new girl has simple features.

970
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:07,508
She seemed to be on another level.

971
00:42:09,148 --> 00:42:12,478
I felt like I had never seen a woman like her before.

972
00:42:13,018 --> 00:42:14,618
She seemed really nice.

973
00:42:16,288 --> 00:42:19,488
There's this image in my head when I think of an older woman.

974
00:42:20,418 --> 00:42:22,858
And she fits that image perfectly.

975
00:42:22,888 --> 00:42:26,498
A woman who is gentle and friendly, and who laughs easily.

976
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:29,898
And So Hyun seemed exactly like that.

977
00:42:32,168 --> 00:42:35,938
(Have the younger men's hearts started to change?)

978
00:42:36,068 --> 00:42:38,438
Shall we have another drink in the second-floor living room?

979
00:42:38,538 --> 00:42:40,408
- In the second-floor living room?
- Can we drink there?

980
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:42,178
- Sure. Sounds good.
- Sounds great.

981
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:43,208
Sounds great.

982
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:45,117
- Thank you for the food.
- Enjoy.

983
00:42:45,118 --> 00:42:46,247
(So Hyun's welcome party, Part 2?)

984
00:42:46,248 --> 00:42:48,317
I express my deepest gratitude toward the chef.

985
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:52,688
(Mu Jin comes down after changing his clothes.)

986
00:42:54,928 --> 00:42:56,828
(He sits next to So Hyun.)

987
00:42:57,288 --> 00:43:00,257
(Another man So Hyun was interested in based on his appearance)

988
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:02,028
(Mu Jin)

989
00:43:02,698 --> 00:43:03,898
(Glancing)

990
00:43:04,738 --> 00:43:08,508
(Looking around)

991
00:43:08,908 --> 00:43:10,107
(Mu Jin seems to be looking for someone.)

992
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:11,638
Is he looking for Bon Hee?

993
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:17,777
(He finds out Bon Hee isn't here and leaves.)

994
00:43:17,778 --> 00:43:19,817
It's because we shouldn't do it anywhere else but here.

995
00:43:19,818 --> 00:43:22,087
- From morning to night...
- Right.

996
00:43:22,088 --> 00:43:23,887
- See?
- I knew it.

997
00:43:23,888 --> 00:43:25,118
- My goodness.
- Come in.

998
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:29,127
- May I come in?
- Sure.

999
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:30,227
What are you doing?

1000
00:43:30,228 --> 00:43:31,598
- I'm working.
- You're working?

1001
00:43:32,658 --> 00:43:33,757
Can I see?

1002
00:43:33,758 --> 00:43:34,768
Yes.

1003
00:43:36,298 --> 00:43:37,938
He entered the room. He's the first man...

1004
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:39,437
- to enter a girls' room.
- The first man to do what?

1005
00:43:39,438 --> 00:43:41,838
The first younger man to enter the older women's room.

1006
00:43:42,138 --> 00:43:44,937
But everyone is watching it.

1007
00:43:44,938 --> 00:43:46,277
(That's right.)

1008
00:43:46,278 --> 00:43:47,577
- He's so straightforward.
- They're in front of the room.

1009
00:43:47,578 --> 00:43:50,207
- Mu Jin is straightforward.
- They'll notice it shortly.

1010
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:51,878
It must bother Sang Hyeon so much.

1011
00:43:54,888 --> 00:43:57,888
(Mu Jin goes into Bon Hee's room.)

1012
00:43:59,058 --> 00:44:00,058
Of course, it bothers me.

1013
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:03,988
(Sang Hyeon's mind is occupied by what's going on in her room.)

1014
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:07,657
I came up with the concept for this photoshoot...

1015
00:44:07,658 --> 00:44:09,097
and decorated the place.

1016
00:44:09,098 --> 00:44:11,638
- I see.
- Do you want to see the photos?

1017
00:44:12,968 --> 00:44:15,407
So you don't just take photos. You do all the work from A to Z.

1018
00:44:15,408 --> 00:44:16,437
That's right.

1019
00:44:16,438 --> 00:44:18,577
- You plan everything too.
- Yes.

1020
00:44:18,578 --> 00:44:21,277
I choose props and discuss with the stylists too.

1021
00:44:21,278 --> 00:44:22,747
- And then I hand them over.
- That's cool.

1022
00:44:22,748 --> 00:44:24,307
The staff edits them.

1023
00:44:24,308 --> 00:44:26,048
(That's cool.)

1024
00:44:26,378 --> 00:44:28,417
I review the photos before sending them via e-mail.

1025
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:30,647
(Mu Jin has never seen this side of her, which feels new to him.)

1026
00:44:30,648 --> 00:44:31,818
He's falling for her again.

1027
00:44:32,658 --> 00:44:33,658
He's falling for her again.

1028
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:36,088
Both of them keep smiling.

1029
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:38,897
(Hesitating)

1030
00:44:38,898 --> 00:44:40,128
Did you enjoy the date?

1031
00:44:41,228 --> 00:44:43,698
Oh, about that... Yesterday,

1032
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:46,838
didn't you apply lip balm?

1033
00:44:47,598 --> 00:44:49,768
- I applied it many times.
- Right?

1034
00:44:49,968 --> 00:44:52,207
Doesn't it have something like a red stick?

1035
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,338
Yes, it does.

1036
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:55,507
The bag didn't seem right,

1037
00:44:55,508 --> 00:44:57,747
but the same lip balm I saw was in the bag.

1038
00:44:57,748 --> 00:44:59,778
So I opened it to see the inside,

1039
00:44:59,878 --> 00:45:01,548
and I saw the red stick.

1040
00:45:02,218 --> 00:45:04,047
Did you pick the bag because you thought it was mine?

1041
00:45:04,048 --> 00:45:05,058
Yes.

1042
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:07,888
Our guesses were all wrong. It was funny.

1043
00:45:09,528 --> 00:45:10,628
You didn't eat pizza, did you?

1044
00:45:12,158 --> 00:45:13,658
I want to eat pizza with you too.

1045
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,798
What if you have to eat pizza with someone else?

1046
00:45:17,568 --> 00:45:18,937
It wouldn't taste good.

1047
00:45:18,938 --> 00:45:19,938
(They promised to eat pizza together on their previous date.)

1048
00:45:19,939 --> 00:45:20,998
I mean it.

1049
00:45:21,868 --> 00:45:23,008
You didn't eat pizza, did you?

1050
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:25,377
No.

1051
00:45:25,378 --> 00:45:27,108
(Both chuckle.)

1052
00:45:28,008 --> 00:45:29,448
Shall we go out together?

1053
00:45:30,278 --> 00:45:32,247
- Let's go out and talk.
- Okay.

1054
00:45:32,248 --> 00:45:37,488
(After checking Bon Hee's feelings, Mu Jin feels more relaxed.)

1055
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:41,557
I didn't know everyone was here.

1056
00:45:41,558 --> 00:45:42,658
- Come here.
- Really?

1057
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:45,698
- I feel bad for Sang Hyeon.
- Oh, no.

1058
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,327
Where would you like to sit?

1059
00:45:49,328 --> 00:45:50,368
I'll sit here.

1060
00:45:51,638 --> 00:45:53,267
(Everyone makes room for her.)

1061
00:45:53,268 --> 00:45:54,737
INFP, take an action now.

1062
00:45:54,738 --> 00:45:56,468
- Exactly. Linger around Bon Hee.
- He should move around her.

1063
00:45:57,138 --> 00:45:58,338
(Glancing)

1064
00:46:00,938 --> 00:46:02,148
I'll sit here.

1065
00:46:02,478 --> 00:46:03,648
I'm so full.

1066
00:46:04,008 --> 00:46:05,418
He sat down next to Bon Hee.

1067
00:46:05,648 --> 00:46:08,318
This is driving me crazy. It's crazy.

1068
00:46:08,548 --> 00:46:09,588
You left some for me.

1069
00:46:09,718 --> 00:46:11,148
(Glancing)

1070
00:46:11,988 --> 00:46:13,388
- Oh, no.
- Gosh.

1071
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,487
I heard that gambas was really good.

1072
00:46:16,488 --> 00:46:18,698
- It is, indeed.
- It's really good.

1073
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:22,067
(Mu Jin hears what Bon Hee says and stands up right away.)

1074
00:46:22,068 --> 00:46:23,328
He went there to get some for her?

1075
00:46:24,128 --> 00:46:25,238
Is he putting some gambas on a plate for her?

1076
00:46:25,468 --> 00:46:26,797
Right, I think he's doing it for her.

1077
00:46:26,798 --> 00:46:27,868
(He's putting some gambas on a plate for Bon Hee.)

1078
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,737
This is what I'm talking about.

1079
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:31,807
He behaves that way in front of everyone,

1080
00:46:31,808 --> 00:46:33,178
which makes it obvious that he likes her.

1081
00:46:33,738 --> 00:46:35,047
- Try it.
- It's delicious.

1082
00:46:35,048 --> 00:46:36,477
- I really enjoyed it.
- Shall I try it?

1083
00:46:36,478 --> 00:46:37,778
(He puts the plate in front of Bon Hee.)

1084
00:46:40,418 --> 00:46:43,018
(Happy)

1085
00:46:43,988 --> 00:46:45,758
(Feeling troubled)

1086
00:46:50,758 --> 00:46:55,298
(Love QR messages have been sent. Check one another's heart.)

1087
00:46:57,928 --> 00:47:01,038
(Yeon House's Love QR Zone is open.)

1088
00:47:01,668 --> 00:47:08,608
(Today, both men and women check one another's heart.)

1089
00:47:09,278 --> 00:47:11,307
(Could the person I chose...)

1090
00:47:11,308 --> 00:47:13,848
(share the same feelings with me?)

1091
00:47:14,348 --> 00:47:17,688
(They will see how one another feels through Love QR messages.)

1092
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:21,527
(Sighing)

1093
00:47:21,528 --> 00:47:24,928
(Someone enters the room while sighing deeply.)

1094
00:47:26,598 --> 00:47:29,398
(Bon Hee, who received 4 votes yesterday, will check the messages.)

1095
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:36,238
(Did the younger men's hearts stay the same?)

1096
00:47:38,738 --> 00:47:39,937
(Sighing)

1097
00:47:39,938 --> 00:47:41,648
What? Why did she sigh?

1098
00:47:43,908 --> 00:47:44,977
(Two people have sent you Love QR messages.)

1099
00:47:44,978 --> 00:47:46,048
- Oh, I see.
- Two people?

1100
00:47:46,778 --> 00:47:48,647
(Among the 4 men who chose Bon Hee yesterday,)

1101
00:47:48,648 --> 00:47:50,948
(only 2 of them sent her Love QR messages.)

1102
00:47:51,888 --> 00:47:55,428
(What could be the first message that Bon Hee received?)

1103
00:47:56,488 --> 00:48:00,327
(Can I look forward to having kimchi stew tomorrow?)

1104
00:48:00,328 --> 00:48:02,898
(Which one do you prefer? Doenjang stew or kimchi stew?)

1105
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:04,728
(Pork kimchi stew)

1106
00:48:05,268 --> 00:48:07,998
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin made a promise.)

1107
00:48:09,568 --> 00:48:12,378
(Bon Hee smiles happily.)

1108
00:48:14,038 --> 00:48:16,678
(She hasn't checked the second message yet.)

1109
00:48:17,248 --> 00:48:21,148
(What could be the second message that Bon Hee received?)

1110
00:48:22,148 --> 00:48:27,618
(We've never gone on a date. I hope we'll get a chance.)

1111
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:32,297
(He always holds his gaze at Bon Hee.)

1112
00:48:32,298 --> 00:48:33,298
(Sang Hyeon)

1113
00:48:33,299 --> 00:48:34,397
- It was Sang Hyeon.
- Sang Hyeon.

1114
00:48:34,398 --> 00:48:37,098
He called Bon Hee out for a chat at night.

1115
00:48:37,398 --> 00:48:42,068
I sent my Love QR message to Bon Hee again.

1116
00:48:42,568 --> 00:48:44,807
I mean, I know how things are going.

1117
00:48:44,808 --> 00:48:47,178
I'm sure I wasn't the only one who sent a message to her.

1118
00:48:47,538 --> 00:48:49,248
Something crossed my mind today.

1119
00:48:49,808 --> 00:48:53,117
We were talking in the living room in front of the girls' room.

1120
00:48:53,118 --> 00:48:56,017
And I could hear Mu Jin talking to Bon Hee...

1121
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:57,518
when she was alone in her room.

1122
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:01,458
Based on the caring tone of voice and his gestures,

1123
00:49:02,728 --> 00:49:04,187
I realized that he was interested in her.

1124
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:06,697
I don't know if Bon Hee feels the same way,

1125
00:49:06,698 --> 00:49:10,698
but I'm sure that Mu Jin has feelings for her.

1126
00:49:11,738 --> 00:49:14,038
It bothers me, of course. It really does.

1127
00:49:15,008 --> 00:49:16,537
So I just want...

1128
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:19,008
She's the only one whom I haven't gone on a date with.

1129
00:49:19,108 --> 00:49:22,478
So I just let her know I wanted to go on a date with her.

1130
00:49:23,078 --> 00:49:26,618
(It was Sang Hyeon who sent the message to Bon Hee.)

1131
00:49:28,718 --> 00:49:32,918
(Bon Hee received Love QR messages from Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon.)

1132
00:49:33,918 --> 00:49:38,698
(Which of the younger men did Bon Hee send a message to?)

1133
00:49:40,398 --> 00:49:42,127
(Click)

1134
00:49:42,128 --> 00:49:45,667
(Bon Hee took a photo of the plant.)

1135
00:49:45,668 --> 00:49:48,068
(One person has sent you a Love QR message.)

1136
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:54,877
(The younger man who received the photo sent by Bon Hee is...)

1137
00:49:54,878 --> 00:49:57,848
(Mu Jin.)

1138
00:49:59,618 --> 00:50:04,748
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin sent messages to each other.)

1139
00:50:07,818 --> 00:50:10,327
(He seems nervous as he walks in.)

1140
00:50:10,328 --> 00:50:11,587
(Sang Hyeon)

1141
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:13,297
(Sighing)

1142
00:50:13,298 --> 00:50:14,358
Oh, boy.

1143
00:50:14,858 --> 00:50:19,438
(Are there any Love QR messages sent to Sang Hyeon?)

1144
00:50:20,498 --> 00:50:24,638
(He scans the Love QR Code carefully.)

1145
00:50:27,738 --> 00:50:32,078
(What if no one sent a message?)

1146
00:50:32,648 --> 00:50:35,417
- Come on. Check it already.
- Oh, no. I'm worried.

1147
00:50:35,418 --> 00:50:39,588
(He checks the Love QR message nervously.)

1148
00:50:42,228 --> 00:50:43,487
Did he get zero votes?

1149
00:50:43,488 --> 00:50:47,127
(One person has sent you a Love QR message.)

1150
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:48,797
He probably hopes it is from Bon Hee.

1151
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:50,697
- Exactly.
- But we all know who she likes.

1152
00:50:50,698 --> 00:50:52,798
(Bon Hee didn't send a message to Sang Hyeon.)

1153
00:50:52,898 --> 00:50:54,037
(Then could it be Yeong Gyeong whom he went on a date with today?)

1154
00:50:54,038 --> 00:50:56,168
Oh, I forgot about Yeong Gyeong.

1155
00:50:56,608 --> 00:50:59,177
(Should I tuck this into my collar or spread it on my lap?)

1156
00:50:59,178 --> 00:51:01,178
(She pranks him by telling him to tuck it into his collar.)

1157
00:51:02,278 --> 00:51:03,608
- Is this right?
- Well... I want...

1158
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:07,178
(Is it Yeong Gyeong who wanted to get to know him better?)

1159
00:51:08,018 --> 00:51:11,018
(Who sent the Love QR message to Sang Hyeon?)

1160
00:51:13,258 --> 00:51:14,288
What could that be?

1161
00:51:16,788 --> 00:51:18,898
- "I want to talk to you more." - "I want to talk to you more."

1162
00:51:19,228 --> 00:51:20,758
I guess they have talked before.

1163
00:51:21,628 --> 00:51:23,198
I am Go So Hyun.

1164
00:51:23,628 --> 00:51:24,697
- Go So Hyun?
- Yes.

1165
00:51:24,698 --> 00:51:26,767
I see. I am Kim Sang Hyeon.

1166
00:51:26,768 --> 00:51:28,368
- Sang Hyeon? Okay.
- Yes.

1167
00:51:28,768 --> 00:51:29,908
It's nice to meet you.

1168
00:51:31,108 --> 00:51:32,178
(Glancing)

1169
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:35,807
Sang Hyeon seemed very calm...

1170
00:51:35,808 --> 00:51:39,318
and seemed like a nice person.

1171
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:42,317
- The way he talks...
- How is it?

1172
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:43,887
is sweet.

1173
00:51:43,888 --> 00:51:45,117
The way he talks is sweet, indeed.

1174
00:51:45,118 --> 00:51:46,257
Whenever I see someone,

1175
00:51:46,258 --> 00:51:48,688
it takes me time to remember his or her name.

1176
00:51:49,058 --> 00:51:51,327
I'm still confused as well. I don't remember their family names.

1177
00:51:51,328 --> 00:51:52,757
We call one another by our first names.

1178
00:51:52,758 --> 00:51:54,457
How about we introduce ourselves again?

1179
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:56,097
- Sounds great.
- He's so nice.

1180
00:51:56,098 --> 00:51:58,097
- I work at a securities firm...
- Indeed.

1181
00:51:58,098 --> 00:51:59,798
as an IT engineer.

1182
00:51:59,898 --> 00:52:01,097
An IT engineer?

1183
00:52:01,098 --> 00:52:02,107
(Sang Hyeon's tone of voice conveys thoughtfulness.)

1184
00:52:02,108 --> 00:52:03,767
Sang Hyeon is very considerate.

1185
00:52:03,768 --> 00:52:07,077
Rather than just asking each other simple questions,

1186
00:52:07,078 --> 00:52:10,308
I wanted to have a long conversation with him.

1187
00:52:11,178 --> 00:52:15,548
The one I'm most curious about is Sang Hyeon.

1188
00:52:19,888 --> 00:52:22,928
I think it's probably Ye Eun.

1189
00:52:23,088 --> 00:52:26,198
My hunch could be wrong, but I had a feeling...

1190
00:52:26,828 --> 00:52:30,527
that Ye Eun tried to stay close to me.

1191
00:52:30,528 --> 00:52:32,538
What if I regret saying this?

1192
00:52:33,598 --> 00:52:34,938
When I watch this on TV later...

1193
00:52:36,008 --> 00:52:38,838
(Ye Eun will be taken aback.)

1194
00:52:39,978 --> 00:52:44,008
- But that's how I felt. I'm sorry.
- Exactly.

1195
00:52:46,078 --> 00:52:49,887
(The next person to check the Love QR messages is...)

1196
00:52:49,888 --> 00:52:52,857
(So Hyun.)

1197
00:52:52,858 --> 00:52:54,818
That's Ji Won's. That's Bon Hee's.

1198
00:52:55,528 --> 00:52:57,728
That's Ye Eun's, and that's Yeong Gyeong's.

1199
00:53:00,058 --> 00:53:02,498
I'm half excited, half worried.

1200
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:08,908
(She carefully scans her Love QR Code.)

1201
00:53:10,868 --> 00:53:14,578
(Whose heart did So Hyun's appearance change?)

1202
00:53:15,848 --> 00:53:18,948
(Sang Won is the first person she met at Yeon House.)

1203
00:53:19,818 --> 00:53:20,847
(Well...)

1204
00:53:20,848 --> 00:53:23,718
(Since we were sitting next to each other...)

1205
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:26,058
(She seemed like my type.)

1206
00:53:26,388 --> 00:53:29,027
(Did Sang Won, who said she was his type, send her a message?)

1207
00:53:29,028 --> 00:53:31,187
I like a woman with simple features.

1208
00:53:31,188 --> 00:53:32,528
And the new girl has simple features.

1209
00:53:33,198 --> 00:53:36,368
I felt like I had never seen a woman like her before.

1210
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:43,508
(Which of the younger men chose So Hyun?)

1211
00:53:44,838 --> 00:53:47,578
(Surprised)

1212
00:53:50,778 --> 00:53:52,848
Two messages. I think she got two votes.

1213
00:53:53,448 --> 00:53:54,448
Or three?

1214
00:53:58,888 --> 00:54:01,118
(You have received no Love QR message.)

1215
00:54:01,288 --> 00:54:02,427
(She doesn't know how to react.)

1216
00:54:02,428 --> 00:54:03,428
What?

1217
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:05,958
Where did it go?

1218
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:09,727
Wait. She received no votes? Not even one?

1219
00:54:09,728 --> 00:54:10,997
But it's her first day.

1220
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,138
(It's okay. It's her first day.)

1221
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:15,908
There's none.

1222
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,638
I think it's completely understandable.

1223
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:24,548
It's been only a few hours since they first met me.

1224
00:54:25,478 --> 00:54:27,378
But still, it's a shame how things turned out.

1225
00:54:28,448 --> 00:54:33,058
If I talk to them 1-on-1 more,

1226
00:54:33,758 --> 00:54:35,688
something may happen, right?

1227
00:54:36,028 --> 00:54:38,828
(So Hyun is done with her warm-ups.)

1228
00:54:40,658 --> 00:54:42,628
So Hyun, it was your first time. How did it go?

1229
00:54:43,198 --> 00:54:44,628
I'm pretty sure she got many votes.

1230
00:54:47,938 --> 00:54:50,067
Why... Why would you say such a thing?

1231
00:54:50,068 --> 00:54:52,177
- I mean, it's possible.
- There's nothing wrong about it.

1232
00:54:52,178 --> 00:54:53,208
I agree.

1233
00:54:53,608 --> 00:54:56,878
The guys must seem different to her now.

1234
00:54:58,648 --> 00:55:01,548
- Do we have any cushions to sit on?
- Cushions?

1235
00:55:02,148 --> 00:55:04,218
Shall I give you a cushion? Would you like this one?

1236
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,617
- Here you go.
- You both sit on a cushion.

1237
00:55:06,618 --> 00:55:08,057
Mu Jin gave his cushion to her.

1238
00:55:08,058 --> 00:55:10,058
But she already received a cushion. Is that necessary?

1239
00:55:10,828 --> 00:55:12,128
She already received one.

1240
00:55:17,298 --> 00:55:19,898
(Bon Hee took Mu Jin's cushion in the end.)

1241
00:55:23,008 --> 00:55:24,108
It's quite cold.

1242
00:55:25,308 --> 00:55:29,678
I could tell who was interested in who.

1243
00:55:30,308 --> 00:55:33,048
I think I should be more aggressive.

1244
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:36,147
- Exactly. My gosh.
- You can just tell.

1245
00:55:36,148 --> 00:55:39,888
Both Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon gave her a cushion.

1246
00:55:39,988 --> 00:55:41,657
And Bon Hee took Mu Jin's.

1247
00:55:41,658 --> 00:55:43,588
- My point, exactly.
- Isn't it hurtful?

1248
00:55:44,028 --> 00:55:45,597
- I know, right?
- Watching it hurt my feelings.

1249
00:55:45,598 --> 00:55:49,527
If the man I like doesn't take the cushion...

1250
00:55:49,528 --> 00:55:51,128
- that I gave to him, - Yes.

1251
00:55:51,168 --> 00:55:54,898
I would get upset and give up on him.

1252
00:55:54,998 --> 00:55:58,368
Seriously, I wonder how that made Sang Hyeon feel.

1253
00:55:58,678 --> 00:56:02,507
We wouldn't know unless we're among them.

1254
00:56:02,508 --> 00:56:04,147
- Right.
- We need to be with them.

1255
00:56:04,148 --> 00:56:05,378
(Only the ones who are going through it know how it feels.)

1256
00:56:06,148 --> 00:56:09,088
When you become really close to her, you'll see that she's no joke.

1257
00:56:09,918 --> 00:56:12,517
I treated her casually first...

1258
00:56:12,518 --> 00:56:14,887
since we were going on a date.

1259
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:15,987
(Keeping a close watch)

1260
00:56:15,988 --> 00:56:18,858
We became more comfortable around each other than I thought.

1261
00:56:19,298 --> 00:56:21,327
We really hit it off well.

1262
00:56:21,328 --> 00:56:24,768
I was glad that things were going as I wanted them to go.

1263
00:56:24,868 --> 00:56:26,337
- She's very good...
- Oh, my goodness.

1264
00:56:26,338 --> 00:56:27,667
- with words as well.
- He's holding the glass...

1265
00:56:27,668 --> 00:56:28,867
so that he can use it as a weapon when necessary.

1266
00:56:28,868 --> 00:56:30,907
She has a really deep philosophy on life too.

1267
00:56:30,908 --> 00:56:33,307
- Expressing that sincerity...
- It was no joke on the way here.

1268
00:56:33,308 --> 00:56:35,007
Seriously, that's why I loved it.

1269
00:56:35,008 --> 00:56:37,678
He does seem to make people feel relaxed.

1270
00:56:40,948 --> 00:56:43,688
I thought that Ji Yung might be interested in Bon Hee.

1271
00:56:44,148 --> 00:56:45,588
Of course, it bothers me.

1272
00:56:46,058 --> 00:56:47,618
- Well...
- This is...

1273
00:56:48,728 --> 00:56:50,158
It's because I'm really nervous.

1274
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:51,688
Oh, no.

1275
00:56:52,198 --> 00:56:55,198
It seemed like she had really gotten close with Ji Yung.

1276
00:56:56,328 --> 00:56:57,628
I felt anxious.

1277
00:56:59,198 --> 00:57:00,467
(Ji Yung caused confusion for those who chose Bon Hee.)

1278
00:57:00,468 --> 00:57:02,038
They should experience a sense of anxiety too.

1279
00:57:02,468 --> 00:57:04,168
- It'll make them more desperate.
- That's right.

1280
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,437
(The next one to check her Love QR...)

1281
00:57:07,438 --> 00:57:10,808
(is Yeong Gyeong.)

1282
00:57:17,288 --> 00:57:24,158
(Which younger man sent Yeong Gyeong a Love QR Code?)

1283
00:57:25,058 --> 00:57:27,258
(Tilting her head)

1284
00:57:28,828 --> 00:57:32,268
(Two people have sent you Love QR Codes.)

1285
00:57:32,668 --> 00:57:33,797
Two people?

1286
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:35,407
(There are 2 younger men who chose Yeong Gyeong.)

1287
00:57:35,408 --> 00:57:36,638
(One more than before)

1288
00:57:37,508 --> 00:57:38,707
(Who are the 2 younger men that sent their hearts to Yeong Gyeong?)

1289
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:39,807
- First, there's Hyeon Jun.
- So, Hyeon Jun...

1290
00:57:39,808 --> 00:57:40,937
(Who are the 2 younger men that sent their hearts to Yeong Gyeong?)

1291
00:57:40,938 --> 00:57:43,448
(Checking the first Love QR)

1292
00:57:44,678 --> 00:57:46,047
(Sleepy)

1293
00:57:46,048 --> 00:57:47,118
"Sleepy?"

1294
00:57:48,378 --> 00:57:49,617
(Curious)

1295
00:57:49,618 --> 00:57:52,988
I'm not really sure who the message is from.

1296
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,628
I should close my eyes in the tunnel.

1297
00:57:57,288 --> 00:57:58,527
You're sleepy right now, aren't you?

1298
00:57:58,528 --> 00:57:59,828
(Laughing)

1299
00:58:00,198 --> 00:58:01,857
The question I asked Yeong Gyeong the most was...

1300
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:04,028
- whether she was sleepy.
- I see.

1301
00:58:04,828 --> 00:58:08,138
I thought a question mark would make it too obvious that it was from me,

1302
00:58:08,268 --> 00:58:10,568
so I just wrote "Sleepy" on purpose.

1303
00:58:11,068 --> 00:58:12,507
That's why she doesn't know.

1304
00:58:12,508 --> 00:58:14,477
(Hyeon Jun expressed his feelings for Yeong Gyeong.)

1305
00:58:14,478 --> 00:58:15,608
Hyeon Jun.

1306
00:58:15,948 --> 00:58:17,248
Who's the other one?

1307
00:58:17,478 --> 00:58:19,317
(The second Love QR Code that Yeong Gyeong received)

1308
00:58:19,318 --> 00:58:20,678
- How did this happen so suddenly?
- Sang Won?

1309
00:58:21,118 --> 00:58:22,988
(The second Love QR Code that Yeong Gyeong received)

1310
00:58:23,988 --> 00:58:24,988
- "Recommend good restaurants..." - "Recommend good restaurants..."

1311
00:58:24,989 --> 00:58:26,018
- "on Jeju Island?" - "on Jeju Island?"

1312
00:58:26,758 --> 00:58:28,087
Do you like traveling too?

1313
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,088
I love traveling.

1314
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:30,627
- You do?
- Yes.

1315
00:58:30,628 --> 00:58:32,128
Jeju Island is nice too.

1316
00:58:32,328 --> 00:58:33,797
- Do you know any good restaurants?
- Ji Yung?

1317
00:58:33,798 --> 00:58:34,898
I do.

1318
00:58:34,998 --> 00:58:36,998
- I'll recommend them to you.
- Yes, please do.

1319
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:39,468
We talked,

1320
00:58:39,798 --> 00:58:41,497
and her personality was so...

1321
00:58:41,498 --> 00:58:45,478
It was brief, but our conversation flowed really well.

1322
00:58:45,938 --> 00:58:48,878
I think I was very attracted to her.

1323
00:58:50,378 --> 00:58:52,177
There are some things that we don't know...

1324
00:58:52,178 --> 00:58:53,317
- between them.
- I know.

1325
00:58:53,318 --> 00:58:54,477
(Ji Yung expressed his feelings for Yeong Gyeong...)

1326
00:58:54,478 --> 00:58:55,618
(by referencing their conversation.)

1327
00:58:56,288 --> 00:58:58,347
Ji Yung chose Yeong Gyeong?

1328
00:58:58,348 --> 00:58:59,657
(Ji Yung chose Yeong Gyeong.)

1329
00:58:59,658 --> 00:59:01,717
But anyway, what's clear is...

1330
00:59:01,718 --> 00:59:04,057
that Ji Yung has left Bon Hee.

1331
00:59:04,058 --> 00:59:05,058
Yes.

1332
00:59:05,158 --> 00:59:06,397
After talking,

1333
00:59:06,398 --> 00:59:07,827
and things are...

1334
00:59:07,828 --> 00:59:09,928
- so clear between her and Mu Jin.
- Things are going well for them.

1335
00:59:11,228 --> 00:59:12,767
(Yeong Gyeong received Love QR Codes...)

1336
00:59:12,768 --> 00:59:14,538
(from Ji Yung and Hyeon Jun.)

1337
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:18,607
(Who did Yeong Gyeong express her feelings for?)

1338
00:59:18,608 --> 00:59:19,807
(First Love QR Code)

1339
00:59:19,808 --> 00:59:22,808
(The Love QR sent by Yeong Gyeong was an oven.)

1340
00:59:24,278 --> 00:59:27,147
I sent one to Hyeon Jun.

1341
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:28,177
It was Hyeon Jun.

1342
00:59:28,178 --> 00:59:29,617
Every time we went on a date,

1343
00:59:29,618 --> 00:59:31,747
he said he was addicted to carbs...

1344
00:59:31,748 --> 00:59:33,688
and that he loved bread so much.

1345
00:59:33,858 --> 00:59:36,528
He had said that several times.

1346
00:59:36,658 --> 00:59:37,827
So, I sent a photo...

1347
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:40,157
that might help him wonder and guess.

1348
00:59:40,158 --> 00:59:41,957
She's still sending something that will make him wonder.

1349
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:44,868
(Hyeon Jun and Yeong Gyeong's Love QRs were sent to each other.)

1350
00:59:47,298 --> 00:59:50,538
(And Ji Yung's first Love QR)

1351
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:56,978
(He checks his Love QR Code for the first time.)

1352
00:59:59,448 --> 01:00:01,218
(Ji Yung)

1353
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:06,558
(Whose heart will be inside Ji Yung's Love QR?)

1354
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:10,388
(Twitching)

1355
01:00:11,158 --> 01:00:13,227
(One person has sent you a Love QR Code.)

1356
01:00:13,228 --> 01:00:14,358
One person.

1357
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:18,228
(One older woman has expressed her feelings for Ji Yung.)

1358
01:00:19,898 --> 01:00:21,437
(A picture and a single-line message has been sent to Ji Yung.)

1359
01:00:21,438 --> 01:00:22,467
What is that?

1360
01:00:22,468 --> 01:00:24,067
- A rugby ball?
- "I want to talk to you alone?"

1361
01:00:24,068 --> 01:00:26,708
(I want to talk to you alone.)

1362
01:00:28,878 --> 01:00:33,718
(Which older woman sent the Love QR Code to Ji Yung?)

1363
01:00:33,978 --> 01:00:37,748
(Ji Won has always said she wanted a masculine guy.)

1364
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:39,587
(Then, I will...)

1365
01:00:39,588 --> 01:00:41,018
(choose this one.)

1366
01:00:41,288 --> 01:00:45,428
(I think I chose it thinking it was Ji Yung.)

1367
01:00:47,598 --> 01:00:50,228
(The owner of the rugby ball picture was Ji Won.)

1368
01:00:50,928 --> 01:00:53,968
(Ji Won's Love QR Code was sent to the masculine guy Ji Yung.)

1369
01:00:55,438 --> 01:00:59,408
(Does Ji Yung know how Ji Won feels?)

1370
01:01:02,348 --> 01:01:03,647
What about Sang Won?

1371
01:01:03,648 --> 01:01:04,807
(Sang Won's footsteps seem especially heavy...)

1372
01:01:04,808 --> 01:01:06,377
He has never received a Love QR Code before.

1373
01:01:06,378 --> 01:01:07,577
(on his way to the QR Room.)

1374
01:01:07,578 --> 01:01:09,148
He has never gotten one.

1375
01:01:11,688 --> 01:01:14,357
(His first trip to the QR Room)

1376
01:01:14,358 --> 01:01:15,658
(Tilting his head)

1377
01:01:16,558 --> 01:01:19,498
(No one chose Sang Won.)

1378
01:01:20,298 --> 01:01:23,368
Seeing it in real life was a little shocking.

1379
01:01:26,438 --> 01:01:28,138
(And today)

1380
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,768
(Park Sang Won, you don't have a date matching partner today.)

1381
01:01:30,868 --> 01:01:33,478
Really being left alone made me feel all sorts of mixed feelings.

1382
01:01:34,338 --> 01:01:35,707
(Following the Love QR Code,)

1383
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:37,208
(Sang Won wasn't chosen for a date either.)

1384
01:01:37,748 --> 01:01:40,578
I was thinking that it might be hard to get a QR Code today as well.

1385
01:01:43,188 --> 01:01:45,888
(Sighing)

1386
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,058
(A deep breath)

1387
01:01:51,388 --> 01:01:52,427
(Shutting his eyes)

1388
01:01:52,428 --> 01:01:54,098
Gosh, this guy is driving me crazy.

1389
01:01:56,028 --> 01:01:57,168
- For the first time.
- Please.

1390
01:01:58,468 --> 01:02:00,468
- He can't have zero votes again.
- Please help him.

1391
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:06,407
(Will Sang Won have...)

1392
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:09,802
(a Love QR Code today?)

1393
01:02:11,078 --> 01:02:13,517
(Hesitating)

1394
01:02:13,518 --> 01:02:15,378
He has a traumatic memory right now.

1395
01:02:15,848 --> 01:02:19,217
(He presses the button carefully.)

1396
01:02:19,218 --> 01:02:20,258
Please.

1397
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:23,088
(One person has sent you a Love QR Code.)

1398
01:02:23,428 --> 01:02:25,287
(Congratulations, Sang Won escapes getting 0 votes!)

1399
01:02:25,288 --> 01:02:27,198
Congratulations.

1400
01:02:30,568 --> 01:02:33,038
(What?)

1401
01:02:33,538 --> 01:02:34,837
(Sang Won's face has brightened up.)

1402
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:36,568
He will probably be able to guess who it is, right?

1403
01:02:36,868 --> 01:02:38,307
(Sent to Sang Won)

1404
01:02:38,308 --> 01:02:39,637
What did she send? It's a video.

1405
01:02:39,638 --> 01:02:41,407
(A video of the stairs)

1406
01:02:41,408 --> 01:02:42,577
What is that?

1407
01:02:42,578 --> 01:02:44,047
She's going up to the second floor, right?

1408
01:02:44,048 --> 01:02:46,247
(A video of the stairs was sent to Sang Won.)

1409
01:02:46,248 --> 01:02:47,348
What is this?

1410
01:02:52,348 --> 01:02:54,418
(Grinning)

1411
01:02:55,158 --> 01:02:58,388
I thought it might be Ye Eun.

1412
01:02:58,828 --> 01:03:01,298
Yesterday, Ye Eun said she liked wasabi.

1413
01:03:01,498 --> 01:03:03,727
I thought I should buy her some wasabi for sure,

1414
01:03:03,728 --> 01:03:05,068
so I bought some.

1415
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,838
- He bought some wasabi too.
- What?

1416
01:03:08,098 --> 01:03:09,208
Oh, really?

1417
01:03:09,868 --> 01:03:11,668
Really? Sang Won, did you really?

1418
01:03:12,938 --> 01:03:14,908
- I want to have some now.
- My goodness.

1419
01:03:15,238 --> 01:03:16,447
She loves it that much?

1420
01:03:16,448 --> 01:03:17,748
(Was the Love QR sent by Ye Eun who was touched by the wasabi?)

1421
01:03:17,848 --> 01:03:19,247
That vibe is for real.

1422
01:03:19,248 --> 01:03:22,147
(Ye Eun is the owner of the staircase video.)

1423
01:03:22,148 --> 01:03:23,148
I was so grateful.

1424
01:03:23,149 --> 01:03:26,858
I was so touched by the wasabi.

1425
01:03:27,288 --> 01:03:29,728
I called him over with my hand.

1426
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:31,788
- Sang Won.
- Yes?

1427
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:33,158
Thank you.

1428
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:34,498
You liked the wasabi, right?

1429
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,267
Thank you.

1430
01:03:36,268 --> 01:03:37,397
- Get some rest.
- Okay.

1431
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:38,527
(Ye Eun expressed her thanks for Sang Won on the stairs.)

1432
01:03:38,528 --> 01:03:39,668
Really?

1433
01:03:40,498 --> 01:03:43,607
In a way, he could've cared about several people,

1434
01:03:43,608 --> 01:03:44,708
but still...

1435
01:03:45,508 --> 01:03:48,778
I thought this was his way of caring about me.

1436
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,308
Right. She would feel grateful.

1437
01:03:53,618 --> 01:03:55,918
I was feeling depressed, but I felt grateful.

1438
01:03:56,848 --> 01:03:59,048
This couple is a win-win for each other.

1439
01:03:59,558 --> 01:04:00,858
I really hope things work out for them.

1440
01:04:03,088 --> 01:04:04,358
He's running downstairs.

1441
01:04:05,728 --> 01:04:08,128
This is my first time seeing Sang Won so excited.

1442
01:04:08,528 --> 01:04:10,397
- I'm glad.
- Our director.

1443
01:04:10,398 --> 01:04:14,267
(Ye Eun's feelings were delivered to Sang Won.)

1444
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:18,968
(Will Sang Won's feelings point in the same direction?)

1445
01:04:29,348 --> 01:04:32,247
(Ye Eun had sent Sang Won a Love QR.)

1446
01:04:32,248 --> 01:04:33,587
(Ye Eun)

1447
01:04:33,588 --> 01:04:35,757
(Did her feelings and Sang Won's connect?)

1448
01:04:35,758 --> 01:04:38,227
Sang Won didn't choose someone else, did he?

1449
01:04:38,228 --> 01:04:39,928
(Did her feelings and Sang Won's connect?)

1450
01:04:43,528 --> 01:04:46,198
(Ye Eun's QR is empty.)

1451
01:04:46,838 --> 01:04:47,838
What?

1452
01:04:48,498 --> 01:04:50,138
What? It's zero?

1453
01:04:50,638 --> 01:04:52,067
(Frozen)

1454
01:04:52,068 --> 01:04:54,138
- Wait a minute. What is this?
- What?

1455
01:04:55,638 --> 01:04:59,548
(Sang Won's Love QR didn't come to Ye Eun.)

1456
01:05:01,148 --> 01:05:03,348
(Mixed feelings)

1457
01:05:04,348 --> 01:05:09,371
(Then, where did Sang Won's Love QR go?)

1458
01:05:09,874 --> 01:05:13,814
(Sang Won's Love QR didn't come to Ye Eun.)

1459
01:05:15,225 --> 01:05:17,455
(Mixed feelings)

1460
01:05:18,495 --> 01:05:23,794
(Then, where did Sang Won's Love QR go?)

1461
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:25,935
(One person has sent you a Love QR Code.)

1462
01:05:26,735 --> 01:05:28,605
(I want to hear your story a bit more, Ji Won.)

1463
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:31,805
For real?

1464
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:33,034
What is this?

1465
01:05:33,035 --> 01:05:34,435
Something must've happened.

1466
01:05:35,845 --> 01:05:37,775
(No way.)

1467
01:05:41,115 --> 01:05:43,844
(What is the message inside the Love QR that Sang Won sent?)

1468
01:05:43,845 --> 01:05:45,055
Let's see what the message says.

1469
01:05:45,515 --> 01:05:47,385
"I want to hear your story a bit more, Ji Won."

1470
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:53,055
I think it might be Sang Hyeon.

1471
01:05:53,795 --> 01:05:56,994
Anyway, when I went on a date with Sang Hyeon,

1472
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:59,565
I felt like we had a deep conversation.

1473
01:06:00,765 --> 01:06:01,834
I thought the message meant that...

1474
01:06:01,835 --> 01:06:05,435
he wanted to have an even deeper conversation.

1475
01:06:05,835 --> 01:06:08,745
That's why I guessed it might be Sang Hyeon.

1476
01:06:09,175 --> 01:06:10,245
What is this?

1477
01:06:11,345 --> 01:06:12,714
- Hang on. This is...
- I guess there wasn't anything...

1478
01:06:12,715 --> 01:06:14,344
between her and Sang Won, then?

1479
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,215
Sang Won chose Ji Won, right?

1480
01:06:17,185 --> 01:06:20,684
But Ji Won doesn't even know that it's from Sang Won.

1481
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,054
- No, not at all.
- She has no clue.

1482
01:06:22,055 --> 01:06:23,954
Then, Sang Won...

1483
01:06:23,955 --> 01:06:26,795
didn't even send her a signal. He must've thought all by himself.

1484
01:06:27,655 --> 01:06:29,695
"Ji Won." Like this.

1485
01:06:29,825 --> 01:06:31,935
- That's right.
- But Ji Won doesn't even know.

1486
01:06:32,495 --> 01:06:34,704
He did choose Ji Won,

1487
01:06:34,705 --> 01:06:38,104
but Sang Won didn't seem like he was that interested, to be honest.

1488
01:06:38,105 --> 01:06:40,734
He was just sending it to every girl as if he were applying to colleges,

1489
01:06:40,735 --> 01:06:41,744
and wherever he got accepted,

1490
01:06:41,745 --> 01:06:44,474
- he'd go.
- Sure, it's okay to apply.

1491
01:06:44,475 --> 01:06:46,714
It's fine to apply, but that college...

1492
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:48,684
doesn't even know who sent the application.

1493
01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:50,744
- I know.
- This is the worst situation ever.

1494
01:06:50,745 --> 01:06:51,884
What meaning does this have?

1495
01:06:51,885 --> 01:06:54,725
Why can't he utilize the Love QR properly and just blow it?

1496
01:06:54,955 --> 01:06:56,054
I know.

1497
01:06:56,055 --> 01:06:57,224
What was he suddenly feeling?

1498
01:06:57,225 --> 01:06:59,024
- Sang Won first liked Bon Hee.
- This is kind of...

1499
01:06:59,025 --> 01:07:01,594
He also said that So Hyun was his type.

1500
01:07:01,595 --> 01:07:03,165
Then, he gave Ye Eun wasabi.

1501
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,134
This is bad.

1502
01:07:06,135 --> 01:07:07,695
(What did Sang Won's message mean?)

1503
01:07:07,965 --> 01:07:09,805
Based on first impressions,

1504
01:07:10,105 --> 01:07:15,145
So Hyun was the closest to my ideal type in terms of looks,

1505
01:07:16,475 --> 01:07:18,445
but we haven't really talked much yet.

1506
01:07:18,615 --> 01:07:20,715
So, there's Ye Eun, who I talked to a lot on our date,

1507
01:07:21,145 --> 01:07:24,955
and Ji Won, who I've talked to a lot since the first day...

1508
01:07:25,415 --> 01:07:26,484
and who looked out for me a lot too.

1509
01:07:26,485 --> 01:07:28,285
I was going back and forth between those two.

1510
01:07:29,485 --> 01:07:33,394
(Ji Won came to pick Sang Won up for the first meeting.)

1511
01:07:33,395 --> 01:07:36,494
On the first day, we didn't get to talk much comfortably,

1512
01:07:36,495 --> 01:07:37,865
which I still feel disappointed about.

1513
01:07:38,895 --> 01:07:40,364
Yeong Gyeong just looks like...

1514
01:07:40,365 --> 01:07:41,804
- a celebrity.
- Hey, Yeong Gyeong.

1515
01:07:41,805 --> 01:07:44,335
Ji Won really played along with my vibe,

1516
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:45,905
and she was so considerate.

1517
01:07:46,505 --> 01:07:48,974
I felt even more disappointed that we didn't get to talk more.

1518
01:07:48,975 --> 01:07:52,114
I felt more curious about her as I spent more time at Yeon House.

1519
01:07:52,115 --> 01:07:53,774
Tomorrow, if I get the chance,

1520
01:07:53,775 --> 01:07:56,084
I really wanted to talk to Ji Won once more.

1521
01:07:56,085 --> 01:07:57,185
That's why I sent it to her.

1522
01:07:58,855 --> 01:08:02,425
Sang Won might not have that much dating experience.

1523
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:09,665
(And Ye Eun...)

1524
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:14,465
(She leaves the QR Room looking dejected.)

1525
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:16,165
Oh, dear.

1526
01:08:22,905 --> 01:08:24,374
(She turns away from where everyone is gathered.)

1527
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:25,875
Of course, she doesn't want to drink.

1528
01:08:28,385 --> 01:08:32,355
(She spends time in her room alone.)

1529
01:08:37,525 --> 01:08:39,394
I'm not really sure, to be honest.

1530
01:08:39,395 --> 01:08:41,924
I don't know how Sang Won feels...

1531
01:08:41,925 --> 01:08:44,264
because I haven't been receiving any QR Codes.

1532
01:08:44,265 --> 01:08:45,935
Honestly, I am curious.

1533
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,564
Doesn't he have feelings for me? Did I do something wrong?

1534
01:08:50,565 --> 01:08:53,004
But if I did something wrong, why did he buy the wasabi?

1535
01:08:53,005 --> 01:08:54,475
That's what I thought.

1536
01:08:55,845 --> 01:08:58,314
Since things happened that way on the second day as well,

1537
01:08:58,315 --> 01:09:00,345
I was wondering whether this was right...

1538
01:09:01,315 --> 01:09:03,385
a bit more.

1539
01:09:03,915 --> 01:09:05,385
So, I am pretty disappointed.

1540
01:09:06,215 --> 01:09:11,455
(Ye Eun tries hard to smile.)

1541
01:09:12,555 --> 01:09:15,694
Well, I want to think more about...

1542
01:09:15,695 --> 01:09:19,265
what I should do, honestly.

1543
01:09:20,235 --> 01:09:22,764
Right, she must have a lot on her mind. What will she do?

1544
01:09:22,765 --> 01:09:23,964
(The Love QR ends amid complicated relationships.)

1545
01:09:23,965 --> 01:09:25,905
This is a change of tides right now.

1546
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:30,105
(For the first time, they checked how everyone felt.)

1547
01:09:32,215 --> 01:09:35,344
Right now, after checking the Love QR,

1548
01:09:35,345 --> 01:09:37,144
the mood has shifted a bit.

1549
01:09:37,145 --> 01:09:39,184
(Complicated vibes are in the air at Yeon House.)

1550
01:09:39,185 --> 01:09:40,615
It has subtly shifted.

1551
01:09:44,025 --> 01:09:47,255
(Sang Won comes to the 2nd floor living room.)

1552
01:09:50,495 --> 01:09:52,895
(Glancing)

1553
01:09:54,395 --> 01:09:55,565
Did you get something?

1554
01:09:55,635 --> 01:09:57,905
(Staring)

1555
01:10:00,975 --> 01:10:02,104
(Ye Eun was staring at Sang Won.)

1556
01:10:02,105 --> 01:10:03,275
Oh, no.

1557
01:10:03,575 --> 01:10:07,274
"Why did he do that? Why didn't he choose me?"

1558
01:10:07,275 --> 01:10:08,614
Say something. Ask him.

1559
01:10:08,615 --> 01:10:11,244
- Yes, ask him honestly.
- That's it! Go!

1560
01:10:11,245 --> 01:10:12,285
Oh, really?

1561
01:10:13,715 --> 01:10:14,785
No.

1562
01:10:15,885 --> 01:10:17,455
Oh, was this yours, Ye Eun?

1563
01:10:18,055 --> 01:10:19,355
She's just going to her room.

1564
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:21,825
- Do you want to talk for a minute?
- Sure.

1565
01:10:22,595 --> 01:10:23,694
(Good job, Ye Eun.)

1566
01:10:23,695 --> 01:10:25,194
I love that.

1567
01:10:25,195 --> 01:10:26,395
Ye Eun, you did great.

1568
01:10:26,995 --> 01:10:29,535
(Do you want to talk for a minute?)

1569
01:10:30,765 --> 01:10:36,645
(Ye Eun asks to talk to Sang Won quietly but suddenly.)

1570
01:10:38,445 --> 01:10:39,874
(Sang Won follows her out without anyone's knowing.)

1571
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:43,845
I bet Sang Won is wondering, "Why is she asking to see me?"

1572
01:10:45,755 --> 01:10:47,385
- Where should we go? Downstairs?
- Let's go downstairs.

1573
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:51,994
- Do we have to be quiet?
- What?

1574
01:10:51,995 --> 01:10:53,095
Do we have to be quiet?

1575
01:10:53,255 --> 01:10:56,765
- No, we don't have to be quiet.
- He's kind of scared.

1576
01:10:58,125 --> 01:10:59,864
There's no one here.

1577
01:10:59,865 --> 01:11:02,805
(The two came down to the 1st floor where no one is around.)

1578
01:11:03,305 --> 01:11:04,535
What will she say?

1579
01:11:06,175 --> 01:11:09,405
- I've never been here at this hour.
- This is nice.

1580
01:11:10,945 --> 01:11:12,745
How was it today? Did you have fun?

1581
01:11:16,585 --> 01:11:19,754
No. I chose that bag today,

1582
01:11:19,755 --> 01:11:21,885
thinking it was yours.

1583
01:11:21,955 --> 01:11:24,355
What? Why did that happen?

1584
01:11:24,525 --> 01:11:27,225
Well, so... What is it?

1585
01:11:28,425 --> 01:11:31,865
The belonging that I chose...

1586
01:11:32,995 --> 01:11:35,834
Everyone thought that it was yours.

1587
01:11:35,835 --> 01:11:38,574
Oh, when you guys were guessing together?

1588
01:11:38,575 --> 01:11:42,444
Yes. I just thought that it was yours. That's how it felt.

1589
01:11:42,445 --> 01:11:43,845
- That's just how it felt?
- Yes.

1590
01:11:44,475 --> 01:11:45,645
Who did you go with?

1591
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:47,874
The bag was Mu Jin's.

1592
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:49,145
Oh, really? Mu Jin?

1593
01:11:49,615 --> 01:11:51,754
Oh, that? Wasn't Mu Jin wearing it?

1594
01:11:51,755 --> 01:11:53,754
- Right.
- Yes.

1595
01:11:53,755 --> 01:11:55,054
(Ye Eun works up her courage and expresses herself to Sang Won.)

1596
01:11:55,055 --> 01:11:58,025
But Mu Jin came out,

1597
01:11:59,925 --> 01:12:02,564
- and I got back from the date...
- You can't help it.

1598
01:12:02,565 --> 01:12:04,324
I'm sure that's why they made us choose belongings,

1599
01:12:04,325 --> 01:12:05,635
so that we can't tell.

1600
01:12:06,035 --> 01:12:08,335
But you hadn't had anything to eat.

1601
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:10,934
She cared about him.

1602
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:12,005
But it was okay.

1603
01:12:12,275 --> 01:12:15,975
Well, if I were to express myself...

1604
01:12:16,505 --> 01:12:19,244
I went to the Korean dining restaurant, you know?

1605
01:12:19,245 --> 01:12:22,545
- I chose to go to that restaurant.
- Right.

1606
01:12:23,615 --> 01:12:25,954
When I got there, I thought of you.

1607
01:12:25,955 --> 01:12:27,155
Oh, dear.

1608
01:12:32,555 --> 01:12:33,595
But I...

1609
01:12:35,865 --> 01:12:38,995
From our date before, I thought that...

1610
01:12:39,895 --> 01:12:41,534
you didn't have much fun.

1611
01:12:41,535 --> 01:12:42,904
- Me?
- Well, I just thought to myself.

1612
01:12:42,905 --> 01:12:44,705
- Oh, really?
- Maybe...

1613
01:12:45,275 --> 01:12:47,635
you thought we didn't get along very well.

1614
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,704
I guess I was trying to read your face.

1615
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:53,374
(He was trying to read her face during their date?)

1616
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:55,544
He was trying to read her face.

1617
01:12:55,545 --> 01:12:57,144
(Thinking)

1618
01:12:57,145 --> 01:12:59,315
Actually, I had so much fun on our date yesterday.

1619
01:12:59,585 --> 01:13:00,985
Oh, really? I thought...

1620
01:13:01,515 --> 01:13:03,685
You could probably tell when we're alone,

1621
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:05,795
but our personalities didn't really match well.

1622
01:13:07,525 --> 01:13:08,525
(Ye Eun and Sang Won's first date)

1623
01:13:08,526 --> 01:13:09,625
Don't you dip it in soy sauce?

1624
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:11,265
I don't eat it with soy sauce.

1625
01:13:12,495 --> 01:13:15,264
I thought you were kind of frigid, but you're not like that.

1626
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:16,834
You seem very cheerful.

1627
01:13:16,835 --> 01:13:18,305
(Nodding without saying anything)

1628
01:13:18,675 --> 01:13:19,975
(Reading her reaction)

1629
01:13:20,435 --> 01:13:23,345
(To Sang Won, they didn't get along well on their date.)

1630
01:13:24,575 --> 01:13:28,715
(They spent time together, but their hearts went separate ways.)

1631
01:13:31,345 --> 01:13:33,355
You should decide which way you want to go.

1632
01:13:35,955 --> 01:13:37,455
Gosh, this is kind of awkward.

1633
01:13:39,495 --> 01:13:40,555
Shall we go up?

1634
01:13:47,295 --> 01:13:48,965
Oh, my head hurts.

1635
01:13:50,765 --> 01:13:52,434
I don't know what to do.

1636
01:13:52,435 --> 01:13:54,875
(Sang Won's mind is in a jumble after talking to Ye Eun.)

1637
01:13:56,005 --> 01:13:58,915
I did feel kind of flustered in that situation.

1638
01:13:59,175 --> 01:14:02,885
When I went on that date with Ye Eun on the second day,

1639
01:14:03,315 --> 01:14:05,414
I didn't feel like...

1640
01:14:05,415 --> 01:14:07,054
she really enjoyed herself on our date.

1641
01:14:07,055 --> 01:14:08,484
Right, that could happen.

1642
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:09,924
So, we did grow closer,

1643
01:14:09,925 --> 01:14:12,794
but I didn't feel like she had feelings for me as a guy.

1644
01:14:12,795 --> 01:14:15,364
So, I'm still thinking about what to do...

1645
01:14:15,365 --> 01:14:17,025
about my relationship with Ye Eun.

1646
01:14:21,535 --> 01:14:22,665
Things have gotten more complicated.

1647
01:14:23,565 --> 01:14:24,635
I have a lot on my mind.

1648
01:14:27,235 --> 01:14:28,704
Gosh, my head is in a jumble.

1649
01:14:28,705 --> 01:14:30,544
(Sang Won still feels confused.)

1650
01:14:30,545 --> 01:14:34,975
Actually, there were a few people I was curious about, including Ye Eun.

1651
01:14:36,115 --> 01:14:37,444
But looking back...

1652
01:14:37,445 --> 01:14:39,115
When I see you, Hyeon Jun,

1653
01:14:39,415 --> 01:14:41,685
you look like you're at ease because you've made up your mind.

1654
01:14:42,885 --> 01:14:44,584
But the first person you met...

1655
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:46,795
must've been the one you liked from the beginning.

1656
01:14:47,325 --> 01:14:49,824
Well, I'm someone who thinks that it's pointless...

1657
01:14:49,825 --> 01:14:51,494
to get to know several people...

1658
01:14:51,495 --> 01:14:53,895
by spending short amounts of time with them.

1659
01:14:54,195 --> 01:14:56,564
If there's someone I have in mind,

1660
01:14:56,565 --> 01:15:00,005
I tend to try to get to know that person a little more.

1661
01:15:00,535 --> 01:15:02,205
- I don't...
- Someone you're curious about...

1662
01:15:02,305 --> 01:15:03,344
In the time that I was given,

1663
01:15:03,345 --> 01:15:05,344
- I did what I could.
- Did you want to...

1664
01:15:05,345 --> 01:15:06,345
go out with her again today?

1665
01:15:06,415 --> 01:15:08,315
- What? Yes.
- Did you want to go out today too?

1666
01:15:08,515 --> 01:15:10,885
Actually, I want to go out with Yeong Gyeong tomorrow too.

1667
01:15:11,685 --> 01:15:12,885
- Did you want to go out today too?
- Yes.

1668
01:15:15,255 --> 01:15:16,354
I think you two are similar.

1669
01:15:16,355 --> 01:15:17,725
I feel the exact same way.

1670
01:15:18,255 --> 01:15:21,494
Well, ever since the beginning, my feelings...

1671
01:15:21,495 --> 01:15:23,565
- were focused on Bon Hee.
- What?

1672
01:15:24,195 --> 01:15:26,665
(Kim Sang Hyeon, you're so cool!)

1673
01:15:27,265 --> 01:15:28,635
That's what I wanted.

1674
01:15:29,265 --> 01:15:31,164
I've never seen the guys...

1675
01:15:31,165 --> 01:15:32,775
talk about that when they're alone.

1676
01:15:32,805 --> 01:15:33,805
(Amazed)

1677
01:15:33,806 --> 01:15:36,105
Sang Hyeon isn't some ordinary guy.

1678
01:15:36,205 --> 01:15:39,344
Well, ever since the beginning, my feelings...

1679
01:15:39,345 --> 01:15:41,545
were focused on Bon Hee.

1680
01:15:44,985 --> 01:15:46,454
- I wanted to go on a date...
- Who do you like the most?

1681
01:15:46,455 --> 01:15:47,555
with Bon Hee.

1682
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:51,255
But honestly,

1683
01:15:52,255 --> 01:15:55,765
I thought Mu Jin was the one who had the clearest stance.

1684
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:57,025
My stance?

1685
01:15:57,225 --> 01:15:58,565
I have a clear stance.

1686
01:15:59,535 --> 01:16:02,365
To be completely honest,

1687
01:16:04,135 --> 01:16:05,705
I am not curious about anyone else.

1688
01:16:10,745 --> 01:16:12,374
You two already look too tight.

1689
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:13,445
- That's true.
- I actually...

1690
01:16:13,845 --> 01:16:16,545
This is what I thought. If they become too close,

1691
01:16:16,815 --> 01:16:19,954
even if I wanted to get to know her, I won't be able to do it.

1692
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:21,484
That's what I thought.

1693
01:16:21,485 --> 01:16:22,924
- It's not like that.
- It's not like that.

1694
01:16:22,925 --> 01:16:24,854
We are close, but we have to compete fairly.

1695
01:16:24,855 --> 01:16:26,055
It's a competition, after all.

1696
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:30,365
You just consider your feelings.

1697
01:16:37,405 --> 01:16:39,604
(The younger men start to reveal their honest feelings.)

1698
01:16:39,605 --> 01:16:40,634
It's tense in that room.

1699
01:16:40,635 --> 01:16:42,504
This is good. It's good to let it all out.

1700
01:16:42,505 --> 01:16:44,704
- Yes. It feels good.
- I love it.

1701
01:16:44,705 --> 01:16:46,344
- I feel much better now.
- It's much better.

1702
01:16:46,345 --> 01:16:49,015
(It's the night with mixed emotions.)

1703
01:16:49,945 --> 01:16:51,315
Sang Hyeon surprised me.

1704
01:16:51,415 --> 01:16:55,285
Sang Hyeon said that he's always had a thing...

1705
01:16:55,555 --> 01:16:58,625
for Bon Hee in front of all the men.

1706
01:16:59,095 --> 01:17:03,064
That's him trying to keep Mu Jin in check.

1707
01:17:03,065 --> 01:17:05,335
Do you know why he said that?

1708
01:17:05,435 --> 01:17:07,135
He doesn't need to make a declaration.

1709
01:17:07,495 --> 01:17:09,004
The fact that he made a declaration means...

1710
01:17:09,005 --> 01:17:11,065
that he will now take actions.

1711
01:17:11,165 --> 01:17:13,404
"I will take actions now,"

1712
01:17:13,405 --> 01:17:15,104
"so understand it, whatever I do."

1713
01:17:15,105 --> 01:17:16,605
"I said it."

1714
01:17:16,705 --> 01:17:18,574
So people now have some level of expectations.

1715
01:17:18,575 --> 01:17:22,344
Sang Hyeon is going to become very aggressive.

1716
01:17:22,345 --> 01:17:23,444
Sang Hyeon...

1717
01:17:23,445 --> 01:17:25,954
- has to feel impatient.
- Why?

1718
01:17:25,955 --> 01:17:29,224
Mu Jin and Bon Hee...

1719
01:17:29,225 --> 01:17:31,255
dated other people for the first time.

1720
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:34,224
He would only see a possibility if they seemed shaken.

1721
01:17:34,225 --> 01:17:36,164
But after dating other people,

1722
01:17:36,165 --> 01:17:38,124
they went into a room alone.

1723
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:40,194
When they came out of the room, they were tighter than ever.

1724
01:17:40,195 --> 01:17:43,235
He must've thought he wouldn't have any chance if he waited more.

1725
01:17:43,535 --> 01:17:45,934
That must have given him the reason to think...

1726
01:17:45,935 --> 01:17:47,774
- that it's time to take action.
- Right.

1727
01:17:47,775 --> 01:17:48,775
Yes.

1728
01:17:49,545 --> 01:17:52,475
(The Secret Room is open.)

1729
01:17:54,745 --> 01:17:59,885
(Bon Hee, the one with the most votes)

1730
01:18:00,685 --> 01:18:01,784
(It's her second visit to the Secret Room.)

1731
01:18:01,785 --> 01:18:03,024
It's her second visit.

1732
01:18:03,025 --> 01:18:05,225
(It's her second visit to the Secret Room.)

1733
01:18:06,325 --> 01:18:07,325
(It's her chance to find out the age of a man of her choice.)

1734
01:18:07,326 --> 01:18:08,554
(Open the envelope and guess the age of the person...)

1735
01:18:08,555 --> 01:18:09,725
(you're curious about. Please keep what you learn a secret.)

1736
01:18:10,765 --> 01:18:12,364
(Whose age would Bon Hee want to know?)

1737
01:18:12,365 --> 01:18:13,935
I wish she would check someone else's age.

1738
01:18:14,735 --> 01:18:15,735
Please.

1739
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:21,705
(After thinking carefully, she moves.)

1740
01:18:23,475 --> 01:18:31,385
(Bon Hee chose a photo from someone's childhood.)

1741
01:18:33,415 --> 01:18:35,354
- It's Sang Hyeon.
- Yes, it's Sang Hyeon.

1742
01:18:35,355 --> 01:18:36,355
(The boy in the photo is Sang Hyeon.)

1743
01:18:36,356 --> 01:18:38,055
Thank you, Bon Hee!

1744
01:18:38,455 --> 01:18:39,825
Well done.

1745
01:18:40,225 --> 01:18:41,795
He's similar to how he is now.

1746
01:18:42,195 --> 01:18:45,894
But when he was little, he looked innocent without the nervousness.

1747
01:18:45,895 --> 01:18:47,765
Right now, he looks nervous.

1748
01:18:48,905 --> 01:18:50,004
He looks nervous.

1749
01:18:50,005 --> 01:18:53,805
(Below the innocent face, there's a hint about his age.)

1750
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:58,244
(The photo was taken in 2004.)

1751
01:18:58,245 --> 01:19:01,145
- It's 2004.
- In 2004,

1752
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,514
Bon Hee was wearing a duffle coat.

1753
01:19:03,515 --> 01:19:06,815
(In 2004, Bon Hee was wearing a duffle coat.)

1754
01:19:09,325 --> 01:19:11,955
(Bon Hee opened Sang Hyeon's drawer.)

1755
01:19:12,425 --> 01:19:15,524
I am always more drawn...

1756
01:19:15,525 --> 01:19:17,795
to people who are calm.

1757
01:19:17,895 --> 01:19:19,134
Clearly Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon.

1758
01:19:19,135 --> 01:19:21,164
Because of the conversations we had yesterday,

1759
01:19:21,165 --> 01:19:23,965
I became curious about the person.

1760
01:19:24,405 --> 01:19:26,204
I was curious about him, so I opened his drawer.

1761
01:19:26,205 --> 01:19:27,575
- She was curious.
- See?

1762
01:19:27,675 --> 01:19:29,844
This is why you need to express your feelings.

1763
01:19:29,845 --> 01:19:31,475
You shouldn't just sit and watch.

1764
01:19:31,575 --> 01:19:34,114
If Sang Hyeon takes action,

1765
01:19:34,115 --> 01:19:36,215
we never know what will happen to Bon Hee's feelings.

1766
01:19:37,185 --> 01:19:40,084
Sang Hyeon is the one I am curious to learn about.

1767
01:19:40,085 --> 01:19:41,755
(Smiling)

1768
01:19:42,685 --> 01:19:48,624
(Who is Bon Hee's heart leaning toward?)

1769
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:50,325
Woo Young said it earlier.

1770
01:19:50,425 --> 01:19:53,564
In 2004, Bon Hee was wearing a duffle coat.

1771
01:19:53,565 --> 01:19:54,834
Is that right? Was it 2004?

1772
01:19:54,835 --> 01:19:56,235
- It was 2004.
- It's right.

1773
01:19:56,335 --> 01:19:57,634
- Right?
- Right.

1774
01:19:57,635 --> 01:19:59,435
- Then...
- They have a big age gap.

1775
01:19:59,535 --> 01:20:01,505
If she was 17 years old...

1776
01:20:01,605 --> 01:20:02,904
He must've been in sixth grade.

1777
01:20:02,905 --> 01:20:04,044
Right?

1778
01:20:04,045 --> 01:20:05,375
- He's in 5th or 6th grade.
- Yes.

1779
01:20:05,475 --> 01:20:07,015
So that's 12 years old.

1780
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:10,084
That means she's at least five years older than him.

1781
01:20:10,085 --> 01:20:11,544
- At least.
- About...

1782
01:20:11,545 --> 01:20:13,355
- About 5, 6 years older.
- At least 5 years.

1783
01:20:13,815 --> 01:20:15,255
It's not as big as ten years.

1784
01:20:15,355 --> 01:20:16,584
- Not that big.
- Less than ten years.

1785
01:20:16,585 --> 01:20:17,785
- Less than 10 years.
- Less than 10 years.

1786
01:20:20,155 --> 01:20:23,065
(It's Yeong Gyeong's first time to visit the Secret Room.)

1787
01:20:28,295 --> 01:20:33,705
(Whose age does Yeong Gyeong want to find out?)

1788
01:20:34,605 --> 01:20:36,845
(Who's the younger man Yeong Gyeong chose?)

1789
01:20:38,475 --> 01:20:41,445
(Yeong Gyeong chose someone's childhood photo.)

1790
01:20:42,585 --> 01:20:46,184
(The boy in the photo is...)

1791
01:20:46,185 --> 01:20:50,025
(Hyeon Jun.)

1792
01:20:51,425 --> 01:20:52,494
(At the end of her fond gaze lies Hyeon Jun's photo.)

1793
01:20:52,495 --> 01:20:53,954
I'm curious about his age.

1794
01:20:53,955 --> 01:20:56,924
I want to check it.

1795
01:20:56,925 --> 01:20:59,194
(The year in the photo...)

1796
01:20:59,195 --> 01:21:02,835
(is 1998.)

1797
01:21:04,265 --> 01:21:10,875
(How much is their age gap?)

1798
01:21:13,715 --> 01:21:16,115
(Can we talk, Mu Jin?)

1799
01:21:16,745 --> 01:21:19,215
(Mu Jin is startled by the sudden call.)

1800
01:21:20,285 --> 01:21:23,825
(Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon talk.)

1801
01:21:24,455 --> 01:21:28,295
(I've always had a feeling for Bon Hee.)

1802
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:32,165
(I called you to ask to let me spend some time with her.)

1803
01:21:33,935 --> 01:21:35,765
(Bon Hee, can we talk?)

1804
01:21:36,305 --> 01:21:39,075
(Sang Hyeon calls her, and Bon Hee follows him.)

1805
01:21:39,505 --> 01:21:44,275
(So Hyun quietly watches it happen.)

1806
01:21:46,245 --> 01:21:47,374
(I can see things, you know.)

1807
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:49,385
(I can only approach you when I have conviction.)

1808
01:21:50,445 --> 01:21:55,055
(Once again, he confesses his honest feelings.)

1809
01:21:57,825 --> 01:22:00,254
(That night)

1810
01:22:00,255 --> 01:22:02,695
(Peeking)

1811
01:22:03,965 --> 01:22:06,695
(Someone comes for Sang Hyeon.)

1812
01:22:07,995 --> 01:22:10,304
(So Hyun musters up her courage...)

1813
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:13,834
(and carefully approaches Sang Hyeon.)

1814
01:22:13,835 --> 01:22:14,935
Really?
