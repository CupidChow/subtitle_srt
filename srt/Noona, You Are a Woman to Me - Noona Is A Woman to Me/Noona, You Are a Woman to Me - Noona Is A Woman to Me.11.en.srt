1
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:07,540
(The younger men...)

2
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,750
(have more dilemmas after the age reveal.)

3
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:14,821
(So do the older women.)

4
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:18,451
(But they might be different.)

5
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:21,290
(I have a feeling...)

6
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,321
(there will definitely be a twist or change.)

7
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,230
(I keep thinking...)

8
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:28,530
(you're approaching me even though you're not being serious.)

9
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:30,371
I really can't tell how you feel.

10
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,740
(Shocked)

11
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:35,800
(Not being able to break free from such a thought...)

12
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:37,841
(makes it hard for me to do something.)

13
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,481
(Sang Hyeon misunderstood So Hyun's sincerity.)

14
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,211
(Were you not shocked after hearing my age?)

15
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:47,921
(It's impossible not to think things through...)

16
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:52,321
(when our age gap goes over 10 years.)

17
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:55,561
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin face the big age gap of 12 years.)

18
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:59,760
(Right now, I'm only interested in you.)

19
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:01,641
(I want to go on a date with you and miss you.)

20
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:04,771
(The guy I was drawn to was you, Sang Won.)

21
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:08,571
(Sang Won's worry grows after Ye Eun and Ji Won's confessions.)

22
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:11,671
(The last morning after the age reveal before the final decision)

23
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:15,640
(The younger men are to choose one woman...)

24
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:19,281
(they want to talk to for each day and night.)

25
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:22,271
(After much consideration, the Day and Night Dates have begun.)

26
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:26,620
(The older woman Sang Hyeon chose for his Day Date is...)

27
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:29,721
(Bon Hee.)

28
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,991
(I know Bon Hee and Mu Jin are hitting it off well, )

29
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:34,601
(but I wanted to talk to her more.)

30
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,400
(You have your strengths and weaknesses.)

31
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:40,031
(I thought you were very meticulous.)

32
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:45,670
(The ideal type I had in mind...)

33
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:49,911
(was Bon Hee.)

34
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:53,280
(The younger man who chose So Hyun for his Day Date is...)

35
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:55,421
(Mu Jin.)

36
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,820
(I've wanted to talk to her.)

37
00:01:58,821 --> 00:01:59,891
(That's why I chose her.)

38
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:02,261
(When you joined, )

39
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:04,531
(I thought you were pretty...)

40
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:06,291
(and still very down to earth.)

41
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:10,471
(Would things have been different had I joined on the first day?)

42
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:12,170
(Thinking)

43
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:15,171
(Maybe.)

44
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:19,541
(So Hyun and Mu Jin shared an honest conversation.)

45
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:23,751
(Sang Won is waiting for his Day Date partner.)

46
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,120
(The older woman Sang Won chose for his Day Date is...)

47
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,721
(So Hyun.)

48
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:32,220
(Her looks are close to my ideal type.)

49
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:35,261
(I could put in more effort.)

50
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:40,130
- After the age reveal, - Yes?

51
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:42,830
- it's total chaos in Yeon House. - Correct.

52
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:44,601
What's more, after Bon Hee and Mu Jin's...

53
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:46,870
ages were revealed,

54
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:48,840
Bon Hee said to Mu Jin while returning inside,

55
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:51,371
- "You said you were old." - Exactly.

56
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,170
Mu Jin wasn't taken aback by it all.

57
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:54,380
- I know, right? - So as not to put Bon Hee...

58
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:55,580
on the spot,

59
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:56,910
he asked if it was a shocker.

60
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:59,010
(Was it a real shock?)

61
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,420
(Laughing)

62
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:01,621
- That was... - I know, right?

63
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:06,251
Mu Jin's way of talking must continue.

64
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:08,021
- It's no joke. - How charming.

65
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:12,230
Sang Hyeon finally gets to have a 1-on-1 date with Bon Hee.

66
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:14,460
I imagined something would happen...

67
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,831
as Sang Hyeon kept wavering.

68
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:18,730
But then, Sang Won chose So Hyun.

69
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:22,500
That's causing many...

70
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:23,911
unexpected possibilities.

71
00:03:24,211 --> 00:03:25,341
It's unpredictable.

72
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:30,511
(The younger man's choice, Sang Won's Day Date)

73
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,681
Oh, gosh.

74
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,780
(Who was Sang Won waiting for?)

75
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:39,750
- I'm here. Goodness. - Hi.

76
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:40,760
(So Hyun)

77
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:42,191
So Hyun has two dates.

78
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:45,561
Well...

79
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:47,901
Were you surprised?

80
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,760
(Thinking)

81
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:50,771
No.

82
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,800
Did you somewhat expect it?

83
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:54,370
(Thinking)

84
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:55,441
Yes.

85
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:57,071
I thought it could happen.

86
00:03:57,741 --> 00:03:59,171
We couldn't wrap up...

87
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:00,880
- our conversation. - In a rush?

88
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:02,911
Yes, our chat was in a rush.

89
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,850
- Just... - Here?

90
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:07,680
- Yes, here isn't bad. - Oh, my gosh.

91
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,120
I didn't know the two had such a moment.

92
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:14,261
It's just that we never had a 1-on-1 conversation.

93
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:18,231
You're the most unpredictable person to me.

94
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:19,891
- Is that so? Why? - Yes.

95
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:24,071
Why? You're simply hard to read.

96
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:26,031
So I've been curious.

97
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:29,301
Honestly...

98
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,611
I don't know where to start or how to put it.

99
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,741
At first, I was...

100
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:38,281
curious about you.

101
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:40,727
- And very much at that. - He said "very much."

102
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:42,111
- He was interested in her. - Yes.

103
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:43,380
- Actually... - Here's the thing.

104
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:44,490
(Sang Won was bummed out about yesterday's short talk.)

105
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:46,751
- Personally, at first, - Yes?

106
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:49,690
The day you joined was when I had...

107
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:52,090
- the biggest mental breakdown. - I see.

108
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,630
- Nobody chose him, right? - So...

109
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,400
I had just made up my mind...

110
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:57,031
to start anew from the very beginning.

111
00:04:58,101 --> 00:04:59,700
And someone with my physical ideal type joined,

112
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:01,301
which made me think I had a chance.

113
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:04,371
I'm still upset about it. That day,

114
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:05,770
I couldn't do much.

115
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:08,480
Even I realized I couldn't express my interest,

116
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:09,781
nor did I know how to do it.

117
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,380
Didn't he go grocery shopping alone?

118
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:13,581
Yes.

119
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,550
- Hello. - Look at his surprised eyes.

120
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:17,721
Did you just come?

121
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:19,851
Yes, I'm a new participant.

122
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:21,061
Hi.

123
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:23,930
- Hi. - He fell for her...

124
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:25,260
right then and there.

125
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:26,930
Like Korean, Chinese, and Western cuisine.

126
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:29,031
(Naturally, they had a chance to talk alone.)

127
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:32,801
(Impatient, Sang Won bombarded So Hyun with questions...)

128
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:34,300
(and couldn't charm her at all.)

129
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,970
That was him showing interest in her.

130
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:37,140
- Yes. - Exactly.

131
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:38,671
Anyone could tell...

132
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:42,740
you were a celebrity, and it was a first for me.

133
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:44,080
(Understanding)

134
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:45,751
I had my doubts.

135
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:48,450
"Could she be serious about..."

136
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:49,651
"such a show?"

137
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:52,520
Sang Won is saying the same exact thing.

138
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:54,990
Right? Everyone had the same thought.

139
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:56,061
Exactly.

140
00:05:56,461 --> 00:05:59,531
(Could she be serious about such a show?)

141
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:01,930
"I may be serious about it,"

142
00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:04,130
"but would she see me as a man?"

143
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,471
Such a worry filled me,

144
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:09,441
- I see. - and approaching you was...

145
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:11,741
In a way, I was being timid.

146
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,101
But those questions floated in my head.

147
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:19,080
Because of those cowardly thoughts,

148
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:21,081
I believe I missed my chance.

149
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:23,421
In another way,

150
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:26,751
I was being selfish.

151
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,360
It may have been me not wanting to get hurt.

152
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:30,661
That's the conclusion I came to.

153
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:35,000
Say I expressed my feelings to someone.

154
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:37,530
If she rejected it flatly,

155
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:38,931
I wasn't sure if I could handle it.

156
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:41,300
That crossed my mind as well.

157
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,400
I didn't know back then, but did after a while.

158
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:45,670
(Sang Won opens his heart to So Hyun.)

159
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,271
- So as not to leave any regrets, - Yes?

160
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,340
I should try,

161
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:51,180
and if it doesn't work out, I should give up.

162
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:52,880
- Right. - When it comes to my emotions.

163
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:54,361
- After all, this isn't work. - True.

164
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:58,121
With that, I came to this decision.

165
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,191
Let's go all out right now.

166
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:03,161
I should give it a shot.

167
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:04,260
(Surprised)

168
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:05,591
Oh, my goodness.

169
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,831
To think Director Park would...

170
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,111
He has changed drastically.

171
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,161
With that, I came to this decision.

172
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:14,840
(Let's go all out right now.)

173
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:16,970
I should give it a shot if I don't want to regret anything.

174
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:19,110
Even if it's for a day or two.

175
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:21,411
Nothing has been set in stone yet.

176
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:22,710
Even if you've made up your mind,

177
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:24,681
I could change it.

178
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,121
I'm going to set out passionately...

179
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:31,451
doing what I want and go where my heart leads me.

180
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:36,190
I'm learning about myself after joining Yeon House.

181
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,031
Is this the guys' growth place or what?

182
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:42,130
(Sighing)

183
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:43,731
I'm getting to know myself here.

184
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,400
- Getting to know yourself. - But isn't that what dating is?

185
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:49,370
- Yes. - Yes, that's what dating is.

186
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:51,341
(Will he be able to show a changed self?)

187
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:55,610
Sang Won was being honest...

188
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:58,951
and told me about his regrets for the first time.

189
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:03,350
I was grateful for how he mustered up the courage to do so.

190
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:04,621
I'm sure she appreciated it.

191
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,821
How nice it would have been if they had a little more time.

192
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:11,060
- Right? - This is bad.

193
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:13,730
Today, he frankly confessed that...

194
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:16,661
he was determined to go all out at the last minute.

195
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:21,041
Do you think he'll go after So Hyun until the very end?

196
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:23,121
- What do you think? - After So Hyun?

197
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:26,141
After saying that, he'll go on a Night Date with Ji Won.

198
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:31,351
(Director Park is unpredictable.)

199
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:33,950
(Ye Eun is alone at Yeon House.)

200
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:35,051
- Ye Eun. - Oh, no.

201
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:40,820
The date is before the final decision tomorrow.

202
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,660
But not being selected...

203
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:44,860
How upsetting.

204
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:47,701
It upset me...

205
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,801
and took a heavy emotional toll.

206
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,031
Oh, dear.

207
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,040
(Ye Eun has come out to the terrace.)

208
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,211
Is it to get some fresh air?

209
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:02,911
Yes.

210
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:09,921
(Sighing)

211
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:18,130
(As her mind is a mess, )

212
00:09:18,131 --> 00:09:20,800
(she tries to dance it out.)

213
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:23,461
(she tries to dance it out.)

214
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:37,911
(Sniffling)

215
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:44,990
(But she turns off the music shortly after.)

216
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:47,760
Ye Eun tried to forget about it with ballet,

217
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,360
- It didn't work. - but she couldn't calm herself.

218
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:51,931
- She can't focus. I feel bad. - Tears keep falling down.

219
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,500
(Ye Eun can't stop herself from choking up.)

220
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,270
- Of course it's upsetting. - Oh, no.

221
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,371
(Ye Eun can't stop herself from choking up.)

222
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,511
Do you know what happens in that situation?

223
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:13,710
He chose someone else,

224
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:16,150
so it doesn't exactly mean he rejected her.

225
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:17,951
Well, it is a rejection in a way.

226
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:21,420
It makes you keep thinking,

227
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:25,230
"Did I do something wrong?"

228
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:26,891
and "Why wasn't I chosen?"

229
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:28,930
Right. Like, "What do I lack?"

230
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:30,011
And it makes you regret it.

231
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,471
(The Day Dates end.)

232
00:10:34,671 --> 00:10:35,841
The Night Dates.

233
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,171
Who will be the first one to go on a Night Date.

234
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:43,241
(Sang Won was on the Day Date with So Hyun.)

235
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:44,311
It's Sang Won.

236
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,950
(Who did he choose to go on the Night Date with?)

237
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:47,711
Who will go on the Night Date with Sang Won?

238
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:49,651
I wonder who.

239
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:52,751
We don't have much time left,

240
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:55,160
so I chose the one that I was most attracted to...

241
00:10:55,161 --> 00:10:57,091
and that I had good chemistry with.

242
00:10:59,061 --> 00:11:02,060
I decided to be selfish about my feelings.

243
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,230
(He focused on his feelings.)

244
00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:05,100
Maybe it's someone totally unexpected.

245
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:06,101
No way.

246
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:07,600
(His Night Date partner approaches him.)

247
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:08,841
That looks like Ji Won.

248
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:10,911
It was Ji Won.

249
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,010
- I waited forever. - Did you?

250
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:16,811
- Take a seat. - Thank you.

251
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:18,451
How long did you wait?

252
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:19,680
I was joking. I didn't wait that long.

253
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:20,711
Are you sure?

254
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:22,580
You're dressed...

255
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,251
- How do I look? - very maturely.

256
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:27,150
- Do I look mature? - Really?

257
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:28,790
- It means he likes it. - It's a date, after all.

258
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,220
He likes the way she's dressed.

259
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:32,291
He seems a little tense, doesn't he?

260
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:35,000
He was overwhelmed...

261
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,601
- by how she entered. - Yes.

262
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:38,601
Wait. Our food is here.

263
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,271
Do you eat beef tartare?

264
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,640
- I love it. - Thank you.

265
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:44,841
You made a great choice. Thank you for the food.

266
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:47,341
What should we try first?

267
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:50,011
Do you want me to put the egg yolk on top?

268
00:11:50,381 --> 00:11:52,180
- Should we pop it together? - Yes.

269
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:54,080
May I put it on top?

270
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,120
Of course.

271
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:56,220
They seem very comfortable.

272
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:57,620
- Cheers. - Let's eat. Cheers.

273
00:11:57,621 --> 00:11:59,451
They're being playful too.

274
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,821
(Satisfied)

275
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:04,560
(Moaning)

276
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:06,431
I hope it goes well.

277
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:10,730
I had one last question for you.

278
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:11,731
Okay.

279
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,012
(Sang Won's question for Ji Won)

280
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:16,341
I want to know how you felt after learning about our ages.

281
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:17,770
I was younger than most.

282
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,310
I was younger...

283
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:20,741
- than people expected. - Right.

284
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,511
I don't mind, actually.

285
00:12:27,051 --> 00:12:28,151
But it's like this.

286
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:33,021
At the youthful age of 27...

287
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:39,591
You could shine even brighter by dating someone your age,

288
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:43,701
but my youthful days are over.

289
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes. And there are emotions...

290
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:51,541
that you can feel when you're that age.

291
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:57,080
I'm worried you might not feel that way about me.

292
00:12:57,081 --> 00:12:58,841
(What if he doesn't feel that way about me?)

293
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,851
You don't have to worry about that.

294
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,161
If I had wanted that,

295
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:13,331
and if I had thought I should date someone my age,

296
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:18,431
I wouldn't have come to Yeon House.

297
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:20,471
So, that's not an issue.

298
00:13:23,371 --> 00:13:25,141
After the age reveal,

299
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,010
Ji Won seems more worried...

300
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:29,340
about the other person...

301
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,487
- feeling burdened. - Indeed.

302
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:33,950
Perhaps she asked Sang Won first...

303
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:37,050
because she was worried. She probably asked...

304
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,491
to get confirmation.

305
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:40,390
- Don't you think? - Like, "Please say you don't."

306
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:41,891
Right. Maybe that's what she thinks.

307
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:44,161
When I was dating a younger guy,

308
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,230
I said something like that as well.

309
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:47,960
But the reason was...

310
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,330
simply that I thought...

311
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:51,471
he should be having fun with people his age.

312
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,970
That was what I meant.

313
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:56,801
Why won't he be able to have fun while dating you, though?

314
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:58,170
Because the environment changes.

315
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,310
I used to go out and have fun,

316
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:03,611
but I prefer quiet places now.

317
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:05,250
Things change like that.

318
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:07,751
Oh, you mean how the dates go.

319
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:10,220
- Because he won't be able... - Right.

320
00:14:10,221 --> 00:14:11,990
To go on active and dynamic dates.

321
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:13,850
Oh, you're right. You have a point.

322
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:15,590
- I'm like, "Are you sure?" - We've all done it,

323
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:16,871
- so it makes us tired. - Right.

324
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:18,407
We don't want to go to crowded places.

325
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:19,431
Why are you laughing?

326
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:21,131
And to be honest...

327
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,500
Also...

328
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:25,181
(Ji Won wants to know how Sang Won feels.)

329
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:28,400
When a man and a woman have feelings for each other,

330
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,240
you can tell...

331
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:33,441
from how they look at each other and their behaviors.

332
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:37,041
But I wasn't sure...

333
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:44,350
if I ever felt...

334
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:47,321
that you were completely into me.

335
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:49,261
She's right.

336
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:51,930
She's asking him to tell her...

337
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:53,930
his honest feelings.

338
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:55,601
- Something like that. - I see.

339
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:59,731
- I was kind of confused. - What?

340
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:02,601
- I was. - I get it, though.

341
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,440
- Because nothing has been set yet. - Right.

342
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:07,541
- Yes. So... - We can't be sure about anything.

343
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,151
I'm the type of person who needs certainty,

344
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:13,251
so I felt anxious...

345
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,880
and had my doubts.

346
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:20,620
She wants to know why he wasn't so proactive.

347
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:24,430
I had one plan before coming here.

348
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:26,590
If I felt that you were into me...

349
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:29,931
from the way you looked at me,

350
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:31,171
I was going to go for it.

351
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:33,131
If not,

352
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:36,740
the chances of us being in a romantic relationship...

353
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:39,041
Well, you said you wanted to keep an open mind.

354
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:41,311
But I thought the chances were low.

355
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:44,851
That's what I thought.

356
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:48,480
So, I was going to make up my mind tonight.

357
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:51,490
It was a crucial judgment.

358
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:53,151
That's why I was so nervous...

359
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,421
the whole time I waited.

360
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,731
That's why you need to express yourself.

361
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,301
I actually...

362
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:04,471
thought lightly of coming here.

363
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,051
"I just have to listen to my heart. What's so hard about that?"

364
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:11,041
But it turned out to be really difficult.

365
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:16,210
I was also disappointed in myself for how indecisive I was.

366
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:17,771
(He's been indecisive the entire time.)

367
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:20,411
It's so tricky and confusing.

368
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:24,151
But I can't stand it when things are confusing.

369
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:26,651
I'm not sure how he feels.

370
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,491
It's so frustrating.

371
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:32,831
That's her honest thought.

372
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:34,861
I hope he knows this.

373
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,030
Right.

374
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:37,637
(Can Ji Won feel certain about Sang Won?)

375
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:40,670
Who's the second person to go on the Night Date?

376
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:41,671
(The second Night Date)

377
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,241
(Mu Jin went on a Day Date with So Hyun.)

378
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,141
(Would things have been different had I joined on the first day?)

379
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:53,251
(Maybe.)

380
00:16:56,221 --> 00:16:57,250
It's Mu Jin!

381
00:16:57,251 --> 00:17:00,351
(Who did Mu Jin want to go on the Night Date with?)

382
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,860
(Mu Jin still chose Bon Hee.)

383
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,231
As expected.

384
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:11,700
(Grinning)

385
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:13,531
- He's so in love with her. - Goodness.

386
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:15,241
Hey.

387
00:17:16,841 --> 00:17:21,241
(Mu Jin chose to go on the Night Date with Bon Hee.)

388
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,411
It feels like it's been a while.

389
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:26,951
Where were you?

390
00:17:28,651 --> 00:17:31,051
I had coffee this afternoon.

391
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:34,051
And then,

392
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:35,991
I came here.

393
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:42,201
What did you do?

394
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:44,471
- I also had coffee. - Coffee?

395
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:46,801
And I came here.

396
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:52,610
Did you have a good talk during the Day Date?

397
00:17:52,611 --> 00:17:53,811
Yes.

398
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,481
Who did you go with?

399
00:17:56,411 --> 00:17:57,441
Sang Hyeon.

400
00:17:58,611 --> 00:17:59,811
- Sang Hyeon. - Yes.

401
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:02,950
We had never met outside before,

402
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:05,021
and we had only talked inside the Yeon House.

403
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:07,191
So, he wanted to go out with me.

404
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,661
He was very serious,

405
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:14,330
but it was good that I talked to him today.

406
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:15,331
Yes.

407
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:21,511
Who did you go on the Day Date with?

408
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:22,770
So Hyun.

409
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:24,971
I see. I thought so.

410
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,341
- Did you have a feeling? - Yes.

411
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:29,641
- You could feel it? - Yes.

412
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,251
I see.

413
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:34,981
It's good to talk to others. That's why we're all here.

414
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:37,681
I had a good talk.

415
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,791
So did I.

416
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:44,906
It's a little awkward.

417
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:46,691
(Staring)

418
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:51,030
I think it gets awkward again...

419
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:53,001
when we leave the Yeon House.

420
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:55,171
It's a little awkward.

421
00:18:55,196 --> 00:18:57,191
(Staring)

422
00:18:58,815 --> 00:19:01,614
I think it gets awkward again...

423
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:03,515
when we leave the Yeon House.

424
00:19:05,155 --> 00:19:06,655
It's a totally different vibe.

425
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:09,695
Yes. And we're dressed differently there.

426
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,765
(You're right.)

427
00:19:13,225 --> 00:19:14,465
Seeing you here...

428
00:19:15,265 --> 00:19:16,594
feels different.

429
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:17,605
Right.

430
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:22,635
You look pretty.

431
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:25,574
He said the same thing on their first date.

432
00:19:25,575 --> 00:19:26,745
(Shy)

433
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:32,785
Tomorrow is our last day.

434
00:19:33,245 --> 00:19:36,915
Right. It's so fascinating how time goes so fast.

435
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:40,855
I have some regrets.

436
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:44,165
It was fun.

437
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:47,764
We can talk more tonight.

438
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:48,895
Yes.

439
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:50,805
Maybe it's because it's their last night,

440
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:53,104
but don't they seem more cautious?

441
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:55,035
(They seem more cautious than usual.)

442
00:19:56,105 --> 00:19:57,975
When we revealed our ages yesterday,

443
00:20:00,245 --> 00:20:01,445
were you nervous?

444
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:05,884
I think I was anxious.

445
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:07,515
- What? - I was anxious.

446
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:09,285
I see.

447
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:11,884
(I'm 27.)

448
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:13,794
(Gasping)

449
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,054
(My name is Kim Mu Jin.)

450
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:17,225
- She was genuinely startled. - She was.

451
00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:19,864
(Mu Jin's age startled her.)

452
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:21,565
He was younger than I thought.

453
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:24,304
I had a feeling...

454
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:26,464
that one of them could be up to 12 years younger than me,

455
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:28,275
but I never knew that would be Mu Jin.

456
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:32,845
Thinking about being in a relationship,

457
00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:36,215
I'm not so sure because I've never been in one.

458
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:37,415
Right.

459
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:40,455
Were you not shocked after hearing my age?

460
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:44,825
It's impossible not to think things through...

461
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:49,195
when our age gap goes over ten years.

462
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:51,394
- Poor them. - I'm just worried.

463
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:52,995
Maybe they won't be matched.

464
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:55,594
Her brother is 11 years younger,

465
00:20:55,595 --> 00:20:57,235
and Mu Jin is 12 years younger.

466
00:20:57,305 --> 00:20:59,834
She'd be dating a guy who's younger than her little brother.

467
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:01,075
Also, do you know that?

468
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:03,535
When the age difference is exactly 11 years,

469
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:07,245
it's less mental pressure.

470
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:09,045
But when you're 12 years older...

471
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,244
and he has the same zodiac sign, it's a lot of pressure.

472
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:14,485
It would have been better if he were younger.

473
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:16,054
- Right! - Younger than 12 years?

474
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:17,555
Yes, like 13 or 14 years younger.

475
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:20,284
At that point, it's just meaningless to worry.

476
00:21:20,285 --> 00:21:22,524
- Right. - You wouldn't even care...

477
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:24,541
- at that point... - They have the same zodiac sign.

478
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:26,595
And just go for him.

479
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:28,794
But it's different when you share the same zodiac sign.

480
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:31,065
(I see.)

481
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:35,135
Are you worried about anything?

482
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:37,575
- Worried? - Yes.

483
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:42,214
(Thinking)

484
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:44,544
I'd be lying to say that I'm not.

485
00:21:44,545 --> 00:21:46,944
Right. That's an honest answer.

486
00:21:46,945 --> 00:21:49,284
And Mu Jin is younger than most guys there.

487
00:21:49,285 --> 00:21:50,555
I thought...

488
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:54,055
that there would be a big age difference,

489
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,124
but actually hearing it...

490
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,494
(Even he didn't know they would be 12 years apart.)

491
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:00,195
It's because she looks so young.

492
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:02,435
Oh, man.

493
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:06,565
While I was here,

494
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:09,735
there weren't any terms when we talked to each other...

495
00:22:11,045 --> 00:22:12,745
and grew feelings.

496
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:15,844
But would I be able to date you...

497
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:18,514
outside of this program...

498
00:22:18,515 --> 00:22:21,955
regardless of what people think?

499
00:22:23,185 --> 00:22:25,284
I was slightly worried about that.

500
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:26,954
(He was worried about what people would think...)

501
00:22:26,955 --> 00:22:28,625
(about the 12-year age difference.)

502
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:31,224
But I was still curious about you.

503
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,795
(He's still curious about Bon Hee.)

504
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:35,365
Bon Hee is keeping a straight face, though.

505
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:36,634
- She is. - Yes.

506
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:40,205
Judging from the emotions I felt,

507
00:22:41,605 --> 00:22:44,144
I thought we could make it work.

508
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:45,905
What I was more worried about was...

509
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:49,415
you than myself.

510
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:53,115
You could be more worried...

511
00:22:54,585 --> 00:22:56,315
than I would be.

512
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:58,954
That's what concerned me.

513
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:00,675
(He was worried she might change her mind.)

514
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:03,225
Things might be harder when this ends,

515
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,995
even with the feelings we've shared.

516
00:23:09,465 --> 00:23:11,665
Do I look like I'm worried?

517
00:23:12,505 --> 00:23:15,075
(Thinking)

518
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:19,905
I have a good eye for people.

519
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:21,575
What do you think?

520
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:25,014
I'm not so sure today.

521
00:23:25,015 --> 00:23:27,915
(I'm not so sure today.)

522
00:23:29,715 --> 00:23:31,354
Just like I said,

523
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:33,685
it's true that I'm worried.

524
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:35,525
I'm naturally concerned.

525
00:23:35,925 --> 00:23:38,095
And I'm cautious about this.

526
00:23:38,695 --> 00:23:40,294
It's a completely different stage...

527
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:42,595
when this program ends.

528
00:23:42,995 --> 00:23:44,564
We're more immersed...

529
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:47,434
in our feelings because we're in Yeon House.

530
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:48,475
Yes.

531
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:51,575
I think it's a different issue once the show is over.

532
00:23:57,715 --> 00:24:00,084
Anyway, tomorrow, we'll make...

533
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:01,454
(They don't have much time left in Yeon House.)

534
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:02,955
something like the final decision.

535
00:24:04,785 --> 00:24:06,424
Whatever decision you make,

536
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:09,754
(Whatever decision Bon Hee makes...)

537
00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:13,095
(Whatever decision Bon Hee makes...)

538
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:14,965
I'll accept it...

539
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:17,905
and respect you for it.

540
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:22,335
It's tough.

541
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:24,005
Thanks.

542
00:24:25,905 --> 00:24:28,944
(Can they overcome their age difference?)

543
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:30,414
I'm not sure what he means.

544
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:32,784
What he said in the end...

545
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:34,414
makes you think.

546
00:24:34,415 --> 00:24:37,355
They talked honestly...

547
00:24:37,955 --> 00:24:40,725
about the things they must overcome...

548
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:43,395
in the future.

549
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:46,324
But he didn't say,

550
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:49,595
"But you were the only one for me from beginning to end."

551
00:24:49,965 --> 00:24:52,934
He said, "I'll respect whatever decision you make."

552
00:24:52,935 --> 00:24:55,275
- That sounds very neutral. - Indeed.

553
00:24:55,475 --> 00:24:56,974
And she had...

554
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:59,174
a subtle look when he said that.

555
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:01,114
She didn't seem so happy.

556
00:25:01,115 --> 00:25:03,515
It looked like she wanted to hide her feelings.

557
00:25:04,685 --> 00:25:07,555
She must have wanted him to hold on to her.

558
00:25:08,515 --> 00:25:11,825
She's like, "He's always been so straightforward with me,"

559
00:25:12,285 --> 00:25:14,005
"and now he's saying this on the last day?"

560
00:25:16,455 --> 00:25:18,394
(The third Night Date...)

561
00:25:18,395 --> 00:25:21,465
(chosen by the younger guy)

562
00:25:22,135 --> 00:25:24,534
(Hyeon Jun was on a Day Date with Ji Won.)

563
00:25:24,535 --> 00:25:25,765
It's Hyeon Jun.

564
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:29,974
- It must be Yeong Gyeong, right? - Yeong Gyeong.

565
00:25:29,975 --> 00:25:31,304
- I think so. - Right.

566
00:25:31,305 --> 00:25:33,621
(He's waiting for the older woman to go on a Night Date with.)

567
00:25:33,645 --> 00:25:36,775
I don't think we know each other well enough.

568
00:25:37,215 --> 00:25:38,985
I wanted to eat delicious food with her...

569
00:25:39,385 --> 00:25:42,054
and have a serious conversation.

570
00:25:42,055 --> 00:25:44,095
(He wants to have a serious conversation with her.)

571
00:25:44,855 --> 00:25:47,854
(Who's the woman he wants to have a serious chat with...)

572
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:49,724
(during the Night Date?)

573
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:50,864
It was Yeong Gyeong.

574
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:52,525
(Yeong Gyeong)

575
00:25:53,025 --> 00:25:54,234
(A bright smile)

576
00:25:54,235 --> 00:25:55,834
- He's smiling so big already. - Look at his face.

577
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:57,405
- Look at that. - Oh, my gosh.

578
00:25:57,665 --> 00:25:59,004
Good luck, Hyeon Jun.

579
00:25:59,005 --> 00:26:01,035
(Shy)

580
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:03,605
Hi.

581
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:05,774
- Hi. - You came in so suddenly.

582
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:08,975
(Hyeon Jun didn't change his mind and chose Yeong Gyeong.)

583
00:26:13,285 --> 00:26:16,055
(Feeling a bit awkward)

584
00:26:16,885 --> 00:26:18,125
What did you do this afternoon?

585
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:20,031
- What? - What did you do this afternoon?

586
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:21,595
He's cracking down on her.

587
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:24,071
- This afternoon? - "Who did you go on a date with?"

588
00:26:24,095 --> 00:26:25,965
- It's a secret. - I see.

589
00:26:28,135 --> 00:26:29,135
Okay.

590
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:32,265
(Stopping)

591
00:26:32,835 --> 00:26:33,934
What?

592
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:38,074
I feel like it's been ages since we ate like this.

593
00:26:38,075 --> 00:26:40,515
I think it's our first time ever coming to a place like this.

594
00:26:42,745 --> 00:26:44,145
So, how do you feel?

595
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:46,914
I could have gone...

596
00:26:46,915 --> 00:26:49,184
on two dates today, right?

597
00:26:49,185 --> 00:26:50,215
But...

598
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:53,155
I chose you for the Night Date on purpose.

599
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:57,024
I believed I could spend more time with you that way.

600
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:58,894
(I believed I could spend more time with you that way.)

601
00:26:58,895 --> 00:27:02,665
This is a very important dinner for me.

602
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:04,464
He's honest.

603
00:27:04,465 --> 00:27:05,605
- Is it now? - Yes.

604
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:08,204
So, I hope you take this seriously.

605
00:27:08,205 --> 00:27:10,635
- I must take it seriously. - I'm joking.

606
00:27:10,905 --> 00:27:12,644
(He jokingly tells her how he really feels.)

607
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:13,775
I'm joking.

608
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:17,615
Our ages were revealed last night.

609
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:19,144
But...

610
00:27:19,145 --> 00:27:23,055
I don't think I actually heard about your thoughts.

611
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:25,055
So, I was curious about that.

612
00:27:26,155 --> 00:27:28,355
I was wondering what was on your mind.

613
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,055
I want to know...

614
00:27:30,825 --> 00:27:34,265
what you want to do from here on out.

615
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,934
(He asked her about marriage...)

616
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:38,264
(after the age reveal last night.)

617
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:39,865
It seemed unclear at that moment, right?

618
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:41,274
It did.

619
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:44,845
(I think marriage is about stability.)

620
00:27:45,175 --> 00:27:48,645
(He prioritized stability in marriage.)

621
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,685
(What I can tell you for sure is...)

622
00:27:51,985 --> 00:27:55,454
(that I never want to be in a marriage...)

623
00:27:55,455 --> 00:27:56,784
(that only looks good on the outside.)

624
00:27:56,785 --> 00:27:59,854
(I'd rather live alone than do that...)

625
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:03,955
(because I'm already living a happy life by myself.)

626
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:05,924
(They had different goals...)

627
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:07,164
(regarding marriage.)

628
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:09,364
Numerous single women...

629
00:28:09,365 --> 00:28:11,434
think that.

630
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:12,565
I want to know...

631
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:16,675
what you want to do from here on out.

632
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:19,144
He's bringing it up again.

633
00:28:19,145 --> 00:28:21,074
- What I want to do? - Yes.

634
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,075
(Flustered)

635
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,145
You asked me so suddenly...

636
00:28:25,015 --> 00:28:27,555
and put me on the spot.

637
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:31,784
- Here are your drinks. - Thank you.

638
00:28:31,785 --> 00:28:33,055
- And this is... - It's hers.

639
00:28:35,095 --> 00:28:36,095
Thanks.

640
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:38,865
- Enjoy. - Sure.

641
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:42,295
What else do you want to know other than that?

642
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:44,235
I'll ask you later.

643
00:28:44,405 --> 00:28:45,765
After I hear your answer.

644
00:28:46,665 --> 00:28:48,674
She tried to move on,

645
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:50,275
- but he wouldn't let her. - Right.

646
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:53,944
(Thinking)

647
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:57,015
If I had good feelings about it,

648
00:28:58,385 --> 00:29:02,055
I would express it in some way.

649
00:29:03,255 --> 00:29:06,425
(Her answer is a bit ambiguous.)

650
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:09,424
That must come first for Hyeon Jun.

651
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:10,924
- It must be his top priority. - He's in a rush.

652
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:13,894
I guess building a family is an essential factor...

653
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:15,694
- I think so. - for his ideal life.

654
00:29:15,695 --> 00:29:18,435
- It must matter the most. - Right. But...

655
00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:22,905
I told you once that I was interested in you.

656
00:29:23,835 --> 00:29:27,545
I think you know that clearly now.

657
00:29:28,315 --> 00:29:30,815
I'm wondering how you express your feelings...

658
00:29:31,385 --> 00:29:34,015
when you're interested in someone.

659
00:29:34,785 --> 00:29:36,885
The thing is... Well...

660
00:29:37,925 --> 00:29:39,525
(Thinking)

661
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:42,225
To tell you the truth... Well...

662
00:29:45,225 --> 00:29:48,395
The answer to your question...

663
00:29:50,295 --> 00:29:53,705
will be revealed tomorrow.

664
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:58,044
It will be revealed tomorrow.

665
00:29:58,045 --> 00:29:59,504
(Realizing)

666
00:29:59,505 --> 00:30:01,074
- That's what I think. - I'm curious.

667
00:30:01,075 --> 00:30:02,745
But that reaction is quite...

668
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:06,784
Her answer could mean something significant.

669
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:07,854
I have no idea what it means.

670
00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:10,115
(What does Yeong Gyeong's answer mean?)

671
00:30:11,525 --> 00:30:14,455
You said you lived in Gyeongsang Province.

672
00:30:15,725 --> 00:30:16,885
Where in Gyeongsang Province?

673
00:30:17,225 --> 00:30:18,824
- May I ask? - I live in Gyeongju.

674
00:30:18,825 --> 00:30:20,265
- Gyeongju? - Yes.

675
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,094
- That's far. - Indeed.

676
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:27,674
I also want to know what you think about a long-distance relationship.

677
00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:29,195
- A long-distance relationship? - Yes.

678
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:32,704
Actually, I've never been in a long-distance relationship.

679
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,275
(Yeong Gyeong has never been in a long-distance relationship.)

680
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:37,985
Do you have any experience?

681
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,325
No, I have no experience either.

682
00:30:40,745 --> 00:30:41,945
I've never been in one either.

683
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:44,254
But I often come...

684
00:30:44,255 --> 00:30:46,385
to Seoul or Bundang.

685
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:49,394
I'm used to going to those areas.

686
00:30:49,395 --> 00:30:51,495
So it's not hard for me to come.

687
00:30:52,295 --> 00:30:54,465
I can always come to Seoul when I need to.

688
00:30:54,865 --> 00:30:56,895
So it won't be a problem to me.

689
00:30:58,035 --> 00:31:00,434
(The reality feels more real on the last date.)

690
00:31:00,435 --> 00:31:02,734
I haven't seen those looks...

691
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:06,204
on Yeong Gyeong's face before.

692
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:09,745
She looks like she's finally facing the reality.

693
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:13,645
This isn't easy.

694
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:15,384
Seul Hye,

695
00:31:15,385 --> 00:31:18,885
if you were Yeong Gyeong, how would you feel?

696
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:22,154
A seven-year age gap wouldn't be an issue to me.

697
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:24,031
- So the age gap is not an issue. - I wouldn't mind the age gap.

698
00:31:24,055 --> 00:31:25,824
- A long-distance relationship... - Four hours.

699
00:31:25,825 --> 00:31:27,294
If I were in a four-hour long-distance relationship...

700
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:28,494
"I can go that far."

701
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:30,375
Some people don't go after saying such a thing.

702
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:32,634
It would work if he's a man who keeps his promises.

703
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:35,174
While getting to know him,

704
00:31:35,175 --> 00:31:38,604
I would see what type of person he is over time,

705
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,904
and then I'd decide...

706
00:31:39,905 --> 00:31:41,174
whether to date him.

707
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:42,175
That's wise.

708
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:43,274
What's gotten into me?

709
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:45,114
(Why am I doing so well today?)

710
00:31:45,115 --> 00:31:47,144
The comment you made earlier was also very good.

711
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:49,654
You sound like a dating expert.

712
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:52,231
(Instructor Hwangwoo Seul Hye, a long-distance relationship expert)

713
00:31:52,255 --> 00:31:57,095
(The fourth Night Date chosen by a younger man)

714
00:31:57,655 --> 00:32:01,834
(Ji Yung had his Day Date with Yeong Gyeong.)

715
00:32:01,835 --> 00:32:03,471
Even many of those who lived in Australia don't know.

716
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:05,105
Is it Ji Yung's Night Date?

717
00:32:05,535 --> 00:32:07,264
- Who could it be? So Hyun? - So Hyun.

718
00:32:07,265 --> 00:32:09,275
- It must be So Hyun. - It could be Bon Hee.

719
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:11,144
- No, it must be So Hyun. - So Hyun?

720
00:32:11,145 --> 00:32:12,175
Yes, So Hyun.

721
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:14,004
He seems nervous.

722
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:15,685
(He arrived early and is waiting for her.)

723
00:32:19,945 --> 00:32:20,984
Hello.

724
00:32:20,985 --> 00:32:23,415
(Ji Yung smiles while looking nervous.)

725
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:26,324
(The one Ji Yung chose for his Night Date is...)

726
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:28,205
It's raining outside. Didn't you get rained on?

727
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:29,555
No, I didn't.

728
00:32:30,455 --> 00:32:32,964
- Did you wait long? - No, just a bit.

729
00:32:32,965 --> 00:32:33,965
Just a bit?

730
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:40,065
Thank you for choosing me...

731
00:32:41,005 --> 00:32:42,675
for your last date.

732
00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:47,175
I always go only in the same direction.

733
00:32:47,915 --> 00:32:51,144
(Ji Yung has been proved to be straightforward.)

734
00:32:51,145 --> 00:32:52,245
How many dates...

735
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:55,115
did you go on earlier today?

736
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:56,814
I was so curious about it.

737
00:32:56,815 --> 00:32:58,554
- Today? - I think you were chosen by many.

738
00:32:58,555 --> 00:32:59,555
Really?

739
00:33:01,455 --> 00:33:02,625
He must be curious about it.

740
00:33:02,825 --> 00:33:04,665
I went on many dates today.

741
00:33:05,895 --> 00:33:07,455
I met several guys I needed to talk to.

742
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:10,034
He seems sad and disappointed.

743
00:33:10,035 --> 00:33:14,735
Were there any other girls...

744
00:33:16,835 --> 00:33:19,505
that you went on a date with or talked to?

745
00:33:21,145 --> 00:33:22,945
On the day after I moved in,

746
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:25,915
you joined the show.

747
00:33:27,515 --> 00:33:29,615
We had the 5-on-1 date next day.

748
00:33:29,915 --> 00:33:32,285
That day, you left a deep impression on me.

749
00:33:32,755 --> 00:33:34,955
Since then, I've been committed to you.

750
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:36,695
I tried hard to get a date ticket.

751
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:38,524
I barely managed to get one.

752
00:33:38,525 --> 00:33:41,001
(He tried to win only So Hyun's heart since he first met her.)

753
00:33:41,025 --> 00:33:44,564
I started to express my feelings even before I knew.

754
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:46,404
(Ji Yung showed his interest consistently inside Yeon House too.)

755
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:49,375
It might've made you uncomfortable.

756
00:33:49,805 --> 00:33:52,175
But you always treated me nicely.

757
00:33:52,345 --> 00:33:53,844
- Well... - Thank you for that.

758
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:56,175
You don't have to thank me. I mean... How should I put it?

759
00:33:56,675 --> 00:33:58,085
I was worried...

760
00:33:58,545 --> 00:33:59,945
if I didn't tell you clearly...

761
00:34:00,745 --> 00:34:03,385
about how I felt about you,

762
00:34:03,955 --> 00:34:07,455
which could give you false hope,

763
00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:09,405
considering we didn't have much time.

764
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:13,565
- That wasn't the case. - Is that so?

765
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:17,695
Rather, you told me honestly right away.

766
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:22,104
And that made me fall for you even more deeply.

767
00:34:22,105 --> 00:34:23,175
"I was right about her."

768
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:28,814
"That's the person who I thought So Hyun was."

769
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:30,291
(Ji Yung liked that she rejected him in her own way.)

770
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:31,545
I liked that about you.

771
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:34,165
- I rather liked that. - He likes her and no other girls.

772
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:40,425
You're very mature.

773
00:34:41,495 --> 00:34:43,554
You think in a mature way.

774
00:34:43,555 --> 00:34:46,124
After we had that conversation,

775
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,935
I felt so relieved.

776
00:34:50,295 --> 00:34:51,304
I left no regrets.

777
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:53,104
(Even so, I left no regrets.)

778
00:34:53,105 --> 00:34:55,334
I showed you who I was.

779
00:34:55,335 --> 00:34:56,505
Did she just reject him?

780
00:34:56,735 --> 00:34:57,975
He just feels that way.

781
00:34:59,005 --> 00:35:00,005
I think it's a good thing.

782
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:01,205
- Are you serious? - Yes.

783
00:35:02,075 --> 00:35:03,545
I was surprised how mature he was.

784
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:06,715
He must've been hurt and emotionally suffering,

785
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:10,955
but despite that, he seemed to try to be considerate of my feelings.

786
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:12,485
I was very grateful.

787
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:15,395
I felt apologetic toward him at the same time.

788
00:35:15,555 --> 00:35:16,894
But I was more grateful than apologetic.

789
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:18,975
(She felt apologetic and grateful at the same time.)

790
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:21,495
Who's left?

791
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:23,336
(The fifth Night Date chosen by a younger man)

792
00:35:24,465 --> 00:35:25,704
- Sang Hyeon. - Sang Hyeon.

793
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:27,425
(Sang Hyeon had his Day Date with Bon Hee.)

794
00:35:28,005 --> 00:35:31,134
(You have your strengths and weaknesses.)

795
00:35:31,135 --> 00:35:32,745
(I thought you were meticulous.)

796
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:38,185
(The ideal type I had in mind is...)

797
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:40,545
(Bon Hee.)

798
00:35:42,255 --> 00:35:44,285
This is Sang Hyeon's Night Date.

799
00:35:44,455 --> 00:35:45,815
- It should be So Hyun. - So Hyun.

800
00:35:46,555 --> 00:35:47,684
It might not be So Hyun.

801
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:53,095
(He's waiting for the older woman he chose.)

802
00:35:55,135 --> 00:35:56,195
What was it? Capri...

803
00:35:56,535 --> 00:35:57,794
"Capri?"

804
00:35:57,795 --> 00:35:59,935
- Caprile? - What?

805
00:36:00,965 --> 00:36:02,535
Capris? Ca...

806
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:04,035
Caprise.

807
00:36:06,605 --> 00:36:07,605
He's cute.

808
00:36:07,775 --> 00:36:10,415
- Oh, he doesn't know caprese salad. - Caprise.

809
00:36:15,985 --> 00:36:17,085
You're here.

810
00:36:17,215 --> 00:36:19,085
Hi.

811
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:23,224
- Did you wait long? - I just got here too.

812
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:24,324
Really?

813
00:36:24,325 --> 00:36:25,871
(Sang Hyeon chose So Hyun as expected.)

814
00:36:25,895 --> 00:36:27,364
- How many dates did she go on? - So Hyun...

815
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:29,664
- Exactly. - Right. She's been busy today.

816
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:30,994
She had four dates.

817
00:36:30,995 --> 00:36:32,865
So Hyun is very popular.

818
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:34,705
I'm jealous.

819
00:36:35,705 --> 00:36:38,005
The cardigan you're wearing looks nice.

820
00:36:38,105 --> 00:36:42,414
Oh, this? Thank you. You look nicer than me.

821
00:36:42,415 --> 00:36:43,545
I always look nice.

822
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:49,555
I think you waited long. Didn't you?

823
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:50,955
No, I didn't wait long.

824
00:36:51,755 --> 00:36:54,254
I was memorizing the name of the dish to tell you.

825
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,455
- Come again? - Capril...

826
00:36:56,025 --> 00:36:57,954
- Caprise. - Caprese.

827
00:36:57,955 --> 00:36:58,964
Cap...

828
00:36:58,965 --> 00:36:59,965
(Embarrassed)

829
00:36:59,966 --> 00:37:01,734
Oh, you know. I've never tried this before.

830
00:37:01,735 --> 00:37:03,464
- Capri... -Really? Caprese.

831
00:37:03,465 --> 00:37:05,065
- Caprese. - Caprese... And...

832
00:37:05,235 --> 00:37:07,404
I also ordered pork belly, and this is what I wanted to have.

833
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:08,934
It's mala rose tteokbokki. It was on the menu.

834
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,611
(Although he doesn't know the names of dishes...)

835
00:37:10,635 --> 00:37:13,145
Did you choose this restaurant?

836
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:14,404
Yes.

837
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:16,645
(He chose the dishes himself while thinking of So Hyun.)

838
00:37:16,675 --> 00:37:17,675
Mala?

839
00:37:18,315 --> 00:37:21,615
I can't really handle mala sauce.

840
00:37:22,385 --> 00:37:24,314
- You can't eat it? - It's not that I can't eat it.

841
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:25,684
- He's flustered. - I just don't...

842
00:37:25,685 --> 00:37:27,784
I don't understand what people like so much about it.

843
00:37:27,785 --> 00:37:28,955
- You don't? - No.

844
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:33,194
My favorite dishes are all made with mala sauce.

845
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:35,635
- Like malatang, mala xiang guo, - Really?

846
00:37:36,435 --> 00:37:38,705
And mala tteokbokki. I love them all.

847
00:37:38,835 --> 00:37:41,164
- It's a good choice in most cases. - Exactly.

848
00:37:41,165 --> 00:37:43,634
It's really unlikely that your date doesn't like it.

849
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:45,204
- That's right. - But she doesn't like it.

850
00:37:45,205 --> 00:37:47,905
- Try the other dishes. - I will. I'll try the other dishes.

851
00:37:48,315 --> 00:37:50,144
- Can you cut this in pieces? - I'll cut it for you.

852
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:51,684
Slice it for me.

853
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:52,785
Slice it nicely.

854
00:37:53,045 --> 00:37:54,584
See? She's acting cute.

855
00:37:54,585 --> 00:37:56,454
So Hyun is giving off a totally different vibe.

856
00:37:56,455 --> 00:37:58,824
She met Mu Jin earlier in the daytime.

857
00:37:58,825 --> 00:38:00,485
She met other guys too, though.

858
00:38:01,055 --> 00:38:04,194
"But Mu Jin has Bon Hee."

859
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:07,724
"He chose me for his Day Date, but I'm not his first choice."

860
00:38:07,725 --> 00:38:10,005
That's how she seemed to be feeling. But now, she's like,

861
00:38:10,095 --> 00:38:12,604
"I'm finally where I belong."

862
00:38:12,605 --> 00:38:14,925
(She seems comfortable as if she were where she belonged.)

863
00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:17,274
You've got something on your lip.

864
00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:18,545
- Really? - Yes.

865
00:38:18,705 --> 00:38:21,175
(They look relaxed like a real couple.)

866
00:38:21,515 --> 00:38:23,345
I should be the one to do things like this.

867
00:38:26,615 --> 00:38:28,255
What did you do earlier in the afternoon?

868
00:38:29,615 --> 00:38:30,655
- In the afternoon? - Yes.

869
00:38:31,985 --> 00:38:34,085
I went on a date like you did.

870
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:39,694
(So Hyun finds out about Sang Hyeon's Day Date.)

871
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:40,795
Did it go well?

872
00:38:41,795 --> 00:38:42,895
Did it go well?

873
00:38:43,135 --> 00:38:44,811
- Yes, it went well. - Did you enjoy the date?

874
00:38:44,835 --> 00:38:47,265
- Did you enjoy it? - It cleared my head.

875
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:49,674
It cleared his head?

876
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:51,435
(Nodding)

877
00:38:52,945 --> 00:38:55,845
Which of the dates did you like the most?

878
00:38:56,245 --> 00:38:57,415
Me?

879
00:38:59,515 --> 00:39:00,614
A date?

880
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:02,554
(She looks back on the dates she went on.)

881
00:39:02,555 --> 00:39:03,885
The princess date.

882
00:39:05,825 --> 00:39:07,725
You were with five men like a princess.

883
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:10,054
The whole chicken soup date.

884
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:13,225
(The 5-on-1 date was unforgettable for So Hyun.)

885
00:39:13,595 --> 00:39:15,495
(I'm a queen.)

886
00:39:16,435 --> 00:39:18,304
What other dates did I have?

887
00:39:18,305 --> 00:39:19,605
(What other dates did I have?)

888
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:22,785
- What else... - You went to an amusement park.

889
00:39:23,635 --> 00:39:26,044
- At the amusement park... - Except for that date.

890
00:39:26,045 --> 00:39:28,074
Because that's the only date I can think of.

891
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:30,614
- Right. - It was really memorable.

892
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:32,785
I tried to think of the other dates...

893
00:39:33,315 --> 00:39:35,614
in order to choose the best one among all the dates I went on.

894
00:39:35,615 --> 00:39:36,884
(Even after looking back on all of the dates she had...)

895
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:38,524
The date at the amusement park was really fun.

896
00:39:38,525 --> 00:39:40,625
- Of course. - I see.

897
00:39:42,355 --> 00:39:45,194
I hadn't seen you that excited before then.

898
00:39:45,195 --> 00:39:46,924
"Oh, yes! I'm at the amusement park!"

899
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:47,925
(She found another side of Sang Hyeon that day.)

900
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:51,194
- Watching you getting so excited, - I'm not immune to that.

901
00:39:51,195 --> 00:39:53,765
I found you very cute.

902
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,904
I found a new side of you, which was charming.

903
00:39:57,905 --> 00:40:01,675
(She found an unexpected charm of Sang Hyeon.)

904
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:05,545
To me, an amusement park...

905
00:40:06,085 --> 00:40:09,555
always meant a place for lovers.

906
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:14,995
I always went to an amusement park with someone special.

907
00:40:16,495 --> 00:40:18,195
From my perspective...

908
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:21,325
It was nice.

909
00:40:21,425 --> 00:40:24,865
You were someone special for me.

910
00:40:25,635 --> 00:40:26,805
That's how I felt.

911
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:30,335
So it felt like a date that real couples would have.

912
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,245
He's being proactive.

913
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:34,175
That day, you were...

914
00:40:36,115 --> 00:40:38,985
so beautiful. I mean it.

915
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:41,515
Was she beautiful?

916
00:40:42,355 --> 00:40:44,515
In the afternoon, he told Bon Hee that she was pretty.

917
00:40:45,185 --> 00:40:46,584
(Bon Hee and Sang Hyeon's Day Date)

918
00:40:46,585 --> 00:40:49,385
(As you were walking toward me... You weren't wearing a dress, but...)

919
00:40:50,295 --> 00:40:52,565
(You look very pretty.)

920
00:40:53,265 --> 00:40:55,195
When Sang Hyeon was with Bon Hee...

921
00:40:55,295 --> 00:40:56,335
He said she looked pretty.

922
00:40:57,295 --> 00:41:00,605
Sang Hyeon seemed a little bit nervous.

923
00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:02,735
But with So Hyun,

924
00:41:03,275 --> 00:41:06,204
he seems a lot more relaxed.

925
00:41:06,205 --> 00:41:07,674
Really? I think it's the other way around.

926
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:09,415
- Do you? - He seems uncomfortable.

927
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,214
It seems that he tries to choose words...

928
00:41:12,215 --> 00:41:13,814
- Not using his familiar words... - Right.

929
00:41:13,815 --> 00:41:16,054
- He chooses words very carefully... - He sugar-coats his words?

930
00:41:16,055 --> 00:41:17,154
No, I don't mean he sugar-coats his words.

931
00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:19,955
It just feels like he chooses his words more carefully.

932
00:41:20,485 --> 00:41:24,124
He seemed more relaxed when he was with Bon Hee.

933
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:25,164
Right.

934
00:41:25,165 --> 00:41:28,364
With So Hyun, he seems awkward and nervous,

935
00:41:28,365 --> 00:41:30,094
trying to choose words carefully.

936
00:41:30,095 --> 00:41:32,734
- Right. "Beautiful" was too much. - I see. I understand.

937
00:41:32,735 --> 00:41:35,134
- Have you ever used that word? - "Beautiful?"

938
00:41:35,135 --> 00:41:37,675
People usually use that word to describe a mountain or a river.

939
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:39,144
We mostly use that word...

940
00:41:39,145 --> 00:41:41,204
- while enjoying a natural scenery. - Exactly.

941
00:41:41,205 --> 00:41:42,814
- It's different. - But Sang Hyeon...

942
00:41:42,815 --> 00:41:44,674
has his own way to describe things.

943
00:41:44,675 --> 00:41:46,275
(Sang Hyeon's words are very sensitive.)

944
00:41:46,315 --> 00:41:49,055
I really enjoyed it too. It's the most memorable date...

945
00:41:49,915 --> 00:41:53,525
Maybe it's because I was sad that it ended so quickly,

946
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:55,495
it was the most memorable date.

947
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:56,595
I see.

948
00:41:56,825 --> 00:41:59,025
I'm still sad that I couldn't go to the zoo.

949
00:41:59,695 --> 00:42:02,464
When you go to the zoo,

950
00:42:02,465 --> 00:42:04,865
you can feed some animals.

951
00:42:05,835 --> 00:42:07,434
I love animals.

952
00:42:07,435 --> 00:42:09,535
Why do you like animals?

953
00:42:10,605 --> 00:42:11,745
They're harmless.

954
00:42:13,245 --> 00:42:16,744
They're harmless to me.

955
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,615
That's what I like the most about animals.

956
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:21,785
I found you...

957
00:42:22,755 --> 00:42:24,554
very charming...

958
00:42:24,555 --> 00:42:26,855
because you seemed so meek and kind.

959
00:42:28,355 --> 00:42:30,475
You seemed like a person who always yields to others.

960
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:32,524
- That's true. - Things like that...

961
00:42:32,525 --> 00:42:36,764
Those are the personality traits that I like in a man,

962
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:38,865
which I think is why I was attracted to you.

963
00:42:39,635 --> 00:42:41,205
You're different from me.

964
00:42:44,905 --> 00:42:46,404
You do know that...

965
00:42:46,405 --> 00:42:48,744
you and I are different types of people.

966
00:42:48,745 --> 00:42:51,574
If I'm being honest and dare to judge,

967
00:42:51,575 --> 00:42:53,715
I think you have a distinctive personality.

968
00:42:54,045 --> 00:42:57,085
- You're lively and bubbly. - I see.

969
00:42:57,185 --> 00:42:58,655
And I didn't...

970
00:43:00,525 --> 00:43:02,025
dislike that about you.

971
00:43:02,355 --> 00:43:03,394
I became curious about you.

972
00:43:03,395 --> 00:43:06,065
To be honest, at some point,

973
00:43:06,565 --> 00:43:07,965
I wanted...

974
00:43:09,765 --> 00:43:11,564
to hang out more with you.

975
00:43:11,565 --> 00:43:15,375
Honestly, I'm curious about your world.

976
00:43:19,045 --> 00:43:20,675
He's trying so hard to say nice things.

977
00:43:21,145 --> 00:43:23,215
- Like "beautiful." - Right.

978
00:43:23,315 --> 00:43:25,515
- "I'm curious about your world." - "The world of you."

979
00:43:25,545 --> 00:43:27,784
- "Harmless." - "I'm a romantic guy."

980
00:43:27,785 --> 00:43:30,115
- "Animals are harmless." - "Animals are harmless."

981
00:43:30,555 --> 00:43:31,885
"Animals are harmless."

982
00:43:32,255 --> 00:43:34,585
Try going into a lion's cage and see if it's harmless.

983
00:43:34,925 --> 00:43:36,555
You'll be just gone.

984
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:39,465
Tomorrow is the last day.

985
00:43:42,695 --> 00:43:44,035
(Sighing)

986
00:43:44,695 --> 00:43:46,165
Why do you keep sighing?

987
00:43:46,805 --> 00:43:48,505
On this show,

988
00:43:51,235 --> 00:43:55,114
I met such charming people.

989
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:56,115
Yes.

990
00:43:58,045 --> 00:43:59,114
There's a person I'm attracted to...

991
00:43:59,115 --> 00:44:00,314
because she's different from me.

992
00:44:00,315 --> 00:44:01,884
And there's another one I'm attracted to...

993
00:44:01,885 --> 00:44:03,815
because she's similar to me.

994
00:44:05,425 --> 00:44:07,885
He's referring to specific people, isn't he?

995
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:13,294
That's exactly how I feel.

996
00:44:13,295 --> 00:44:16,334
I see. You experienced those feelings at the same time?

997
00:44:16,335 --> 00:44:19,305
Yes, since I was experiencing them at the same time,

998
00:44:19,765 --> 00:44:22,504
it gave me such a headache from time to time.

999
00:44:22,505 --> 00:44:24,975
- I see. - It gave me such a headache.

1000
00:44:26,405 --> 00:44:28,375
- It's a rare experience. - So you contemplated.

1001
00:44:28,915 --> 00:44:31,445
- Yes. - You contemplated deeply.

1002
00:44:32,485 --> 00:44:33,485
I see.

1003
00:44:33,486 --> 00:44:34,985
She seems taken aback.

1004
00:44:36,315 --> 00:44:39,284
(So Hyun finds out that Sang Hyeon is faltering.)

1005
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:40,385
It happened that way.

1006
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:41,685
I didn't know that.

1007
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:43,355
- You didn't know? - No.

1008
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:46,965
I decided to do as I want.

1009
00:44:47,065 --> 00:44:50,734
We have to make a choice eventually.

1010
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:54,264
So I decided to do as I want.

1011
00:44:54,265 --> 00:44:56,434
I'll follow my heart.

1012
00:44:56,435 --> 00:44:57,935
That's the only thing on my mind.

1013
00:45:04,645 --> 00:45:05,684
There's a little tension in the air.

1014
00:45:05,685 --> 00:45:07,415
- It's lukewarm. - Right.

1015
00:45:08,015 --> 00:45:09,655
I had no idea.

1016
00:45:09,755 --> 00:45:13,555
Based on what he told me and how he treated me,

1017
00:45:13,655 --> 00:45:17,025
I was sure that he had feelings for me.

1018
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:19,925
I thought he adored me.

1019
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:25,605
(You're so pretty.)

1020
00:45:26,035 --> 00:45:28,674
(What is this?)

1021
00:45:28,675 --> 00:45:30,704
(I want to give you a health supplement.)

1022
00:45:30,705 --> 00:45:33,044
Really? Thank you.

1023
00:45:33,045 --> 00:45:34,545
I really needed this.

1024
00:45:35,445 --> 00:45:38,115
I thought he felt the same way about me as I felt about him,

1025
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:40,285
but maybe I was wrong.

1026
00:45:42,085 --> 00:45:44,315
I was so confused.

1027
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,995
It's always so hard...

1028
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:52,094
to tell how someone feels.

1029
00:45:52,095 --> 00:45:55,095
(It's always so hard to tell how someone feels.)

1030
00:45:58,065 --> 00:46:00,605
If we do as our hearts say,

1031
00:46:04,775 --> 00:46:06,175
things will go as we want, I think.

1032
00:46:08,915 --> 00:46:10,914
(Nothing can be guaranteed after the last dates.)

1033
00:46:10,915 --> 00:46:12,145
How will things pan out?

1034
00:46:13,985 --> 00:46:17,785
My goodness. "Let's do as our hearts say."

1035
00:46:18,355 --> 00:46:20,585
What he said would hurt my feelings if I were her.

1036
00:46:20,685 --> 00:46:22,854
On many dates,

1037
00:46:22,855 --> 00:46:25,395
we heard the participants say, "Let's do as our hearts say."

1038
00:46:25,495 --> 00:46:28,425
But when Mu Jin and Bon Hee said it...

1039
00:46:28,735 --> 00:46:31,271
Since they felt a certain level of certainty in their relationship,

1040
00:46:31,295 --> 00:46:33,804
when they said it, it sounded like,

1041
00:46:33,805 --> 00:46:35,674
"Don't feel pressured and follow your heart."

1042
00:46:35,675 --> 00:46:37,275
That's how I interpreted their comments.

1043
00:46:37,475 --> 00:46:39,944
But when Sang Hyeon said the same thing...

1044
00:46:39,945 --> 00:46:41,874
He said he was contemplating deeply...

1045
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:44,244
between two people...

1046
00:46:44,245 --> 00:46:45,815
before making the comment.

1047
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:49,355
So it was the same comment, but it sounded different.

1048
00:46:49,885 --> 00:46:53,354
"Don't hate me too much because of my decision."

1049
00:46:53,355 --> 00:46:54,355
- That's how it sounded to me. - Right.

1050
00:46:54,355 --> 00:46:55,355
"Don't expect too much."

1051
00:46:55,356 --> 00:46:56,624
- "Don't be disappointed." - Exactly.

1052
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:57,625
"I don't know whom I'll choose."

1053
00:46:57,626 --> 00:46:58,664
- Right. It's the same comment, - "Let's do..."

1054
00:46:58,665 --> 00:46:59,764
- as our hearts say." - but it sounded different.

1055
00:46:59,765 --> 00:47:02,065
- Right. - If I were So Hyun,

1056
00:47:02,165 --> 00:47:04,935
I'd think there's not enough time to make the decision...

1057
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:07,405
I'd be very upset.

1058
00:47:07,865 --> 00:47:10,934
Knowing Sang Hyeon, and as it happens repeatedly,

1059
00:47:10,935 --> 00:47:12,044
I'm sure he'll regret again.

1060
00:47:12,045 --> 00:47:13,204
My point, exactly.

1061
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,844
- Is it like Sang Hyeon's habit? - I think he'll regret saying it.

1062
00:47:14,845 --> 00:47:16,144
Is it his own way of speaking?

1063
00:47:16,145 --> 00:47:17,444
I think he'll regret when he goes back to Yeon House.

1064
00:47:17,445 --> 00:47:18,815
"Maybe I shouldn't have said it."

1065
00:47:20,415 --> 00:47:23,315
(The Day and Night Dates ended where different emotions were felt.)

1066
00:47:23,815 --> 00:47:27,585
(Mu Jin is at Yeon House as his date ended earlier than the others.)

1067
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:29,755
- Hey. You're back. - I just got back.

1068
00:47:30,455 --> 00:47:32,325
- Did you enjoy your date? - Yes, I'm so full.

1069
00:47:33,565 --> 00:47:34,625
Gosh, I'm so full.

1070
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:37,134
I didn't eat much food.

1071
00:47:37,135 --> 00:47:38,165
Did you drink a lot?

1072
00:47:38,395 --> 00:47:40,105
I had two glasses of cocktail.

1073
00:47:41,165 --> 00:47:42,705
We were always busy eating food.

1074
00:47:44,735 --> 00:47:47,175
But today, we...

1075
00:47:48,075 --> 00:47:50,175
- talked more than we used to. - Did you talk a lot?

1076
00:47:51,075 --> 00:47:52,684
Do you two have a different type of conversation now?

1077
00:47:52,685 --> 00:47:54,715
- Yes. - A more stable conversation?

1078
00:47:55,185 --> 00:47:57,955
Now we share our innermost feelings.

1079
00:47:58,055 --> 00:48:01,825
Now that we know each other's age...

1080
00:48:02,525 --> 00:48:03,895
So you can talk about the future?

1081
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:06,665
- Yes. - That's cool.

1082
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:09,494
(Sighing)

1083
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:11,035
It's difficult.

1084
00:48:12,965 --> 00:48:14,004
You seem tired.

1085
00:48:14,005 --> 00:48:16,675
- Right. I look unwell, right? - Yes.

1086
00:48:16,775 --> 00:48:19,444
Would you like to rest for a bit before you come down?

1087
00:48:19,445 --> 00:48:21,604
I feel out of energy too.

1088
00:48:21,605 --> 00:48:23,015
Why? What's up with you?

1089
00:48:23,115 --> 00:48:24,874
It's not that I'm upset about anything.

1090
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:26,844
- You must be emotionally tired. - I mean...

1091
00:48:26,845 --> 00:48:29,385
I started to worry again about real life issues.

1092
00:48:33,685 --> 00:48:34,724
(Meanwhile, Ye Eun is still alone in her room.)

1093
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:35,824
- I feel bad for Ye Eun. - Poor her.

1094
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:37,355
Poor Ye Eun.

1095
00:48:39,925 --> 00:48:41,295
I'm back.

1096
00:48:41,865 --> 00:48:43,565
Welcome back.

1097
00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:48,035
- Did you have a good day? - Yes.

1098
00:48:49,575 --> 00:48:51,135
Did you have dinner?

1099
00:48:52,575 --> 00:48:54,905
- Sorry? - You haven't had dinner yet, right?

1100
00:48:55,105 --> 00:48:57,345
- I'm good. - Okay.

1101
00:48:58,145 --> 00:48:59,985
What did you do on your dates?

1102
00:49:00,715 --> 00:49:04,415
I just ate food at a restaurant. That was all.

1103
00:49:04,715 --> 00:49:05,725
What did you eat?

1104
00:49:06,255 --> 00:49:08,155
It was a Western cuisine restaurant.

1105
00:49:08,255 --> 00:49:10,655
Who chose it?

1106
00:49:10,795 --> 00:49:12,325
Hyeon Jun.

1107
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:16,495
I guess it's the guys who had to pick a date spot.

1108
00:49:16,695 --> 00:49:17,734
I think so.

1109
00:49:17,735 --> 00:49:20,135
I met Ji Yung as well.

1110
00:49:20,665 --> 00:49:22,275
Was he really?

1111
00:49:22,905 --> 00:49:24,374
- So... - Was it a three-person date?

1112
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:25,875
No, I went on two dates.

1113
00:49:27,075 --> 00:49:28,205
That's cool.

1114
00:49:28,815 --> 00:49:32,344
Ye Eun only just found out that the younger men...

1115
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:33,914
- each had two choices. - She only just found out.

1116
00:49:33,915 --> 00:49:35,435
- She only just found out. - Goodness.

1117
00:49:36,655 --> 00:49:38,985
- So it was... - When did they make the choices?

1118
00:49:40,025 --> 00:49:42,395
- I didn't ask about that. - Everything bothers her now.

1119
00:49:42,555 --> 00:49:44,024
Can you ask them for me?

1120
00:49:44,025 --> 00:49:45,785
Whether it was last night or this morning...

1121
00:49:45,895 --> 00:49:48,964
is going to be important for me.

1122
00:49:48,965 --> 00:49:50,094
- Goodness. - Yesterday,

1123
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:52,365
I talked to him honestly.

1124
00:49:52,935 --> 00:49:56,334
I told him he should follow his heart.

1125
00:49:56,335 --> 00:50:00,074
Then, as he was leaving, he held my hand.

1126
00:50:00,075 --> 00:50:01,604
- Right. - Goodness.

1127
00:50:01,605 --> 00:50:04,244
We locked eyes and held hands tightly.

1128
00:50:04,245 --> 00:50:07,215
To me, that was a good signal.

1129
00:50:07,585 --> 00:50:09,785
He didn't just hold her hand. He held it tightly.

1130
00:50:10,115 --> 00:50:15,055
(Last night, Sang Won requested her to have a conversation.)

1131
00:50:15,155 --> 00:50:18,125
(Go to the person you are more drawn to.)

1132
00:50:18,455 --> 00:50:20,225
(After the heartfelt conversation, )

1133
00:50:20,325 --> 00:50:23,034
(Sang Won shook Ye Eun's hand, )

1134
00:50:23,035 --> 00:50:26,405
(and Ye Eun considered it as a signal.)

1135
00:50:27,135 --> 00:50:29,574
But to do this after giving me...

1136
00:50:29,575 --> 00:50:31,205
a signal like that is...

1137
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:36,474
Honestly, it really hurts... It hurts my feelings a lot.

1138
00:50:36,475 --> 00:50:37,745
Right.

1139
00:50:38,045 --> 00:50:39,485
I understand.

1140
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:42,955
It's important to me.

1141
00:50:43,455 --> 00:50:44,685
Right.

1142
00:50:45,355 --> 00:50:46,454
But...

1143
00:50:46,455 --> 00:50:48,755
- I'm worried about this. - Yes?

1144
00:50:49,055 --> 00:50:50,595
Do you think we will gather up later?

1145
00:50:50,995 --> 00:50:53,695
I think we might, even if it's late.

1146
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:55,735
Why do you ask?

1147
00:50:57,965 --> 00:51:01,035
I'm a very honest person.

1148
00:51:04,275 --> 00:51:07,475
So it all shows up on my face.

1149
00:51:07,705 --> 00:51:08,805
Right.

1150
00:51:09,445 --> 00:51:11,525
You're worried that it would show up on your face...

1151
00:51:12,115 --> 00:51:13,945
when everyone is there.

1152
00:51:18,485 --> 00:51:21,485
I hope she won't come to me.

1153
00:51:23,225 --> 00:51:24,425
Ji Won.

1154
00:51:26,725 --> 00:51:27,794
(Oh, dear.)

1155
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:29,355
She doesn't want Ji Won to come to her.

1156
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:34,534
She assumes that Ji Won...

1157
00:51:34,535 --> 00:51:36,095
must have gone on a date with Sang Won.

1158
00:51:36,235 --> 00:51:37,805
Oh, dear.

1159
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:43,715
I hope she won't come to me.

1160
00:51:45,445 --> 00:51:46,584
Ji Won.

1161
00:51:46,585 --> 00:51:49,015
(She hopes Ji Won won't come to her.)

1162
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:51,384
I hope she won't come to me, with that whining voice.

1163
00:51:51,385 --> 00:51:52,824
(She doesn't think she can face Ji Won like nothing happened.)

1164
00:51:52,825 --> 00:51:55,595
- I hope she won't do that. - I will close the door.

1165
00:51:58,455 --> 00:52:02,395
It must be uncomfortable for you to look at Ji Won.

1166
00:52:02,895 --> 00:52:06,564
It's not that I don't like her.

1167
00:52:06,565 --> 00:52:08,065
- I know. - But...

1168
00:52:08,865 --> 00:52:10,404
I'm hurt badly.

1169
00:52:10,405 --> 00:52:13,675
(But I'm hurt badly.)

1170
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:18,045
How can I pretend to be fine?

1171
00:52:18,675 --> 00:52:21,245
You can cry if you feel like it.

1172
00:52:21,815 --> 00:52:23,714
I can understand why she would think that.

1173
00:52:23,715 --> 00:52:25,215
How will she pretend to be fine?

1174
00:52:27,585 --> 00:52:28,884
(She understands it with her head, )

1175
00:52:28,885 --> 00:52:30,254
It's okay.

1176
00:52:30,255 --> 00:52:34,065
(but her heart is still in pain.)

1177
00:52:37,895 --> 00:52:40,405
What should I do, Yeong Gyeong?

1178
00:52:42,935 --> 00:52:44,935
I will go and ask when he asked her out on a date.

1179
00:52:47,445 --> 00:52:48,774
If I were Ye Eun,

1180
00:52:48,775 --> 00:52:49,914
- I would go mad. - Me too.

1181
00:52:49,915 --> 00:52:51,815
- You can't just leave the house. - Right.

1182
00:52:52,385 --> 00:52:54,585
And you can't just stay in the room alone.

1183
00:52:55,815 --> 00:52:58,115
- That would be too tough. - That would be too tough.

1184
00:52:58,585 --> 00:53:00,824
She must be embarrassed, hurt,

1185
00:53:00,825 --> 00:53:02,055
and irritated.

1186
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:04,755
- You are all here. - Yes.

1187
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:06,294
- What did you do? - When did you get back?

1188
00:53:06,295 --> 00:53:07,325
- I was starving. - Oh?

1189
00:53:07,465 --> 00:53:08,964
- Can I talk to you? - Oh.

1190
00:53:08,965 --> 00:53:10,664
- I need to talk to you. - Me?

1191
00:53:10,665 --> 00:53:11,734
Great.

1192
00:53:11,735 --> 00:53:13,204
(They have no clue about Ye Eun's situation.)

1193
00:53:13,205 --> 00:53:14,841
- Yeong Gyeong's changed. - It's my first time seeing this.

1194
00:53:14,865 --> 00:53:16,034
Is it your first time seeing me like this?

1195
00:53:16,035 --> 00:53:17,274
Since everyone is here,

1196
00:53:17,275 --> 00:53:19,045
let's go upstairs.

1197
00:53:20,045 --> 00:53:21,074
Cute.

1198
00:53:21,075 --> 00:53:22,075
Okay.

1199
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:24,374
(Yeong Gyeong and Hyeon Jun came to the 2nd floor.)

1200
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:27,185
It's just that there's something I need to ask you.

1201
00:53:28,115 --> 00:53:29,814
When did you choose...

1202
00:53:29,815 --> 00:53:32,355
who you were going on today’s date with?

1203
00:53:32,385 --> 00:53:33,854
- Today? - This morning.

1204
00:53:33,855 --> 00:53:35,185
This morning. Right.

1205
00:53:36,295 --> 00:53:39,095
There's a problem we need to solve.

1206
00:53:39,765 --> 00:53:41,264
Ye Eun's been here alone...

1207
00:53:41,265 --> 00:53:43,735
all day long.

1208
00:53:44,235 --> 00:53:48,065
She must have felt hurt staying here alone all day.

1209
00:53:49,505 --> 00:53:51,905
It seems...

1210
00:53:52,475 --> 00:53:55,745
she had a heart-to-heart with Sang Won last night.

1211
00:53:56,675 --> 00:53:58,675
She thought their conversation went well.

1212
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,561
And she even thought he gave her a signal.

1213
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:05,554
But he didn't ask her out on a date today.

1214
00:54:05,555 --> 00:54:07,284
So that made her feel...

1215
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,994
- She must've been hurt. - She had her hopes high...

1216
00:54:09,995 --> 00:54:12,595
only to be disappointed.

1217
00:54:13,095 --> 00:54:16,035
Now she's embarrassed to come down.

1218
00:54:16,935 --> 00:54:18,194
What do we do?

1219
00:54:18,195 --> 00:54:20,304
I will figure something out.

1220
00:54:20,305 --> 00:54:21,405
- Okay. - Okay.

1221
00:54:23,035 --> 00:54:24,875
- Come, Sang Won. - Yes?

1222
00:54:25,705 --> 00:54:26,904
It's raining a lot.

1223
00:54:26,905 --> 00:54:28,174
(Hyeon Jun talks to Sang Won right away.)

1224
00:54:28,175 --> 00:54:31,474
It seems Ye Eun didn't get to go out today.

1225
00:54:31,475 --> 00:54:33,284
She must've been home all day, all by herself.

1226
00:54:33,285 --> 00:54:36,855
And it hurt her feelings.

1227
00:54:37,385 --> 00:54:40,825
Ye Eun feels that you hurt her feelings.

1228
00:54:42,385 --> 00:54:44,524
She's also curious about whether you made your choice...

1229
00:54:44,525 --> 00:54:48,094
last night or this morning.

1230
00:54:48,095 --> 00:54:50,865
It seems she wants to talk to you.

1231
00:54:54,235 --> 00:54:57,805
I think you should talk to her now so we can all eat together.

1232
00:54:58,135 --> 00:55:00,274
They can't talk alone when everyone is around.

1233
00:55:00,275 --> 00:55:02,405
It would be nice if they talk alone first.

1234
00:55:08,745 --> 00:55:10,084
(Knock-knock)

1235
00:55:10,085 --> 00:55:11,085
Yes?

1236
00:55:12,818 --> 00:55:14,087
(Knock-knock)

1237
00:55:14,088 --> 00:55:15,118
Yes?

1238
00:55:15,218 --> 00:55:17,158
- Is Ye Eun in? - She is.

1239
00:55:17,388 --> 00:55:18,888
Can you ask her to come out?

1240
00:55:19,388 --> 00:55:20,458
Okay.

1241
00:55:20,658 --> 00:55:23,098
- I will be there on the sofa. - Okay.

1242
00:55:28,338 --> 00:55:29,937
(Sang Won waits for Ye Eun.)

1243
00:55:29,938 --> 00:55:31,737
It must be difficult for Sang Won.

1244
00:55:31,738 --> 00:55:34,038
(Sang Won waits for Ye Eun.)

1245
00:55:50,188 --> 00:55:52,828
Sit. I will tell you.

1246
00:55:55,198 --> 00:55:57,727
I had my reasons. Sit.

1247
00:55:57,728 --> 00:56:00,328
(Sang Won had his reasons.)

1248
00:56:02,138 --> 00:56:03,798
I heard you were not happy.

1249
00:56:07,568 --> 00:56:08,938
Here's what happened.

1250
00:56:10,808 --> 00:56:13,408
There was a day date, and there was a night date.

1251
00:56:14,048 --> 00:56:16,918
The night date was like a real date.

1252
00:56:17,578 --> 00:56:20,818
The day date for me was an opportunity to talk.

1253
00:56:21,218 --> 00:56:24,587
That's why I chose someone who I had never got to talk to,

1254
00:56:24,588 --> 00:56:26,588
someone who I was a little interested in at first.

1255
00:56:27,588 --> 00:56:30,827
That was So Hyun. I wanted to use the chance...

1256
00:56:30,828 --> 00:56:32,567
to go to a cafe with her and have a chat.

1257
00:56:32,568 --> 00:56:33,797
How about the night date then?

1258
00:56:33,798 --> 00:56:35,667
I talked to Ji Won then.

1259
00:56:35,668 --> 00:56:37,667
(I see.)

1260
00:56:37,668 --> 00:56:40,708
On the night date, we could be more relaxed.

1261
00:56:41,938 --> 00:56:44,877
There was no date after, so I thought we could talk...

1262
00:56:44,878 --> 00:56:46,448
more freely then, so I chose Ji Won.

1263
00:56:47,148 --> 00:56:49,248
At the end of the day, you didn't choose me.

1264
00:56:51,288 --> 00:56:53,818
In the end, I didn't choose you.

1265
00:56:54,118 --> 00:56:55,258
Right.

1266
00:56:56,358 --> 00:56:57,618
Because I've been always...

1267
00:56:58,288 --> 00:57:02,458
clear about where I stand,

1268
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:07,128
even when I talked to other men,

1269
00:57:07,668 --> 00:57:09,698
I only talked about you.

1270
00:57:10,298 --> 00:57:13,508
I guess it's because I am clear about...

1271
00:57:14,138 --> 00:57:15,938
who I am drawn to.

1272
00:57:17,848 --> 00:57:19,048
To be honest,

1273
00:57:20,048 --> 00:57:21,448
seeing how you...

1274
00:57:22,518 --> 00:57:24,048
held my hand at the end,

1275
00:57:25,718 --> 00:57:27,958
I thought you had...

1276
00:57:28,618 --> 00:57:31,427
some feelings for me too.

1277
00:57:31,428 --> 00:57:32,558
She can think that.

1278
00:57:33,088 --> 00:57:36,028
Not being chosen for the date,

1279
00:57:37,098 --> 00:57:39,028
I felt hurt.

1280
00:57:40,898 --> 00:57:43,397
(On the day Sang Won bought wasabi for Ye Eun)

1281
00:57:43,398 --> 00:57:45,938
(On the day Sang Won bought wasabi for Ye Eun)

1282
00:57:46,468 --> 00:57:49,977
(I want to tell you how I feel.)

1283
00:57:49,978 --> 00:57:53,048
(I went to the Korean dining restaurant with Mu Jin, you know.)

1284
00:57:54,178 --> 00:57:56,918
(I couldn't stop thinking about you there.)

1285
00:57:57,318 --> 00:57:59,617
(Yesterday, I told you that you were...)

1286
00:57:59,618 --> 00:58:01,888
(one of the few people I'm interested in.)

1287
00:58:01,988 --> 00:58:04,428
(They used to have mutual interest in each other.)

1288
00:58:05,128 --> 00:58:08,127
(You completely won me over...)

1289
00:58:08,128 --> 00:58:09,627
(by wasabi.)

1290
00:58:09,628 --> 00:58:11,497
(It was one of the things...)

1291
00:58:11,498 --> 00:58:15,167
(I had to buy at the grocery store.)

1292
00:58:15,168 --> 00:58:18,468
(I thought I shouldn't forget about the meat and wasabi.)

1293
00:58:19,268 --> 00:58:21,978
(But of course, I didn't just buy it for no reason.)

1294
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:26,508
(Ye Eun thought Sang Won felt the same way about her.)

1295
00:58:28,518 --> 00:58:29,687
(But Sang Won didn't choose Ye Eun for the last date.)

1296
00:58:29,688 --> 00:58:30,918
Oh, dear.

1297
00:58:34,058 --> 00:58:35,198
- What will they do? - So...

1298
00:58:35,398 --> 00:58:37,898
what is it that you want to say?

1299
00:58:39,068 --> 00:58:41,028
I came to check.

1300
00:58:41,868 --> 00:58:44,198
I heard you weren't so happy.

1301
00:58:44,568 --> 00:58:47,008
I feel sorry that I am the cause.

1302
00:58:47,268 --> 00:58:48,678
I didn't think things would...

1303
00:58:50,508 --> 00:58:54,078
turn out this way.

1304
00:59:00,048 --> 00:59:01,188
I see.

1305
00:59:03,688 --> 00:59:04,718
Okay.

1306
00:59:05,288 --> 00:59:07,158
Thank you for coming to talk to me.

1307
00:59:10,698 --> 00:59:12,267
I spent my time alone well.

1308
00:59:12,268 --> 00:59:13,328
I did ballet.

1309
00:59:14,198 --> 00:59:15,298
I exercised.

1310
00:59:18,098 --> 00:59:19,338
I worked on my assignments too.

1311
00:59:19,638 --> 00:59:21,037
I finished writing my thesis too.

1312
00:59:21,038 --> 00:59:23,577
(She bursts out in tears.)

1313
00:59:23,578 --> 00:59:25,008
But... Gosh.

1314
00:59:25,878 --> 00:59:27,408
I will go back to my room.

1315
00:59:29,578 --> 00:59:30,578
I'm sorry.

1316
00:59:32,918 --> 00:59:35,417
(Afraid that he might see her cry, Ye Eun hurriedly leaves.)

1317
00:59:35,418 --> 00:59:37,888
(Afraid that he might see her cry, Ye Eun hurriedly leaves.)

1318
00:59:44,428 --> 00:59:48,097
He's in an awkward situation, and she's really hurt.

1319
00:59:48,098 --> 00:59:51,297
(Seeing Ye Eun hurt, he is perplexed.)

1320
00:59:51,298 --> 00:59:54,408
(Seeing Ye Eun hurt, he is perplexed.)

1321
00:59:59,008 --> 01:00:00,577
Perhaps because it's the last day,

1322
01:00:00,578 --> 01:00:02,778
- everyone is in a low mood. - Yes.

1323
01:00:03,218 --> 01:00:05,288
- We're sorry to leave. - There's that too.

1324
01:00:05,688 --> 01:00:07,617
- Everyone's perplexed. - It's a bit of everything.

1325
01:00:07,618 --> 01:00:08,687
(After talking to Ye Eun, Sang Won comes down to the 1st floor.)

1326
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,958
It's raining too.

1327
01:00:10,988 --> 01:00:12,088
What's up with that face?

1328
01:00:13,028 --> 01:00:16,358
He's usually not a serious person.

1329
01:00:17,758 --> 01:00:20,597
(Staring)

1330
01:00:20,598 --> 01:00:23,438
(Staring)

1331
01:00:23,698 --> 01:00:25,367
Why is this chair really heavy?

1332
01:00:25,368 --> 01:00:28,477
(Sang Won's serious face dampens the atmosphere.)

1333
01:00:28,478 --> 01:00:31,238
(Conscious)

1334
01:00:36,018 --> 01:00:37,448
Is everyone home?

1335
01:00:37,648 --> 01:00:41,087
I heard everyone is home. Where is Ye Eun?

1336
01:00:41,088 --> 01:00:42,457
- She's home. - I see.

1337
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:43,588
- She's home. - Is she?

1338
01:00:43,988 --> 01:00:45,127
I will go talk to her.

1339
01:00:45,128 --> 01:00:46,358
- Alone? - Yes.

1340
01:00:47,628 --> 01:00:48,628
No.

1341
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:49,628
(Don't go.)

1342
01:00:49,798 --> 01:00:50,798
- Oh, dear. - Don't go.

1343
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:54,068
- No. - This is bad timing, Ji Won.

1344
01:00:54,468 --> 01:00:55,937
(Knocking)

1345
01:00:55,938 --> 01:00:57,738
She must be in a really bad mood.

1346
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,938
Is Ye Eun here?

1347
01:01:03,678 --> 01:01:05,447
Go downstairs.

1348
01:01:05,448 --> 01:01:07,107
(Yeong Gyeong sends her down.)

1349
01:01:07,108 --> 01:01:09,247
The situation is really bad.

1350
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:11,077
- She should come back later. - Right.

1351
01:01:11,078 --> 01:01:12,418
(Shutting the door)

1352
01:01:15,158 --> 01:01:16,158
Where is Ye Eun?

1353
01:01:22,928 --> 01:01:24,157
(Looking)

1354
01:01:24,158 --> 01:01:25,628
(Asking to talk)

1355
01:01:26,128 --> 01:01:28,898
(She quietly takes Bon Hee.)

1356
01:01:29,598 --> 01:01:31,668
(Sighing)

1357
01:01:32,908 --> 01:01:34,607
(The younger men figures out the situation.)

1358
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:35,708
Look.

1359
01:01:36,778 --> 01:01:39,978
I guess someone might not have gone on a date today.

1360
01:01:41,308 --> 01:01:42,317
(Oh!)

1361
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:43,847
- Not once? - Right.

1362
01:01:43,848 --> 01:01:45,948
It's possible that someone never went on a date.

1363
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:48,147
I thought there would be at least one date for everyone.

1364
01:01:48,148 --> 01:01:49,857
(They realize there's someone who didn't get to go on any dates.)

1365
01:01:49,858 --> 01:01:51,287
They didn't share it.

1366
01:01:51,288 --> 01:01:52,758
- Right. - Who their dates were.

1367
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:59,497
(Ji Won takes Bon Hee to the stairs.)

1368
01:01:59,498 --> 01:02:01,668
I went to Ye Eun's room,

1369
01:02:02,838 --> 01:02:03,968
and I was told to leave.

1370
01:02:05,968 --> 01:02:07,808
Ye Eun was in the restroom.

1371
01:02:08,408 --> 01:02:11,407
And Yeong Gyeong told me to leave.

1372
01:02:11,408 --> 01:02:13,178
She told me to go to the first floor.

1373
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:15,148
Why?

1374
01:02:15,378 --> 01:02:16,548
I don't know.

1375
01:02:16,648 --> 01:02:18,348
- Really? - Yes.

1376
01:02:18,718 --> 01:02:21,247
When Sang Won came down, he looked really serious.

1377
01:02:21,248 --> 01:02:22,288
Yes.

1378
01:02:22,718 --> 01:02:24,617
I should go talk to Sang Won.

1379
01:02:24,618 --> 01:02:26,158
- Yes. - Go ahead.

1380
01:02:31,398 --> 01:02:33,497
- Can we talk? - Yes.

1381
01:02:33,498 --> 01:02:36,968
(Ji Won asks Sang Won to talk.)

1382
01:02:37,168 --> 01:02:39,268
- What's wrong? - What?

1383
01:02:40,068 --> 01:02:41,108
Ye Eun?

1384
01:02:41,238 --> 01:02:43,037
- I heard she was unhappy. - Yes.

1385
01:02:43,038 --> 01:02:44,678
I should be more careful about saying it.

1386
01:02:45,448 --> 01:02:48,208
I was worried about her, so I went upstairs to her room.

1387
01:02:48,418 --> 01:02:51,418
- And I was told to go down. - Did she...

1388
01:02:52,148 --> 01:02:53,547
So it made me wonder if I had done something...

1389
01:02:53,548 --> 01:02:54,787
(So it made me wonder if I had done something...)

1390
01:02:54,788 --> 01:02:56,588
It wasn't something you did.

1391
01:02:56,688 --> 01:02:59,688
Everyone expected me to go on a date...

1392
01:03:00,088 --> 01:03:01,528
with you.

1393
01:03:02,228 --> 01:03:04,397
Even Ye Eun knew about it. I think she expected me...

1394
01:03:04,398 --> 01:03:07,267
to ask her out to go on...

1395
01:03:07,268 --> 01:03:08,368
the other date.

1396
01:03:08,998 --> 01:03:12,038
I knew she might feel sad about it.

1397
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:14,737
But I didn't think she would be staying home all day.

1398
01:03:14,738 --> 01:03:16,778
- How could he have known? - He didn't expect that.

1399
01:03:17,178 --> 01:03:21,478
(Ji Won learns that Ye Eun didn't get to go on any dates.)

1400
01:03:22,678 --> 01:03:23,817
(Knock-knock)

1401
01:03:23,818 --> 01:03:26,988
(Worried, Bon Hee goes to Ye Eun.)

1402
01:03:30,058 --> 01:03:31,518
Can I come in?

1403
01:03:32,528 --> 01:03:33,788
Ye Eun.

1404
01:03:36,228 --> 01:03:37,758
What have you been doing?

1405
01:03:40,898 --> 01:03:43,098
(Looking at her)

1406
01:03:44,938 --> 01:03:46,207
(As soon as she sees Bon Hee, she bursts into tears.)

1407
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:49,138
She's going to cry again.

1408
01:03:50,238 --> 01:03:51,908
She just stopped.

1409
01:03:52,808 --> 01:03:56,078
(Flustered)

1410
01:04:02,018 --> 01:04:03,287
What happened?

1411
01:04:03,288 --> 01:04:06,927
(She tries to suppress her feelings, but she can't contain her emotion.)

1412
01:04:06,928 --> 01:04:10,557
(She tries to suppress her feelings, but she can't contain her emotion.)

1413
01:04:10,558 --> 01:04:11,868
It's okay.

1414
01:04:15,198 --> 01:04:17,167
(Looking around)

1415
01:04:17,168 --> 01:04:18,267
Did Bon Hee go up?

1416
01:04:18,268 --> 01:04:20,468
(I don't know.)

1417
01:04:21,438 --> 01:04:25,808
(Ji Won hesitates to go up.)

1418
01:04:26,948 --> 01:04:30,118
(Thinking about it)

1419
01:04:31,048 --> 01:04:32,618
I will go up.

1420
01:04:34,748 --> 01:04:37,757
(She carefully approaches Ye Eun's room.)

1421
01:04:37,758 --> 01:04:40,057
- The door is open. - Yes.

1422
01:04:40,058 --> 01:04:41,187
(Through the opened door, )

1423
01:04:41,188 --> 01:04:45,927
(she can hear Ye Eun crying.)

1424
01:04:45,928 --> 01:04:47,867
- I'm okay. - Okay.

1425
01:04:47,868 --> 01:04:51,908
(Ji Won gives up and leaves.)

1426
01:04:53,308 --> 01:04:55,307
(She came into her room instead.)

1427
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,438
She must feel bad too.

1428
01:05:00,678 --> 01:05:02,818
(Sighing)

1429
01:05:05,718 --> 01:05:07,788
- Oh, dear. - Goodness.

1430
01:05:10,488 --> 01:05:15,158
I know that Ye Eun is interested in Sang Won.

1431
01:05:17,428 --> 01:05:19,928
I had mixed emotions.

1432
01:05:23,038 --> 01:05:27,068
(Ji Won can't stop being bothered.)

1433
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:29,937
Ye Eun knows that Ji Won isn't the one to blame.

1434
01:05:29,938 --> 01:05:32,278
Ji Won knows everything that's going on,

1435
01:05:32,608 --> 01:05:34,577
but there's nothing she can do about it.

1436
01:05:34,578 --> 01:05:36,317
She was chosen.

1437
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:37,577
Sang Won chose...

1438
01:05:37,578 --> 01:05:39,687
the person he wanted to go on a date with...

1439
01:05:39,688 --> 01:05:42,587
- out of his free will. - Of course.

1440
01:05:42,588 --> 01:05:45,017
- Of course. - There's no villain.

1441
01:05:45,018 --> 01:05:46,687
And that makes it difficult for everyone.

1442
01:05:46,688 --> 01:05:47,757
(Because nobody is at fault, everyone struggles.)

1443
01:05:47,758 --> 01:05:49,898
What will they do? What's going to happen?

1444
01:05:52,568 --> 01:05:55,197
(A message has arrived at Yeon House.)

1445
01:05:55,198 --> 01:05:57,138
Do you think she's really sad?

1446
01:05:57,968 --> 01:05:59,008
Did you receive something?

1447
01:06:00,438 --> 01:06:01,608
I got one too.

1448
01:06:02,008 --> 01:06:03,277
(It's time for the game Truth or Dare.)

1449
01:06:03,278 --> 01:06:05,247
- To know each other's feelings. - Truth or Dare.

1450
01:06:05,248 --> 01:06:06,577
- Truth or Dare! - Truth or Dare!

1451
01:06:06,578 --> 01:06:08,547
They have to ask each other a question.

1452
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,748
And every question will remain anonymous.

1453
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:13,188
What should I ask?

1454
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:15,557
I don't know what to send.

1455
01:06:15,558 --> 01:06:19,058
(They think hard about the question.)

1456
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:22,098
Personally, I have a lot of questions now.

1457
01:06:23,398 --> 01:06:25,467
In a way, it turned out for the better.

1458
01:06:25,468 --> 01:06:27,727
I got a chance...

1459
01:06:27,728 --> 01:06:30,038
to talk to him a little more.

1460
01:06:31,138 --> 01:06:32,637
I want to ask him about what he's thinking...

1461
01:06:32,638 --> 01:06:34,198
and the things I've been curious about.

1462
01:06:34,268 --> 01:06:35,637
I wanted to ask her.

1463
01:06:35,638 --> 01:06:37,958
(It's time to ask each other about their honest thoughts.)

1464
01:06:38,178 --> 01:06:40,077
Since it remains anonymous, they can be completely...

1465
01:06:40,078 --> 01:06:41,407
- honest. - Right.

1466
01:06:41,408 --> 01:06:43,294
(Truth or Dare time comes to the rainy Yeon House.)

1467
01:06:43,318 --> 01:06:44,747
- You're here. - Hello.

1468
01:06:44,748 --> 01:06:45,888
Ye Eun came down.

1469
01:06:46,088 --> 01:06:47,318
(Hesitating)

1470
01:06:48,888 --> 01:06:50,558
(Looking)

1471
01:06:51,418 --> 01:06:52,628
He's conscious of her.

1472
01:06:57,898 --> 01:07:00,227
We shouldn't mix up the seating arrangement...

1473
01:07:00,228 --> 01:07:01,228
- too obviously. - Right.

1474
01:07:01,229 --> 01:07:03,109
(Sang Won and Ye Eun don't look at each other.)

1475
01:07:03,138 --> 01:07:06,467
(So Hyun passes by Sang Hyeon.)

1476
01:07:06,468 --> 01:07:10,478
(Bon Hee sits next to Mu Jin.)

1477
01:07:17,218 --> 01:07:20,417
Ye Eun and Ji Won are facing each other now.

1478
01:07:20,418 --> 01:07:21,647
Oh, dear.

1479
01:07:21,648 --> 01:07:23,317
Ye Eun cried so much...

1480
01:07:23,318 --> 01:07:24,557
that her face is all swollen.

1481
01:07:24,558 --> 01:07:26,238
(Before the game, there's subtle tension.)

1482
01:07:27,128 --> 01:07:28,898
Goodness, it's the last night.

1483
01:07:28,928 --> 01:07:30,797
That's how they met on the first day.

1484
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:32,827
And this is now their last night there.

1485
01:07:32,828 --> 01:07:35,737
"Choose a person freely and ask each other a question."

1486
01:07:35,738 --> 01:07:38,098
(Each person will choose a question and choose who to ask.)

1487
01:07:40,068 --> 01:07:41,307
There are questions in that box,

1488
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:42,537
but they don't know who wrote that, right?

1489
01:07:42,538 --> 01:07:43,984
(Sang Won is the first one to choose a question.)

1490
01:07:44,008 --> 01:07:46,147
Are they supposed to just read the question...

1491
01:07:46,148 --> 01:07:47,747
- and answer? - Yes.

1492
01:07:47,748 --> 01:07:49,578
(He doesn’t know who sent the question.)

1493
01:07:50,418 --> 01:07:55,218
(Who will Sang Won ask the question to?)

1494
01:07:57,488 --> 01:07:58,488
Bon Hee.

1495
01:07:59,928 --> 01:08:01,127
I shouldn't have locked eyes.

1496
01:08:01,128 --> 01:08:02,628
(What's the question for Bon Hee?)

1497
01:08:03,598 --> 01:08:05,498
"Between someone who has the same..."

1498
01:08:05,598 --> 01:08:07,098
"or the opposite disposition as you,"

1499
01:08:07,198 --> 01:08:08,738
"who are you more drawn to?"

1500
01:08:09,298 --> 01:08:10,937
Oh, nice question.

1501
01:08:10,938 --> 01:08:12,507
(Between someone who has the same or the opposite disposition as you, )

1502
01:08:12,508 --> 01:08:13,967
(who are you more drawn to?)

1503
01:08:13,968 --> 01:08:15,528
I think Sang Hyeon asked this question.

1504
01:08:16,438 --> 01:08:18,338
- It sounds like Sang Hyeon, right? - Yes.

1505
01:08:19,548 --> 01:08:22,117
(Bon Hee's answer is...)

1506
01:08:22,118 --> 01:08:23,178
The same disposition.

1507
01:08:24,478 --> 01:08:26,318
She said the same disposition.

1508
01:08:26,718 --> 01:08:29,557
But we don't know who the person with the same disposition is.

1509
01:08:29,558 --> 01:08:32,278
(Bon Hee is more drawn to someone with the same disposition as her.)

1510
01:08:33,888 --> 01:08:38,158
(Yeong Gyeong chose a question.)

1511
01:08:41,698 --> 01:08:44,637
So, I want to ask So Hyun.

1512
01:08:44,638 --> 01:08:45,638
Yes?

1513
01:08:45,768 --> 01:08:47,968
"Is there a moment you want to take back?"

1514
01:08:48,508 --> 01:08:51,377
- Oh, a moment I want to take back? - Yes.

1515
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:53,607
(Is there a moment you want to take back?)

1516
01:08:53,608 --> 01:08:55,448
A moment I want to take back...

1517
01:08:56,918 --> 01:08:57,947
(So Hyun, who feels confused...)

1518
01:08:57,948 --> 01:09:00,118
Who would've asked that kind of question?

1519
01:09:00,418 --> 01:09:03,458
"A moment you want to take back." Is there a relationship...

1520
01:09:03,558 --> 01:09:05,527
that might make someone ask this kind of question?

1521
01:09:05,528 --> 01:09:07,648
(Is there a moment that she might want to turn back?)

1522
01:09:08,128 --> 01:09:09,897
(Curious)

1523
01:09:09,898 --> 01:09:10,898
What will she say?

1524
01:09:11,558 --> 01:09:12,718
Was there a moment like that?

1525
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:13,898
No.

1526
01:09:14,368 --> 01:09:17,398
In every moment, I think I just made choices...

1527
01:09:18,038 --> 01:09:21,108
that my heart led me to.

1528
01:09:21,868 --> 01:09:22,878
Yes.

1529
01:09:23,938 --> 01:09:25,748
I don't have any moments I want to take back.

1530
01:09:26,778 --> 01:09:28,918
Right, she always behaved the same way.

1531
01:09:29,378 --> 01:09:31,018
And she behaved like a consistent person.

1532
01:09:31,248 --> 01:09:35,187
I think my desire to choose Sang Hyeon...

1533
01:09:35,188 --> 01:09:37,518
never changed and stayed the same the whole time.

1534
01:09:39,358 --> 01:09:43,398
(So Hyun was attracted to Sang Hyeon from his first impression.)

1535
01:09:44,128 --> 01:09:47,197
(After that, it has always been Sang Hyeon, )

1536
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:49,737
(and she expressed herself honestly.)

1537
01:09:49,738 --> 01:09:52,268
(and she expressed herself honestly.)

1538
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:54,667
(So Hyun doesn't regret her decision.)

1539
01:09:54,668 --> 01:09:58,007
So, for So Hyun, it has always been Sang Hyeon, right?

1540
01:09:58,008 --> 01:09:59,808
(So Hyun doesn't regret her decision.)

1541
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:04,947
(This time, Ji Won chose a question.)

1542
01:10:04,948 --> 01:10:06,018
What is it?

1543
01:10:06,448 --> 01:10:08,718
Gosh, this is hard.

1544
01:10:09,418 --> 01:10:11,518
- Is it Ye Eun's question? - No way.

1545
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,557
Sang Hyeon.

1546
01:10:13,558 --> 01:10:16,328
(Ji Won chose to ask Sang Hyeon.)

1547
01:10:17,128 --> 01:10:19,397
- The question must be hard. - I guess so.

1548
01:10:19,398 --> 01:10:23,397
"Did you change your mind after today's date?"

1549
01:10:23,398 --> 01:10:25,167
(Did you change your mind after today's date?)

1550
01:10:25,168 --> 01:10:26,308
Did I change my mind?

1551
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:32,948
I clearly knew from today's conversation.

1552
01:10:33,748 --> 01:10:36,517
From what I felt, the person with similar vibes as me...

1553
01:10:36,518 --> 01:10:37,678
was Bon Hee.

1554
01:10:38,478 --> 01:10:41,348
And the one who's the complete opposite with bubbly personality...

1555
01:10:41,448 --> 01:10:42,717
was So Hyun.

1556
01:10:42,718 --> 01:10:44,558
(So Hyun has a different disposition from me.)

1557
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:49,857
(After going on dates with two contrasting people, )

1558
01:10:49,858 --> 01:10:52,367
(have you changed your mind?)

1559
01:10:52,368 --> 01:10:53,898
What is it? What will he say?

1560
01:10:53,998 --> 01:10:55,028
- Yes. - What?

1561
01:10:57,298 --> 01:10:58,537
He changed his mind?

1562
01:10:58,538 --> 01:11:03,208
(After today's date, Sang Hyeon's mind has changed.)

1563
01:11:03,378 --> 01:11:04,378
But look.

1564
01:11:04,379 --> 01:11:06,224
No one knows where his heart was before and after.

1565
01:11:06,248 --> 01:11:08,507
Since he expressed his attraction to both,

1566
01:11:08,508 --> 01:11:09,717
there's no way for us to know.

1567
01:11:09,718 --> 01:11:11,478
(So curious)

1568
01:11:12,448 --> 01:11:13,488
Yes.

1569
01:11:15,318 --> 01:11:18,057
(After today's date, Sang Hyeon's mind has changed.)

1570
01:11:18,058 --> 01:11:20,828
(After today's date, Sang Hyeon's mind has changed.)

1571
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:23,334
Why does Mu Jin look so taken aback?

1572
01:11:23,358 --> 01:11:24,358
- Of course, he would be. - Right.

1573
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:26,199
He doesn't know who he chose before and after.

1574
01:11:31,868 --> 01:11:35,238
From the actions and words that he showed me,

1575
01:11:35,338 --> 01:11:38,638
I thought his heart was pointing in my direction.

1576
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:41,947
But when he said that he had changed his mind...

1577
01:11:41,948 --> 01:11:44,668
- She thinks it might not be her. - "Did he really change his mind?"

1578
01:11:45,648 --> 01:11:47,017
"Did he have a change of heart?"

1579
01:11:47,018 --> 01:11:48,818
After going on a date with someone else...

1580
01:11:50,688 --> 01:11:53,228
The date with Bon Hee left...

1581
01:11:54,358 --> 01:11:56,498
a deeper impression than I thought.

1582
01:11:57,128 --> 01:11:58,428
That was actually...

1583
01:11:59,128 --> 01:12:02,598
what made me really go back and forth.

1584
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:04,937
What choice will I make?

1585
01:12:04,938 --> 01:12:07,607
I honestly don't really know either.

1586
01:12:07,608 --> 01:12:08,708
Oh, what is this?

1587
01:12:10,138 --> 01:12:12,898
(Sang Hyeon's heart is wavering the night before the final decision.)

1588
01:12:13,278 --> 01:12:16,978
(On the last night at Yeon House, the end is a mystery.)

1589
01:12:17,948 --> 01:12:18,948
(Ji Yung is the last one to ask a question.)

1590
01:12:18,949 --> 01:12:23,188
I want to ask this question to everyone.

1591
01:12:24,118 --> 01:12:25,758
"On the last day,"

1592
01:12:25,858 --> 01:12:28,828
- "was coming here a good choice?" - Was it a good choice?

1593
01:12:29,228 --> 01:12:30,228
That's a good question.

1594
01:12:30,228 --> 01:12:31,228
"Do you have any regrets?"

1595
01:12:31,229 --> 01:12:32,667
(A question for everyone)

1596
01:12:32,668 --> 01:12:34,097
(Was coming here a good choice? Do you have any regrets?)

1597
01:12:34,098 --> 01:12:35,168
Regrets?

1598
01:12:36,068 --> 01:12:37,598
- I'm curious about Ye Eun. - Regrets?

1599
01:12:39,068 --> 01:12:40,838
First of all, I think...

1600
01:12:46,048 --> 01:12:48,108
I definitely don't have any regrets.

1601
01:12:48,578 --> 01:12:50,548
I rather think it was good for me to come.

1602
01:12:51,818 --> 01:12:53,848
It was so nice to be here. Really.

1603
01:12:55,618 --> 01:12:58,617
Out of all of the decisions I've made this year,

1604
01:12:58,618 --> 01:13:02,158
I think this was the best decision.

1605
01:13:02,258 --> 01:13:04,457
- I'm glad to hear that. - So, I have zero regrets.

1606
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:05,827
Gosh, I'm so glad.

1607
01:13:05,828 --> 01:13:08,928
I didn't know I'd become so invested in this.

1608
01:13:10,798 --> 01:13:11,868
It was nice.

1609
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:14,438
Yes, it was nice.

1610
01:13:15,568 --> 01:13:17,377
I think I felt many emotions...

1611
01:13:17,378 --> 01:13:18,638
that I normally don't feel.

1612
01:13:18,738 --> 01:13:20,408
Just person to person,

1613
01:13:21,308 --> 01:13:23,248
I'm leaving this place with lots of stimulation.

1614
01:13:23,348 --> 01:13:24,818
"Person to person."

1615
01:13:24,918 --> 01:13:28,788
I took the time to think about a lot today.

1616
01:13:29,358 --> 01:13:32,627
I'm someone who takes responsibility for my decisions,

1617
01:13:32,628 --> 01:13:34,927
- so I don't have any regrets. - That's cool.

1618
01:13:34,928 --> 01:13:38,457
Now, I want to do my best until I leave.

1619
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:40,368
(Now, I want to do my best until I leave.)

1620
01:13:41,698 --> 01:13:42,768
Actually,

1621
01:13:44,038 --> 01:13:47,208
there were moments I might have regretted.

1622
01:13:47,808 --> 01:13:49,108
But now that it's the last day,

1623
01:13:51,108 --> 01:13:52,478
I don't want to go home...

1624
01:13:53,078 --> 01:13:54,378
and want to keep living here.

1625
01:13:55,108 --> 01:13:56,848
That's how nice it was.

1626
01:13:57,578 --> 01:13:58,648
Thank you all so much.

1627
01:14:01,818 --> 01:14:03,857
I do have regrets.

1628
01:14:03,858 --> 01:14:05,987
I think I'm full of regrets,

1629
01:14:05,988 --> 01:14:08,027
- He has regrets. - but when I look back,

1630
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:10,028
those regretful decisions were also part of me.

1631
01:14:10,898 --> 01:14:12,027
When I look back on this later,

1632
01:14:12,028 --> 01:14:14,467
I think I'll be able to go forward...

1633
01:14:14,468 --> 01:14:16,167
thinking that I shouldn't repeat the same mistakes.

1634
01:14:16,168 --> 01:14:18,897
- Wouldn't that be about Bon Hee? - So, I think...

1635
01:14:18,898 --> 01:14:20,237
- I think you're right. - I do have regrets,

1636
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:21,937
- Don't you think so? - but it was very good that I came.

1637
01:14:21,938 --> 01:14:23,018
I think it's about Bon Hee.

1638
01:14:23,438 --> 01:14:24,438
That's what I think.

1639
01:14:24,439 --> 01:14:26,278
How could I not have regrets? I'm human.

1640
01:14:27,008 --> 01:14:28,847
- That's honest. - It's cool.

1641
01:14:28,848 --> 01:14:29,918
So honest.

1642
01:14:31,948 --> 01:14:34,117
I think I'm leaving...

1643
01:14:34,118 --> 01:14:38,157
with such great memories,

1644
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:40,358
and I got to meet so many great people.

1645
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:45,058
I hope that our connection continues in the future too.

1646
01:14:48,468 --> 01:14:49,867
Gosh, what is this? What will happen?

1647
01:14:49,868 --> 01:14:51,097
How will this go?

1648
01:14:51,098 --> 01:14:52,438
(Will So Hyun's hopes come true?)

1649
01:14:56,178 --> 01:15:00,408
(The Truth Game that left everyone more confused is over.)

1650
01:15:00,878 --> 01:15:01,907
(I'm curious about something.)

1651
01:15:01,908 --> 01:15:02,918
(What is it?)

1652
01:15:03,118 --> 01:15:07,218
(For Sang Hyeon, I'm obviously his choice when we meet and talk.)

1653
01:15:08,088 --> 01:15:11,157
(I just don't get who he's considering other than me.)

1654
01:15:11,158 --> 01:15:12,158
(There isn't anyone else.)

1655
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:13,719
(Why would he say something like that?)

1656
01:15:13,888 --> 01:15:15,798
(On the day before the final decision?)

1657
01:15:15,898 --> 01:15:17,858
I am going to ask tomorrow, though.

1658
01:15:18,828 --> 01:15:22,328
(I feel like Sang Hyeon and I aren't a match, and he won't choose me.)

1659
01:15:25,038 --> 01:15:29,308
(Yeon House has gotten more complicated since the Truth Game.)

1660
01:15:31,408 --> 01:15:34,708
(Finally, the day of the Final Decision has arrived.)

1661
01:15:35,148 --> 01:15:37,218
(It's finally today.)

1662
01:15:37,318 --> 01:15:39,548
(I'm still really confused.)

1663
01:15:39,648 --> 01:15:42,518
(I hope my decision doesn't hurt anyone.)

1664
01:15:42,618 --> 01:15:46,028
(I want to get to know more about her outside of Yeon House.)

1665
01:15:47,028 --> 01:15:49,927
(By putting their photo in the drawer, )

1666
01:15:49,928 --> 01:15:53,868
(choose the final person your heart points to.)

1667
01:15:54,298 --> 01:15:55,698
(I have no regrets.)

1668
01:15:55,798 --> 01:15:58,838
(Scan your Love QR Code to check your final match.)

1669
01:16:00,038 --> 01:16:04,338
(Checking their last Love QR Code with nervous hearts)

1670
01:16:05,908 --> 01:16:08,507
(Is this possible?)

1671
01:16:08,508 --> 01:16:09,778
(Will this work?)

1672
01:16:10,548 --> 01:16:12,518
(It wasn't something I had ever imagined.)

1673
01:16:13,288 --> 01:16:14,948
(I think I was surprised.)

1674
01:16:15,588 --> 01:16:19,427
(I knew it was the final decision, but I was very surprised.)

1675
01:16:19,428 --> 01:16:20,787
(If you want to keep seeing each other, pick a time and place...)

1676
01:16:20,788 --> 01:16:24,328
(The final decision will be fixed after 7 days!)

1677
01:16:25,158 --> 01:16:29,127
(After going back to reality and spending a week, )

1678
01:16:29,128 --> 01:16:33,068
(if you meet again, you will become a final couple.)

1679
01:16:33,568 --> 01:16:36,077
(If I go back to my own life for 7 days, )

1680
01:16:36,078 --> 01:16:37,998
(could the feelings that I had at Yeon House...)

1681
01:16:38,238 --> 01:16:39,708
(end up changing?)

1682
01:16:39,878 --> 01:16:43,377
(No one can be sure about the decision in 7 days.)

1683
01:16:43,378 --> 01:16:46,888
(No one can be sure about the decision in 7 days.)

1684
01:16:47,848 --> 01:16:50,357
(After 7 days in reality go by, )

1685
01:16:50,358 --> 01:16:52,828
(After 7 days in reality go by, )

1686
01:16:53,858 --> 01:16:56,627
(will they be able to meet...)

1687
01:16:56,628 --> 01:16:59,897
(at the time and place they promised to?)

1688
01:16:59,898 --> 01:17:02,638
(at the time and place they promised to?)
