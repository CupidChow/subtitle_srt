1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,150
(A new older woman has appeared in Yeon House.)

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,790
(Go So Hyun, the fifth older woman)

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,200
(I've never seen anyone like her in my life before.)

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,790
(She's a beauty.)

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,069
(I'm really curious.)

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,700
(She's on another level.)

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,509
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,610
(A new older woman who will bring change to Yeon House has appeared.)

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,980
(Can we talk for a bit?)

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,879
(Ye Eun suddenly asked to talk to Sang Won.)

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,920
(I went on a date with Mu Jin.)

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,420
(But you popped into my head.)

13
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,819
(You seemed bored...)

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,359
(during our date.)

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,360
(Me?)

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,366
(I had so much fun during our date yesterday.)

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,529
(You'll notice it more when we're alone together, )

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,730
(but we don't really connect.)

19
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,100
(Choose who you go after wisely.)

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,069
(It's become a bigger mess.)

21
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,579
(I have a lot on my mind now.)

22
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,779
(I've always been interested...)

23
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,910
(in Bon Hee since the beginning.)

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,020
(But Mu Jin and Bon Hee seem inseparable.)

25
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,059
(If the two are already close, )

26
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,130
(I can't go on a date with her.)

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,589
- That's unfair. - It's fine.

28
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,399
(Even if we're close, it's a fair competition.)

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,970
(I'm only thinking about my feelings.)

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:30,110
(The younger men are starting to show their true feelings.)

31
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,980
(And that night, the Secret Room opened.)

32
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,350
(Bon Hee received the most Love QR Codes.)

33
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,079
(Bon Hee, who was curious about...)

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,750
(Mu Jin on her first Secret Room visit, )

35
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,119
(wanted to know about...)

36
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,560
(Sang Hyeon this time.)

37
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,460
(Who does Bon Hee have feelings for now?)

38
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,959
Invisible sparks of emotion...

39
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,870
- are going off everywhere. - Yes.

40
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,099
- Sang Hyeon truly shocked me. - It's getting wild.

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,739
How could he say that in front of Mu Jin?

42
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,110
- He provoked Mu Jin. - Gosh.

43
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,909
It's as if we should set up a boxing ring.

44
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,339
- Things feel hostile. - Right?

45
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,020
- There's an invisible boxing ring. - Yes.

46
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,479
Here's what made me proud.

47
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,680
I thought Sang Hyeon was quiet and calm.

48
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,849
But his charms are working.

49
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,349
- Are they? - Yes. It seems like...

50
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,189
So Hyun has become...

51
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,260
interested in him after Yeong Gyeong.

52
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,890
If he manages to win his way into Bon Hee's heart,

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,259
I have a feeling he can do something with the three women.

54
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,030
- Do what? - Did I go too far?

55
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,129
No.

56
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,570
No, it was fine.

57
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,940
Yeon House. I love it.

58
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,339
(Sang Hyeon is out on the terrace?)

59
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,550
Why is he on the terrace?

60
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,479
To work out.

61
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,120
(Starting his day with a morning workout)

62
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,949
(From working on his lower body with squats first...)

63
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,390
(to a full-body exercise)

64
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,499
(Sang Hyeon starts the day with determination...)

65
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,400
(by working out in the morning.)

66
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,230
- Is that Sang Hyeon? - Yes.

67
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,970
- His style has changed. - Right?

68
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,339
"Male participants, please head over..."

69
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,640
"to enjoy breakfast."

70
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,209
Only the men?

71
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,779
(Touching with care)

72
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,790
(Excited, the younger men get ready eagerly.)

73
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,619
(Meanwhile, the older women are still in bed.)

74
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,090
The younger men generally get up early.

75
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,529
(Things have become awkward...)

76
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,930
(between Sang Hyeon and Mu Jin since their chat last night.)

77
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,970
(Moving it without any reason)

78
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,539
Let's go.

79
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,339
(Putting the awkwardness behind them, )

80
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,980
(the men are off to the breakfast spot.)

81
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,589
- What are we doing today? - I'd like to know.

82
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,890
(What kind of breakfast is waiting for the younger men?)

83
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,060
(Because of yesterday, Sang Hyeon's mind is a mess.)

84
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,459
Ji Yung,

85
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,360
- Yes? - are you all in on Yeong Gyeong?

86
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,660
Not all in.

87
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,830
But I've only ever talked to Bon Hee for two days straight.

88
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,770
It'd be nice to have a talk with Yeong Gyeong.

89
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,840
- I thought you'd be... - Yes?

90
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,040
Interested in So Hyun.

91
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,449
- Same here. - So Hyun?

92
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,609
- Yes. - Right.

93
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,520
I was actually taken aback yesterday.

94
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,979
Because she's your type?

95
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,980
I like women who have...

96
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:29,989
- simple features. - Exactly.

97
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,470
- And she gives off that vibe. - Yes.

98
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,760
(Ji Yung felt a strong attraction to So Hyun's appearance.)

99
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,000
- My ideal type... - Yes?

100
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,529
Is similar to the other three.

101
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,629
We're attracted...

102
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,030
- to our first impression. - Right.

103
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,909
It didn't seem like that was the case for you and Sang Won.

104
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,739
But I think that makes it harder. You have a lot more to think about.

105
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,539
- I do have an ideal type. - You do?

106
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,449
The first person I was attracted to was Bon Hee.

107
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,009
- Appearance-wise? - Yes, appearance-wise.

108
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,819
It made me want to talk to her.

109
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,420
He's not hiding it anymore.

110
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,419
But from the beginning,

111
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,260
her votes naturally went to Mu Jin.

112
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,459
He kept getting chances,

113
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,230
which led to the two developing feelings for each other.

114
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,599
I still waited, hoping we'd get...

115
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,200
a chance to go on a date.

116
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,769
So he waited.

117
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,000
(I see.)

118
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,439
But if the two are inseparable...

119
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,440
(But if the two are inseparable...)

120
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,509
It doesn't matter.

121
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,710
If you like her and want to talk to her, why not do it?

122
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,679
I've talked to Bon Hee.

123
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,920
We had a private chat late in the night.

124
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,620
- You asked to talk? - Yes.

125
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,260
I asked if we could talk for a bit, and we did.

126
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,259
"I am interested in you, and I want to talk to you."

127
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,529
"I want to go on a date with you, but I don't have the chance,"

128
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,250
- You told her that? - "which is a bummer."

129
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,930
(Impressed)

130
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,340
I'm sure she knows.

131
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,740
But not giving me a chance, despite knowing it,

132
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,439
would be her way of expressing her feelings, no?

133
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,680
That's what I think.

134
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,379
- So she has someone else in mind? - Yes.

135
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,910
No answer is also an answer.

136
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,780
That is also...

137
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,620
It's really tough.

138
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,619
What will Sang Hyeon do?

139
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,500
(Sang Hyeon is waiting for Bon Hee to respond.)

140
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,059
This also crosses my mind.

141
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,630
After hearing about our ages...

142
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,830
If Mu Jin turns out to be much younger than me...

143
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,969
- He did say the gap is bigger. - You'd get...

144
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,139
- a chance? - I do think there might be...

145
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,470
a chance for me.

146
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,440
He's certain that Mu Jin...

147
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,640
is younger than him.

148
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,179
But Sang Hyeon is hoping Mu Jin is way younger than him.

149
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,450
- Only then would Bon Hee... - Right.

150
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,449
- feel a bit more burdened. - Listen.

151
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,089
Here's what I find funny.

152
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,159
Sang Hyeon thinks Bon Hee...

153
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,530
might lose interest in him if the age gap is big.

154
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,059
But why does he think that?

155
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,959
- That's a stereotype. - Yes.

156
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,699
- Rather... - It's a prejudice.

157
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,770
Why can't he think that it might act as a booster?

158
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,100
(That's possible.)

159
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,409
The age gap could be 11...

160
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,740
- or 13 years. - That could happen.

161
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,509
(Thinking)

162
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,009
I'm curious.

163
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,510
- Once we disclose our ages, - Yes?

164
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,879
Would our feelings waver?

165
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,019
I think so, for sure.

166
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,619
- Really? - Everyone would waver.

167
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,890
I'd be fine with it.

168
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,220
Unless the age gap is too big,

169
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,030
- it'd be the same. - What about a ten-year age gap?

170
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,300
I'm okay with a bigger gap.

171
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,260
But I think the others would...

172
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,369
- Hesitate? - hesitate,

173
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,600
if I'm being honest.

174
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,299
"He's way younger than I expected."

175
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,370
Way younger? I get it.

176
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,970
If that crosses their minds,

177
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,539
there will be a change.

178
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,540
You're right.

179
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,021
- Of course, things would change. - Once they know their ages.

180
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,020
(How will the ages affect each other?)

181
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,419
By the way, where are they heading to?

182
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,690
(The younger men have arrived at the date spot.)

183
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,100
- There's a creek. - A group breakfast.

184
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,829
- A creek right next to us. - Had I known,

185
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,899
I'd have brought my swimsuit.

186
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,340
(A breakfast spot next to the creek)

187
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,269
- There's one more chair. - Right.

188
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,600
(5 younger men but 6 chairs)

189
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,810
It'd be hilarious if another guy shows up.

190
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,639
- We'd have to brother it up. - Yes.

191
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,139
Jump into the water as a group...

192
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,716
- with our arms around each other. - Nice.

193
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,150
So six guys?

194
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,850
- I can't cook anymore. - That's too many people.

195
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,679
Too many.

196
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,190
(Who will take the remaining seat?)

197
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,889
It's So Hyun.

198
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,730
(So Hyun, the fifth older woman, has arrived.)

199
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,059
Here she comes.

200
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,329
- Right. She needs a chance. - She's here.

201
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,830
(Who?)

202
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,970
Hi.

203
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,839
- Yes. - Right.

204
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,370
So Hyun needs to be given a chance.

205
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,970
Should we get up?

206
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,109
- Hi. - Hi.

207
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,179
(Getting up automatically)

208
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,710
- Hi. - Good morning.

209
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,820
(Smiling)

210
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,319
What a great morning.

211
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,449
- Yes, good morning. - Good morning.

212
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,189
- Take a seat. - We're having breakfast, right?

213
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,190
Sorry?

214
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,190
(Glancing)

215
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,860
(The younger men who couldn't greet her because they joined in later)

216
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,569
- Yes. - Totally.

217
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,139
(A 5-to-1 breakfast date for So Hyun)

218
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,899
I rarely felt jealous of a junior.

219
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,010
Are you jealous right now?

220
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,480
Honestly, I'm quite jealous today.

221
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,410
Why not join in next season?

222
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,209
I've already talked to the production team.

223
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,379
- Really? - I asked them to make a show...

224
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,220
for those over mid-40.

225
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,849
How about "EXchange?"

226
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,020
(Woo Young's recommendation)

227
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,520
(Losing it)

228
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,189
- "EXchange?" - Yes.

229
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,190
With whom?
I wouldn't know.

230
00:09:37,191 --> 00:09:38,289
(It's up to you.)

231
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,400
Hye Jin, that is what we're truly curious about.

232
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,199
(Keep a poker face.)

233
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,520
Turn the camera off for a minute.

234
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,969
(Turn the camera off for a minute!)

235
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,570
(- You little... - I'm joking, Hye Jin.)

236
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,070
(I shouldn't be laughing.)

237
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,809
- I heard this was the benefit. - Good.

238
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,310
- This? - So it's a benefit.

239
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,649
It must make you happy.

240
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,109
Of course. When will I ever get a chance...

241
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,550
to go on a date with five guys at the same time?

242
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,249
What's more, we're all younger than you.

243
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,290
Exactly.

244
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,459
- She's right. - Totally.

245
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,760
- Nice. - I'm a queen.

246
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,390
- We'll treat you really well today. - Thank you.

247
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,829
Don't do a thing. We'll help...

248
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,059
- We'll do everything. - debone the food.

249
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,099
Gosh.

250
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,170
(Feeling grateful)

251
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,099
(Out of the 5 younger men, )

252
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,869
(who does So Hyun want to know about the most?)

253
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,440
I'm dead curious.

254
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,140
Who I wanted to know about...

255
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,650
was Sang Hyeon.

256
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,220
The way he talks...

257
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,449
is nice.

258
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,210
(So Hyun sent a Love QR Code to Sang Hyeon.)

259
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,659
I wanted to talk to Sang Hyeon...

260
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,190
as soon as possible.

261
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,299
(Sang Hyeon is clueless about So Hyun's feelings.)

262
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,329
- Hi. - Hi.

263
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,370
(Is the food here?)

264
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,800
It looks good.

265
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,399
Here you go.

266
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,269
The food looks delicious.

267
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,140
- Chicken soup is a must. - Yes.

268
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,940
Please dig in.

269
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,240
- Bon appetit. - Bon appetit.

270
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,610
- Go ahead. - Okay, I'll try the soup first.

271
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,090
(Nodding aggressively)

272
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,719
- It's really good. - Is it?

273
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Yes.

274
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,559
- Do you have a hobby? - What?

275
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,160
A hobby. What do you do on your day off?

276
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,590
- My hobby? - Yes.

277
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,460
I think I was asked the same question yesterday.

278
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,069
- You were. - Right?

279
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,099
(Sang Won asked the same question.)

280
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,669
- My hobby. - I was given a chance...

281
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,040
to greet So Hyun first.

282
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,750
But it's true that I couldn't chat...

283
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,010
as much as I wanted.

284
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,809
(Last night, when he first met So Hyun)

285
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,909
Working out...

286
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,070
Do you like Japanese cuisine?

287
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,420
(Impatient, Sang Won bombarded So Hyun with questions.)

288
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,490
Disappointed,

289
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,560
I decided to change my attitude.

290
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,129
I'm going to get to know people I'm interested in with enthusiasm.

291
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,029
With that, I was determined to get to know So Hyun the next day.

292
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,270
(Sang Won made up his mind to get to know So Hyun.)

293
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,840
My hobby.

294
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,369
I like watching movies at home...

295
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,510
and visiting exhibitions.

296
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,109
Exercising.

297
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,679
- Yes, exercising as well. - It's a hobby.

298
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,809
- He's showing off. - He answered for you.

299
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,550
(Feeling proud for some reason)

300
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,010
(Glancing)

301
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:13,980
Tell me about your hobbies.

302
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,820
I like working out and golfing.

303
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,490
So you golf.

304
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,890
For me, golf is quite hard.

305
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,559
Personally, I think...

306
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,359
golf is a lot harder to pick up than tennis.

307
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,960
- Yes. - It's a static sport.

308
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,130
Finding the fun in it takes a long time.

309
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,529
- When did you start? - What?

310
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,670
When did you start?

311
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,999
- It seems like. - Two years ago?

312
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,069
Two years?

313
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,240
(That's not long.)

314
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,939
I like traveling.

315
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,579
I often go on a one-day trip.

316
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,156
(The two guys react immediately to So Hyun.)

317
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,820
(Swatting)

318
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,650
- If I suddenly feel like it, - Yes?

319
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,989
I just get up and go on a trip.

320
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,190
I'm jealous of his spirit.

321
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,490
It's only possible if one has a driving force.

322
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,760
I'm jealous.

323
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,359
As for me, I don't have one.

324
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,569
My hobbies are quite ambiguous.

325
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,700
(Moving forward)

326
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,009
(Interested and focused)

327
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,510
I read a bit...

328
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,410
or go to coffee shops alone to take care of some things.

329
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,849
I also play games. Those are my hobbies.

330
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,409
- Games? - Yes, I like gaming.

331
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,449
Like what?

332
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,019
(Her eyes are fixed.)

333
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,289
Online games I can play with my friends.

334
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,920
- Computer games? - Yes.

335
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,089
Now that we've grown older, my friends have become busy,

336
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,630
and we can't meet up. We also live in different places.

337
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,029
That's why we gather through games.

338
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,099
- Is that so? - Yes, we meet online.

339
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,929
And gathering online is nice.

340
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,070
(Nodding aggressively)

341
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,700
You've got several hobbies.

342
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,110
Like a variety of hobbies. They may be static,

343
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,710
- True. - but hobbies are still hobbies.

344
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,940
(Glancing)

345
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,419
- What's your ideal physical type? - What?

346
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,919
What's your ideal physical type?

347
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,449
My ideal physical type?

348
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,520
Ideal physical type.

349
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,150
(Curious)

350
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,019
Here's what I realized.

351
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,720
You know when a couple goes on a date,

352
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,929
the guy puts his arm around the woman's shoulders,

353
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,299
and the woman wraps her arm around his waist...

354
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,829
while walking?

355
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,470
That's a dream for models.

356
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,070
- Since models are tall. - When that happens,

357
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,769
I hope the guy is tall enough so that...

358
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,290
- I don't have to hunch over. - You want him to be tall enough?

359
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,179
Did it look nice?

360
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,009
No, it was too uncomfortable for me.

361
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,080
It was uncomfortable?

362
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,119
- It's from experience. - Yes.

363
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,219
- Like this. - You went through it.

364
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,780
- Because you have to hunch over? - You become disproportionate.

365
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,290
We always have to hunch over.

366
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,089
(Realizing it)

367
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,130
For real.

368
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,860
- To think there's such a hassle. - It's truly uncomfortable.

369
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,529
That's why when I date someone smaller than me...

370
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,140
Here's how I usually walk.

371
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,410
(She's really tall.)

372
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,109
If I have to walk side by side with a smaller boyfriend,

373
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,039
worried he might feel intimidated by my height...

374
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,780
(Hunching over)

375
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,750
- I see. - You get it, right?

376
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,120
This is what you call true love.

377
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,190
That is the very reason my back is a mess now.

378
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,560
It helped me realize...

379
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,999
how nice it would be if our heights...

380
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,730
had a good distance.

381
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,829
- Did you say you were 168cm tall? - Yes, I'm 168cm tall.

382
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,469
How tall are you guys?

383
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,839
- I remember you being 188cm. - He's 188cm.

384
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,940
Correct.

385
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,039
- I'm 181cm tall. - You're 181cm.

386
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,679
- Everyone is tall. - Sang Hyeon is...

387
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
All the guys are tall.

388
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:29,509
- I'm a little short of 190cm. - You're not 190cm?

389
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,709
- A little short of 190cm. - Why are you so tall?

390
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,849
(Busted)

391
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,919
- You're lying, aren't you? - He's a tiny bit short of it.

392
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,379
- Just a tiny bit. - So you're a little short of 190cm.

393
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,519
Actually, a little short of 180cm.

394
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,889
(Confessing)

395
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,619
- We're all similar in height. - Yes, it seems like it.

396
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,460
I'm a little short of 170cm myself.

397
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,730
There's that meme.

398
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,029
The meme about whole chicken soup and Buldak instant noodles.

399
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,099
- What is that? - A meme?

400
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,670
A meme about your partner.

401
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,609
Someone who's stable yet less proactive,

402
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,209
- I didn't know about it. - while Buldak...

403
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,209
is someone who's unstable yet very proactive.

404
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,079
People had different values.

405
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,440
(Whole chicken soup versus Buldak)

406
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,380
- Who do you prefer? - Me?

407
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,750
Whole chicken soup.

408
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,949
(Exclaiming)

409
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,720
Really? I thought it'd be Buldak.

410
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,190
I think my proactivity is more than enough.

411
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,860
What's more, I've dated men who were proactive,

412
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,100
but those who were stable were better.

413
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,170
(I got it.)

414
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,669
Whole chicken soup all the way.

415
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,770
(Thinking)

416
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,980
I like someone who's proactive.

417
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,150
I'm someone who's a whole chicken soup.

418
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,030
- A full whole chicken soup. - I'm more of a...

419
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,419
It'd be nice to learn such a side from my partner.

420
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,189
Getting along well together feels great.

421
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,706
(Getting along with someone opposite feels great.)

422
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,900
I can provide the stability, you know?

423
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,000
Something like that.

424
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,300
Talking about whole chicken soup while eating whole chicken soup.

425
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,779
Whole chicken soup versus Buldak.

426
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,879
They played a balance game.

427
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,079
It must be a trend among millennials and Gen Z.

428
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,479
I choose whole chicken soup.

429
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,519
(Woo Young's choice)

430
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,820
- Whole chicken soup. - Yes.

431
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,990
Well, Buldak...

432
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,619
Have you been hurt by Buldak?

433
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,290
Ultimately, Buldak isn't good for your body.

434
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,289
- True. - Is it from experience?

435
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,900
Spiciness that's too provocative...

436
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,900
hurts your gut.

437
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,870
So you've met a woman who hurt your gut.

438
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,400
As for me,

439
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,469
boredom is my least favorite in the world.

440
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,470
He's certainly young.

441
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,239
- So, I prefer Buldak far more. - Right.

442
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
- Far more? - Yes.

443
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:46,049
Can you be straightforward like him?

444
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,219
- You keep beating around the bush. - He says his gut hurt.

445
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,650
Tell me about it.

446
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,189
- I also want whole chicken soup. - Really?

447
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,760
Dating a Buldak-like guy...

448
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,390
hurts my body and soul.

449
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,760
See? It hurts.

450
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,230
You've also been to the hospital.

451
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,830
No, I don't want whole chicken soup.

452
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,259
- Seriously? - You'd choose Buldak?

453
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,469
We're not talking about marriage here.

454
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,829
It's about dating. Why would you want chicken soup?

455
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,299
So, it's whole chicken soup if you had to marry him?

456
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,040
I still don't think I could marry a guy who's like chicken soup.

457
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,009
I just want to live a flamboyant life and leave.

458
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,140
- Okay. - It's boring.

459
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,549
You date people because you want to have fun.

460
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,650
So, have you always dated Buldak-like guys?

461
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,820
Mostly.

462
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,750
(Admiring)

463
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,759
(Meanwhile, in Yeon House where only older women are left)

464
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,129
- Knock, knock. - Knock, knock.

465
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,189
We're here to see you, Ye Eun.

466
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,129
- Hey. - Hi.

467
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,930
Let me watch you do your hair.

468
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,670
I'm not good at it, so I just do it.

469
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,070
Do you want me to help you?

470
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,140
Were you chosen last night?

471
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,410
- I did get one vote. - Good for you.

472
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,449
I got zero.

473
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,250
I'm not doing so well either.

474
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,219
Right. Ye Eun picked Sang Won the night before,

475
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,049
- but Sang Won picked Ji Won. - Yes.

476
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,389
But they don't know who they chose.

477
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,070
(Ye Eun and Ji Won don't know about this.)

478
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,760
- I almost cried last night. - Me too.

479
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,900
I actually cried the day before yesterday.

480
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,639
I've always gotten zero votes.

481
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,370
So have I.

482
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,840
- Poor them. - Poor them.

483
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,540
Why am I so unpopular?

484
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,410
Same here.

485
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,220
I don't know why.

486
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,249
I think I'm more popular with women.

487
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,250
Me too.

488
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,920
- That's good, right? - I like you too.

489
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,230
(Two women who both want Sang Won comfort each other.)

490
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,269
Should we eat bagels?

491
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,770
- You're hungry, right? - Yes.

492
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,069
Where are all the men, though?

493
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,410
Maybe they're in their rooms.

494
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,109
- They're not here! - It's totally empty.

495
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,080
They're on a date with So Hyun.

496
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,779
- I usually eat a small breakfast. - Okay.

497
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,456
- But I'm going to eat a bunch. - Let's cheer up.

498
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,819
- Let's cheer up. - Let's eat and cheer up.

499
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,320
- Right. - We need to be invigorated.

500
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,660
- Enjoy your food! - Enjoy your food!

501
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,630
(Bon Hee joins them for breakfast.)

502
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,999
- It's good. - Is it good?

503
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,530
You slightly frowned because it was so good.

504
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,100
This is my first bite of the day, but it's too sweet.

505
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,909
I feel good again.

506
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,169
(You're right.)

507
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,210
I feel much better.

508
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,980
I wonder how we'll go on dates today.

509
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,210
I know, right?

510
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,710
Who do you want to go on a date with?

511
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,720
I actually had...

512
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,389
so much fun with Sang Won yesterday,

513
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,430
so I'm interested in him.

514
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,530
What about you, Bon Hee?

515
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,570
(Laughing)

516
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:53,939
I have to say his name, right?

517
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,940
It'd be nice...

518
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,740
if I could go with Mu Jin.

519
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,340
- I see. - Or Sang Hyeon.

520
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,510
Sang Hyeon is the one I'm curious about.

521
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,109
From talking with him yesterday?

522
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,550
(Nodding)

523
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,320
(Sang Hyeon asked her for a chat the night before.)

524
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,630
(I wanted to go on a date with you today.)

525
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,599
(Sang Hyeon confessed his feelings, )

526
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,060
(and she became curious.)

527
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
What about you, Ji Won?

528
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,740
I want Ji Yung.

529
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,040
(I see.)

530
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,239
Though I don't think he's that interested in me,

531
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,809
but I want to try talking to him.

532
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,849
- That's good. - But...

533
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:43,079
it looked like Ji Yung was...

534
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,219
interested in you, Ji Won.

535
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,690
But I actually think...

536
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,630
he's more interested in Yeong Gyeong.

537
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,029
What if he is?

538
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,000
You can win him over if you like him.

539
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,499
(Bon Hee is so cool!)

540
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,569
"You can win him over."

541
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,039
What did I just hear?

542
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,639
(Doubting her ears)

543
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,969
What if he is?

544
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,669
You can win him over if you like him.

545
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,340
Yes, I'm going to have a chat with him.

546
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,979
Fighting for it is also a form of love.

547
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,980
- Yes. - That was a great line.

548
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,450
(Ji Won braces herself once again.)

549
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,489
- Are you finished? - Yes, I really enjoyed it.

550
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,659
(So Hyun's breakfast date ends.)

551
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,690
Let's get in.

552
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,430
- Get in this one. - Pick the car you want.

553
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,076
- Whose car is this? - Whatever you like.

554
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,529
My truck doesn't drive so smoothly,

555
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,769
- Really? - but it's fine in the front seat.

556
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,829
Pick whichever car you want.

557
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,140
(Waiting for now)

558
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,440
I wanted to get in the car where Sang Hyeon was.

559
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,780
- Sang Hyeon. - Obviously.

560
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,980
Then, she could wait and see and follow him.

561
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,619
(Only So Hyun and Sang Hyeon are left.)

562
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,149
- Will you take the front seat? - Me?

563
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,649
- Yes. - Okay.

564
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,650
(Sang Hyeon lets So Hyun take the passenger seat.)

565
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,019
(Ji Yung politely opens the door for her.)

566
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,460
Oh, right. It was your own truck.

567
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,760
It's a cute truck.

568
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,969
It suits you so well.

569
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,629
But Sang Hyeon just...

570
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,200
told her to sit in the front.

571
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,440
He took the other car?

572
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,569
- Why? - What...

573
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,740
- It's pretty high. - It's fine.

574
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,979
(Turning)

575
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,920
I turned, and Sang Hyeon wasn't there.

576
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,449
I thought, "I guess he's not interested in me."

577
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,920
- No way. - What?

578
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,489
But it's natural to think that way.

579
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,059
I'll drive you there safely.

580
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,230
(Is Sang Hyeon not interested in So Hyun?)

581
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,600
Oh, dear.

582
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,770
Is he really not interested?

583
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,270
- Never. - He's...

584
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,669
- Is that what guys think? - I think...

585
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,670
Is it?

586
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:47,509
Judging from the stride he took to the car behind it...

587
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,540
Not even a little?

588
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,749
(He's not even regretting it a little.)

589
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,150
He safely escorted her,

590
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,149
so he's on his way.

591
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,780
Oh, no.

592
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,819
If a guy were interested in her,

593
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,149
he would have definitely gotten in that car, right?

594
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,519
I would have found a way...

595
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,089
- to get in the same car with her. - I see.

596
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,559
So, I don't think he's exactly interested in her.

597
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,059
(Sang Hyeon isn't interested in So Hyun?)

598
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,200
Oh, no.

599
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,469
The weather's so nice, though.

600
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,670
- I know, right? It's not too hot. - It's not that hot.

601
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,239
It was a great date, guys.

602
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,720
- Good work today. - Good work today.

603
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,569
We had delicious food, thanks to you.

604
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,580
Let's head inside.

605
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,110
She seems cheerful for once.

606
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,080
Where is everyone?

607
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,920
Oh, there you are.

608
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,590
Where were you?

609
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,749
We went to eat a whole chicken soup next to a creek.

610
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,259
- Seriously? Whole chicken soup? - Yes.

611
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,429
It was so good. I needed to be invigorated.

612
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,729
Did you dip your feet in the water?

613
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,359
- I couldn't. - You didn't do that?

614
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,659
We only joked about it,

615
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,699
- like, - Really?

616
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,800
"You're going in soon."

617
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,469
Hi.

618
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,370
- I heard you ate chicken soup. - I did.

619
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,999
- Were you at home the whole time? - Yes.

620
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,309
- Did you eat? - We had a simple meal.

621
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,370
What did you eat?

622
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,610
He's going straight to her.

623
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,149
- What did you eat? - We chatted and ate.

624
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,849
Bell pepper, bananas, bagels...

625
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,850
(Clearing his throat)

626
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,780
How can he like her that much?

627
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,320
(Smiling)

628
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,289
Did you guys drink coffee there?

629
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,759
- No. - You only ate the chicken soup?

630
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,159
Yes, that's why we went.

631
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,660
Oh, my gosh.

632
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,469
They must be dying to be alone.

633
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,670
- I know, right? - Right.

634
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,600
Will we go somewhere today?

635
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,439
Probably in the evening.

636
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,610
- In the evening? - Yes.

637
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,540
To eat delicious food.

638
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,610
- What? - I'm always reflecting on myself.

639
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,210
(Mu Jin is about to make coffee.)

640
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,449
- How was the weather outside? - It was lovely.

641
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,390
- Was it? - The creek was cool.

642
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,520
- The weather's nice today. - Is it?

643
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,860
Did you have coffee?

644
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,890
I did, but that made so little.

645
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,560
I do want another cup.

646
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,229
- Pour some water into it. - Thank you.

647
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,870
(Mu Jin instantly hands over his coffee.)

648
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,579
- We had whole chicken soup. - What?

649
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,179
- Whole chicken soup. - Yes, I heard.

650
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,380
- Did you? - Yes.

651
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,420
Did you know she was the only woman going out?

652
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,920
She told me as she was getting ready this morning.

653
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,419
She had to get ready, so she told me.

654
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,489
(They share even trivial things.)

655
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,490
(Smiling)

656
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,070
Did Yeong Gyeong say she didn't have to eat?

657
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,069
- She hasn't eaten anything? - She hasn't?

658
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,790
- She didn't eat anything. - What do we do?

659
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,509
She should eat fruits instead.

660
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,539
(The night before)

661
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,310
I'll have to ask for your consideration.

662
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,049
I have a patient from another country...

663
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,650
who made an appointment 3 months ago.

664
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,850
(She skipped breakfast due to work in the morning.)

665
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,420
Oh, no. Here goes the Yeong Gyeong enthusiast.

666
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,389
(Hyeon Jun came upstairs to find her.)

667
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,800
- Yeong Gyeong, you didn't eat? - No.

668
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,569
- Aren't you hungry? - I am.

669
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,969
Did you eat?

670
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,200
- Yes, I had chicken soup. - Was it good?

671
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,209
How about I cook you a meal? Just a simple one.

672
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,240
I'd like that.

673
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,139
- "How about I cook you a meal?" - That was nice.

674
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,749
- So cool. - It didn't even matter to him.

675
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,220
He didn't even need to talk about the chicken soup.

676
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,519
He gets straight to the point.

677
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,950
All right, Hyeon Jun.

678
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,490
- Hyeon Jun is so sweet. - Yes.

679
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,889
How is he so sweet?

680
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,289
Kimchi fried rice?

681
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,290
Right. He did mention he'd make fried rice before.

682
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,600
(Yeong Gyeong hurriedly comes downstairs.)

683
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,969
Are you making kimchi fried rice?

684
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,500
Yes. It was the quickest thing I could make.

685
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,140
He's such a sexy chef.

686
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,840
What are you cooking?

687
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,910
(Grinning)

688
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,039
- It's kimchi fried rice again. - I like it.

689
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,480
I didn't have that many ingredients.

690
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,349
(Sang Hyeon gives them privacy.)

691
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,519
I should get some groceries.

692
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,950
All we need is kimchi.

693
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,720
- Give me just a minute. - Sure.

694
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,120
How was work this morning?

695
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460
- Me? - Yes.

696
00:27:57,461 --> 00:28:00,290
Yes, I worked hard on treating my patients.

697
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,459
I had put 4 to 5 appointments into this morning.

698
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,130
- Oh, you dealt with all of them. - Yes.

699
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,540
What do your employees say?

700
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,939
They're so curious.

701
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,739
They look like a married couple.

702
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,340
- About other participants? - Yes.

703
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,439
They're like "How many are there?"

704
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,309
- And about who you like? - "Are you interested in anyone?"

705
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,480
They asked me that.

706
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,510
(Smiling)

707
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,950
(Pleased)

708
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:23,349
This couple is so stable.

709
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,150
They make you feel at ease.

710
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,750
They're so cute.

711
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,520
What kind of boss are you?

712
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,290
- Me? - Yes.

713
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,959
I can't tolerate any mistakes,

714
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,229
so I'm scary...

715
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,500
when they shouldn't make mistakes.

716
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,500
I can't imagine you being scary.

717
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,770
- Me? - Yes.

718
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,240
I can be pretty scary when I'm angry.

719
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,339
(Finding her cute)

720
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,070
Do you talk like a sloth even then?

721
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,270
I do.

722
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,110
An angry sloth.

723
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,209
They have such good chemistry,

724
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,880
so they make me feel comfortable.

725
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,249
Something smells delicious.

726
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,990
- Come here if you're hungry. - You can eat it if you're hungry.

727
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,590
Who's hungry?

728
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,129
Eat up. You must be starving.

729
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,390
He made it quickly.

730
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,429
Take a photo of me, please.

731
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,329
Do you want a photo?

732
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,500
Like that? It looks perfect.

733
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,999
(Yeong Gyeong is excited and leaves a photo.)

734
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,870
Just a second.

735
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,539
- I have... - The fried rice has to show.

736
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,810
- I've never imagined this. - In 1, 2, 3.

737
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,039
(Food after work made by Hyeon Jun)

738
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,109
It's cute.

739
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,180
(Shy)

740
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,610
- That's cute. - Yeong Gyeong...

741
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,379
can be chic and cold like a city woman,

742
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,449
- but she's also cutesy. - Totally.

743
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,189
She's very attractive.

744
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,590
I want to be like Yeong Gyeong.

745
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,160
She's elegant.

746
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,320
You're also elegant when you're not talking.

747
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,800
I should speak less.

748
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,669
Thank you for the food.

749
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,730
Thanks for the food.

750
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,140
(Nom)

751
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,570
(Moaning)

752
00:29:51,571 --> 00:29:52,610
It's good.

753
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,940
- Is this your first meal? - Yes.

754
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,650
It's delicious.

755
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,520
(Yeon Gyeong's first meal that Hyeon Jun made)

756
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,250
That feels good.

757
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,489
(Proud and satisfied)

758
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,560
- I'm jealous. - It's so nice.

759
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,430
- They got a text. - We got a text.

760
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,099
Only the younger men got it.

761
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,170
They did.

762
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,529
Date tickets.

763
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,540
What is it?

764
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,140
- Three minutes? - Three minutes.

765
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,540
The men will have a competition.

766
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,539
- Private Glamping Date. - Private Glamping Date?

767
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,260
- Three-Minute Match? - Three-Minute Match?

768
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,080
The men will have the Three-Minute Match.

769
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,680
What's a Three-Minute Match?

770
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,179
They make me physically compete against these fit guys.

771
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,280
(The moment has come.)

772
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,149
- Seriously? - This is so harsh.

773
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,559
- Are you going to warm up? - Get warmed up.

774
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,659
I'm going to get changed.

775
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,160
- This is war. - It is.

776
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,100
(The younger men's 3-Minute Match)

777
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,170
They set things up.

778
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,839
(Push-ups, sit-ups, and pull-ups)

779
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,169
- Oh, no. - Sit-ups and push-ups?

780
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,239
- Taking turns? - One minute each.

781
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,369
"The man with the highest total count..."

782
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,410
"gets a chance to go on the Private Glamping Date?"

783
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,610
Glamping sounds fun.

784
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,679
- There's a handicap for you. - You get a handicap.

785
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,749
- I do? - Yes.

786
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,430
- Ten seconds. - You get ten seconds less.

787
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,649
- It's 50 seconds each. - So, 50 seconds each?

788
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,290
- Yes, 50 seconds each. - You should do it in 50 seconds.

789
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,090
- That was necessary. - It was.

790
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,589
Glamping in that weather sounds so good.

791
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,759
(They must win to go glamping with the older woman they want.)

792
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,900
(Determined)

793
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:28,770
Who wants to go first?

794
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,540
Let's do it, Sang Won.

795
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,939
(Sang Won goes first.)

796
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,940
(Sighing)

797
00:31:34,941 --> 00:31:37,410
Oh, no. It's Sang Won.

798
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,409
- Oh, no. - Look at his fair arms.

799
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,719
I don't know about others,

800
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,950
but I was dispirited as if I ran into a wall.

801
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,390
It was a game that I could never win.

802
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,829
(Sang Won has zero confidence from the start.)

803
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,960
Get ready.

804
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,030
(Nervous)

805
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:55,500
- Go, dermatologist. - Ready.

806
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,530
Get set. Go!

807
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,170
One...

808
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,670
Get set. Go!

809
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,500
- One, two... - One, two...

810
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,040
- He's better than I thought. - That's not bad.

811
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,910
- Five... - He's good.

812
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,039
He said he was bad at it on purpose.

813
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,080
Eight,

814
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,809
nine... He downplayed it.

815
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,720
He was a doctor,

816
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,889
so I assumed...

817
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:20,620
he wouldn't have much time to work out.

818
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,520
I was surprised.

819
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,260
He puffed out his chest and everything.

820
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,760
I was genuinely surprised.

821
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,370
I'm terrible at this.

822
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,500
He's acting weak again.

823
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,069
- He might have the best form. - Right.

824
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,870
He lowers our expectations first.

825
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,670
He's doing better than I thought.

826
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,679
He has such good form.

827
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,609
- He does. - He's good! What?

828
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,949
Six, seven...

829
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,079
- Sang Won! - That's so surprising.

830
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,750
I know, right? He's good!

831
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,250
- This is surprising. - How can this be?

832
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,390
He's good.

833
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,090
- Good luck. - It's Hyeon Jun.

834
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,850
He could do pull-ups there on his feet.

835
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,899
He's already doing one.

836
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,960
Like this.

837
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,299
(Laughing)

838
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,399
You're already up there.

839
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,699
(Is Hyeon Jun relaxed?)

840
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,400
- All right. - Don't go easy on them.

841
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,910
(He looks awkward.)

842
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,770
Get set. Go!

843
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,680
- He's too tall. - I know.

844
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,550
One, two...

845
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,049
Go higher!

846
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,049
(Struggling)

847
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,450
- I'm so bad at this. - Oh, no.

848
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,089
- It's because he's tall. - Yes.

849
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,090
Right.

850
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,359
Oh, boy.

851
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,590
(You can do it.)

852
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,629
(He does his best, although the bar's too low.)

853
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,630
Eight.

854
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:38,469
Ten, nine,

855
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,630
- I'm done. - eight...

856
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,070
- Great work. - Good job.

857
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,199
- His height was a disadvantage. - Exactly.

858
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,370
He's too tall for it.

859
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,639
(Looking up)

860
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,679
It's Mu Jin.

861
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,010
(Looking forward to it)

862
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,279
(Mu Jin confidently goes third.)

863
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,379
Mu Jin.

864
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,120
- We'll start counting. - I'll start.

865
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,950
They must be good at different things, right?

866
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,650
Get set. Go.

867
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,619
One, two,

868
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,720
- three, four, - He's good!

869
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,160
- five, six, - Five, six,

870
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,760
- seven, eight, - seven, eight,

871
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,470
- nine, ten... - nine, ten...

872
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,830
Four,

873
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,739
five...

874
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,940
(Consistent)

875
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,770
(How is he so good?)

876
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,239
Thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight,

877
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,549
thirty-nine,

878
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,210
forty, forty-one,

879
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,080
forty-two, forty-three...

880
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,290
I didn't expect him to be so good at it,

881
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,020
but he worked really hard.

882
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,190
I could tell that he was giving it his all.

883
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,530
- He worked so hard. - It was so cool.

884
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,899
- They're certainly amazing. - Right.

885
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,900
That's incredible.

886
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,070
They're really good.

887
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,369
(Feeling pressured)

888
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,410
Who's next?

889
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,710
(Sang Hyeon goes fourth.)

890
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,680
It must be so much pressure.

891
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,649
Good luck.

892
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,220
(Looking forward to it)

893
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,560
(Composed)

894
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,689
I've been working out...

895
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,500
every day except for on day two.

896
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,729
Sang Hyeon is good at this.

897
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,299
- He works out every morning. - You're right.

898
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,469
(He secretly did bodyweight exercises every day.)

899
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,939
He looks like he's got a sleeper build.

900
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,569
(He secretly did bodyweight exercises every day.)

901
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,039
Everyone said that the match was...

902
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,480
for Ji Yung, the new guy.

903
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,849
Everyone seemed to think so,

904
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,620
but I actually thought...

905
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:42,390
they were giving me a chance.

906
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,730
That was on my mind.

907
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,660
I'm going to do my best.

908
00:35:51,303 --> 00:35:52,863
(Composed)

909
00:35:53,533 --> 00:35:55,072
I've been working out...

910
00:35:55,073 --> 00:35:58,803
every day except for on day two.

911
00:35:59,703 --> 00:36:01,012
Sang Hyeon is good at this.

912
00:36:01,013 --> 00:36:03,542
- He works out every morning. - You're right.

913
00:36:03,543 --> 00:36:04,782
(He secretly did bodyweight exercises every day.)

914
00:36:04,783 --> 00:36:07,182
He looks like he's got a sleeper build.

915
00:36:07,183 --> 00:36:08,882
(He secretly did bodyweight exercises every day.)

916
00:36:08,883 --> 00:36:12,382
Everyone said that the match was...

917
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:15,723
for Ji Yung, the new guy.

918
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:19,122
Everyone seemed to think so,

919
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:20,863
but I actually thought...

920
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:24,663
they were giving me a chance.

921
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,933
That was on my mind.

922
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:29,973
I'm going to do my best.

923
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:31,972
He sounds extremely confident.

924
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:34,743
Because I also want to look good.

925
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,242
He wants to look cool.

926
00:36:36,243 --> 00:36:39,182
I really hope that Sang Hyeon wins...

927
00:36:39,183 --> 00:36:41,812
- Sang Hyeon? - and goes on a date with Bon Hee.

928
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:43,182
Please, let it happen.

929
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:45,323
- I want to see them together. - Right.

930
00:36:46,683 --> 00:36:49,092
Ready. Set. Go.

931
00:36:49,093 --> 00:36:50,322
(Sang Hyeon can't lose in this game.)

932
00:36:50,323 --> 00:36:51,523
Go.

933
00:36:53,163 --> 00:36:55,462
- Three, four... - Three, four...

934
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,532
(He's doing it fast in the right position.)

935
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:59,502
- Six, seven, eight... - Six, seven, eight...

936
00:36:59,503 --> 00:37:01,679
(Now they can believe that he's been working out secretly.)

937
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:02,932
(Impressed)

938
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:05,172
- Five, six... - Five, six...

939
00:37:05,173 --> 00:37:09,142
(He won't slow down.)

940
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,643
Ten. He's good at it.

941
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:14,552
Sang Hyeon is doing it most properly of all.

942
00:37:14,553 --> 00:37:16,113
That's the right way of doing pull-ups.

943
00:37:17,013 --> 00:37:19,622
He did way better than I expected.

944
00:37:19,623 --> 00:37:21,553
He seemed cool to me.

945
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:24,462
- He impressed Bon Hee. - Oh, my. Sang Hyeon.

946
00:37:24,463 --> 00:37:26,123
He declared war the day before.

947
00:37:26,563 --> 00:37:27,793
He's showing what he can do.

948
00:37:28,863 --> 00:37:31,062
One, two,

949
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:32,803
- That's the textbook position. - three...

950
00:37:33,433 --> 00:37:34,933
Should he sit all the way up? Four.

951
00:37:35,473 --> 00:37:36,533
- Five. - Five.

952
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:39,602
Sang Hyeon did a great job.

953
00:37:39,603 --> 00:37:41,472
So while counting the numbers,

954
00:37:41,473 --> 00:37:43,713
I cheered for him subtly.

955
00:37:44,743 --> 00:37:46,043
I said cheering words.

956
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:49,652
- One, two, three, four, - One, two, three, four,

957
00:37:49,653 --> 00:37:51,052
- five, six... - Oh, he's so cool.

958
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:52,599
(Sang Hyeon gives it all he's got to the end.)

959
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:55,292
- And 16, 17, 18, 19... - And 16, 17, 18, 19...

960
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:58,262
It was completely unexpected to see that side of him.

961
00:37:58,263 --> 00:38:01,663
How he tried his best to win...

962
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:05,633
made him look like a cool younger man.

963
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:09,003
Also, it made my heart flutter.

964
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,472
Oh, boy.

965
00:38:10,473 --> 00:38:11,833
- It must be exhausting. - Indeed.

966
00:38:12,803 --> 00:38:15,342
- Oh, gosh. Sang Hyeon. - And 47, 48...

967
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:16,542
(He makes the women' hearts flutter. He exudes his charms properly.)

968
00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:17,843
- Fifty. - Fifty.

969
00:38:19,443 --> 00:38:20,882
- He did a lot. - Indeed.

970
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:22,659
(Golden Retriever showed his unexpected charm.)

971
00:38:22,683 --> 00:38:24,722
- That was so cool. - Indeed.

972
00:38:24,723 --> 00:38:25,882
How does he do that so fast?

973
00:38:25,883 --> 00:38:27,082
Exactly.

974
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:28,092
- He's really different... - That was the perfect position.

975
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:29,692
Because he's been working out alone.

976
00:38:29,693 --> 00:38:30,723
Exactly.

977
00:38:30,863 --> 00:38:33,199
- I didn't do as many as I hoped. - Everyone is good at it.

978
00:38:33,223 --> 00:38:34,293
That was unexpected.

979
00:38:35,263 --> 00:38:36,263
(The last player, Ji Yung)

980
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:37,833
- I have 50 seconds? - Yes, 50 seconds.

981
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,063
- The athlete is here. - It's neck and neck.

982
00:38:40,763 --> 00:38:42,032
Ji Yung.

983
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:43,033
(Excited)

984
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:46,142
Let's begin. Ready. Set. Go.

985
00:38:46,143 --> 00:38:47,243
How well will he do?

986
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:50,212
- Three, four, - Three, four,

987
00:38:50,213 --> 00:38:52,412
- It's game over. - five, six,

988
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,142
- He's muscular and fast. - seven, eight...

989
00:38:54,143 --> 00:38:55,413
- He's scary. - Indeed.

990
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:59,422
- One, two... - Two.

991
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:01,452
- Three, four, - Three, four,

992
00:39:01,453 --> 00:39:03,552
- five, six, - five, six,

993
00:39:03,553 --> 00:39:04,562
- seven... - seven...

994
00:39:04,563 --> 00:39:06,563
- One, two, three, four... - Four.

995
00:39:06,623 --> 00:39:07,692
(He's overwhelmingly fast!)

996
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:08,762
Seven, eight...

997
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,393
Oh, my. He's really overwhelmingly fast.

998
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:12,263
How are they supposed to defeat an athlete?

999
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:16,772
- Seventy? Two, three... - One, two, three,

1000
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:18,703
- four, five, six... - He's amazing.

1001
00:39:19,703 --> 00:39:20,773
My goodness.

1002
00:39:21,743 --> 00:39:24,782
(We knew he'd do well, but we didn't expect him to do this well.)

1003
00:39:24,783 --> 00:39:26,083
- Eighty. Amazing. - Time's up.

1004
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:29,182
(The handicap wasn't a problem for Ji Yung.)

1005
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:31,283
He's on another level.

1006
00:39:32,523 --> 00:39:33,652
Gosh, I'm tired.

1007
00:39:33,653 --> 00:39:36,353
(Everyone did well, but their faces tell the result.)

1008
00:39:37,323 --> 00:39:39,223
- I did my best. - Right. I agree.

1009
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,662
- Who placed first? - Ji Yung.

1010
00:39:41,663 --> 00:39:45,462
(Despite the handicap, Ji Yung wins as expected.)

1011
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:49,403
Great job, everyone. You all did a good job.

1012
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:52,403
(Disappointed)

1013
00:39:52,543 --> 00:39:54,783
- Shall we give them some water? - Right. Let's do that.

1014
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:58,582
It's not really cool though.

1015
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:00,042
- But still... - Thank you.

1016
00:40:00,043 --> 00:40:02,113
- Great job. - Thank you.

1017
00:40:03,253 --> 00:40:04,623
I'll give it to Mu Jin.

1018
00:40:06,523 --> 00:40:08,393
- Thank you. - You did a good job.

1019
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:10,522
She takes care of Mu Jin.

1020
00:40:10,523 --> 00:40:11,593
(Glancing)

1021
00:40:14,123 --> 00:40:15,263
You did really well.

1022
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:17,593
(Happy)

1023
00:40:18,763 --> 00:40:20,463
Oh, gosh. It breaks my heart.

1024
00:40:20,933 --> 00:40:22,102
Right in front of Sang Hyeon.

1025
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:23,232
Gosh. Poor him.

1026
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:26,103
(Sang Hyeon drinks water with an upset look on his face.)

1027
00:40:26,673 --> 00:40:27,772
He did his best.

1028
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:30,742
After the game, she came up to Mu Jin...

1029
00:40:30,743 --> 00:40:33,443
and had a chat with him, which I obviously saw.

1030
00:40:34,453 --> 00:40:35,853
It was a little disappointing.

1031
00:40:37,253 --> 00:40:38,523
Poor him.

1032
00:40:40,723 --> 00:40:42,283
I'm so upset. This is driving me crazy.

1033
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,862
- What should he do? - They were right in front of him.

1034
00:40:44,863 --> 00:40:46,492
My point, exactly.

1035
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:47,862
What just happened?

1036
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:50,463
Even though he impressed Bon Hee by showing his athletic ability,

1037
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:53,663
- Bon Hee gave water to Mu Jin. - Right.

1038
00:40:54,063 --> 00:40:56,102
It must've hurt Sang Hyeon's pride.

1039
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:57,943
- He must've been upset. - Right. I agree.

1040
00:40:58,143 --> 00:41:01,072
I believe that Sang Hyeon will soon...

1041
00:41:01,073 --> 00:41:02,173
make up his mind.

1042
00:41:02,873 --> 00:41:04,072
You're saying he might give up?

1043
00:41:04,073 --> 00:41:07,312
When Bon Hee went up to Mu Jin...

1044
00:41:07,313 --> 00:41:10,313
and gave water to him,

1045
00:41:10,683 --> 00:41:13,822
she wasn't just being kind like she is to everyone.

1046
00:41:13,823 --> 00:41:15,493
- It wasn't like that. - That's right.

1047
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:17,469
He's the one whom she wants to take care of.

1048
00:41:17,493 --> 00:41:18,493
So he was the first one she gave water to.

1049
00:41:18,494 --> 00:41:20,294
- She doesn't care about the others. - Right.

1050
00:41:20,463 --> 00:41:23,193
- That's about it. - From Sang Hyeon's perspective...

1051
00:41:24,093 --> 00:41:27,332
I think it makes him think that there's nothing more he can do.

1052
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:28,473
Don't you think so?

1053
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:30,502
I think that's possible.

1054
00:41:30,503 --> 00:41:32,703
- What he just saw... - It must be discouraging.

1055
00:41:32,803 --> 00:41:33,903
That's right.

1056
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:37,672
(It's time to choose the one to take on the Private Glamping Date.)

1057
00:41:37,673 --> 00:41:38,743
I choose...

1058
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:42,612
I'm nervous.

1059
00:41:42,613 --> 00:41:43,652
(Who does Ji Yung want to take out on a date?)

1060
00:41:43,653 --> 00:41:44,973
- Who could it be? - I'm curious.

1061
00:41:45,353 --> 00:41:46,653
It must be Yeong Gyeong.

1062
00:41:47,223 --> 00:41:48,392
Pick So Hyun.

1063
00:41:48,393 --> 00:41:50,729
(Is it So Hyun he was with on the whole chicken soup date?)

1064
00:41:50,753 --> 00:41:52,923
(He's walking straight toward her.)

1065
00:41:53,563 --> 00:41:54,593
Let's go together.

1066
00:41:54,863 --> 00:41:56,932
(Ji Yung chose So Hyun.)

1067
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,063
Thank you.

1068
00:41:58,703 --> 00:42:00,362
(Ji Yung's choice is unexpected.)

1069
00:42:00,363 --> 00:42:01,402
- What? - Yes!

1070
00:42:01,403 --> 00:42:03,132
(She's happy for now.)

1071
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:06,302
- In the morning... - While having whole chicken soup...

1072
00:42:06,303 --> 00:42:07,943
- That's right. He fell for her. - Right.

1073
00:42:08,413 --> 00:42:10,113
Oh, yes. I'm going glamping.

1074
00:42:10,643 --> 00:42:12,813
- It's even better as it's glamping. - Right.

1075
00:42:13,183 --> 00:42:16,353
When we talked this morning at the whole chicken soup place...

1076
00:42:16,613 --> 00:42:19,953
Since she was the only woman and five men were with her,

1077
00:42:20,423 --> 00:42:22,193
she could've felt shy.

1078
00:42:22,993 --> 00:42:24,622
But she actively participated in the conversation.

1079
00:42:24,623 --> 00:42:26,493
She seemed emotionally relaxed.

1080
00:42:26,563 --> 00:42:27,792
So I wanted to talk to her more.

1081
00:42:27,793 --> 00:42:31,302
I wanted to get to know her better.

1082
00:42:31,303 --> 00:42:32,579
(Ji Yung became more curious about So Hyun.)

1083
00:42:32,603 --> 00:42:34,572
(Excited)

1084
00:42:34,573 --> 00:42:35,803
It will be fun.

1085
00:42:37,843 --> 00:42:39,173
I'm disappointed.

1086
00:42:39,673 --> 00:42:41,643
- Oh, no. - Thank you.

1087
00:42:42,573 --> 00:42:43,772
Good job.

1088
00:42:43,773 --> 00:42:45,282
(The fierce, but romantic match of the younger men is over.)

1089
00:42:45,283 --> 00:42:46,283
Are you eating something?

1090
00:42:46,284 --> 00:42:48,482
- I'm so hungry. - I'm hungry.

1091
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:49,882
- So I'll eat this yogurt. - I see.

1092
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:51,299
- Shall we also eat some? - I was nervous.

1093
00:42:51,323 --> 00:42:54,283
(Both grunt.)

1094
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:57,152
We didn't play the game, but we...

1095
00:42:57,153 --> 00:42:58,222
Are you tired?

1096
00:42:58,223 --> 00:43:00,723
- We got nervous while watching it. - Why am I tired?

1097
00:43:01,433 --> 00:43:03,132
- Sang Hyeon surprised me. - Right.

1098
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:04,192
- Sang Hyeon? - Sang Hyeon?

1099
00:43:04,193 --> 00:43:07,263
Sang Hyeon seemed so determined, which was a new side of him.

1100
00:43:07,663 --> 00:43:09,032
Didn't he do better than expected?

1101
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:10,532
- He did well. - He did a great job.

1102
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:13,772
- He must work out a lot. - Right.

1103
00:43:13,773 --> 00:43:16,172
His body shows how much he's been working out.

1104
00:43:16,173 --> 00:43:18,012
- He has firm fine muscles, right? - Yes.

1105
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,742
- That's how he looks. - Also, he doesn't look...

1106
00:43:19,743 --> 00:43:21,452
like he works out with weights.

1107
00:43:21,453 --> 00:43:22,682
- He looks like he's been doing... - Bodyweight workouts.

1108
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:23,982
A lot of bodyweight workouts.

1109
00:43:23,983 --> 00:43:26,083
Oh, you can tell that.

1110
00:43:26,783 --> 00:43:30,223
(They found a new side of Sang Hyeon through the game.)

1111
00:43:30,823 --> 00:43:33,462
That one thing made all the women reevaluate Sang Hyeon.

1112
00:43:33,463 --> 00:43:34,563
Exactly.

1113
00:43:34,933 --> 00:43:36,492
- They're all talking about him. - Right now,

1114
00:43:36,493 --> 00:43:38,402
Sang Hyeon didn't lose anything through the game.

1115
00:43:38,403 --> 00:43:40,962
Bon Hee also said she was surprised.

1116
00:43:40,963 --> 00:43:42,403
(That's right.)

1117
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,872
Are you okay? Doesn't it hurt?

1118
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,003
I'm fine.

1119
00:43:47,243 --> 00:43:48,313
You look a little upset.

1120
00:43:49,013 --> 00:43:50,213
I'm not exactly happy.

1121
00:43:52,983 --> 00:43:54,613
(Smiling)

1122
00:43:57,383 --> 00:43:58,482
(The 1st place and the last place chuckle awkwardly.)

1123
00:43:58,483 --> 00:44:00,023
Oh, he came in last place.

1124
00:44:00,853 --> 00:44:02,293
That was so exhausting.

1125
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:05,163
(The guys gather 1 by 1.)

1126
00:44:06,263 --> 00:44:07,423
But that was...

1127
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:09,213
Even from my perspective...

1128
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:10,892
I'm sorry.

1129
00:44:10,893 --> 00:44:11,932
What?

1130
00:44:11,933 --> 00:44:13,062
(Ji Yun is sorry to everyone about the result of the game.)

1131
00:44:13,063 --> 00:44:14,903
I was really nervous while doing it.

1132
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:18,143
I really did my utmost.

1133
00:44:18,443 --> 00:44:19,843
I gave my 120 percent.

1134
00:44:20,243 --> 00:44:22,472
I just pretended I was confident.

1135
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:23,953
Or else, I would've been embarrassed.

1136
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:26,042
- I really did my best. - You did well.

1137
00:44:26,043 --> 00:44:27,163
- I mean it. - You did well.

1138
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:30,053
- I'll get going now. - Right now?

1139
00:44:30,713 --> 00:44:32,053
Oh, he's going right away.

1140
00:44:32,883 --> 00:44:35,852
Can't I go out on a date with someone too?

1141
00:44:35,853 --> 00:44:36,853
(Glancing)

1142
00:44:40,193 --> 00:44:43,063
(Mu Jin leaves the room.)

1143
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:57,343
(Mu Jin checks his appearance.)

1144
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:00,813
(Sighing)

1145
00:45:09,353 --> 00:45:11,823
(Sang Hyeon suddenly leaves the room.)

1146
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:14,492
(He walks toward the room where Sang Won and Mu Jin are.)

1147
00:45:14,493 --> 00:45:15,733
What? Why is he going there?

1148
00:45:15,863 --> 00:45:17,062
He's going to the guys' room.

1149
00:45:17,063 --> 00:45:18,502
(He walks toward the room where Sang Won and Mu Jin are.)

1150
00:45:18,503 --> 00:45:20,103
I was wearing a mask while doing it.

1151
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:23,632
I think it was Ji Yung who suggested the idea of glamping...

1152
00:45:23,633 --> 00:45:24,942
most strongly of us.

1153
00:45:24,943 --> 00:45:27,603
(Sang Hyeon keeps pacing around and sighs.)

1154
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:35,483
Mu Jin, can I talk to you?

1155
00:45:36,713 --> 00:45:39,853
(After pacing around for a while, Sang Hyeon calls Mu Jin out.)

1156
00:45:41,923 --> 00:45:45,422
I decided to talk to Bon Hee.

1157
00:45:45,423 --> 00:45:47,362
But at that moment, Mu Jin asked...

1158
00:45:47,363 --> 00:45:48,863
if he could...

1159
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:52,102
go out on a date with someone.

1160
00:45:52,103 --> 00:45:54,303
And I heard him saying that.

1161
00:45:54,673 --> 00:45:58,403
I was sure about whom he was referring to.

1162
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,742
I thought I would miss my chance to talk to her again.

1163
00:46:00,743 --> 00:46:03,213
I didn't want anyone to interrupt...

1164
00:46:03,473 --> 00:46:06,012
while I was talking to Bon Hee,

1165
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,782
so I went to Mu Jin to talk to him.

1166
00:46:08,783 --> 00:46:10,683
(Surprised)

1167
00:46:10,713 --> 00:46:13,152
- That'll clearly help. - Yes, that's a good idea.

1168
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:15,222
He'll ask Mu Jin not to interrupt when he talks to Bon Hee.

1169
00:46:15,223 --> 00:46:16,392
He's so decisive.

1170
00:46:16,393 --> 00:46:19,153
(He'll prevent all the distractions for a conversation with Bon Hee.)

1171
00:46:20,623 --> 00:46:22,233
This is where I rest.

1172
00:46:23,293 --> 00:46:25,163
- No one else must use this place. - Right.

1173
00:46:27,963 --> 00:46:29,472
Is there no camera in there?

1174
00:46:29,473 --> 00:46:31,193
- I think so. - There's no camera in there.

1175
00:46:31,303 --> 00:46:32,443
Well...

1176
00:46:32,503 --> 00:46:35,443
(Sang Hyeon can't start talking easily.)

1177
00:46:36,373 --> 00:46:37,973
What I want to tell you is...

1178
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,213
Well...

1179
00:46:41,683 --> 00:46:42,953
Don't get me wrong.

1180
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:48,553
I was fond of Bon Hee from the get-go.

1181
00:46:48,853 --> 00:46:52,063
But I saw that you were always around her.

1182
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:57,293
I would also like to talk to her.

1183
00:46:57,863 --> 00:46:58,962
- I see. - So I'm asking you...

1184
00:46:58,963 --> 00:47:01,333
to give me some time to talk to her.

1185
00:47:01,873 --> 00:47:03,633
- Goodness, you. - That's my honest feeling.

1186
00:47:04,803 --> 00:47:06,372
You don't have to ask for my permission.

1187
00:47:06,373 --> 00:47:07,903
I know, but still...

1188
00:47:08,003 --> 00:47:10,312
But I really don't care at all.

1189
00:47:10,313 --> 00:47:11,983
And we're all here to do so.

1190
00:47:13,243 --> 00:47:15,113
- That's true, but... - We're here for that.

1191
00:47:15,213 --> 00:47:19,052
I don't know how Bon Hee feels.

1192
00:47:19,053 --> 00:47:21,353
But I just do as my heart says.

1193
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:23,223
I just follow my heart.

1194
00:47:23,323 --> 00:47:24,692
You don't have to worry about me.

1195
00:47:24,693 --> 00:47:26,462
You can do whatever you want.

1196
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,523
My, that's cool.

1197
00:47:27,663 --> 00:47:30,292
Then I'll go and talk to her.

1198
00:47:30,293 --> 00:47:31,333
All right.

1199
00:47:34,733 --> 00:47:37,672
Sang Hyeon kept it simple and nice. I'm glad he talked to Mu Jin.

1200
00:47:37,673 --> 00:47:40,643
(Sang Hyeon goes straight to the older women's room.)

1201
00:47:41,173 --> 00:47:42,412
(Knocking)

1202
00:47:42,413 --> 00:47:43,413
Come in.

1203
00:47:45,713 --> 00:47:46,782
You're all gathered here?

1204
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:47,783
- Yes. - Yes.

1205
00:47:48,413 --> 00:47:52,083
(All the older women are looking at Sang Hyeon.)

1206
00:47:52,983 --> 00:47:54,992
Bon Hee, can I talk to you briefly?

1207
00:47:54,993 --> 00:47:56,053
Oh, sure. Yes.

1208
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:57,822
He's cool.

1209
00:47:57,823 --> 00:47:59,462
I think he made up his mind.

1210
00:47:59,463 --> 00:48:00,562
He should be like this.

1211
00:48:00,563 --> 00:48:01,892
(Smiling, surprised)

1212
00:48:01,893 --> 00:48:02,993
(Surprised)

1213
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:04,433
I'm surprised.

1214
00:48:05,103 --> 00:48:06,503
I feel bad for So Hyun.

1215
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:09,833
"What? He didn't come to see me."

1216
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:13,973
I realized that he wasn't interested in me.

1217
00:48:16,513 --> 00:48:21,283
(Mu Jin comes back to his room after talking to Sang Hyeon.)

1218
00:48:21,953 --> 00:48:25,652
Although Mu Jin nonchalantly said he didn't care,

1219
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,492
- it must bother him. - It must bother him so much.

1220
00:48:28,493 --> 00:48:30,533
(Does the conversation with Sang Hyeon bother him?)

1221
00:48:31,293 --> 00:48:36,093
(Bon Hee and Sang Hyeon come out to the terrace.)

1222
00:48:38,963 --> 00:48:40,033
There's one pair here.

1223
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,633
- Thank you. - It's still a little bit wet here.

1224
00:48:43,903 --> 00:48:45,602
- Did you catch your breath? - Yes.

1225
00:48:45,603 --> 00:48:47,503
- Shall I sit here? - Yes, please.

1226
00:48:50,873 --> 00:48:53,312
Actually, before I came to you,

1227
00:48:53,313 --> 00:48:56,953
- I talked to Mu Jin briefly. - Okay.

1228
00:48:57,513 --> 00:49:01,253
I said I liked you the most based on the first impression.

1229
00:49:01,953 --> 00:49:04,592
And that you were the only one I was interested in romantically,

1230
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:05,762
and so I wanted to talk to you.

1231
00:49:05,763 --> 00:49:07,922
But I didn't have a chance to talk to you.

1232
00:49:07,923 --> 00:49:11,832
Also, it's hard to approach you because he's always around you.

1233
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:15,172
So I asked him to give me a chance to talk to you if he didn't mind.

1234
00:49:15,173 --> 00:49:16,303
That's what I told him.

1235
00:49:17,203 --> 00:49:20,373
It was quite hard for me to say that to Mu Jin.

1236
00:49:20,673 --> 00:49:23,313
But I really wanted to talk to you.

1237
00:49:24,573 --> 00:49:27,943
(Hesitating)

1238
00:49:29,053 --> 00:49:30,883
To be honest, here's what I thought.

1239
00:49:31,313 --> 00:49:33,522
It's hard not to notice...

1240
00:49:33,523 --> 00:49:34,993
how Mu Jin takes care of you...

1241
00:49:35,623 --> 00:49:38,463
and how you take care of him.

1242
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,093
Watching you two doing so...

1243
00:49:41,533 --> 00:49:44,063
made me realize that you two were already...

1244
00:49:44,163 --> 00:49:46,903
into each other so deeply.

1245
00:49:47,633 --> 00:49:50,903
Watching you two together made me feel...

1246
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:53,642
miserable.

1247
00:49:53,643 --> 00:49:55,812
It hurt my feelings every time,

1248
00:49:55,813 --> 00:49:57,342
which made me unconfident and timid.

1249
00:49:57,343 --> 00:49:58,382
(Wounds have piled up in his heart.)

1250
00:49:58,383 --> 00:49:59,503
He's telling her everything.

1251
00:50:00,143 --> 00:50:02,583
(A few hours earlier, after the 3-Minute Match...)

1252
00:50:03,783 --> 00:50:06,253
(Bon Hee took care of Mu Jin.)

1253
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:09,452
After the game, she came up to him...

1254
00:50:09,453 --> 00:50:12,492
and had a chat with him, which I obviously saw.

1255
00:50:12,493 --> 00:50:14,693
(Sang Hyeon had a lot on his mind while watching them.)

1256
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:18,093
(The night before, when everyone gathered, )

1257
00:50:18,193 --> 00:50:22,133
(she didn't take the cushion that Sang Hyeon offered.)

1258
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:24,833
It was so easy to tell...

1259
00:50:25,443 --> 00:50:27,172
that the feelings were mutual.

1260
00:50:27,173 --> 00:50:28,733
(Sang Hyeon felt that they were solid.)

1261
00:50:30,073 --> 00:50:31,243
Oh, I see.

1262
00:50:34,643 --> 00:50:36,852
I thought that if I approached you aggressively...

1263
00:50:36,853 --> 00:50:39,053
just because you were the only one I was interested in,

1264
00:50:39,253 --> 00:50:42,223
it would be nothing less than sabotaging your relationship.

1265
00:50:49,063 --> 00:50:54,463
If you're more sure about Mu Jin than you are about me...

1266
00:50:58,133 --> 00:50:59,143
Oh, my.

1267
00:51:02,313 --> 00:51:06,442
I think I should give up on you. That thought got bigger...

1268
00:51:06,443 --> 00:51:07,543
as time went by.

1269
00:51:10,853 --> 00:51:13,583
That's why I decided to talk to you.

1270
00:51:15,053 --> 00:51:18,422
I did become serious about this after you first came to talk to me.

1271
00:51:18,423 --> 00:51:22,593
I was just relaxed on the 1st and 2nd days.

1272
00:51:23,233 --> 00:51:25,703
But I realized that...

1273
00:51:26,403 --> 00:51:29,103
it could be more emotionally exhausting than I expected.

1274
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,003
And that surprised me.

1275
00:51:32,003 --> 00:51:35,112
Also, I found it so great of you to pluck up the courage...

1276
00:51:35,113 --> 00:51:37,143
and told me how you felt that day.

1277
00:51:37,613 --> 00:51:40,043
I found you to be a very brave man.

1278
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:42,353
But it's too soon to say...

1279
00:51:42,653 --> 00:51:45,723
I admit that I'm interested in him,

1280
00:51:47,183 --> 00:51:50,153
but it's not that there's no room in my heart for anyone else.

1281
00:51:50,323 --> 00:51:52,592
I mean, it's been only four days.

1282
00:51:52,593 --> 00:51:53,823
Exactly.

1283
00:51:54,423 --> 00:51:55,993
That's how I feel right now.

1284
00:51:57,233 --> 00:52:02,073
(Sang Hyeon finally smiles after the honest conversation.)

1285
00:52:08,513 --> 00:52:11,213
If I ever made you uncomfortable...

1286
00:52:14,383 --> 00:52:16,782
- No, that's okay. - I'm simply sorry.

1287
00:52:16,783 --> 00:52:18,083
Don't say that.

1288
00:52:19,423 --> 00:52:22,122
After hearing what Sang Hyeon had to say,

1289
00:52:22,123 --> 00:52:24,452
I felt like my heart ached for him...

1290
00:52:24,453 --> 00:52:25,963
because of how he had felt.

1291
00:52:26,323 --> 00:52:27,963
I mean, it must have seemed to him...

1292
00:52:28,063 --> 00:52:30,293
like I was already into someone else,

1293
00:52:30,863 --> 00:52:32,902
so he must've worried if he had made me uncomfortable...

1294
00:52:32,903 --> 00:52:35,573
by telling me how he felt about me.

1295
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:38,442
It seemed very considerate of him...

1296
00:52:38,443 --> 00:52:41,103
from my perspective.

1297
00:52:42,173 --> 00:52:46,383
I hoped it didn't break his heart so much.

1298
00:52:47,513 --> 00:52:50,882
(Weren't you being too considerate?)

1299
00:52:50,883 --> 00:52:53,352
I understand that it can be frustrating.

1300
00:52:53,353 --> 00:52:56,352
I feel frustrated too. I'm frustrated with myself sometimes.

1301
00:52:56,353 --> 00:52:58,993
I think I'm too timid.

1302
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:01,323
And I wonder why.

1303
00:53:02,533 --> 00:53:06,462
But when I showed someone whom I was interested in...

1304
00:53:06,463 --> 00:53:10,473
who I really was, little by little,

1305
00:53:11,433 --> 00:53:13,243
things went well between me and her.

1306
00:53:13,573 --> 00:53:17,012
When I met someone who liked that side of me too,

1307
00:53:17,013 --> 00:53:18,813
I was very happy in that relationship.

1308
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:23,853
That's who I am.

1309
00:53:24,983 --> 00:53:27,053
- Let's go up. - Shall we?

1310
00:53:29,323 --> 00:53:31,023
Sang Hyeon is...

1311
00:53:31,993 --> 00:53:34,792
- very serious about this. - He's immersed in it.

1312
00:53:34,793 --> 00:53:37,163
- It's so easy to see that. - That's right.

1313
00:53:37,533 --> 00:53:39,203
It must've required a lot of courage.

1314
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:42,633
And it must've hurt his pride a little bit.

1315
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:47,343
He was whining to ask her to notice his feelings for her.

1316
00:53:47,643 --> 00:53:49,319
- He was whining? - He wasn't complaining though.

1317
00:53:49,343 --> 00:53:52,113
That's because he had no other choice.

1318
00:53:52,443 --> 00:53:55,552
Mu Jin and Bon Hee seemed like a sturdy wall...

1319
00:53:55,553 --> 00:53:57,852
- that wouldn't fall down. - Right.

1320
00:53:57,853 --> 00:54:00,652
So he decided to hit the wall...

1321
00:54:00,653 --> 00:54:02,892
using his entire body.

1322
00:54:02,893 --> 00:54:04,822
He decided to do that, at least.

1323
00:54:04,823 --> 00:54:07,343
(Sang Hyeon made every effort to express his feelings for her.)

1324
00:54:07,723 --> 00:54:08,933
(Sighing)

1325
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,003
(He spots Sang Hyeon.)

1326
00:54:17,773 --> 00:54:21,103
(The two of them pass each other by without saying anything.)

1327
00:54:30,453 --> 00:54:33,283
(Sighing)

1328
00:54:37,053 --> 00:54:38,153
Aren't you hungry?

1329
00:54:39,093 --> 00:54:40,563
Can't we start cooking kimchi stew?

1330
00:54:40,623 --> 00:54:42,163
We don't have the ingredients yet.

1331
00:54:43,233 --> 00:54:44,233
Is it done?

1332
00:54:44,234 --> 00:54:45,362
- Do we just have to set the table? - We just have to wait.

1333
00:54:45,363 --> 00:54:46,762
We have to keep boiling it for 10 or 20 minutes.

1334
00:54:46,763 --> 00:54:48,443
- It's too easy. - What else will we have?

1335
00:54:49,533 --> 00:54:51,232
I took out pork neck, so we could grill it.

1336
00:54:51,233 --> 00:54:53,543
- We can also have ramyeon. - Han River ramyeon?

1337
00:54:54,003 --> 00:54:55,372
I didn't see Han River ramyeon.

1338
00:54:55,373 --> 00:54:57,613
(Bothered)

1339
00:54:59,143 --> 00:55:01,983
(Is he flirting in the way INFPs flirt?)

1340
00:55:02,253 --> 00:55:03,852
- I took it out. - We can also have ramyeon.

1341
00:55:03,853 --> 00:55:05,153
Han River ramyeon?

1342
00:55:05,353 --> 00:55:09,153
(Mu Jin brings a chair right away.)

1343
00:55:09,953 --> 00:55:12,462
- Think of Han River ramyeon. - Should I? I couldn't think of it.

1344
00:55:12,463 --> 00:55:14,193
(He puts his chair right next to Bon Hee.)

1345
00:55:14,663 --> 00:55:16,492
(Looking around nervously)

1346
00:55:16,493 --> 00:55:18,362
Ji Yung is good at making rolled omelet.

1347
00:55:18,363 --> 00:55:19,532
(Mu Jin sits next to Bon Hee naturally.)

1348
00:55:19,533 --> 00:55:20,633
Rolled omelet?

1349
00:55:21,533 --> 00:55:23,002
That would make it like Japanese cuisine.

1350
00:55:23,003 --> 00:55:25,133
It would taste great if you add some seasoning.

1351
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,103
Aren't you hungry?

1352
00:55:28,243 --> 00:55:31,173
I've been so out of it, so I'm not so hungry right now.

1353
00:55:31,513 --> 00:55:33,242
And I ate so much of kimchi fried rice earlier.

1354
00:55:33,243 --> 00:55:34,603
- I see. - It should be all right.

1355
00:55:42,623 --> 00:55:47,963
(Their feelings are entangled at Yeon House this evening.)

1356
00:55:48,663 --> 00:55:50,933
- This place is so nice. - It's beautiful.

1357
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:52,493
There's a swimming pool here.

1358
00:55:53,063 --> 00:55:55,533
They decorated the walls with bows.

1359
00:55:56,003 --> 00:55:57,503
It's beautiful.

1360
00:55:58,573 --> 00:56:00,303
- Please sit. - Thank you.

1361
00:56:02,573 --> 00:56:04,873
- It looks good. - It looks really tasty.

1362
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:09,483
- Let's eat. - Can we eat it right now?

1363
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:14,323
You can sit and relax. I'll cook these deliciously.

1364
00:56:16,093 --> 00:56:17,953
It will be so tasty.

1365
00:56:19,163 --> 00:56:20,222
This looks so good.

1366
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,103
(Chicken stir fry is being cooked deliciously.)

1367
00:56:22,933 --> 00:56:25,093
- Should we reduce the heat? - Yes, we should do that.

1368
00:56:26,963 --> 00:56:29,402
- Three, maybe. It's almost done. - Three?

1369
00:56:29,403 --> 00:56:31,403
What? Already?

1370
00:56:31,473 --> 00:56:33,572
It's good even when it's barely cooked.

1371
00:56:33,573 --> 00:56:34,673
No.

1372
00:56:35,313 --> 00:56:37,013
I don't want to get a stomachache.

1373
00:56:39,243 --> 00:56:41,982
How should I say this? Are you the type...

1374
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,052
that doesn't get sick from eating undercooked food?

1375
00:56:44,053 --> 00:56:45,253
- Me? Yes. - I knew it.

1376
00:56:45,283 --> 00:56:46,953
You're the really healthy type.

1377
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:49,323
I don't get sick often.

1378
00:56:50,753 --> 00:56:51,992
I think we can have alcohol.

1379
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:53,122
- Really? - Yes.

1380
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:54,293
Shall we have some, then?

1381
00:56:54,893 --> 00:56:55,893
(Exclaiming)

1382
00:56:55,894 --> 00:56:56,992
- Is it good? - It's so good.

1383
00:56:56,993 --> 00:56:57,993
Really?

1384
00:57:01,163 --> 00:57:02,173
(Surprised)

1385
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:04,103
- It's delicious! - It's really delicious.

1386
00:57:05,643 --> 00:57:07,873
(Proud)

1387
00:57:10,843 --> 00:57:13,083
By the way, out of the three exercises,

1388
00:57:13,343 --> 00:57:14,883
which one was the toughest?

1389
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:16,383
- Chin-ups. - This one?

1390
00:57:16,883 --> 00:57:18,513
Is that normally the hardest one?

1391
00:57:19,123 --> 00:57:20,453
It's not really that.

1392
00:57:20,723 --> 00:57:24,123
If you weigh more, you're at a disadvantage, for sure.

1393
00:57:26,023 --> 00:57:28,593
I tried really hard. For real.

1394
00:57:28,763 --> 00:57:30,133
That's the truth.

1395
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:32,533
So, after the morning date,

1396
00:57:33,463 --> 00:57:35,933
I was thinking, "That was my last date for the day."

1397
00:57:36,433 --> 00:57:38,232
- Did you think we would all... - Today,

1398
00:57:38,233 --> 00:57:39,603
we ate as a group of six.

1399
00:57:40,973 --> 00:57:43,873
But I wanted to talk to you more,

1400
00:57:45,383 --> 00:57:47,682
so I was wondering, "Do I have to wait until tomorrow?" But then...

1401
00:57:47,683 --> 00:57:49,083
I thought it was my birthday today.

1402
00:57:49,283 --> 00:57:50,352
Did you hear that?

1403
00:57:50,353 --> 00:57:52,382
- He thought it was his birthday. - What an expression.

1404
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,882
- He's good at sweet-talking. - All right.

1405
00:57:53,883 --> 00:57:55,252
All right. Write that down now.

1406
00:57:55,253 --> 00:57:56,699
- He knows how to flirt. - "I thought it was my birthday."

1407
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,622
- He sure knows how to flatter. - That kind of expression...

1408
00:57:58,623 --> 00:58:00,362
only comes from sincerity.

1409
00:58:00,363 --> 00:58:01,692
- Yes. - That's nice.

1410
00:58:01,693 --> 00:58:04,033
I think that's the charm of a younger guy.

1411
00:58:04,593 --> 00:58:06,003
I thought it was my birthday today.

1412
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,403
And the event just happened to be...

1413
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:10,872
It was perfect for you.

1414
00:58:10,873 --> 00:58:11,973
Perfect for me.

1415
00:58:12,643 --> 00:58:13,942
(For Ji Yung, today was like a birthday present.)

1416
00:58:13,943 --> 00:58:15,243
I was so happy.

1417
00:58:15,613 --> 00:58:17,912
Goodness, it even felt like your birthday?

1418
00:58:17,913 --> 00:58:19,483
(Chuckling)

1419
00:58:22,283 --> 00:58:23,853
Can I ask who you chose yesterday?

1420
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,823
Did you send it to the person you wanted to talk to the most?

1421
00:58:27,383 --> 00:58:29,852
Did you just ask who I chose yesterday?

1422
00:58:29,853 --> 00:58:30,853
Yes.

1423
00:58:30,854 --> 00:58:32,494
- Who did I choose? - Who did you choose?

1424
00:58:32,923 --> 00:58:34,363
- Do you want me to tell you? - Yes.

1425
00:58:34,393 --> 00:58:36,663
- Well... - Tell me who you chose first.

1426
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:37,962
- Me? - Yes.

1427
00:58:37,963 --> 00:58:38,963
He's in trouble.

1428
00:58:38,964 --> 00:58:40,062
Now that you put it like that,

1429
00:58:40,063 --> 00:58:41,163
- I can't say it. - See?

1430
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,803
I can tell you, though.

1431
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:47,302
There was someone I wanted to talk to more.

1432
00:58:47,303 --> 00:58:48,913
- Oh, really? There was just one? - Yes.

1433
00:58:49,373 --> 00:58:51,573
Yes. There was one person.

1434
00:58:51,813 --> 00:58:53,183
So, who did you choose?

1435
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:54,383
(Laughing)

1436
00:58:54,483 --> 00:58:55,912
- You go first. Yes? - I brought it up myself,

1437
00:58:55,913 --> 00:58:58,389
- but I'm regretting it now. - You're regretting it, aren't you?

1438
00:58:58,413 --> 00:58:59,753
I think I made a mistake.

1439
00:59:01,253 --> 00:59:02,453
Who would you have chosen?

1440
00:59:03,323 --> 00:59:04,593
I'm curious who you chose.

1441
00:59:04,823 --> 00:59:05,992
Don't say it, both of you.

1442
00:59:05,993 --> 00:59:07,463
Then, yesterday,

1443
00:59:08,363 --> 00:59:09,792
people voted for each other...

1444
00:59:09,793 --> 00:59:11,709
- and checked each other's, right? - That's right.

1445
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:13,003
How many votes did you get?

1446
00:59:14,163 --> 00:59:15,333
I got one.

1447
00:59:16,133 --> 00:59:17,632
But here's what's fascinating about the guys.

1448
00:59:17,633 --> 00:59:19,679
Am I allowed to say this? Is this too big a spoiler?

1449
00:59:19,703 --> 00:59:20,872
Did everyone get one vote each?

1450
00:59:20,873 --> 00:59:22,473
I think so, based on our conversation.

1451
00:59:25,313 --> 00:59:27,382
(She found out that only she sent Sang Hyeon a Love QR Code.)

1452
00:59:27,383 --> 00:59:28,543
That is fascinating.

1453
00:59:29,183 --> 00:59:31,353
Then, she might find a bit more courage...

1454
00:59:31,813 --> 00:59:33,373
since she doesn't have any competitors.

1455
00:59:33,453 --> 00:59:34,823
This place is so nice, by the way.

1456
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,223
- Then, let's change into swimsuits. - Yes?

1457
00:59:41,893 --> 00:59:44,133
Let's change into swimsuits and show me your skills.

1458
00:59:47,203 --> 00:59:49,832
(Ji Yung changed into his swimsuit.)

1459
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:51,503
He has a great build.

1460
00:59:52,773 --> 00:59:54,073
Ji Yung is seriously...

1461
00:59:54,373 --> 00:59:56,943
Rugby players are just built differently.

1462
00:59:57,643 --> 01:00:00,582
I mean, his body looks like it's four-dimensional.

1463
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:03,482
I think... It's only been a day since So Hyun arrived.

1464
01:00:03,483 --> 01:00:05,082
How can he appear shirtless in a single day?

1465
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:07,922
Well, I'm guessing that Ji Yung thought...

1466
01:00:07,923 --> 01:00:09,393
that was his charming point.

1467
01:00:11,023 --> 01:00:12,292
- Is the water warm? - Yes.

1468
01:00:12,293 --> 01:00:14,262
- Since the water is warm... - Are you really not cold?

1469
01:00:14,263 --> 01:00:17,793
I'm okay now since I have a towel around me.

1470
01:00:20,263 --> 01:00:21,603
- Is it warm? - Oh, my.

1471
01:00:21,903 --> 01:00:23,473
- Is it warm? - This is so nice.

1472
01:00:25,173 --> 01:00:27,043
- It's warm. - It's so warm.

1473
01:00:27,673 --> 01:00:29,213
It's really warm.

1474
01:00:35,013 --> 01:00:37,653
Out of all the places you went swimming, which place was the best?

1475
01:00:38,923 --> 01:00:41,953
The sea in Australia is really beautiful. There...

1476
01:00:42,123 --> 01:00:43,353
Who did you hang out with?

1477
01:00:43,993 --> 01:00:45,053
- Me? - Yes.

1478
01:00:45,623 --> 01:00:46,722
That's a secret.

1479
01:00:46,723 --> 01:00:48,423
(Smiling)

1480
01:00:48,563 --> 01:00:50,232
- What do you mean it's a secret? - By myself.

1481
01:00:50,233 --> 01:00:51,913
- You had fun by yourself. - That's right.

1482
01:00:52,133 --> 01:00:53,732
Yes, you had fun by yourself.

1483
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,573
(Slightly taken aback)

1484
01:00:56,033 --> 01:00:59,273
It's kind of cute when you get flustered.

1485
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,442
- I'm usually not like this. - Oh, really?

1486
01:01:02,443 --> 01:01:04,173
- I'm literally going crazy. - Really?

1487
01:01:04,843 --> 01:01:06,883
Normally, I just...

1488
01:01:07,543 --> 01:01:10,953
say what I want to say honestly.

1489
01:01:12,723 --> 01:01:14,452
I'm not sure why I'm doing this.

1490
01:01:14,453 --> 01:01:15,693
I keep behaving awkwardly.

1491
01:01:16,623 --> 01:01:17,853
Are you maybe nervous?

1492
01:01:20,663 --> 01:01:21,892
- A bit? - Oh, a bit.

1493
01:01:21,893 --> 01:01:22,893
A bit.

1494
01:01:23,593 --> 01:01:25,293
I'm sure that can happen.

1495
01:01:25,363 --> 01:01:26,763
I usually don't get nervous at all.

1496
01:01:27,733 --> 01:01:29,832
"How cute would I seem to her?"

1497
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,203
I suddenly had that thought.

1498
01:01:31,473 --> 01:01:34,473
Normally, I would've flirted with her as I found her cute,

1499
01:01:35,003 --> 01:01:37,973
but it seemed like she found me way too cute instead.

1500
01:01:38,543 --> 01:01:39,843
But this is so...

1501
01:01:41,143 --> 01:01:43,613
It didn't feel all that great.

1502
01:01:44,013 --> 01:01:47,153
But this is a first for me.

1503
01:01:47,483 --> 01:01:49,993
I didn't know how to behave.

1504
01:01:50,223 --> 01:01:52,183
That's cute. I see he has that kind of charm too.

1505
01:01:52,393 --> 01:01:55,463
(Stay calm.)

1506
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:58,133
Do you like guys with nice bodies?

1507
01:01:58,763 --> 01:02:00,133
Someone with a nice body?

1508
01:02:00,233 --> 01:02:01,233
(Getting his hopes up)

1509
01:02:01,234 --> 01:02:02,833
A man with a nice body?

1510
01:02:03,003 --> 01:02:06,443
To be honest, my personal taste...

1511
01:02:07,073 --> 01:02:08,802
Rather than big muscles,

1512
01:02:08,803 --> 01:02:10,712
- Like lean muscles? - I like slim but fit muscles.

1513
01:02:10,713 --> 01:02:11,912
I prefer more slender...

1514
01:02:11,913 --> 01:02:13,112
Someone who looks good in most outfits.

1515
01:02:13,113 --> 01:02:14,582
That's right.

1516
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:15,753
That's not me, then.

1517
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:19,483
- That's just my personal taste. - Okay.

1518
01:02:20,883 --> 01:02:23,493
(Disappointed)

1519
01:02:24,493 --> 01:02:27,963
But So Hyun... Even though he took his shirt off,

1520
01:02:28,063 --> 01:02:31,733
she said, "I like a man with lean muscles."

1521
01:02:32,933 --> 01:02:35,563
If she liked Ji Yung, she wouldn't have said that.

1522
01:02:36,403 --> 01:02:38,132
She could've said, "I don't really care about that."

1523
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:41,702
Or maybe like, "I like guys with bigger muscles."

1524
01:02:41,703 --> 01:02:43,303
- She would've said that. - That's true.

1525
01:02:43,373 --> 01:02:46,182
Also, he said, "As for the men,"

1526
01:02:46,183 --> 01:02:48,942
"I think we each got one vote."

1527
01:02:48,943 --> 01:02:50,413
That's what he said earlier.

1528
01:02:51,513 --> 01:02:52,753
He's totally unaware.

1529
01:02:53,483 --> 01:02:56,353
But on this date, that actually became...

1530
01:02:56,723 --> 01:02:58,852
the thing that made So Hyun...

1531
01:02:58,853 --> 01:03:01,223
yearn for Sang Hyeon even more.

1532
01:03:01,663 --> 01:03:03,892
"What's this? I don't have any competitors."

1533
01:03:03,893 --> 01:03:05,962
"Okay! He only got my vote!"

1534
01:03:05,963 --> 01:03:07,533
That's what this turned into.

1535
01:03:07,733 --> 01:03:09,873
"Okay!" That's how things went.

1536
01:03:10,273 --> 01:03:11,702
- Are you still cold? - Yes.

1537
01:03:11,703 --> 01:03:13,442
- I'll try to find... - I don't think I want to eat,

1538
01:03:13,443 --> 01:03:14,473
but I'm not sure.

1539
01:03:16,213 --> 01:03:18,413
- It's quiet. - Hello.

1540
01:03:19,483 --> 01:03:21,343
Hello.

1541
01:03:22,313 --> 01:03:24,182
- Why are you back so late? - How far did you guys go?

1542
01:03:24,183 --> 01:03:26,553
- You look like you drank a lot. - You look tired.

1543
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:29,053
Do I seem like I had drinks?

1544
01:03:31,993 --> 01:03:34,822
(So Hyun goes upstairs, and Ji Yung follows her.)

1545
01:03:34,823 --> 01:03:36,232
You've had a long day.

1546
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:38,032
(Ji Yung follows her as well as Sang Hyeon.)

1547
01:03:38,033 --> 01:03:40,233
Hang on. Sang Hyeon is right on his tail.

1548
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:42,603
What were you guys doing?

1549
01:03:43,233 --> 01:03:44,833
- Who? Us? - Yes.

1550
01:03:45,173 --> 01:03:47,902
We got some sleep and talked a bit too.

1551
01:03:47,903 --> 01:03:50,042
- And you guys ate? - By the way, your outfit is pretty.

1552
01:03:50,043 --> 01:03:51,412
- Oh, really? - It's so...

1553
01:03:51,413 --> 01:03:53,582
It's subtle, but it's beautiful.

1554
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:55,682
- It sure is different. - Yes, it's somehow...

1555
01:03:55,683 --> 01:03:56,782
Thank you.

1556
01:03:56,783 --> 01:03:59,122
Is that jacket "one size fits all?" For men and women?

1557
01:03:59,123 --> 01:04:01,282
This? I don't know. Do you want to try it on?

1558
01:04:01,283 --> 01:04:03,293
No, I wasn't trying to borrow your clothes.

1559
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:05,193
- Oh, you should get some rest. - Okay.

1560
01:04:08,423 --> 01:04:10,092
- Bon Hee. - Yes?

1561
01:04:10,093 --> 01:04:11,492
She became happier just now.

1562
01:04:11,493 --> 01:04:13,002
It's because Sang Hyeon complimented her.

1563
01:04:13,003 --> 01:04:14,563
- Was it fun? How was it? - Well,

1564
01:04:15,033 --> 01:04:16,603
it was fun, but...

1565
01:04:17,403 --> 01:04:19,842
I can tell you, right?

1566
01:04:19,843 --> 01:04:20,902
- Yes. - Okay.

1567
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:25,713
I think I like someone else.

1568
01:04:26,443 --> 01:04:28,012
Oh, no!

1569
01:04:28,013 --> 01:04:29,952
- He just has a good personality, - I feel so bad for Ji Yung.

1570
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:31,653
- so I did have fun. - Right.

1571
01:04:31,853 --> 01:04:33,082
But...

1572
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:35,753
I didn't feel really giddy or happy.

1573
01:04:36,493 --> 01:04:38,823
- It was just pleasant. - So, it was pleasant.

1574
01:04:40,123 --> 01:04:42,192
(Ji Yung is talking to Hyeon Jun too.)

1575
01:04:42,193 --> 01:04:43,563
Until this point in my life,

1576
01:04:45,633 --> 01:04:48,232
I don't think I've talked to anyone else who was this...

1577
01:04:48,233 --> 01:04:50,233
- Easy to talk to? - That's how it felt earlier.

1578
01:04:50,473 --> 01:04:54,803
It felt like she was catering to me on purpose.

1579
01:04:55,143 --> 01:04:57,673
She was so comfortable and nice.

1580
01:04:59,073 --> 01:05:00,183
She was so nice.

1581
01:05:00,613 --> 01:05:01,983
- I'm glad to hear that. - Oh, no.

1582
01:05:02,283 --> 01:05:03,382
- You did great. - I know.

1583
01:05:03,383 --> 01:05:04,613
This is bad. What do we do?

1584
01:05:06,753 --> 01:05:08,682
- So, can I ask you something? - About what?

1585
01:05:08,683 --> 01:05:10,423
Is there someone you like?

1586
01:05:10,793 --> 01:05:13,723
- Can I ask you? - I think I like Mu Jin.

1587
01:05:14,263 --> 01:05:15,323
Oh, really?

1588
01:05:15,933 --> 01:05:16,933
I like...

1589
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:19,403
Sang Hyeon.

1590
01:05:19,903 --> 01:05:21,003
Oh, really?

1591
01:05:22,133 --> 01:05:23,333
But the thing is,

1592
01:05:24,173 --> 01:05:26,642
I want to keep talking to him,

1593
01:05:26,643 --> 01:05:28,273
but I never get the chance to do so.

1594
01:05:31,143 --> 01:05:35,583
(Meanwhile, Sang Hyeon is talking on the terrace.)

1595
01:05:37,653 --> 01:05:40,382
(After meticulously checking her appearance, )

1596
01:05:40,383 --> 01:05:42,022
I'll be back.

1597
01:05:42,023 --> 01:05:44,153
(So Hyun leaves the room.)

1598
01:05:44,853 --> 01:05:48,522
(Then, she heads to the terrace.)

1599
01:05:48,523 --> 01:05:50,263
It must be a ten, not a hundred.

1600
01:05:51,263 --> 01:05:52,803
(Hiding)

1601
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:56,073
(She hides herself after seeing so many people.)

1602
01:05:56,673 --> 01:05:58,932
(Peeking)

1603
01:05:58,933 --> 01:06:00,372
(Do you want me to get Sang Hyeon?)

1604
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,373
(Nodding)

1605
01:06:01,455 --> 01:06:05,124
(Then, she heads to the terrace.)

1606
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:06,465
It must be a ten, not a hundred.

1607
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:09,495
(Hiding)

1608
01:06:10,165 --> 01:06:12,765
(She hides herself after seeing so many people.)

1609
01:06:13,335 --> 01:06:15,504
(Peeking)

1610
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:16,904
(Do you want me to get Sang Hyeon?)

1611
01:06:16,905 --> 01:06:18,275
(Nodding)

1612
01:06:18,505 --> 01:06:22,045
(Communicating with her head)

1613
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:24,375
(Tapping)
(She's asking for you.)

1614
01:06:25,376 --> 01:06:26,544
(Getting right up)

1615
01:06:26,545 --> 01:06:27,814
It's a good thing Ji Yung isn't there.

1616
01:06:27,815 --> 01:06:30,355
(Thanks to Hyeon Jun, So Hyun gets Sang Hyeon's attention.)

1617
01:06:31,015 --> 01:06:33,025
(Turning around)

1618
01:06:34,525 --> 01:06:36,855
Yeong Gyeong is also kind of interested in Sang Hyeon.

1619
01:06:39,065 --> 01:06:41,795
(Why isn't he coming?)

1620
01:06:43,565 --> 01:06:44,765
What? Why?

1621
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:47,504
- Can he not open the door? - Is the door maybe locked?

1622
01:06:47,505 --> 01:06:48,804
(Sang Hyeon is struggling with the door.)

1623
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:50,004
It won't open.

1624
01:06:50,005 --> 01:06:51,905
- He's taking the door off. - Oh, I got it.

1625
01:06:53,645 --> 01:06:55,715
- Shall we talk for a bit? - Pardon?

1626
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:58,175
- Let's talk. - Oh, okay.

1627
01:06:58,575 --> 01:06:59,884
Shall we talk on the first floor?

1628
01:06:59,885 --> 01:07:01,914
- Oh, you mean talk about us? - Yes.

1629
01:07:01,915 --> 01:07:04,414
I thought someone else was asking for me.

1630
01:07:04,415 --> 01:07:05,454
- Oh, no. - Then,

1631
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:08,455
shall we go somewhere else like the second floor?

1632
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:14,225
(They end up coming up to the men's floor.)

1633
01:07:15,165 --> 01:07:16,334
Oh, wait.

1634
01:07:16,335 --> 01:07:18,065
(Backing up)

1635
01:07:19,305 --> 01:07:20,835
Let me close the door.

1636
01:07:22,105 --> 01:07:23,335
Come this way.

1637
01:07:23,405 --> 01:07:24,634
Where?

1638
01:07:24,635 --> 01:07:26,995
(Sang Hyeon leads her to the terrace in front of his room.)

1639
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:29,874
Oh, there's a place like this?

1640
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:31,914
It's where I secretly work out.

1641
01:07:31,915 --> 01:07:33,084
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1642
01:07:33,085 --> 01:07:34,245
This is nice.

1643
01:07:34,285 --> 01:07:36,454
- Her energy is totally different. - Right.

1644
01:07:36,455 --> 01:07:38,484
Her voice has gotten higher. "This is nice."

1645
01:07:38,485 --> 01:07:40,045
She didn't say stuff like that earlier.

1646
01:07:40,485 --> 01:07:43,325
- Did you enjoy your evening? - Yes, I did.

1647
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:46,464
- I had chicken stir fry today. - Really?

1648
01:07:46,465 --> 01:07:48,164
I thought you'd have grilled meat.

1649
01:07:48,165 --> 01:07:49,964
Well, there was meat,

1650
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:53,504
but I wanted chicken more, so we had chicken stir fry.

1651
01:07:53,505 --> 01:07:54,764
Was it good?

1652
01:07:54,765 --> 01:07:55,874
It was.

1653
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:57,175
What about the person?

1654
01:07:57,235 --> 01:07:59,104
- The person? - The person you went with.

1655
01:07:59,105 --> 01:08:00,274
The person I went with?

1656
01:08:00,275 --> 01:08:03,214
Did you talk a lot with the person you went with?

1657
01:08:03,215 --> 01:08:06,785
Well, we talked a lot since we were...

1658
01:08:06,985 --> 01:08:08,685
together the whole time.

1659
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:13,124
But I... Earlier,

1660
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:16,425
when you guys exercised for the mission,

1661
01:08:16,795 --> 01:08:18,454
- I was rooting for you. - Oh, me?

1662
01:08:18,455 --> 01:08:20,724
- Yes, I rooted for you. - Really?

1663
01:08:20,725 --> 01:08:22,205
And I thought, "I hope he does well,"

1664
01:08:23,135 --> 01:08:26,404
"so we can go on a date together." Well, you might not have picked me.

1665
01:08:26,405 --> 01:08:30,434
- Oh, right. - But that was what I was thinking.

1666
01:08:30,435 --> 01:08:31,435
(So Hyun carefully expresses her feelings.)

1667
01:08:31,436 --> 01:08:36,114
So, I wanted to talk to you.

1668
01:08:36,115 --> 01:08:37,914
- That's what I thought. - Oh, really?

1669
01:08:37,915 --> 01:08:38,945
Yes.

1670
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,644
(Sighing)

1671
01:08:40,645 --> 01:08:43,385
- Goodness, let me catch my breath. - Why?

1672
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:47,925
I gave you water first too.

1673
01:08:48,455 --> 01:08:49,695
Oh, did you?

1674
01:08:50,455 --> 01:08:52,194
But I was only thinking of...

1675
01:08:52,195 --> 01:08:53,894
giving the water to those behind me quickly.

1676
01:08:53,895 --> 01:08:55,365
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1677
01:08:56,035 --> 01:08:59,734
(So Hyun went to Sang Hyeon as soon as the game ended.)

1678
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:01,904
(However, )

1679
01:09:01,905 --> 01:09:05,235
(that bottle of water went straight to Hyeon Jun.)

1680
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:08,244
- I made sure to give you water. - Really?

1681
01:09:08,245 --> 01:09:09,314
If I also gave you a towel,

1682
01:09:09,315 --> 01:09:10,944
I thought it would've been too obvious.

1683
01:09:10,945 --> 01:09:12,075
Oh, really?

1684
01:09:12,845 --> 01:09:14,615
Gosh, I had no idea.

1685
01:09:16,455 --> 01:09:18,215
Anyway, that's how I felt.

1686
01:09:20,985 --> 01:09:24,894
- I'm not really sure at this point, - Sure.

1687
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:27,994
- but what I felt at first... - Yes?

1688
01:09:27,995 --> 01:09:29,494
Was that you were very calm...

1689
01:09:29,495 --> 01:09:34,565
and that you had the vibe of someone with a good heart.

1690
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:37,335
I was thinking that.

1691
01:09:37,935 --> 01:09:39,544
I had less time than the others,

1692
01:09:39,545 --> 01:09:42,715
and those who have seen you longer kept talking about that...

1693
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:45,115
when we were all together.

1694
01:09:45,685 --> 01:09:46,914
- Oh, okay. - So, I thought,

1695
01:09:46,915 --> 01:09:47,985
"My judgment was right."

1696
01:09:48,285 --> 01:09:49,615
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1697
01:09:50,255 --> 01:09:52,755
"Is that so?" I was thinking that as well.

1698
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:57,324
"I kind of want to talk to him."

1699
01:09:57,325 --> 01:10:00,025
That was on my mind.

1700
01:10:03,965 --> 01:10:05,095
By the way,

1701
01:10:05,765 --> 01:10:07,964
I never thought you'd approach me like this.

1702
01:10:07,965 --> 01:10:10,175
- Really? - No, not at all.

1703
01:10:11,535 --> 01:10:13,044
If I'm to be totally honest,

1704
01:10:13,045 --> 01:10:16,075
- when we were... When you entered, - Yes?

1705
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:18,114
- I didn't really think much of it. - Okay.

1706
01:10:18,115 --> 01:10:19,845
I just thought, "She's here."

1707
01:10:20,885 --> 01:10:23,284
"She looks like an actress. She has a beautiful face."

1708
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:26,055
That's all I thought about, not anything beyond that.

1709
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:27,785
She must be disappointed.

1710
01:10:28,585 --> 01:10:29,824
He didn't have the time for it.

1711
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:33,194
I actually had someone else in mind from the beginning.

1712
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,225
I mean, I don't know if you guessed that.

1713
01:10:37,435 --> 01:10:40,565
So, I just had a headache from dealing with that.

1714
01:10:41,105 --> 01:10:43,034
(I see.)

1715
01:10:43,035 --> 01:10:44,405
But anyway,

1716
01:10:45,305 --> 01:10:47,975
I will always keep you in mind.

1717
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:52,784
Whatever it is, no matter what I choose,

1718
01:10:52,785 --> 01:10:55,144
I will at least do so with you in mind.

1719
01:10:55,145 --> 01:10:56,354
That's something I can also...

1720
01:10:56,355 --> 01:10:58,191
(Sang Hyeon tries to consider So Hyun who was courageous.)

1721
01:10:58,215 --> 01:11:01,785
Since it happened out of the blue, I was really bewildered.

1722
01:11:02,355 --> 01:11:05,324
The fact that someone was rooting for me...

1723
01:11:05,325 --> 01:11:07,195
was quite fascinating.

1724
01:11:07,665 --> 01:11:09,264
I found out how the other person feels,

1725
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,895
and he said he was grateful that I approached him.

1726
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:14,305
So, for now, I think it's a green light.

1727
01:11:17,035 --> 01:11:18,875
Right. You have to express yourself like that.

1728
01:11:19,145 --> 01:11:21,105
Yes, you have to express yourself no matter what.

1729
01:11:21,605 --> 01:11:23,814
I felt bad for him before,

1730
01:11:23,815 --> 01:11:26,914
but because So Hyun came into the picture,

1731
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:28,815
his face seems to be lighting up again.

1732
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:31,184
It was so nice...

1733
01:11:31,185 --> 01:11:34,155
- that I can watch them lighting up. - That's right.

1734
01:11:34,855 --> 01:11:36,654
Well, the other women...

1735
01:11:36,655 --> 01:11:39,394
have said that they were interested in Sang Hyeon too,

1736
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:41,824
but I don't think anyone directly expressed it.

1737
01:11:41,825 --> 01:11:43,134
- You're right. No one did. - Right.

1738
01:11:43,135 --> 01:11:46,304
But So Hyun was the first to say...

1739
01:11:46,305 --> 01:11:47,564
- that she was rooting for him. - Yes.

1740
01:11:47,565 --> 01:11:48,904
Don't you think that was a huge confidence booster?

1741
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:51,374
Actually, he was really fighting a lonely fight.

1742
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:52,804
- Right. - Hearing that someone...

1743
01:11:52,805 --> 01:11:54,104
was rooting for him...

1744
01:11:54,105 --> 01:11:55,604
must've been a huge comfort.

1745
01:11:55,605 --> 01:11:58,844
You know, SOOBIN has this low...

1746
01:11:58,845 --> 01:12:01,514
and even tone of voice as he speaks nonchalantly,

1747
01:12:01,515 --> 01:12:04,414
but there are very harsh hidden meanings in his words.

1748
01:12:04,415 --> 01:12:05,785
(SOOBIN's harsh manner of speech)

1749
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:07,154
Sang Hyeon might not realize it,

1750
01:12:07,155 --> 01:12:09,624
but he probably won't look at So Hyun the same way.

1751
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:10,894
- Sang Hyeon? - Yes.

1752
01:12:10,895 --> 01:12:12,895
(Will there be any changes in Sang Hyeon's heart?)

1753
01:12:12,965 --> 01:12:15,065
(While Sang Hyeon and So Hyun are talking, )

1754
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:18,995
(Ji Yung happens to come looking for So Hyun.)

1755
01:12:19,565 --> 01:12:20,805
(Quietly walking over)

1756
01:12:22,535 --> 01:12:25,175
(He finds So Hyun talking to Sang Hyeon.)

1757
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:30,315
(Ji Yung's night goes by with complicated feelings.)

1758
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:31,574
- Me too. - Then, shall we talk?

1759
01:12:31,575 --> 01:12:33,385
(And...)

1760
01:12:34,245 --> 01:12:39,855
(Sang Won starts to approach Ji Won.)

1761
01:12:39,885 --> 01:12:42,184
- But there's no mirror there. - Right.

1762
01:12:42,185 --> 01:12:43,194
And without a phone,

1763
01:12:43,195 --> 01:12:44,755
- I had nothing to do. - That's right.

1764
01:12:44,795 --> 01:12:49,435
(It bothers Ye Eun that Sang Won and Ji Won have grown closer.)

1765
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:52,835
- Are you curious about anyone else? - Someone I'm curious about?

1766
01:12:55,265 --> 01:12:57,835
(I can't say it now.)

1767
01:12:58,005 --> 01:13:01,005
(The night at Yeon House is tangled up with complicated emotions.)

1768
01:13:01,475 --> 01:13:04,245
(The women are getting ready for their dates.)

1769
01:13:04,575 --> 01:13:08,044
(They seem to care a lot more today.)

1770
01:13:08,045 --> 01:13:11,284
(Today, it's a memory date with the women.)

1771
01:13:11,285 --> 01:13:16,895
(Put a memorable photo in the drawer of the younger man you like.)

1772
01:13:17,255 --> 01:13:20,925
(Who is the man that the women want to share their memories with?)

1773
01:13:21,695 --> 01:13:23,615
(I think there was a good sense of nervousness.)

1774
01:13:26,705 --> 01:13:28,735
(She might be the one I was looking for.)

1775
01:13:28,865 --> 01:13:31,175
(I want to go with you.)

1776
01:13:31,705 --> 01:13:32,945
Does she like me?

1777
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:35,074
I like this so much.

1778
01:13:35,075 --> 01:13:36,815
I think I'll really remember this.

1779
01:13:37,175 --> 01:13:42,345
(With an added sweet scent, the date feels even more exciting.)

1780
01:13:42,955 --> 01:13:45,055
(A day filled with new memories)

1781
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,585
(It makes their feelings grow deeper.)

1782
01:13:48,325 --> 01:13:50,355
(That night)

1783
01:13:50,795 --> 01:13:51,955
How is Sang Won?

1784
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:55,194
- I'd like to... - Get to know him more?

1785
01:13:55,195 --> 01:13:56,765
Get to know him more, I think?

1786
01:13:58,465 --> 01:14:01,265
(A war of nerves between the two women with their eyes on Sang Won)
