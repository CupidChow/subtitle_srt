1
00:00:00,203 --> 00:00:01,843
(At Yeon House after the Memory Date)

2
00:00:03,343 --> 00:00:05,912
(We had to speak casually.)

3
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:09,112
(Mu Jin jokingly addressed me as an older woman a few times, )

4
00:00:09,113 --> 00:00:12,853
(and I got a reality check.)

5
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:16,053
(Noona, your hands are pretty too.)

6
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:19,192
(If Mu Jin is 11 or 12 years younger than me, )

7
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:22,463
(I'd wonder if I'd be okay with it.)

8
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:25,893
(Bon Hee thinks more deeply about the age gap.)

9
00:00:26,203 --> 00:00:27,502
(Sighing)

10
00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:29,103
(I have so much on my mind.)

11
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:34,673
(I think today's date was perfect for me.)

12
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:38,272
(Ye Eun and Ji Won could be compared right away through the dates.)

13
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:41,613
(I was more comfortable speaking casually to Ye Eun.)

14
00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:44,152
(But the one whom I hit it off well with...)

15
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:45,412
(was Ji Won, clearly.)

16
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,159
(I felt more energetic when I was with her.)

17
00:00:47,183 --> 00:00:49,693
(Sang Won's night is getting complex with many thoughts.)

18
00:00:50,023 --> 00:00:52,453
(Meanwhile, Ye Eun and Ji Won are out in the living room.)

19
00:00:53,993 --> 00:00:56,063
(How was your date with Sang Won?)

20
00:00:58,093 --> 00:01:00,102
(It was fun.)

21
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:01,633
(How was your date?)

22
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:04,132
(I want...)

23
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,172
(You want to get to know him more?)

24
00:01:05,173 --> 00:01:06,803
(I want to get to know him better.)

25
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:13,683
(No longer hiding her feelings for Sang Won)

26
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:18,213
(In here, Sang Won is the only one I am interested in.)

27
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:22,792
(And in this situation, Ji Won appeared.)

28
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:25,692
(So, from my point of view, )

29
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:27,893
(I don't feel all that great, if I'm to be honest.)

30
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:30,433
(Knocking)

31
00:01:30,593 --> 00:01:32,363
(At that moment, Ji Won appears.)

32
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:35,263
(The conversation dies down as soon as Ji Won enters the room.)

33
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,332
(Clicking her tongue)

34
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,373
(Sighing)

35
00:01:40,943 --> 00:01:44,873
(A cold atmosphere lingers among the older women.)

36
00:01:47,143 --> 00:01:49,952
(The next day, at random, )

37
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:54,323
(the group Over or Below Zero Dates are decided.)

38
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:57,792
(Are you ice too? Water?)

39
00:01:57,793 --> 00:01:58,823
(Nodding)

40
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:01,269
(Ye Eun and Ji Won end up being on the same Team Over Zero.)

41
00:02:01,293 --> 00:02:02,762
(Are you Team Over Zero?)

42
00:02:02,763 --> 00:02:03,863
(Nodding)

43
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:08,332
(Sang Won isn't on the same team as Ye Eun and Ji Won.)

44
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,273
(Bummed out)

45
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:16,173
(How would Team Over Zero’s date go without Sang Won?)

46
00:02:16,373 --> 00:02:19,482
- Have fun. Bye. - We're off.

47
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:21,613
- Is it Team Below Zero? - Yes.

48
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:24,183
- Let's go. Don't rush. - Off we go.

49
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:28,752
(Team Below Zero heads to the car.)

50
00:02:28,753 --> 00:02:29,993
Is it that car?

51
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:32,153
Get in, everyone.

52
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:36,463
(Sang Hyeon will drive to the location.)

53
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:42,162
(So Hyun sits next to Sang Hyeon.)

54
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,432
- Is it roomy in the back? - Yes.

55
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:46,172
(Mu Jin and Bon Hee take the back seat.)

56
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:48,053
- Aren't we too close? - The two are too close.

57
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:50,872
Sang Won...

58
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:52,813
(And Director Park.)

59
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,659
- I feel bad for Sang Won. - Isn't that...

60
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:56,113
Sang Won is in a tight spot.

61
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:57,659
- Look at that upset face. - How cute.

62
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:58,812
He has that upset face.

63
00:02:58,813 --> 00:03:00,623
- A "what now?" kind of face. - That's cute.

64
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:03,152
It'd be best for Sang Won to appear on Season Two.

65
00:03:03,153 --> 00:03:04,192
(Laughing)

66
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:05,723
Trying again would be better.

67
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:07,323
Is there a safety belt?

68
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:10,492
- It's on the other side. - Put it on.

69
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:12,533
(Mu Jin takes care of Bon Hee's safety belt first.)

70
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:17,803
I'm making direct eye contact with Bon Hee.

71
00:03:21,273 --> 00:03:23,813
(Laughing)

72
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:27,912
Sang Hyeon is also in a spot.

73
00:03:27,913 --> 00:03:29,612
- Things are awkward here. - Yes.

74
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:31,783
- He's with Bon Hee and So Hyun. - In just one day...

75
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:33,423
It must be troubling.

76
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:36,792
Although not intentional at all,

77
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:38,793
the members I went with...

78
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:42,462
naturally put pressure on me,

79
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:46,232
if I'm being honest.

80
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:49,003
Unknowingly, I got nervous myself.

81
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:50,972
- Of course. - Totally.

82
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:53,442
(There is So Hyun, his current interest, next to him.)

83
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:55,772
The past interest and the current interest.

84
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:57,873
(There is Bon Hee, his past interest, in the back.)

85
00:03:57,973 --> 00:03:59,883
Last but not least, Director Park.

86
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:02,313
And Director Park.

87
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:08,352
(So Hyun, Sang Hyeon, Bon Hee, and Mu Jin...)

88
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:11,353
(are in a complicated relationship.)

89
00:04:11,553 --> 00:04:12,592
(And Sang Won is third-wheeling.)

90
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:14,792
(Becoming self-conscious)

91
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:16,432
Tell me if you start dozing off.

92
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:17,993
- I'll take over right away. - Okay.

93
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:20,503
- I slept really well last night. - I see.

94
00:04:20,963 --> 00:04:22,903
Not drinking really helped with that.

95
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:28,702
- Does everyone know how to skate? - Just a bit.

96
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:29,942
Only in the past.

97
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:31,703
- For real. - It's been ages since I skated.

98
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:33,643
- Can you skate? - It's not my car.

99
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:35,512
- I doubt I'll be bad at it. - But I'm used to it.

100
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:36,612
I'll hold you.

101
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:37,613
(Suddenly)

102
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:39,383
Really, what is up with your character?

103
00:04:40,023 --> 00:04:41,783
(Laughing)

104
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:45,492
Why not? Even I could hold you.

105
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,593
Yes, of course.

106
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:49,833
- All souls have left Sang Won. - It's hot in here.

107
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:55,563
I have a feeling everyone can skate at least a bit.

108
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:57,532
Are you bad at it?

109
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:59,202
I'm not good at it, nor am I bad at it.

110
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:01,302
- I used to roller-blade. - Same here.

111
00:05:01,303 --> 00:05:02,802
- Like in-line skate. - Yes.

112
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,843
I've been on ones with four wheels.

113
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:06,943
Wait, you skated on a four-wheeled?

114
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,442
- No, the straight one. - There were roller rinks.

115
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:09,612
No, the one she's talking about.

116
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,012
I think she's talking about roller skates.

117
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:12,252
- Roller skates. - There were roller skates.

118
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:13,623
I can feel your age.

119
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:16,392
(He's unstoppable.)

120
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:19,453
- Sang Won has warmed up now. - What's wrong with him?

121
00:05:20,063 --> 00:05:21,962
Have you not roller skated before?

122
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:23,692
- Roller rinks... - Roller rinks...

123
00:05:23,693 --> 00:05:25,533
- I'm not sure. - It wasn't in our generation.

124
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:28,432
The roller rinks were outside on top of department stores.

125
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,533
- Yes, on rooftops. - Exactly.

126
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:33,503
Is it similar to a modern indoor play place for kids?

127
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:34,743
No way.

128
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:36,673
It was for adults.

129
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:38,272
Only the older women would know.

130
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:41,582
I remember rollerblades were released a while after that.

131
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,082
- Sorry? - Rollerblades were released...

132
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,753
a while after that.

133
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:48,122
You mean rollerblades?

134
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:49,522
- The straight ones? - Rollerblades?

135
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:51,652
The straight ones. It wasn't a while after, but just a few years.

136
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:53,692
We were able to buy them, but only after then.

137
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:54,793
- Is that so? - Yes.

138
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:57,433
You do know roller rinks, right?

139
00:05:57,963 --> 00:05:59,432
I've never heard of them.

140
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:01,202
- Have you not seen any in movies? - Come on.

141
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:02,962
- No, I swear. - No way.

142
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:06,132
Roller rinks appear in many music videos and movies.

143
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,202
- Roller... - Exactly.

144
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:08,342
(Thinking)

145
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:11,543
- A movie with an 1980s background. - Yes.

146
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:13,982
- You go around in big circles. - Yes, constantly.

147
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:15,843
It looks like a skating rink.

148
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,682
(The Gen Z is dumbfounded.)

149
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:19,082
- Is it a place... - I roller skated.

150
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,482
Where you can roller skate?

151
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:21,523
Only roller skating.

152
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:24,022
- Let's continue with the shoot. - What are some movies?

153
00:06:24,023 --> 00:06:25,423
(Gave up on explaining)

154
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:27,892
Out of the blue, Se7en debuted.

155
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:29,893
- What's Se7en? - I think.

156
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:31,693
What's Se7en?

157
00:06:32,263 --> 00:06:34,202
- Se7en. - Se7en wore roller skates...

158
00:06:34,203 --> 00:06:35,443
for the song "Come Back to Me."

159
00:06:37,073 --> 00:06:38,133
Hold on.

160
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,342
- Hold on. - You mean the singer Se7en?

161
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:42,442
- I know him. - I know Se7en.

162
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,003
- Of course. - At first, I didn't know.

163
00:06:44,313 --> 00:06:46,012
The three take forever to understand.

164
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:47,612
- Like forever. - Right?

165
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:49,912
Everyone in our generation knew "Come Back to Me" by Se7en.

166
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:51,582
He rolled in with those pair of shoes...

167
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,583
- and danced. - Come back to me

168
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:53,622
The shoes with wheels, right?

169
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:55,552
- Yes. - We rode those too.

170
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:56,922
(Inhaling)

171
00:06:56,923 --> 00:06:58,222
(Thinking)

172
00:06:58,223 --> 00:06:59,263
Aren't those old memories?

173
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:00,493
(Laughing)
Yes, old memories.

174
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:04,493
I suddenly feel the need to talk formally.

175
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:07,763
I guess they can finally feel the age gap.

176
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:10,303
I'm curious.

177
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,872
Everyone has different standards and thoughts about...

178
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:14,143
long-distance relationships.

179
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:17,842
I think it’s a long-distance relationship if I can’t see...

180
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:19,963
my partner when I want, which makes me feel burdened.

181
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:22,442
Like if I can't see my partner after work.

182
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,243
That feels like a long-distance relationship.

183
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:27,022
It's one of the factors that may make...

184
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:28,423
keeping a relationship hard for me.

185
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:30,193
What do you guys think?

186
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:32,252
(Thinking)

187
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:33,593
That's an important matter.

188
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:40,562
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin think about the realistic problem.)

189
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:41,683
Long-distance relationships.

190
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:44,772
(Curious)

191
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:46,873
I've never had a long-distance relationship.

192
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:51,873
But here's what made me fight with my past partners.

193
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:55,213
We tried to see each other too often,

194
00:07:55,243 --> 00:07:58,113
like 4 to 5 times a week.

195
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:00,753
That was tough.

196
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:03,853
I'm someone who needs...

197
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:05,893
a certain amount of personal time.

198
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:09,492
I'd rather see each other 1 or 2 times a week.

199
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:10,632
(Mu Jin thinks there are pros to it.)

200
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:12,893
It'd be nice to see your partner when you miss them.

201
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,873
What if you miss her every day?

202
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:19,433
We can video call each other.

203
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,302
We can do that even if it's long-distance.

204
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:23,972
- True. - If it's long distance.

205
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:25,073
You're right.

206
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:27,712
It's a hard question. I've never had one before.

207
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:28,912
It's far from easy.

208
00:08:28,913 --> 00:08:30,752
- Holding back when you miss them. - I don't have much experience.

209
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:32,182
- If you miss them... - That will make you miss them more,

210
00:08:32,183 --> 00:08:34,283
- Exactly. - like how people used to date.

211
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,653
The bus or train ride could be heart-fluttering.

212
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:41,163
- It's heartrending. - True.

213
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,093
Long-distance relationships...

214
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:45,962
What do you think? Have you been in one?

215
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:47,162
While I was modeling...

216
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:48,402
- back in the US, - Yes?

217
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,703
I had a long-distance relationship...

218
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,603
for about four years with a boyfriend who was in Korea.

219
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:54,803
(4 years?)
- How... - That's really...

220
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:57,712
You heard what Mu Jin just said.

221
00:08:57,713 --> 00:08:59,842
I don't like going on a date every day either.

222
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:00,943
What do you think?

223
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:02,903
- About meeting every day. - That's...

224
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:05,383
Twice a month is more than enough.

225
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,783
Twice a month?

226
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:09,183
(In disbelief)

227
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,193
Wait, is that even considered dating?

228
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:12,792
- I... - I prefer meeting every day.

229
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,022
I like meeting all the time.

230
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:15,362
Either way,

231
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:18,462
the heart-fluttering emotions die down someday.

232
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:21,462
You need to get to know constantly and decide whether...

233
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:23,702
- to break up or keep dating. - Like I mentioned earlier...

234
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:24,902
Say that SOOBIN is in...

235
00:09:24,903 --> 00:09:26,072
- a long-distance relationship. - Okay.

236
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:27,873
How far will it be okay for you?

237
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:32,442
If it's not from Seoul to Daegu or Busan...

238
00:09:32,443 --> 00:09:33,612
Are you fine within Seoul?

239
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:35,282
- Seoul is fine. - Even the Greater Seoul Area?

240
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,312
- Yes. - The greater Seoul Area?

241
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:38,252
- I think so. - These days,

242
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:40,222
traffic is insane.

243
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:42,953
The way back home after dropping her off is so lonely.

244
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:45,422
- True. - It's so lonely.

245
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:46,492
It gets tough.

246
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:48,563
If it's too far away, let her sleep at your place.

247
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:52,333
SOOBIN, please date someone like her.

248
00:09:52,963 --> 00:09:55,244
- Someone who lets you stay over. - If it's too far away.

249
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:57,702
- Hi. - Hi.

250
00:09:57,703 --> 00:09:58,902
- Is that a roller rink? - Yes.

251
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:00,143
Where are they?

252
00:10:00,673 --> 00:10:02,842
(Team Below Zero's Date Course: Ice Rink)

253
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:04,643
It's ice skating.

254
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:07,812
- Hence Team Below Zero. - Yes.

255
00:10:07,813 --> 00:10:09,812
- It's cold in here. - It's freezing cold.

256
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:11,182
- It's cold. - Yes, it's cold.

257
00:10:11,183 --> 00:10:13,143
- It's actually really cold. - Why is it so cold?

258
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:14,353
Oh, dear.

259
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:16,623
- It's cold. - It's cold.

260
00:10:18,793 --> 00:10:21,423
- My foot size? - My foot size is...

261
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:24,263
- What's your size, So Hyun? - Between 245mm and 250mm.

262
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:30,402
(Bon Hee has a hard time putting on the skates.)

263
00:10:30,403 --> 00:10:32,933
(Hitting)

264
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:35,942
(Staring)

265
00:10:35,943 --> 00:10:38,473
- Can you do it? - No, I can't.

266
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:40,313
- Is it tight? - Yes.

267
00:10:40,743 --> 00:10:42,083
Okay.

268
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:44,483
If you're not careful,

269
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:47,423
- your ankles will hurt. - It does hurt.

270
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:49,483
- Does it feel okay? - Yes.

271
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:53,153
(Glancing)

272
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:56,013
Is this the right way? Are we supposed to wear them small?

273
00:10:56,293 --> 00:10:57,493
I don't think so.

274
00:10:57,593 --> 00:10:59,263
They're very firm.

275
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:01,963
- They're so tight. - So are mine.

276
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:07,443
(Lovey-dovey and dealing with their own skates)

277
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:09,772
(What kind of date will they go on?)

278
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:10,913
Shall we go and skate?

279
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:12,013
Shall we?

280
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:13,543
(Amazed)

281
00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:15,742
All right.

282
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:17,452
- It's so slippery. - It's slippery, right?

283
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:19,413
- Hold on. - It's very slippery.

284
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,623
(Holding on)

285
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:24,693
This is so wrong.

286
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:26,593
Stay on the wall, and go slowly.

287
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:28,892
It feels weird.

288
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:30,133
(Stumbling)

289
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:32,062
(They take their first steps one at a time.)

290
00:11:32,063 --> 00:11:33,162
Oh, no.

291
00:11:33,163 --> 00:11:35,003
(They take their first steps one at a time.)

292
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:37,103
This is no joke.

293
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,902
I think I can go if I go slowly.

294
00:11:40,903 --> 00:11:41,973
Can you?

295
00:11:43,543 --> 00:11:45,172
Bon Hee is afraid.

296
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:46,643
- She's afraid. - She is.

297
00:11:48,343 --> 00:11:49,483
Are you all right?

298
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:52,653
Yes, I can skate,

299
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,583
but it's slipperier than I thought.

300
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:57,753
- It's... - This is so hard.

301
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,393
It's not that easy.

302
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:03,262
(There are sleds at the center.)

303
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:05,193
Oh, these are for those who are scared.

304
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:07,332
- Take a seat. - Okay.

305
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,063
- I'll push you hard. - Okay.

306
00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:11,433
Let's go.

307
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:13,903
You're so fast!

308
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:21,012
(A major accident)

309
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:22,083
- Or not. - No!

310
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:24,153
- I was so startled. - Sang Won!

311
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:26,823
Are you crazy?

312
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,982
- I'm sorry. - I'm okay.

313
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:30,223
- Are you okay? - Are you hurt?

314
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:31,793
(Getting up)

315
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,592
(Mu Jin rushes toward her.)

316
00:12:34,593 --> 00:12:35,822
- Bon Hee, are you all right? - I'm okay.

317
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:36,892
He came running.

318
00:12:36,893 --> 00:12:39,092
I thought it'd stop,

319
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:40,102
- but it kept going. - Really?

320
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:41,732
- I'm fine. - It drifted instead. Are you okay?

321
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,432
- Yes, I'm okay. - Are you sure?

322
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:45,333
It didn't turn smoothly.

323
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,042
- I thought it'd turn with me. - Did you do that on purpose?

324
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:48,602
No, I didn't. I thought it'd stop.

325
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:50,972
- I'm joking. - But it didn't.

326
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:52,043
How did you fall?

327
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:54,943
I opened my eyes, and I was on the ground.

328
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:57,012
(Finding her cute)

329
00:12:57,013 --> 00:12:59,153
I feel like I'll fall again.

330
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:00,783
I'll hold your hand.

331
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:03,453
I'll hold your hand.

332
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:06,223
- Gosh. - They refuse to be separated now.

333
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:09,863
Another guy tripped her, so...

334
00:13:10,593 --> 00:13:12,092
He's going to stick with her.

335
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:14,132
It's harder than I thought...

336
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:15,462
- because it's been a while. - Same.

337
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:17,102
But I think I'm doing better than I expected.

338
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:18,433
- You are. - Yes.

339
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:19,703
Didn't you get hurt?

340
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:23,872
My head hurts a little, but it's okay.

341
00:13:23,873 --> 00:13:24,942
Your head hurts?

342
00:13:24,943 --> 00:13:26,512
It wasn't a hard hit.

343
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:30,082
(The two are on a private date...)

344
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,683
(Looking)

345
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:35,082
Mu Jin is so sweet.

346
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,123
- He is. - What's Sang Hyeon doing?

347
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:40,292
(He's playing by himself from a distance.)

348
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:42,093
He's having fun all by himself.

349
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:45,393
Come on, it's a date.

350
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:47,233
This is fun.

351
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,132
- What's he doing here? - Why...

352
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,073
Oh, my goodness. Why doesn't he look after her?

353
00:13:55,273 --> 00:13:58,173
(Sang Hyeon has no clue and just enjoys skating.)

354
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:01,219
From the way we're spending time, don't we look like people...

355
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:03,042
who have never dated anyone before?

356
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,312
Sorry, did I make you seem that way?

357
00:14:04,313 --> 00:14:05,612
No, it's not you.

358
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:08,082
- Okay. - I meant the boys.

359
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,183
(Sighing)

360
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:12,023
- No! - What?

361
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:18,533
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

362
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,803
Are you all right?

363
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:23,302
You ran right into it.

364
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:24,303
- Oh, no. - Goodness.

365
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,503
This is going to bruise up.

366
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:27,773
Seriously.

367
00:14:29,273 --> 00:14:30,542
(But Sang Hyeon can't seem to go near her.)

368
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:31,743
Why doesn't he approach her?

369
00:14:32,473 --> 00:14:33,743
Right.

370
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:38,183
I kept picking Sang Hyeon,

371
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:41,183
and I wished he would...

372
00:14:42,553 --> 00:14:45,952
look like he wanted to have fun with me.

373
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:46,993
I know.

374
00:14:47,593 --> 00:14:50,123
But I couldn't tell what he was thinking.

375
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:51,563
It's natural.

376
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,933
(Slipping)

377
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:58,232
(Skating away)

378
00:14:58,233 --> 00:14:59,973
(So Hyun almost fell.)

379
00:15:00,873 --> 00:15:02,143
Why doesn't he hold her?

380
00:15:04,713 --> 00:15:06,213
I knew that would happen.

381
00:15:06,943 --> 00:15:08,712
- Be careful. - I can't brake.

382
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:10,553
- You can't. - I can't brake.

383
00:15:14,653 --> 00:15:17,792
He could at least talk to her.

384
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:18,793
(So Hyun's face hardened at his indifference.)

385
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,022
- He's not even trying. - Exactly.

386
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:22,492
(What exactly is on his mind?)

387
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:23,833
I wonder why he does that.

388
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:27,062
How is he so indifferent?

389
00:15:27,063 --> 00:15:29,703
Because there's Bon Hee.

390
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:31,033
I guess so.

391
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:33,003
Say I fell.

392
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:36,273
Sang Hyeon, who I'm interested in, doesn't even come to me,

393
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:38,473
and Mu Jin comes to help me up...

394
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,483
and asks me how I am.

395
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:43,512
My first thought will be, "I'm jealous of Bon Hee."

396
00:15:43,513 --> 00:15:44,513
(Jealous of Bon Hee)

397
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:46,283
I'll be so jealous of her.

398
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,483
Then, I'll resent Sang Hyeon.

399
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,823
And Mu Jin will start to look different.

400
00:15:52,353 --> 00:15:54,663
Compared to Sang Hyeon.

401
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:56,263
He's never too much.

402
00:15:56,363 --> 00:15:57,632
- That's true. - Right?

403
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:59,062
Even when he asks...

404
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:01,263
if she eats or how she feels...

405
00:16:01,363 --> 00:16:02,633
"Did you eat?"

406
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,703
Was that an impression of Mu Jin?

407
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:08,473
Something goes forward when I do his impression.

408
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:09,672
What is it?

409
00:16:09,673 --> 00:16:11,873
I don't know. It could be my jaw or anything else.

410
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,112
(I look just like him, don't I?)

411
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:16,242
- What is that? - "My jaw or anything else."

412
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:17,382
Mu Jin kind of does this.

413
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:18,753
"Did you eat?"

414
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,223
- What is that? - He does.

415
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:23,523
(Swaying)

416
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:24,753
"Did you eat?"

417
00:16:25,353 --> 00:16:27,062
- What is that? - He does.

418
00:16:27,063 --> 00:16:29,493
- When did he do that? - I don't know, but he does it.

419
00:16:29,963 --> 00:16:31,232
- What are you talking about? - Like this.

420
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:32,233
(Sitting like Mu Jin)

421
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:33,333
He does this.

422
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:35,333
That's bizarre.

423
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,633
Let's have a contest.

424
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:39,673
The loser buys coffee?

425
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:41,802
Or we can play rock-paper-scissors...

426
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:43,973
to pick members for a contest,

427
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:45,712
and the losing team buys coffee.

428
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,382
- That sounds better. - As a team?

429
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,043
- Yes. - Okay, then.

430
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:50,812
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

431
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:51,913
(So Hyun wins.)

432
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:53,253
I'll pick...

433
00:16:54,123 --> 00:16:55,683
She should pick Sang Hyeon.

434
00:16:56,953 --> 00:16:57,953
(She'll pick Sang Hyeon, right?)

435
00:16:57,954 --> 00:17:00,862
I'll pick Mu Jin.

436
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:01,993
- What? - What?

437
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:03,492
Mu Jin.

438
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:04,962
(Oh, no)

439
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:06,883
- He is a good skater. - You saw it, didn't you?

440
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,133
What's going on?

441
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:11,402
Maybe she feels uncomfortable...

442
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:13,003
because Sang Hyeon isn't talking to her.

443
00:17:14,203 --> 00:17:15,502
Then, I'll pick Sang Hyeon.

444
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:16,503
What?

445
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:18,313
All right.

446
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:20,112
- Okay. - All right.

447
00:17:20,113 --> 00:17:21,283
I'll be the judge, then.

448
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:23,443
- In a straight line? - Yes, in a line.

449
00:17:25,283 --> 00:17:27,683
- Are you ready? - I was born ready.

450
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:29,783
(Laughing)

451
00:17:30,653 --> 00:17:33,293
I have a question. So, it's one lap, right?

452
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:35,593
- No, we go straight. - No, straight.

453
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:37,503
It ends if you both pass the finish line.

454
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:39,393
It ends if we both pass the finish line.

455
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:40,813
(Hesitant and looking away)

456
00:17:40,963 --> 00:17:43,532
- I have no choice but to hold you. - Yes, I'll hold it.

457
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:45,102
- I'll hold your arm. - Okay. Good.

458
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:46,972
- It should be the other way around. - Like this?

459
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:48,472
Grab my wrist.

460
00:17:48,473 --> 00:17:49,473
- Grab it. - I've never seen them...
touch each other before.

461
00:17:50,474 --> 00:17:52,273
(Shy)

462
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:57,112
(Mu Jin and So Hyun also hold hands.)

463
00:17:57,113 --> 00:17:58,812
- I'll drag you there if I have to. - What?

464
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:00,259
I'm going to drag you there if I have to.

465
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:01,652
We have good teamwork, though.

466
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:02,783
- Right? - Yes.

467
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:05,692
Did you notice that?

468
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,023
(Laughing)

469
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:08,863
Everybody ready?

470
00:18:09,793 --> 00:18:11,563
Let's start. Get ready.

471
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:13,532
Get set. Go.

472
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,111
(The coffee bet begins.)

473
00:18:15,418 --> 00:18:16,383
Get set. Go.

474
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:18,613
(The coffee bet begins.)

475
00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:24,123
I'll use both my hands.

476
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:27,193
(So Hyun and Mu Jin zip by.)

477
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:30,723
Left foot, right foot.

478
00:18:30,724 --> 00:18:33,433
- It's a piece of cake! - Okay.

479
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:36,832
(An easy win for So Hyun and Mu Jin)

480
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,803
Thanks for the coffee, guys!

481
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:41,633
Oh, come on.

482
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,473
We're both bad at this.

483
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:44,603
Be careful.

484
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:46,272
- Let's go. - Thanks for the coffee.

485
00:18:46,273 --> 00:18:48,642
Coffee's on us. That's not hard.

486
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:49,913
(Flinching)

487
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:53,313
We had good teamwork.

488
00:18:53,513 --> 00:18:56,323
Yes. I noticed it when we talked yesterday.

489
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:04,263
(The Below Zero Date ends.)

490
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:06,523
- Should I just drive? - I'll drive. It's totally fine.

491
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:13,373
(Mu Jin will drive on the way back.)

492
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:14,732
Are you sure you'll be fine in the middle seat?

493
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:15,833
I'm okay.

494
00:19:16,473 --> 00:19:17,772
It's the toughest seat.

495
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:19,102
Why didn't she sit next to him?

496
00:19:19,103 --> 00:19:20,172
Why didn't she?

497
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:22,683
(So Hyun already sat in the shotgun seat.)

498
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:25,813
It's cool.

499
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:30,782
(Team Below Zero heads to the Yeon House.)

500
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:32,323
This looks weird.

501
00:19:37,663 --> 00:19:40,663
Why don't we...

502
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:44,762
share our favorite memory...

503
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:46,103
from our time here?

504
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:47,372
Until now?

505
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:50,143
Yes, the most memorable thing until now.

506
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:54,613
You've been here two days longer than I have, after all.

507
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,443
(Thinking)

508
00:19:58,943 --> 00:19:59,952
(Pondering)

509
00:19:59,953 --> 00:20:01,213
The most memorable?

510
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:03,483
They can't answer?

511
00:20:04,723 --> 00:20:06,293
Was that a difficult question?

512
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:10,493
Maybe we're all thinking of one,

513
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:14,763
but we don't always say it out loud.

514
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:19,003
Is it related to Bon Hee?

515
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:21,233
I see.

516
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:24,173
Perhaps it's about Bon Hee.

517
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:25,602
Maybe.

518
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:26,672
(Reading her face)

519
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:28,142
(So Hyun's face stiffens at his answer.)

520
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,243
So Hyun's face hardened.

521
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:32,182
(Frustrated)

522
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:33,983
So Hyun is about to cry.

523
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:36,783
(Feeling awkward)

524
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:43,563
(What's on Sang Hyeon's mind?)

525
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:45,262
(It went silent in the car.)

526
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:46,563
This is suffocating.

527
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:48,292
It's so suffocating in the car.

528
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:49,333
Right.

529
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,902
You know the hot vacation spots in Southeast Asia?

530
00:20:53,903 --> 00:20:55,102
Have you been abroad often?

531
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:58,943
I've been to Bangkok, Pataya, and Bali.

532
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:00,943
- I'm jealous. - Jealous of what?

533
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:02,912
I also want to go abroad a lot.

534
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:04,013
Do you?

535
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:05,912
I've already done a lot of domestic traveling.

536
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:07,883
Really? What was your favorite place?

537
00:21:08,683 --> 00:21:09,822
Tongyeong.

538
00:21:09,823 --> 00:21:12,183
My great-aunt lives there.

539
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:14,193
My great-aunt lives in Tongyeong.

540
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:15,793
She runs a restaurant there.

541
00:21:16,563 --> 00:21:18,423
- What kind of restaurant? - Beef-bone soup.

542
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,462
It's so tasty.

543
00:21:20,463 --> 00:21:21,463
(No way!)

544
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:23,602
Beef-bone soup made by your great-aunt?

545
00:21:23,603 --> 00:21:27,603
(She feels much better after talking to Mu Jin.)

546
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:29,803
(Peeking)

547
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:32,442
Does anyone...

548
00:21:32,443 --> 00:21:34,943
want to stop by the convenience store?

549
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:37,342
- Anyone? - I won't mind stopping by.

550
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:38,343
Me neither.

551
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:41,682
(Team Below Zero stops by the convenience store...)

552
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:43,422
(near the Yeon House.)

553
00:21:43,423 --> 00:21:45,353
(She just woke up.)

554
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,623
We're stopping by the convenience store.

555
00:21:49,053 --> 00:21:51,163
- Sleep. You can stay here. - Okay.

556
00:21:52,193 --> 00:21:53,363
Let's go.

557
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:01,402
(Sang Hyeon stretches.)

558
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,202
Sang Hyeon and Bon Hee are left alone.

559
00:22:03,203 --> 00:22:05,943
(And Bon Hee keeps her eyes closed.)

560
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:09,783
The day feels like a dream.

561
00:22:10,883 --> 00:22:12,013
It does.

562
00:22:14,353 --> 00:22:15,453
Oh, my.

563
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,182
I really...

564
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:19,792
(Hesitating)

565
00:22:19,793 --> 00:22:22,052
I really don't know what I'm doing.

566
00:22:22,053 --> 00:22:24,322
(I really don't know what I'm doing.)

567
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:26,763
- Right now? - Whatever it is.

568
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:32,463
I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around you.

569
00:22:32,903 --> 00:22:35,173
I hope you don't.

570
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:36,342
I don't want to,

571
00:22:36,343 --> 00:22:38,642
and I'm trying not to.

572
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:40,112
But I can't help it.

573
00:22:40,113 --> 00:22:42,273
And I walk on eggshells around So Hyun as well.

574
00:22:45,413 --> 00:22:48,113
I think I'm getting to know myself.

575
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,123
In a good way or a bad way.

576
00:22:55,153 --> 00:22:56,422
(Sighing)

577
00:22:56,423 --> 00:22:58,593
You must be feeling lots of emotions right now.

578
00:22:58,693 --> 00:23:01,132
I feel like I'm filming my period of growth,

579
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:02,633
and it's driving me insane.

580
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,903
(Sighing)

581
00:23:06,373 --> 00:23:09,203
You're the only one who knows yourself best.

582
00:23:09,803 --> 00:23:11,603
I don't know myself that well.

583
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,243
I'm just too slow.

584
00:23:15,473 --> 00:23:17,342
I'm slow and conscious.

585
00:23:17,343 --> 00:23:19,313
I'm too slow.

586
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:23,023
But I have to be fast when I'm here.

587
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:27,093
It weighs heavily on me if I overthink it,

588
00:23:28,353 --> 00:23:29,593
so I try...

589
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:33,963
to keep myself relaxed for my sake.

590
00:23:36,703 --> 00:23:38,502
(Sang Hyeon struggles...)

591
00:23:38,503 --> 00:23:40,572
(with the pace and direction of his decisions.)

592
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:42,472
As we expected,

593
00:23:42,473 --> 00:23:45,102
Sang Hyeon's awkward behavior was...

594
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:47,272
because he was conscious...

595
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:48,742
- of Bon Hee. - Yes.

596
00:23:48,743 --> 00:23:50,382
- And of So Hyun. - Yes.

597
00:23:50,383 --> 00:23:52,343
One of them is the girl that he liked,

598
00:23:52,643 --> 00:23:55,183
and the other is the girl who likes him.

599
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,022
Whichever it is,

600
00:23:57,023 --> 00:23:59,352
he should be more considerate of the person who's into him...

601
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:02,323
and keep an open mind by approaching her too.

602
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:04,892
Even if Bon Hee is with Mu Jin,

603
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:06,092
as Mu Jin said,

604
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:07,592
he's only doing what his heart tells him to do.

605
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:08,832
- He told her not to... - Right.

606
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,302
Be too conscious of him.

607
00:24:10,303 --> 00:24:11,532
The courage...

608
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:15,173
to approach both sides.

609
00:24:15,673 --> 00:24:17,702
That's what Sang Hyeon needs at the moment.

610
00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:19,942
I hope he realizes it...

611
00:24:19,943 --> 00:24:21,772
before he loses everything that matters.

612
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:22,913
Right.

613
00:24:24,183 --> 00:24:26,142
(Yeong Gyeong, Ye Eun, Ji Won, Ji Yung, and Hyeon Jun...)

614
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:27,223
(go on the Over Zero Date.)

615
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:29,453
I'll drive safely.

616
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:35,893
(Silent)

617
00:24:37,163 --> 00:24:38,792
Oh, no. It's suffocating.

618
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:41,393
(Feeling uncomfortable)

619
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:43,863
- Oh, my gosh. - That's wild.

620
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:46,163
- Oh, boy. - These older women are...

621
00:24:46,873 --> 00:24:49,173
(Last night)

622
00:24:49,543 --> 00:24:52,303
(How was date with Sang Won??)

623
00:24:53,873 --> 00:24:55,012
(I want...)

624
00:24:55,013 --> 00:24:56,212
(You want to get to know him more?)

625
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:58,443
(I want to get to know him better.)

626
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:02,312
(You don't care...)

627
00:25:02,313 --> 00:25:03,322
(for Ji Yung, right?)

628
00:25:03,323 --> 00:25:04,653
(Nodding)

629
00:25:06,623 --> 00:25:08,793
(So it's Sang Won.)

630
00:25:09,493 --> 00:25:11,523
(Nodding)

631
00:25:11,963 --> 00:25:13,992
(Ye Eun and Ji Won, who were both interested in Sang Won, )

632
00:25:13,993 --> 00:25:15,433
(had an uncomfortable conversation.)

633
00:25:19,003 --> 00:25:20,432
What should Yeong Gyeong do?

634
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:22,303
It's making her uncomfortable as well.

635
00:25:22,973 --> 00:25:25,273
Yeong Gyeong said she used to go jet skiing a lot.

636
00:25:26,003 --> 00:25:27,513
- Really? - At the Han River?

637
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:30,082
Wherever.

638
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,282
- I mostly went to the ocean. - Oh, the ocean.

639
00:25:32,283 --> 00:25:33,853
I also love jet skiing.

640
00:25:35,353 --> 00:25:37,882
You can ride a jet ski without getting water on your face.

641
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:39,022
- That's true. - Seriously?

642
00:25:39,023 --> 00:25:40,653
- It's a water motorcycle. - Yes.

643
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:42,852
You're not going into the water.

644
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:44,463
- Right. - Oh, really?

645
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:47,193
I'm speaking fast today, aren't I?

646
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:49,432
- Totally. - I'm trying really hard.

647
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:50,703
You're so funny.

648
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,202
- I've changed. - She's so cute.

649
00:25:52,203 --> 00:25:54,402
How do you normally speak?

650
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:56,272
- Normally... - I'm usually slow.

651
00:25:56,273 --> 00:25:58,402
But everyone pointed out how slowly I spoke,

652
00:25:58,403 --> 00:26:00,142
so I'm speaking three times faster than usual.

653
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,512
- As if I'm rapping. - She's so cute.

654
00:26:02,513 --> 00:26:04,212
That was really fast just now.

655
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:06,243
Was it? I'm trying.

656
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:10,123
- She's so charming. - She's very attractive.

657
00:26:10,253 --> 00:26:12,453
- It's cute that she's trying. - Indeed.

658
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:14,253
We're here.

659
00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:17,592
(Team Over Zero's dating spot for water sports)

660
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:18,593
It must be so fun.

661
00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:20,133
I'll put all of you in the water.

662
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:22,063
The sun is so hot.

663
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:25,233
(Ji Won and Ye Eun got changed first.)

664
00:26:26,163 --> 00:26:28,672
- They're... - Oh, boy.

665
00:26:28,673 --> 00:26:30,143
(Awkward)

666
00:26:30,703 --> 00:26:33,173
(Looking around for no reason)

667
00:26:36,443 --> 00:26:38,882
(Ji Yung and Hyeon Jun are also ready.)

668
00:26:38,883 --> 00:26:40,153
It should be fun.

669
00:26:41,253 --> 00:26:42,712
You're here.

670
00:26:42,713 --> 00:26:45,022
Why are your bathing suits so fabulous?

671
00:26:45,023 --> 00:26:46,323
They're fabulous?

672
00:26:47,493 --> 00:26:48,693
Who wants to try wakeboarding?

673
00:26:48,793 --> 00:26:51,123
Me. It looks fun.

674
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:53,263
Isn't that too tricky?

675
00:26:53,563 --> 00:26:54,962
It's so tricky.

676
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:56,332
I bet Ji Yung is good.

677
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,503
- Let's go! - Let's go!

678
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:01,573
Here we go.

679
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:06,973
(Ji Yung stands up instantly.)

680
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:10,412
Right away?

681
00:27:10,413 --> 00:27:12,282
Don't you have to be at a high level...

682
00:27:12,283 --> 00:27:13,653
to stand up instantly?

683
00:27:13,783 --> 00:27:15,482
I've never seen anyone start...

684
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:16,982
from above water and not below it.

685
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:18,122
He's a pro.

686
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:19,383
(That's amazing.)

687
00:27:20,253 --> 00:27:21,623
You look good!

688
00:27:24,223 --> 00:27:25,463
He's good.

689
00:27:25,923 --> 00:27:27,793
- No way. - He's incredibly good.

690
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:31,632
That's amazing!

691
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:34,203
- You're so cool, Ji Yung! - Awesome!

692
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:36,643
Fantastic.

693
00:27:38,003 --> 00:27:39,873
It would be fun if I could ride it like him.

694
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:41,373
That's so cool.

695
00:27:42,843 --> 00:27:44,143
Look at those thighs.

696
00:27:44,383 --> 00:27:46,243
He rules the water.

697
00:27:53,593 --> 00:27:57,362
Is that the catfish crossing the Bukhan River?

698
00:27:57,363 --> 00:27:58,422
(Laughing)

699
00:27:58,423 --> 00:27:59,662
- Catfish. - Totally.

700
00:27:59,663 --> 00:28:01,392
- That's our catfish. - Totally.

701
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:03,733
Catfish in the Bukhan River.

702
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:07,203
- I wish I could get up. - What's that?

703
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:09,332
- I want to do it like him. - Do you?

704
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,202
(Hyeon Jun also wants to look cool in front of Yeong Gyeong.)

705
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:12,602
But that takes even men...

706
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:14,342
to try 2 to 3 times to actually get up.

707
00:28:14,343 --> 00:28:16,243
None of them can get up on the first day.

708
00:28:19,643 --> 00:28:20,713
Let's see.

709
00:28:20,883 --> 00:28:23,083
I'm not that athletic, so...

710
00:28:23,783 --> 00:28:24,952
Do I sit first?

711
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,923
- Good luck! - Good luck, Hyeon Jun!

712
00:28:28,793 --> 00:28:29,822
Okay!

713
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:31,763
- Yes, that's how you start. - Exactly.

714
00:28:33,263 --> 00:28:34,462
Let's go.

715
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,092
(He fails on the first try.)

716
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:38,003
- Good job. - That's normal.

717
00:28:38,103 --> 00:28:39,432
- Well done. - You can do it.

718
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:40,503
You've got this.

719
00:28:40,903 --> 00:28:42,502
- Here we go. - Yes!

720
00:28:42,503 --> 00:28:44,502
(After that, )

721
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:46,842
(he kept failing.)

722
00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:48,813
- Cheer up! You're getting there. - Go!

723
00:28:50,013 --> 00:28:51,883
Get up now!

724
00:28:52,443 --> 00:28:53,753
Oh, he almost had it.

725
00:28:54,013 --> 00:28:55,082
He's got the hang of it.

726
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,952
- He's got it now. - Yes.

727
00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:58,323
(Hyeon Jun's final attempt)

728
00:28:58,723 --> 00:29:00,052
Please.

729
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:01,053
Oh, no.

730
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:04,493
He almost made it, though. That was so close.

731
00:29:05,263 --> 00:29:06,292
Well done, though.

732
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:07,863
- Good job. - It was great.

733
00:29:10,163 --> 00:29:11,702
I bet Ji Won is good.

734
00:29:11,703 --> 00:29:14,202
- I have a feeling she'll do it. - I know.

735
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:15,372
I bet she'll get up right away.

736
00:29:15,373 --> 00:29:17,003
- Right away. - Right away.

737
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:18,972
Relax your body.

738
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:19,973
(Ji Won tries wakeboarding for the first time.)

739
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:22,573
- She's getting up. - Let's go!

740
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:24,543
Oh, no.

741
00:29:24,783 --> 00:29:26,712
- She's so good! - No way.

742
00:29:26,713 --> 00:29:29,483
- She might float soon. - I think she'll make it.

743
00:29:30,683 --> 00:29:32,423
Don't get up right away!

744
00:29:33,793 --> 00:29:35,323
How would that make me look?

745
00:29:37,363 --> 00:29:38,393
He's so humorous.

746
00:29:38,463 --> 00:29:40,193
I think I can do it with him coaching me.

747
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:42,363
I hope she'll get up.

748
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,902
Get up slowly.

749
00:29:43,903 --> 00:29:44,962
Slowly!

750
00:29:44,963 --> 00:29:47,002
- Here we go. - Let's go.

751
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:48,833
She seems relaxed. We're moving. Oh, my.

752
00:29:51,673 --> 00:29:53,312
(Ji Won gets up on her second attempt.)

753
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:55,173
That's insane!

754
00:29:55,843 --> 00:29:57,613
(Impressed)

755
00:29:57,743 --> 00:29:58,943
(I'm amazed. That's awesome.)

756
00:29:59,343 --> 00:30:01,583
- She's so cool. She's incredible. - Impressive.

757
00:30:03,783 --> 00:30:06,152
- She's doing it! - Okay. She did a great job.

758
00:30:06,153 --> 00:30:09,423
Good. Keep your arms straight. Keep them straight.

759
00:30:09,693 --> 00:30:11,923
That was crazy. She's so amazing.

760
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:14,893
Good.

761
00:30:14,894 --> 00:30:16,903
(This is so much fun.)

762
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:18,563
You're doing so well.

763
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:21,073
- She'll release the handle. - Okay!

764
00:30:22,373 --> 00:30:24,402
(Amazed)

765
00:30:24,403 --> 00:30:26,243
- She's so good at it. - She did a great job.

766
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:27,973
No!

767
00:30:29,883 --> 00:30:31,583
I'm glad she came here.

768
00:30:32,513 --> 00:30:35,413
I should've joined the other group and done some triple axels.

769
00:30:37,323 --> 00:30:39,252
Yeong Gyeong, go and ride a jet ski.

770
00:30:39,253 --> 00:30:40,523
- Shall I go now? - Yes.

771
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:43,462
Yeong Gyeong doesn't seem like a person...

772
00:30:43,463 --> 00:30:45,023
who would like sports like this.

773
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:46,123
You look cool.

774
00:30:46,124 --> 00:30:47,764
(Yeong Gyeong sits in the driver's seat.)

775
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:50,902
He has a big physique, but is not good at sports.

776
00:30:50,903 --> 00:30:51,903
(Hyeon Jun sits in the rear seat shyly.)

777
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,984
Yeong Gyeong looks so cool.

778
00:30:54,233 --> 00:30:56,349
(Yeong Gyeong looks so cool. Hyeon Jun is impressed.)

779
00:30:56,373 --> 00:30:58,373
- Bye. - Bye.

780
00:30:59,003 --> 00:31:00,342
Hold me.

781
00:31:00,343 --> 00:31:01,442
(Hold me tight.)

782
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,343
- I'll hold you. - Okay.

783
00:31:04,313 --> 00:31:05,313
(Vroom)

784
00:31:06,853 --> 00:31:08,583
- Where shall we go? - Yeong Gyeong.

785
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:10,799
- He's holding her waist tightly. - Yes, Hyeon Jun.

786
00:31:10,823 --> 00:31:12,303
He's such a big man and scared of it.

787
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:15,393
(Smiling)

788
00:31:16,353 --> 00:31:18,263
You can go faster. I'm holding you tightly.

789
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:20,863
She's cool.

790
00:31:22,593 --> 00:31:25,563
- Step on it! - That's funny.

791
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:26,773
"Step on it."

792
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:29,272
Yeong Gyeong is so cool.

793
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:30,273
It's good to see them like that.

794
00:31:30,274 --> 00:31:31,742
I haven't been this excited since the show began.

795
00:31:31,743 --> 00:31:32,903
- Really? - Yes.

796
00:31:34,473 --> 00:31:35,643
Today is the best day ever?

797
00:31:35,943 --> 00:31:37,343
I haven't been this excited before.

798
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:38,743
I'm glad to hear that.

799
00:31:38,943 --> 00:31:40,453
Hyeon Jun is cute.

800
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:42,813
Actually,

801
00:31:42,983 --> 00:31:45,082
we spent time together for the first time...

802
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,993
since we had spicy catfish stew together.

803
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:52,323
Being with him made my heart flutter more than I expected.

804
00:31:54,263 --> 00:31:56,033
This is exciting.

805
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,203
I'm so happy now.

806
00:31:59,363 --> 00:32:01,503
- Really? - Yes. I'm really happy.

807
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:02,833
(Chuckling)

808
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,442
Maybe because of Hyeon Jun,

809
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:06,083
it can't seem to go as fast as it should.

810
00:32:08,043 --> 00:32:09,143
I'm so hungry.

811
00:32:09,373 --> 00:32:10,613
Shall we eat something?

812
00:32:10,813 --> 00:32:12,082
- Ramyeon. - Ramyeon.

813
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,283
Han River ramyeon.

814
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,382
(Ramyeon after playing in water)

815
00:32:15,383 --> 00:32:17,522
It tastes even better after you play in water.

816
00:32:17,523 --> 00:32:18,783
- It tastes so good. - Indeed.

817
00:32:20,053 --> 00:32:21,853
- Here's your ramyeon. - But it made a noise.

818
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:23,662
Thank you. Oh, do we have chopsticks?

819
00:32:23,663 --> 00:32:24,903
- I brought chopsticks. - Okay.

820
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,363
It was cooked very quickly.

821
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:30,833
It looks delicious.

822
00:32:32,203 --> 00:32:33,502
Why are my hands shaking?

823
00:32:33,503 --> 00:32:34,503
Me too.

824
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:36,473
I can't use chopsticks.

825
00:32:37,143 --> 00:32:39,203
Enjoying water sports is much better than skating.

826
00:32:39,403 --> 00:32:41,123
- Don't you think so? - It's better, right?

827
00:32:42,013 --> 00:32:43,942
- Isn't this place better? Yes. - Is this place better?

828
00:32:43,943 --> 00:32:45,113
Why do you look upset?

829
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:47,453
- You're not? - Oh, boy.

830
00:32:50,323 --> 00:32:51,382
(Looking at her cautiously)

831
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:54,052
But if we went to the ice rink,

832
00:32:54,053 --> 00:32:56,593
we could've skated in an elegant, graceful manner.

833
00:32:57,963 --> 00:33:00,032
But whom you're with is the most important thing, right?

834
00:33:00,033 --> 00:33:01,963
- You're right. I agree. - Right.

835
00:33:11,643 --> 00:33:14,613
- Oh, boy. That's not good. - What's funny is...

836
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:17,713
that there's tension between them even though Sang Won isn't here.

837
00:33:17,983 --> 00:33:19,312
- That's right. - Because they're here together.

838
00:33:19,313 --> 00:33:20,582
I feel the tension between them.

839
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:21,652
The atmosphere is heavy.

840
00:33:21,653 --> 00:33:22,883
(I feel bad.)

841
00:33:24,123 --> 00:33:25,552
- Let's go. - Can you open the trunk?

842
00:33:25,553 --> 00:33:27,473
(Team Below Zero arrived before the other team.)

843
00:33:27,953 --> 00:33:28,953
I'll carry the bag.

844
00:33:29,223 --> 00:33:30,263
Okay.

845
00:33:31,263 --> 00:33:33,793
(Yeon House)

846
00:33:34,533 --> 00:33:35,963
Isn't your bag heavy?

847
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:39,063
It's heavy, but I'm okay.

848
00:33:40,203 --> 00:33:42,772
- It looks bigger than your body. - Exactly.

849
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,542
- I packed so much stuff... - I was going to carry it for you,

850
00:33:44,543 --> 00:33:45,842
- Really? Thank you. - but it seemed...

851
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:47,142
like part of your fashion style.

852
00:33:47,143 --> 00:33:48,143
No, that's not the case.

853
00:33:48,343 --> 00:33:50,842
Why doesn't anyone carry it for me? I'm joking.

854
00:33:50,843 --> 00:33:52,403
I was really going to carry it for you.

855
00:33:53,383 --> 00:33:55,582
(Sang Hyeon shows no response to what So Hyun said.)

856
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:58,853
I tend to carry a lot of stuff in my bag.

857
00:34:00,793 --> 00:34:02,052
That was fun, eveyone.

858
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:04,493
You can give me back my bag now. Thank you for your help.

859
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:06,363
I helped you because I wanted to.

860
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:07,663
- Don't worry. - I understand.

861
00:34:09,163 --> 00:34:10,202
(Sighing)

862
00:34:10,203 --> 00:34:12,232
She's sighing. I feel so bad for her.

863
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:13,303
She looks tired.

864
00:34:13,773 --> 00:34:15,473
That was fun.

865
00:34:15,503 --> 00:34:17,572
Thank you for driving.

866
00:34:17,573 --> 00:34:18,573
Thank you.

867
00:34:19,943 --> 00:34:21,943
- See you later. - See you.

868
00:34:24,783 --> 00:34:27,683
- We arrived before them. - I thought that was the case.

869
00:34:28,883 --> 00:34:30,953
- I guess we can rest for a bit. - Right.

870
00:34:31,983 --> 00:34:33,592
I'll stay in my bed for a while.

871
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:34,693
Are you tired?

872
00:34:36,823 --> 00:34:39,522
Let me tell you what I tried to say earlier.

873
00:34:39,523 --> 00:34:41,209
(So Hyun seems to have something to say to Bon Hee.)

874
00:34:41,233 --> 00:34:43,962
We didn't go there just to hang out.

875
00:34:43,963 --> 00:34:48,233
But Mu Jin was the only one who seemed to think of it as a date.

876
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:52,402
It was nice that he enjoyed skating...

877
00:34:52,403 --> 00:34:55,472
like an innocent child.

878
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:56,549
She's talking about Sang Hyeon.

879
00:34:56,573 --> 00:34:58,743
But somehow I felt...

880
00:34:59,543 --> 00:35:00,753
I felt awkward.

881
00:35:01,213 --> 00:35:02,282
Because he didn't take care of you?

882
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:04,353
No, that's not the reason.

883
00:35:04,623 --> 00:35:06,723
I just thought...

884
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:09,653
that he was insensitive and tactless.

885
00:35:10,463 --> 00:35:11,862
That's what I thought.

886
00:35:11,863 --> 00:35:14,163
Actually, he cared too much about the others.

887
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:16,463
He was being too careful.

888
00:35:17,203 --> 00:35:18,532
(Realizing)

889
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,732
- I mean... - You're right.

890
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:22,103
He should do as his heart says,

891
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:23,842
but he can't stop thinking too much.

892
00:35:23,843 --> 00:35:25,672
He keeps worrying so much about the consequences of his behaviors.

893
00:35:25,673 --> 00:35:27,642
That's how he seems to me.

894
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:30,243
I do understand that he feels that way.

895
00:35:31,383 --> 00:35:33,552
But since I've been the one to lead,

896
00:35:33,553 --> 00:35:35,453
I'd like him to lead now. I like being led.

897
00:35:36,983 --> 00:35:38,053
That's why...

898
00:35:40,353 --> 00:35:42,052
That's why I got stressed out earlier.

899
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:44,392
- I see. - I see why she was stressed.

900
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:46,323
- Right. - Also, I saw...

901
00:35:47,463 --> 00:35:51,033
Sang Won tried to leave us alone when no one asked.

902
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:52,963
I found him considerate.

903
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:54,532
He has such good manners.

904
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:56,102
Right. He seems naturally well-mannered.

905
00:35:56,103 --> 00:35:58,373
Exactly. He's thoughtful and tactful.

906
00:35:59,573 --> 00:36:01,513
I'm curious about Sang Won's feelings.

907
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:06,842
So I wanted to talk more...

908
00:36:06,843 --> 00:36:09,313
to Mu Jin and Sang Won.

909
00:36:10,113 --> 00:36:11,482
I mean, I can talk to them, but...

910
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:12,783
What's going on?

911
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:17,992
I know I should respect both you and Mu Jin's feelings,

912
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:22,233
but I don't think I should avoid talking to him because of you.

913
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:25,132
It might bother you,

914
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:26,703
but you said you didn't care.

915
00:36:27,173 --> 00:36:29,573
When I am talking in private,

916
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:33,943
I'm not sure if I should refrain from telling him how I feel.

917
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:37,712
If you want to show your feelings, you can go ahead and tell him.

918
00:36:37,713 --> 00:36:40,852
It's possible that more than one girl is interested in the same man.

919
00:36:40,853 --> 00:36:42,882
- That's right. It's possible. - If one of them expresses...

920
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:44,953
If one of them expresses their feeling,

921
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,922
- it's the same... - That I care about him.

922
00:36:46,923 --> 00:36:49,123
As telling the other not to approach the guy.

923
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:51,922
And I don't really care...

924
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:54,263
about things like that.

925
00:36:54,893 --> 00:36:57,033
So it's up to you whether or not you tell him.

926
00:36:57,963 --> 00:36:59,932
It might bother you,

927
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:01,403
but you said you didn't care.

928
00:37:01,973 --> 00:37:04,543
How can I not care about it? Of course, I care about it.

929
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:09,142
I didn't mean I didn't care like it doesn't bother me at all.

930
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,782
- But I can't tell you what to do. - Right.

931
00:37:11,783 --> 00:37:14,613
Even though it bothers me, that's not something I can control.

932
00:37:14,783 --> 00:37:16,153
That's what I meant by that.

933
00:37:17,183 --> 00:37:18,922
We still have a few days left,

934
00:37:18,923 --> 00:37:21,893
so I think it's a good idea to talk more to other guys.

935
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:24,463
And the two of them are the ones I want to talk to.

936
00:37:26,323 --> 00:37:29,633
(So Hyun said she wanted to talk to Mu Jin, which bothers Bon Hee.)

937
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:33,462
I really like that she shared her thoughts openly and honestly.

938
00:37:33,463 --> 00:37:34,679
(It's good that she shared her thoughts openly and honestly.)

939
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:35,802
(So Hyun is so cool.)

940
00:37:35,803 --> 00:37:39,072
How do you think So Hyun's feelings changed...

941
00:37:39,073 --> 00:37:40,872
after the date?

942
00:37:40,873 --> 00:37:43,542
- It didn't occur after the date. - I see.

943
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:46,883
I think her feelings changed to some extent during the date.

944
00:37:47,513 --> 00:37:51,653
In that sense, I believe she chose Mu Jin intentionally.

945
00:37:52,123 --> 00:37:53,952
The man she told she was interested in...

946
00:37:53,953 --> 00:37:57,523
was being indifferent toward her.

947
00:37:57,963 --> 00:37:59,262
So she decided...

948
00:37:59,263 --> 00:38:02,932
to choose Mu Jin whom she was interested in at first.

949
00:38:02,933 --> 00:38:04,902
Then she had fun with Mu Jin making light physical contact.

950
00:38:04,903 --> 00:38:05,903
(Yes, she did.)

951
00:38:05,904 --> 00:38:08,373
Right now, it seems to me...

952
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:11,042
that she probably has two separate rooms in her heart now.

953
00:38:11,043 --> 00:38:13,972
She must've developed feelings for someone else as well.

954
00:38:13,973 --> 00:38:16,289
(So Hyun developed feelings for someone else but Sang Hyeon?)

955
00:38:16,313 --> 00:38:19,543
I was so out of it earlier today.

956
00:38:20,043 --> 00:38:21,813
Did things not go as you wanted?

957
00:38:22,253 --> 00:38:23,782
It's not like that.

958
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:25,752
I didn't know what to do.

959
00:38:25,753 --> 00:38:27,593
And there was one thing...

960
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,553
I realized through the date.

961
00:38:30,123 --> 00:38:32,963
When I'm with a group of people...

962
00:38:33,763 --> 00:38:36,063
- including someone I like, - You can't take care of her?

963
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:38,902
I can't do anything.

964
00:38:38,903 --> 00:38:40,232
So he's always like that.

965
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:41,602
You're comfortable around her when you're alone with her?

966
00:38:41,603 --> 00:38:43,742
- You rather feel comfortable then? - Yes, when it's just the two of us.

967
00:38:43,743 --> 00:38:44,949
(He doesn't know how to express in front of a group of people.)

968
00:38:44,973 --> 00:38:47,472
I didn't know what I should do.

969
00:38:47,473 --> 00:38:49,072
- I know what you mean. - So I...

970
00:38:49,073 --> 00:38:51,219
I could tell that you were worried about it during the date.

971
00:38:51,243 --> 00:38:53,683
He's inept in dating.

972
00:38:57,923 --> 00:39:01,122
(Sang Hyeon changes his clothes feeling troubled.)

973
00:39:01,123 --> 00:39:04,963
(And he comes out to the terrace alone.)

974
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:08,563
(Sighing)

975
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:12,133
Sang Hyeon doesn't seem to have much dating experience.

976
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:17,172
He finds it difficult to approach the person he likes.

977
00:39:17,173 --> 00:39:18,872
- I think so too. - Right?

978
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:19,949
(Sang Hyeon has a lot on his mind.)

979
00:39:19,973 --> 00:39:22,442
(Meanwhile, Mu Jin and Sang Won are resting in their room.)

980
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,519
How did you feel about going on a date with Bon Hee?

981
00:39:24,543 --> 00:39:25,712
You were happy, right?

982
00:39:25,713 --> 00:39:26,913
So Hyun was there too.

983
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,013
Sang Hyeon and I took care of So Hyun.

984
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:34,953
It was more fun than I thought.

985
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:38,393
Will you talk to Ji Won when she comes back?

986
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,433
Well... I don't know.

987
00:39:42,693 --> 00:39:44,033
Things got so complicated.

988
00:39:44,463 --> 00:39:45,863
We don't have much time left now.

989
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:49,103
Whatever. I was annoyed by the uneven gender ratio.

990
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:51,843
I was so upset.

991
00:39:53,303 --> 00:39:55,013
I understand why he was upset.

992
00:39:55,113 --> 00:39:56,812
That's why I wanted to drive.

993
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:58,643
- Really? - So that you guys could talk.

994
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:01,983
Oh, goodness.

995
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:04,553
- He must be upset. - Our director. I'm upset for him.

996
00:40:06,723 --> 00:40:10,693
(So Hyun comes out of the room and heads somewhere.)

997
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:14,262
(She arrives at the men's room?)

998
00:40:14,263 --> 00:40:15,392
Isn't it Mu Jin's room?

999
00:40:15,393 --> 00:40:17,862
- Yes, it's Mu Jin's. - It's Mu Jin's room.

1000
00:40:17,863 --> 00:40:19,433
(Whom is So Hyun looking for?)

1001
00:40:22,373 --> 00:40:23,602
What?

1002
00:40:23,603 --> 00:40:25,323
Oh, the one she's looking for is not there.

1003
00:40:28,743 --> 00:40:31,343
(Thinking hard and hesitating)

1004
00:40:38,953 --> 00:40:40,923
The color of the sky is beautiful.

1005
00:40:41,123 --> 00:40:42,453
(Surprised)

1006
00:40:52,303 --> 00:40:55,333
(So Hyun quietly stands in front of Sang Hyeon.)

1007
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:57,103
(Standing up)

1008
00:40:57,773 --> 00:40:59,873
The color of the sky is really beautiful.

1009
00:41:00,173 --> 00:41:03,013
Good. Do something when you're alone with her.

1010
00:41:03,743 --> 00:41:05,282
Have the others come yet?

1011
00:41:05,283 --> 00:41:08,013
I haven't seen them. I've been in my room until now.

1012
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,543
I came out to hang out with others and found you here.

1013
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:16,823
I had a tough time earlier today.

1014
00:41:17,123 --> 00:41:18,339
- It was hard for me. - You had a tough time?

1015
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:19,792
It was hard in another way.

1016
00:41:19,793 --> 00:41:21,893
So I wanted to spend some time alone.

1017
00:41:23,393 --> 00:41:25,133
(Sighing)

1018
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:30,103
(Sang Hyeon can't open up about his feelings easily.)

1019
00:41:31,243 --> 00:41:34,173
- I have a question. - Fire away. What is it?

1020
00:41:34,843 --> 00:41:37,013
- Earlier today, I felt... - Yes?

1021
00:41:38,683 --> 00:41:41,283
It was arranged as a date.

1022
00:41:41,383 --> 00:41:43,212
- That's right. - Yes.

1023
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:46,552
But you just ran around like a puppy.

1024
00:41:46,553 --> 00:41:49,792
- So it got me confused. - Oh, really?

1025
00:41:49,793 --> 00:41:51,963
I was confused. I felt...

1026
00:41:53,363 --> 00:41:55,993
- I realized something today. - Okay.

1027
00:41:56,393 --> 00:41:58,833
When I go on a double date or when I'm with other people too,

1028
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,502
I don't just become a fool but also don't know what to do...

1029
00:42:01,503 --> 00:42:03,733
which makes me act even more awkwardly.

1030
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:08,743
What makes a double date different from a 1-on-1 date?

1031
00:42:09,373 --> 00:42:12,613
When I'm alone with my date, I'm able to think...

1032
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:15,453
about what I can help her with...

1033
00:42:15,753 --> 00:42:18,952
and what she can do by herself.

1034
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,593
And I can act naturally.

1035
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:24,292
What are the things that I can do on my own...

1036
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:27,532
and that I need help with on a date at an ice rink?

1037
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:29,232
We just skate together. That's all.

1038
00:42:29,233 --> 00:42:31,003
- And we have fun. - That's right.

1039
00:42:31,433 --> 00:42:32,663
Did I skate too well?

1040
00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:34,783
Was there nothing I needed your help with?

1041
00:42:35,573 --> 00:42:37,972
It's not like that. I thought...

1042
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:40,403
- Here's what I thought at first. - Okay.

1043
00:42:41,473 --> 00:42:44,782
I thought you needed to talk more...

1044
00:42:44,783 --> 00:42:46,513
- to the other guys as well. - Yes.

1045
00:42:47,143 --> 00:42:48,982
But then I couldn't help but see...

1046
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,223
how Mu Jin took care of you.

1047
00:42:51,953 --> 00:42:54,122
Watching you guys like that,

1048
00:42:54,123 --> 00:42:56,953
I didn't know what I should do.

1049
00:42:57,563 --> 00:43:00,693
I just thought, "Am I being jealous right now?"

1050
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:03,533
- Oh, so it was because of Mu Jin. - No wonder.

1051
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:06,733
Gosh. It drives me crazy.

1052
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:11,603
I was like, "Should I do something?"

1053
00:43:12,043 --> 00:43:13,672
And when I tried to do something,

1054
00:43:13,673 --> 00:43:16,613
I felt so awkward for no reason.

1055
00:43:18,243 --> 00:43:20,143
- He felt uncomfortable. - Right.

1056
00:43:20,543 --> 00:43:22,313
- Oh, my. - He was already uncomfortable...

1057
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:25,453
around Mu Jin because of his relationship with Bon Hee.

1058
00:43:25,553 --> 00:43:28,092
On top of that, Mu Jin stayed close...

1059
00:43:28,093 --> 00:43:29,853
to the woman who liked me.

1060
00:43:29,953 --> 00:43:32,863
It wasn't Mu Jin's choice but So Hyun's, though.

1061
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:36,033
Anyway, all those things...

1062
00:43:36,233 --> 00:43:38,403
created an uncomfortable situation for Sang Hyeon.

1063
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:41,133
I was like, "Should I do something?"

1064
00:43:41,603 --> 00:43:43,202
And when I tried to do something,

1065
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:46,243
I felt so awkward for no reason.

1066
00:43:47,643 --> 00:43:49,243
What were you going to do?

1067
00:43:50,513 --> 00:43:52,343
I was... Don't ask.

1068
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:54,813
I was going to be more attentive.

1069
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:59,322
Watching someone else did it for you...

1070
00:43:59,323 --> 00:44:01,653
while I was contemplating doing something for you...

1071
00:44:03,123 --> 00:44:04,722
I wished I were the one who did it for you.

1072
00:44:04,723 --> 00:44:06,423
Such thoughts crossed my mind.

1073
00:44:06,993 --> 00:44:08,293
That's what happened.

1074
00:44:08,463 --> 00:44:09,463
There's nothing wrong about being inept.

1075
00:44:09,464 --> 00:44:10,563
- Of course. - Yes.

1076
00:44:10,663 --> 00:44:15,103
Exactly. I know that you're the type...

1077
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:19,173
that always thinks long and hard about everything, but...

1078
00:44:20,773 --> 00:44:22,493
- What I can tell you is... - I don't know.

1079
00:44:24,683 --> 00:44:26,543
That you should put your thoughts into action.

1080
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:28,982
- She sure is older than him. - Right.

1081
00:44:28,983 --> 00:44:31,683
Why do you think too much? It's pointless if you don't act.

1082
00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:34,052
That's my advice to you.

1083
00:44:34,053 --> 00:44:35,092
(Did the conversation relieve So Hyun's frustration?)

1084
00:44:35,093 --> 00:44:36,392
Gosh, I hate myself.

1085
00:44:36,393 --> 00:44:39,023
(Did the conversation relieve So Hyun's frustration?)

1086
00:44:40,793 --> 00:44:42,833
- It sure is pretty. - The same color as mackerel.

1087
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:45,333
I'll show you some time. It's really cute.

1088
00:44:45,663 --> 00:44:47,833
It must be so adorable. What's its name?

1089
00:44:47,933 --> 00:44:49,402
- It's Leo. - Leo?

1090
00:44:49,403 --> 00:44:50,903
It's quite a common name.

1091
00:44:51,003 --> 00:44:52,042
I think it looks handsome.

1092
00:44:52,043 --> 00:44:53,703
Indeed. It's pretty and handsome.

1093
00:44:53,803 --> 00:44:56,072
So Hyun said she had a cat too.

1094
00:44:56,073 --> 00:44:57,073
I think I heard that.

1095
00:44:57,743 --> 00:44:58,743
They have something in common.

1096
00:44:58,744 --> 00:45:00,682
I think So Hyun looks like a cat.

1097
00:45:00,683 --> 00:45:01,712
Doesn't she?

1098
00:45:01,713 --> 00:45:04,723
What about Ji Won? Does she have a cat face?

1099
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:07,753
No, Ji Won...

1100
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:10,422
is more like a puppy, I think.

1101
00:45:10,423 --> 00:45:11,922
She has a personality like puppies.

1102
00:45:11,923 --> 00:45:12,923
That's right, she does...

1103
00:45:12,924 --> 00:45:15,192
She looks that way because she always smiles.

1104
00:45:15,193 --> 00:45:17,362
- She's like a Golden Retriever. - Right.

1105
00:45:17,363 --> 00:45:18,443
She has a good personality.

1106
00:45:19,563 --> 00:45:21,033
- She's considerate. - Right.

1107
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:24,213
She's a good listener, she initiates conversations well, and she's kind.

1108
00:45:25,073 --> 00:45:26,843
And that makes me feel comfortable.

1109
00:45:29,113 --> 00:45:30,233
I think she's a good person.

1110
00:45:31,913 --> 00:45:34,043
But I think I might've made her uncomfortable.

1111
00:45:35,453 --> 00:45:37,413
To be honest, I'm not sure if it's because of me.

1112
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:39,222
I wonder if it's only because of me...

1113
00:45:39,223 --> 00:45:42,223
or because she's still confused about her own feelings.

1114
00:45:43,023 --> 00:45:44,763
She doesn't have interest only in me.

1115
00:45:44,863 --> 00:45:47,463
She said she wanted to talk to the other guys too.

1116
00:45:47,933 --> 00:45:49,862
So I want to know if she's not sure about her feelings.

1117
00:45:49,863 --> 00:45:52,009
(Sang Won can't stop thinking about Ji Won's feelings.)

1118
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:53,132
They're coming back.

1119
00:45:53,133 --> 00:45:54,802
(Team Over Zero arrives right then.)

1120
00:45:54,803 --> 00:45:55,973
They must not have come yet.

1121
00:45:56,903 --> 00:45:58,649
- Haven't they come yet? - I don't think so.

1122
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,603
- Hello. - What took you so long?

1123
00:46:01,313 --> 00:46:02,342
- Hi. - Sorry?

1124
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,073
They all seem out of energy.

1125
00:46:04,743 --> 00:46:05,813
They must've had fun.

1126
00:46:06,213 --> 00:46:07,312
It was so much fun.

1127
00:46:07,313 --> 00:46:09,453
I'm jealous. I wish I had tried water sports.

1128
00:46:09,553 --> 00:46:10,553
- Really? - It was fun.

1129
00:46:10,554 --> 00:46:12,252
All of you seem so exhausted.

1130
00:46:12,253 --> 00:46:14,613
- It was extremely exhausting. - You look really exhausted.

1131
00:46:14,793 --> 00:46:16,513
- She fell into water. - I fell into water.

1132
00:46:16,893 --> 00:46:18,722
- We couldn't have dinner. - We couldn't have dinner.

1133
00:46:18,723 --> 00:46:20,062
My stomach is empty.

1134
00:46:20,063 --> 00:46:21,232
- I'm hungry. - You look so tired.

1135
00:46:21,233 --> 00:46:23,192
I want to eat some cheesecake.

1136
00:46:23,193 --> 00:46:24,332
Eat the one that isn't open yet.

1137
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:26,493
- I want some coffee too. - Those who don't like it...

1138
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:28,002
You look so tired.

1139
00:46:28,003 --> 00:46:30,003
- They really look... - Wash up and come back.

1140
00:46:30,103 --> 00:46:31,572
- I need to eat something. - There could be nothing left.

1141
00:46:31,573 --> 00:46:34,313
- We're out of it. - It's right there in the middle.

1142
00:46:37,213 --> 00:46:39,743
I'll eat some cheesecake. I'm so hungry.

1143
00:46:40,883 --> 00:46:42,083
- I'm starving. - Eat some,

1144
00:46:42,183 --> 00:46:43,452
- What? - wash up, and come back.

1145
00:46:43,453 --> 00:46:44,883
- I'll do it for you. - Thank you.

1146
00:46:46,883 --> 00:46:49,093
- She's good at everything. - No way.

1147
00:46:50,093 --> 00:46:52,993
She saw them. Ye Eun saw them. Oh, no.

1148
00:46:54,063 --> 00:46:55,669
She's pretending she didn't see anything.

1149
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:56,733
She's good at everything?

1150
00:46:57,963 --> 00:46:59,262
(Sang Won helps Ji Won as she's hungry.)

1151
00:46:59,263 --> 00:47:01,073
Oh, my goodness.

1152
00:47:01,503 --> 00:47:03,672
- It's hard to ignore. - This is a mess.

1153
00:47:03,673 --> 00:47:05,502
- They're being so lovey-dovey. - Right.

1154
00:47:05,503 --> 00:47:08,873
(And Ye Eun is watching Sang Won and Ji Won.)

1155
00:47:09,713 --> 00:47:11,313
- Right? - Thank you.

1156
00:47:12,183 --> 00:47:13,183
She's good at everything?

1157
00:47:13,184 --> 00:47:14,913
- Really... - Did you try wakeboarding too?

1158
00:47:15,013 --> 00:47:16,082
- Of course. - That must've been fun.

1159
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,323
- She's good at everything. - No way.

1160
00:47:19,153 --> 00:47:23,193
It's hard for a beginner to stand up on a wakeboard.

1161
00:47:24,053 --> 00:47:25,592
- But she made it. - You mean, Ji Won?

1162
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,522
- Yes. - Ji Won has talent in sports.

1163
00:47:27,523 --> 00:47:28,633
She's really amazing.

1164
00:47:29,863 --> 00:47:30,933
I mean it.

1165
00:47:35,173 --> 00:47:37,303
I'm worried. She looks so exhausted.

1166
00:47:39,503 --> 00:47:41,513
Don't I look okay either?

1167
00:47:41,913 --> 00:47:43,672
- Don't I look okay? - You look tired.

1168
00:47:43,673 --> 00:47:44,713
Right. I'm tired.

1169
00:47:45,383 --> 00:47:47,482
- I dozed off in the car. - She stood up and rode it.

1170
00:47:47,483 --> 00:47:49,203
- She looked so cool from behind. - No way.

1171
00:47:50,313 --> 00:47:51,353
To be honest,

1172
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:52,682
- No way. - I'm not good at sports.

1173
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:54,422
I'll put in some ice. Do you need some?

1174
00:47:54,423 --> 00:47:58,222
(The awkward tension between them continues because of Sang Won.)

1175
00:47:58,223 --> 00:47:59,792
Oh, gosh. That's not good.

1176
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,293
I'll go upstairs, guys.

1177
00:48:02,533 --> 00:48:04,303
I'll wash up and come back.

1178
00:48:05,563 --> 00:48:07,533
All the guys gathered here.

1179
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:09,472
What will they talk about? I'm so curious.

1180
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:11,973
When we were talking in the car,

1181
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,773
there were so many topics that I didn't know.

1182
00:48:15,173 --> 00:48:16,312
Topics that he doesn't know?

1183
00:48:16,313 --> 00:48:19,382
We went to an ice skate rink, you know.

1184
00:48:19,383 --> 00:48:21,253
- You mean, an ice rink. - Right, an ice rink.

1185
00:48:21,683 --> 00:48:24,422
- We said we rode inline skates... - We said we knew...

1186
00:48:24,423 --> 00:48:25,522
- how to ride them. - Right.

1187
00:48:25,523 --> 00:48:28,192
- So... - She said she rode roller skates.

1188
00:48:28,193 --> 00:48:29,523
She said "rollerblades."

1189
00:48:31,263 --> 00:48:32,292
Roller rinks?

1190
00:48:32,293 --> 00:48:34,993
- So we... - She said "rollerblades."

1191
00:48:35,733 --> 00:48:36,733
Roller rinks?

1192
00:48:36,793 --> 00:48:39,003
I've only seen a roller rink in a drama.

1193
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:40,702
He's seen it in a drama.

1194
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,532
- They talked about Se7en. - Oh, right. Se7en.

1195
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:44,103
- What? Who is Se7en? - Se7en...

1196
00:48:44,403 --> 00:48:45,442
- What? - He asked who Se7en was.

1197
00:48:45,443 --> 00:48:46,443
(They don't know Se7en?)

1198
00:48:46,444 --> 00:48:47,719
(Se7en is a Korean singer who debuted with "Come Back to Me.")

1199
00:48:47,743 --> 00:48:49,112
- What? Who is Se7en? - Se7en...

1200
00:48:49,113 --> 00:48:51,743
- He debuted when we were little. - He's married to Lee Da Hae.

1201
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,953
You know the shoes that have wheels in the heel, right?

1202
00:48:55,053 --> 00:48:58,053
Is it called Heelys? Anyway, Se7en used to wear them.

1203
00:48:58,153 --> 00:48:59,582
They suddenly started talking about him,

1204
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:01,329
- and we couldn't hide our emotions. - Se7en...

1205
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:02,593
We were like, "What are those?"

1206
00:49:02,793 --> 00:49:06,122
I mean, it was my first time hearing that word.

1207
00:49:06,123 --> 00:49:07,623
- This is unbelievable. - So I was...

1208
00:49:08,463 --> 00:49:09,832
How can this be happening?

1209
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,102
Oh, my gosh. What should we do?

1210
00:49:11,103 --> 00:49:12,732
How old are they?

1211
00:49:12,733 --> 00:49:13,733
(A single word made them feel the generation gap.)

1212
00:49:13,734 --> 00:49:14,972
My goodness.

1213
00:49:14,973 --> 00:49:16,532
Are they around SOOBIN's age?

1214
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:17,602
This is fun.

1215
00:49:17,603 --> 00:49:20,342
So there are five men around SOOBIN's age.

1216
00:49:20,343 --> 00:49:21,343
- Right. - SOOBIN...

1217
00:49:21,344 --> 00:49:24,172
- Could he be 24 or 25? - Is he 30... Is he 24?

1218
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:26,612
- Could he be that young? - I was sure they were in their 30s.

1219
00:49:26,613 --> 00:49:27,642
- You mean, Ji Yung? - No.

1220
00:49:27,643 --> 00:49:30,052
I thought most of the guys were in their 30s.

1221
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:31,053
I think they're in their early 30s.

1222
00:49:31,054 --> 00:49:32,252
No. I think some of them are in their 20s.

1223
00:49:32,253 --> 00:49:33,582
- They seem to be in their 20s. - Based on their reaction,

1224
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:34,892
they could be around my age.

1225
00:49:34,893 --> 00:49:36,093
Se7en...

1226
00:49:36,423 --> 00:49:37,452
Se7en...

1227
00:49:37,453 --> 00:49:40,592
My sister is ten years older than me,

1228
00:49:40,593 --> 00:49:42,433
and she was a huge K-pop fan, so I know him.

1229
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:45,662
But my friends don't know Se7en.

1230
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:46,732
That's understandable.

1231
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,833
- Can I ask you something? - What is it?

1232
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:51,743
Can you date a woman who's ten years older than you?

1233
00:49:53,643 --> 00:49:55,843
I think I can, easily.

1234
00:49:55,943 --> 00:49:57,172
- You can easily date one? - Really?

1235
00:49:57,173 --> 00:49:59,312
- I wouldn't mind it at all. - He doesn't mind it.

1236
00:49:59,313 --> 00:50:00,413
- I don't. - Goodness.

1237
00:50:00,683 --> 00:50:02,112
- He doesn't mind it. - He's the real man.

1238
00:50:02,113 --> 00:50:03,213
(My feelings matter more.)

1239
00:50:04,553 --> 00:50:07,253
(You received a new message.)

1240
00:50:07,853 --> 00:50:08,923
Oh.

1241
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:11,163
I think we got a message, guys.

1242
00:50:11,563 --> 00:50:12,762
A message.

1243
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:14,762
(Your age will be revealed.)

1244
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:17,392
(Please gather at the yard.)

1245
00:50:17,393 --> 00:50:18,663
- The age. - The age.

1246
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,633
Finally.

1247
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,549
- Their age will be revealed. - What will they do?

1248
00:50:22,573 --> 00:50:23,832
We waited too long.

1249
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:25,503
- Oh, dear. - Goodness.

1250
00:50:26,643 --> 00:50:27,673
Finally.

1251
00:50:29,043 --> 00:50:31,142
Our age will be revealed. No way.

1252
00:50:31,143 --> 00:50:32,213
(My goodness!)

1253
00:50:32,843 --> 00:50:35,552
(There are 10 beanbags in the yard.)

1254
00:50:35,553 --> 00:50:37,213
Can we sit wherever we want?

1255
00:50:37,683 --> 00:50:40,253
- Do we just sit? - Can we sit wherever we want?

1256
00:50:40,923 --> 00:50:42,123
Anywhere?

1257
00:50:42,853 --> 00:50:45,163
- Can we sit wherever we like? - I guess so.

1258
00:50:47,793 --> 00:50:49,863
- I will sit here. - Sit here.

1259
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:51,463
Goodness.

1260
00:50:52,303 --> 00:50:54,032
I took a shower and worked.

1261
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:55,372
- You did? - Yes.

1262
00:50:55,373 --> 00:50:56,373
I will sit there because my left face is prettier.

1263
00:50:56,374 --> 00:50:58,642
(Ji Won follows Sang Won.)

1264
00:50:58,643 --> 00:51:00,073
I will sit here.

1265
00:51:00,573 --> 00:51:04,113
(Sang Won sits between Ye Eun and Ji Won.)

1266
00:51:04,943 --> 00:51:06,883
(Looking)

1267
00:51:08,183 --> 00:51:10,113
(Bothered)

1268
00:51:10,813 --> 00:51:13,423
Sang Won is sitting between Ji Won and Ye Eun.

1269
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:14,723
He is.

1270
00:51:16,593 --> 00:51:18,793
Next to Mu Jin is So Hyun and Bon Hee.

1271
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:20,609
Sang Hyeon is sitting alone.

1272
00:51:20,633 --> 00:51:22,733
Next to Mu Jin is So Hyun and Bon Hee.

1273
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:25,271
Sang Hyeon is sitting alone.

1274
00:51:27,141 --> 00:51:28,141
(Sighing)

1275
00:51:28,142 --> 00:51:29,241
I'm nervous.

1276
00:51:30,811 --> 00:51:32,010
I'm so nervous...

1277
00:51:32,011 --> 00:51:33,220
- that I don't know what to say. - I know.

1278
00:51:33,221 --> 00:51:35,521
- Everyone just feels it. - Right.

1279
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:37,591
- That it's an important moment. - Yes.

1280
00:51:39,991 --> 00:51:43,360
(It's an important moment they forgot about for a while.)

1281
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:46,130
Isn't it possible that things will go back to Day One?

1282
00:51:46,131 --> 00:51:47,600
- Right. - Honestly?

1283
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:49,321
- Because of their ages? - Let's be honest.

1284
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:52,100
I don't know how big of an impact it will have.

1285
00:51:52,101 --> 00:51:54,941
(They exchange glances in silence.)

1286
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:59,140
(And everyone's eyes gather at one spot.)

1287
00:51:59,141 --> 00:52:00,510
- My goodness. - My goodness.

1288
00:52:00,511 --> 00:52:03,881
(And everyone's eyes gather at one spot.)

1289
00:52:04,681 --> 00:52:05,681
(Yeon House)

1290
00:52:05,682 --> 00:52:08,650
(Chapter 1. Our Childhood)

1291
00:52:08,651 --> 00:52:09,990
- No way. - Here we go.

1292
00:52:09,991 --> 00:52:11,291
Childhood.

1293
00:52:13,261 --> 00:52:14,361
Already.

1294
00:52:14,491 --> 00:52:16,430
(Amazed)

1295
00:52:16,431 --> 00:52:17,831
So pretty.

1296
00:52:18,091 --> 00:52:19,761
- Adorable. - Is it a video?

1297
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:23,730
It's Ye Eun.

1298
00:52:23,731 --> 00:52:25,800
(The 5-year-old Ye Eun dreamed of becoming a ballerina.)

1299
00:52:25,801 --> 00:52:27,701
- It's so cool. - It's so cool.

1300
00:52:28,141 --> 00:52:31,540
She's surprised to see her photo move.

1301
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:33,911
(Emotional)

1302
00:52:34,211 --> 00:52:35,811
- What? - What?

1303
00:52:36,211 --> 00:52:38,311
- Is it Ji Won? - Ji Won?

1304
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:42,480
(The 12-year-old Ji Won...)

1305
00:52:42,481 --> 00:52:43,850
She used to play violin.

1306
00:52:43,851 --> 00:52:48,891
(dreamed of becoming a violinist.)

1307
00:52:50,231 --> 00:52:51,291
Goodness.

1308
00:52:52,031 --> 00:52:53,230
They are all surprised...

1309
00:52:53,231 --> 00:52:54,761
to see their photos.

1310
00:52:54,931 --> 00:52:59,570
(The 7-year-old Yeong Gyeong had tanned skin.)

1311
00:52:59,571 --> 00:53:00,641
Goodness.

1312
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:03,340
You said you had tanned skin as a child, and it was true.

1313
00:53:03,341 --> 00:53:04,541
Yes, I had tanned skin.

1314
00:53:04,711 --> 00:53:05,810
She's so pale-skinned now.

1315
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:06,911
- It's true. - Yes.

1316
00:53:08,441 --> 00:53:10,481
So Hyun. So cute.

1317
00:53:11,011 --> 00:53:12,250
- Adorable. - Fat cheeks.

1318
00:53:12,251 --> 00:53:14,680
(The 5-year-old So Hyun had fat cheeks.)

1319
00:53:14,681 --> 00:53:16,121
She looks the same.

1320
00:53:19,891 --> 00:53:21,921
So Hyun. So cute.

1321
00:53:25,991 --> 00:53:27,160
She's exactly the same.

1322
00:53:27,161 --> 00:53:31,001
(The 9-year-old Bon Hee looked exactly the same as now.)

1323
00:53:31,601 --> 00:53:32,931
So pretty.

1324
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:37,570
- It's me. - Is it you really?

1325
00:53:37,571 --> 00:53:38,610
So cute.

1326
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:40,240
- He's so cute. - Why is he so cute?

1327
00:53:40,241 --> 00:53:41,480
(The 4-year-old Mu Jin had the same smiles.)

1328
00:53:41,481 --> 00:53:43,081
Mu Jin is super adorable.

1329
00:53:44,281 --> 00:53:45,511
So adorable.

1330
00:53:47,921 --> 00:53:50,291
Goodness.

1331
00:53:51,491 --> 00:53:52,520
(Laughing)

1332
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:55,520
The one on the right is me.

1333
00:53:55,521 --> 00:53:56,661
Cute.

1334
00:53:57,331 --> 00:53:59,260
He looks exactly the same.

1335
00:53:59,261 --> 00:54:03,631
(The lovely 6-year-old Sang Hyeon)

1336
00:54:03,931 --> 00:54:05,601
Who is that? Hyeon Jun.

1337
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,370
- He's strong. - Cute.

1338
00:54:07,371 --> 00:54:08,501
- Strong. - Cute.

1339
00:54:09,141 --> 00:54:10,211
Hyeon Jun.

1340
00:54:10,941 --> 00:54:12,211
Very similar.

1341
00:54:15,481 --> 00:54:16,510
Who is that?

1342
00:54:16,511 --> 00:54:17,881
- Sang Won. - Sang Won.

1343
00:54:21,081 --> 00:54:22,350
He was a mischievous boy.

1344
00:54:22,351 --> 00:54:23,820
- Clear eyes. - He looks the same.

1345
00:54:23,821 --> 00:54:24,950
Look at him.

1346
00:54:24,951 --> 00:54:26,290
- So handsome. - Goodness.

1347
00:54:26,291 --> 00:54:27,361
So cute.

1348
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:29,761
- Goodness, so cute. - So cute.

1349
00:54:30,531 --> 00:54:31,531
It's Ji Yung.

1350
00:54:31,532 --> 00:54:33,160
- You were really close. - He looks the same.

1351
00:54:33,161 --> 00:54:34,730
He's got an older sister.

1352
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:36,571
(The 4-year-old was very close to his sister.)

1353
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:39,671
You were really close.

1354
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:41,901
Isn't it strange that he once had thin arms?

1355
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:44,640
- Thin arms? - They are thin.

1356
00:54:44,641 --> 00:54:46,071
What are you saying to a baby?

1357
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:49,641
"What are you saying to a baby?"

1358
00:54:50,181 --> 00:54:51,650
(Chapter 2. Our 20s)

1359
00:54:51,651 --> 00:54:52,951
- "Our 20s"? - "Our 20s"?

1360
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:57,291
What?

1361
00:54:57,691 --> 00:54:58,921
It's Cyworld.

1362
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:01,321
- That's crazy. - So pretty.

1363
00:55:03,431 --> 00:55:04,760
She's so pretty.

1364
00:55:04,761 --> 00:55:08,160
(Ye Eun was very cute in her 20s.)

1365
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:10,201
- She looks the same. - She's the same.

1366
00:55:16,671 --> 00:55:17,841
That's me.

1367
00:55:18,171 --> 00:55:19,370
It's Ji Won.

1368
00:55:19,371 --> 00:55:23,411
(Ji Won in her 20s is smiling brightly.)

1369
00:55:24,411 --> 00:55:26,291
- Is that Yeong Gyeong? - Is that Yeong Gyeong?

1370
00:55:26,851 --> 00:55:28,081
So cute.

1371
00:55:30,321 --> 00:55:31,720
Everyone looks the same.

1372
00:55:31,721 --> 00:55:33,220
(It's as if Yeong Gyeong was in her 20s just yesterday.)

1373
00:55:33,221 --> 00:55:34,560
Yeong Gyeong...

1374
00:55:34,561 --> 00:55:36,190
hasn't changed a bit.

1375
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,831
(Looking closely)

1376
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:39,491
My goodness.

1377
00:55:40,101 --> 00:55:41,460
Goodness. She's got a different vibe.

1378
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:42,661
I know.

1379
00:55:44,171 --> 00:55:45,200
(Bon Hee had a different vibe in her 20s.)

1380
00:55:45,201 --> 00:55:47,001
- What? - Completely different.

1381
00:55:47,441 --> 00:55:48,871
She had a really different vibe.

1382
00:55:49,671 --> 00:55:52,610
Doesn't she remind us of Park Ji Yoon?

1383
00:55:52,611 --> 00:55:53,911
- Right. - The singer.

1384
00:55:53,981 --> 00:55:55,540
(Focused)

1385
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:56,980
So pretty.

1386
00:55:56,981 --> 00:55:58,281
(Taking a peek)

1387
00:56:01,551 --> 00:56:02,951
So cute.

1388
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,050
- So young. - She was a baby.

1389
00:56:05,051 --> 00:56:06,291
Is it So Hyun?

1390
00:56:06,661 --> 00:56:08,421
(Nodding)

1391
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:11,660
(Watching closely)

1392
00:56:11,661 --> 00:56:13,760
(So Hyun was very youthful in her 20s.)

1393
00:56:13,761 --> 00:56:14,860
So cute.

1394
00:56:14,861 --> 00:56:17,401
(So Hyun was very youthful in her 20s.)

1395
00:56:18,271 --> 00:56:20,271
I am curious to see the photos of the younger men.

1396
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:22,001
(Surprised)

1397
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:23,641
(Cute)

1398
00:56:24,771 --> 00:56:25,940
I was in the army.

1399
00:56:25,941 --> 00:56:27,280
- Really? - Were you in the army?

1400
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:29,480
- I was in the army. - He's good-looking.

1401
00:56:29,481 --> 00:56:31,080
(The 20-year-old Mu Jin was a handsome young soldier.)

1402
00:56:31,081 --> 00:56:32,710
He looks so young.

1403
00:56:32,711 --> 00:56:34,251
He looks different from now.

1404
00:56:34,481 --> 00:56:35,881
It's Sang Hyeon.

1405
00:56:36,151 --> 00:56:37,591
Goodness.

1406
00:56:40,291 --> 00:56:41,521
He's adorable.

1407
00:56:41,691 --> 00:56:43,631
- He had fat cheeks. - He looks so innocent.

1408
00:56:44,061 --> 00:56:45,630
He looks a little different.

1409
00:56:45,631 --> 00:56:49,061
(The 20-year-old Sang Hyeon looked adorable.)

1410
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,200
It must be Hyeon Jun.

1411
00:56:51,201 --> 00:56:52,400
(Is it Hyeon Jun?)

1412
00:56:52,401 --> 00:56:54,671
- Why is he an adult? - Is it a long time ago?

1413
00:56:55,741 --> 00:56:57,010
(The 20-year-old Hyeon Jun had a sharp jawline.)

1414
00:56:57,011 --> 00:56:58,941
What? He looks amazing.

1415
00:57:00,241 --> 00:57:01,481
Solid.

1416
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:04,611
- They are all good-looking. - When he was in medical school.

1417
00:57:06,351 --> 00:57:08,681
(Interested)

1418
00:57:09,121 --> 00:57:10,550
(The 20-year-old Sang Won...)

1419
00:57:10,551 --> 00:57:11,620
Goodness.

1420
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:16,321
(was a bright medical student.)

1421
00:57:16,491 --> 00:57:17,860
Why are you so good-looking?

1422
00:57:17,861 --> 00:57:19,331
I was young then.

1423
00:57:21,261 --> 00:57:23,400
- Goodness. - He was a baby.

1424
00:57:23,401 --> 00:57:24,630
(The 20-year-old Ji Yung dreamed...)

1425
00:57:24,631 --> 00:57:25,830
(of becoming a professional rugby player.)

1426
00:57:25,831 --> 00:57:27,201
- Cute. - He's still big.

1427
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:29,770
- He looks different from now. - Right.

1428
00:57:29,771 --> 00:57:32,040
I thought he wouldn't look different, but he looks different.

1429
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:34,641
(You came through the same era.)

1430
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:37,650
(Now, )

1431
00:57:37,651 --> 00:57:39,510
(please reveal your age.)

1432
00:57:39,511 --> 00:57:40,621
Oh, dear.

1433
00:57:41,251 --> 00:57:42,351
Finally.

1434
00:57:42,551 --> 00:57:43,650
(Today, they will find out each other's age.)

1435
00:57:43,651 --> 00:57:45,151
It's better to get it over with.

1436
00:57:45,391 --> 00:57:46,891
I'm so curious.

1437
00:57:47,491 --> 00:57:48,591
Gosh.

1438
00:57:48,691 --> 00:57:50,631
- The time has come. - The time has come.

1439
00:57:51,561 --> 00:57:52,990
It's about time.

1440
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:54,960
(They put it behind for a while, but it's time to face it.)

1441
00:57:54,961 --> 00:57:56,731
When their ages are revealed,

1442
00:57:57,131 --> 00:57:59,770
who do you think will be more shaken?

1443
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:01,471
Men or women?

1444
00:58:01,901 --> 00:58:05,670
I think it will be the ladies.

1445
00:58:05,671 --> 00:58:08,681
They hinted it when they first appeared.

1446
00:58:09,141 --> 00:58:10,511
"I've been too invested in work."

1447
00:58:10,911 --> 00:58:12,680
"I don't know if I can fall in love again."

1448
00:58:12,681 --> 00:58:15,280
I think once the reality hits,

1449
00:58:15,281 --> 00:58:17,221
that feeling might resurface.

1450
00:58:17,391 --> 00:58:20,760
- Yes. - The ladies will be shaken.

1451
00:58:20,761 --> 00:58:22,661
But I want them to overcome it.

1452
00:58:23,161 --> 00:58:24,291
I'm so curious.

1453
00:58:26,731 --> 00:58:28,530
Finally, it's time.

1454
00:58:28,531 --> 00:58:30,201
I was very nervous.

1455
00:58:30,901 --> 00:58:33,101
What if I am too old?

1456
00:58:33,341 --> 00:58:34,700
To be completely frank,

1457
00:58:34,701 --> 00:58:36,741
what if they don't see me as a woman anymore?

1458
00:58:37,311 --> 00:58:39,811
"He's that young?"

1459
00:58:39,871 --> 00:58:41,940
"He's younger than I thought." She might not find me attractive.

1460
00:58:41,941 --> 00:58:42,941
Both parties are worried.

1461
00:58:42,942 --> 00:58:45,311
When she hears of my age,

1462
00:58:45,881 --> 00:58:48,781
what will she think? I was worried about that.

1463
00:58:49,581 --> 00:58:52,691
I worried, "What if our age difference is too big?"

1464
00:58:53,361 --> 00:58:56,520
- Also, I have to be realistic. - Right.

1465
00:58:56,521 --> 00:58:58,591
That worried me too.

1466
00:58:58,631 --> 00:59:01,530
I got nervous, unconsciously.

1467
00:59:01,531 --> 00:59:03,571
("Age" is the reality that will make them nervous.)

1468
00:59:03,601 --> 00:59:05,770
(It's time to face reality.)

1469
00:59:05,771 --> 00:59:07,441
The time has come.

1470
00:59:09,541 --> 00:59:10,571
It's today.

1471
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:14,381
Goodness.

1472
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:16,811
Everyone became quiet.

1473
00:59:19,811 --> 00:59:23,080
(Please reveal your age.)

1474
00:59:23,081 --> 00:59:24,121
Should we point?

1475
00:59:24,421 --> 00:59:26,020
Why don't we vote at the same time?

1476
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:28,021
The person who gets the most votes will go first?

1477
00:59:28,061 --> 00:59:29,391
- Sounds good. - Okay.

1478
00:59:31,261 --> 00:59:32,461
Who should I point?

1479
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:35,500
Isn't it like a popularity vote?

1480
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:36,770
(Whose age are they most curious to find out?)

1481
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:39,171
- It means they are interested. - They are most interested.

1482
00:59:40,371 --> 00:59:41,940
Should we point to that person...

1483
00:59:41,941 --> 00:59:43,041
on the count of three?

1484
00:59:43,771 --> 00:59:45,670
- In 3, 2, 1. - In 3, 2, 1.

1485
00:59:45,671 --> 00:59:49,081
(Who will be the first person to reveal the age?)

1486
00:59:49,541 --> 00:59:52,110
(Their eyes meet in the center.)

1487
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:53,211
Who is it?

1488
00:59:53,481 --> 00:59:55,451
- It's Mu Jin. - It's Mu Jin.

1489
00:59:56,921 --> 00:59:57,921
Mu Jin.

1490
00:59:57,922 --> 01:00:00,521
(Mu Jin is the first person to reveal his age.)

1491
01:00:04,191 --> 01:00:05,291
I'm nervous for him.

1492
01:00:08,661 --> 01:00:09,661
I am...

1493
01:00:12,931 --> 01:00:15,201
I was more worried about what Bon Hee...

1494
01:00:15,401 --> 01:00:18,671
would think once my age...

1495
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:21,541
is revealed.

1496
01:00:23,111 --> 01:00:25,910
Realistically, it would be nice if I'm 4 or 5 years older.

1497
01:00:25,911 --> 01:00:27,921
But I think he might be even younger than that.

1498
01:00:28,421 --> 01:00:31,691
I just hoped that he would be a little older.

1499
01:00:37,261 --> 01:00:38,261
I was...

1500
01:00:40,601 --> 01:00:41,931
born in 19...

1501
01:00:44,471 --> 01:00:46,301
I hope he's over 30.

1502
01:00:47,801 --> 01:00:49,041
I was born...

1503
01:00:50,311 --> 01:00:51,711
in 1999.

1504
01:00:53,271 --> 01:00:54,941
- No way. - No.

1505
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:56,441
He's too young.

1506
01:00:56,511 --> 01:00:59,280
- Oh, dear. He's too young. - How much older is he...

1507
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:00,480
- compared to you, SOOBIN? - He's a year older.

1508
01:01:00,481 --> 01:01:01,720
He's just a year older than me.

1509
01:01:01,721 --> 01:01:03,081
Is he?

1510
01:01:04,621 --> 01:01:06,220
(Born in 1999)

1511
01:01:06,221 --> 01:01:07,660
(Shocked)

1512
01:01:07,661 --> 01:01:08,820
No way.

1513
01:01:08,821 --> 01:01:10,191
(Shocked)

1514
01:01:11,261 --> 01:01:12,460
I am 27 years old.

1515
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:14,201
(No way.)

1516
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:16,000
- He's young. - I am Kim Mu Jin.

1517
01:01:16,001 --> 01:01:18,070
(Kim Mu Jin, born in 1999, 27 years old)

1518
01:01:18,071 --> 01:01:19,231
What's up with the reactions?

1519
01:01:20,071 --> 01:01:23,040
(Mu Jin's age made them dizzy.)

1520
01:01:23,041 --> 01:01:24,447
- Bon Hee is dizzy. - She's surprised.

1521
01:01:24,471 --> 01:01:25,971
- Oh, dear. - She's surprised.

1522
01:01:27,181 --> 01:01:28,781
He was younger than I imagined.

1523
01:01:30,281 --> 01:01:33,211
I thought, "He is younger than I thought."

1524
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:36,520
(Mu Jin is much younger than she imagined.)

1525
01:01:36,521 --> 01:01:39,920
(What is Mu Jin and Bon Hee's age difference?)

1526
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:43,390
We all know how strong their relationship is.

1527
01:01:43,391 --> 01:01:45,330
Will the age shake them up?

1528
01:01:45,331 --> 01:01:46,491
- It won't. - Will it really?

1529
01:01:46,931 --> 01:01:49,231
It's fine if the age difference is one digit.

1530
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:51,871
But if it's over two digits...

1531
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:53,130
(If the age difference is two digits...)

1532
01:01:53,131 --> 01:01:54,501
If it's 12...

1533
01:01:54,701 --> 01:01:56,640
No, it won't go that far.

1534
01:01:56,641 --> 01:01:58,171
- You think so? - Yes.

1535
01:01:58,711 --> 01:01:59,740
Perhaps ten years?

1536
01:01:59,741 --> 01:02:02,440
- I don't think it will be big. - You think so too, right?

1537
01:02:02,441 --> 01:02:04,250
I think she would be six years older at the most?

1538
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:05,481
I think so too.

1539
01:02:05,881 --> 01:02:08,651
(It makes us become more curious about Bon Hee's age.)

1540
01:02:09,621 --> 01:02:12,350
(Mu Jin will choose the next person.)

1541
01:02:12,351 --> 01:02:13,761
I choose Ji Yung.

1542
01:02:14,191 --> 01:02:15,391
- Me? - Yes.

1543
01:02:16,021 --> 01:02:18,791
(Ji Yung's age will be revealed.)

1544
01:02:19,491 --> 01:02:21,930
- Ji Yung must be young too. - Ji Yung seems young too.

1545
01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:24,930
(Ji Yung is full of confidence. How old would he be?)

1546
01:02:24,931 --> 01:02:25,931
I was born...

1547
01:02:30,171 --> 01:02:32,771
in 2000.

1548
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:35,381
- What? - What?

1549
01:02:35,941 --> 01:02:38,080
- What is going on? - No way.

1550
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:39,210
(Ji Yung is 26 years old.)

1551
01:02:39,211 --> 01:02:40,381
Really?

1552
01:02:41,921 --> 01:02:43,357
- This is crazy. - The same age as SOOBIN.

1553
01:02:43,381 --> 01:02:44,451
I know.

1554
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:46,650
You two are the same age.

1555
01:02:46,651 --> 01:02:48,391
(Hello, friend.)

1556
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:50,561
I am Yang Ji Yung, and I am 26 years old.

1557
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:51,990
I am sorry, Mu Jin.

1558
01:02:51,991 --> 01:02:53,230
He apologized to Mu Jin.

1559
01:02:53,231 --> 01:02:55,301
(Ji Yung's age shocked everyone.)

1560
01:02:55,531 --> 01:02:56,730
- Really? - I am sorry.

1561
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:57,870
(Mu Jin is 27 years old, and Ji Yung is 26 years old.)

1562
01:02:57,871 --> 01:02:59,131
- Really? - He's 26 years old?

1563
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:01,100
That's a plot twist.

1564
01:03:01,101 --> 01:03:03,470
- He was born in 2000? - He was born in 2000?

1565
01:03:03,471 --> 01:03:04,871
He's 26 years old?

1566
01:03:04,971 --> 01:03:06,771
He's 26 years old.

1567
01:03:07,841 --> 01:03:10,140
Ji Yung was full of confidence,

1568
01:03:10,141 --> 01:03:11,481
and he was witty.

1569
01:03:11,551 --> 01:03:14,720
I thought he developed that personality...

1570
01:03:14,721 --> 01:03:16,581
through life experience.

1571
01:03:16,851 --> 01:03:20,421
But he was much younger than I imagined. I was surprised.

1572
01:03:22,491 --> 01:03:25,460
I expected him to be the youngest.

1573
01:03:25,461 --> 01:03:27,130
- Right. - It's easy to believe.

1574
01:03:27,131 --> 01:03:28,131
(To someone's eyes, Ji Yung looked like the youngest.)

1575
01:03:28,132 --> 01:03:30,030
- There were times... - He looked like one.

1576
01:03:30,031 --> 01:03:31,430
- when he was like the youngest. - Right.

1577
01:03:31,431 --> 01:03:33,270
- He's very driven. - Right.

1578
01:03:33,271 --> 01:03:35,241
- Full of spirit. - He was full of spirit.

1579
01:03:36,441 --> 01:03:37,571
I'm flustered.

1580
01:03:39,011 --> 01:03:40,170
I choose Yeong Gyeong.

1581
01:03:40,171 --> 01:03:42,381
(Yeong Gyeong's age is revealed.)

1582
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:44,481
Me?

1583
01:03:44,611 --> 01:03:46,381
Don't look at me with such resentful eyes.

1584
01:03:47,551 --> 01:03:48,621
I am not.

1585
01:03:48,781 --> 01:03:51,591
I had to tell you one day.

1586
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:54,361
I am...

1587
01:03:55,091 --> 01:03:58,591
(She's the first older woman to reveal her age.)

1588
01:04:00,561 --> 01:04:05,170
I was born in 1989. I am 37 years old.

1589
01:04:05,171 --> 01:04:06,501
Really?

1590
01:04:06,771 --> 01:04:09,701
- No way. - She looks so young.

1591
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:12,440
(He immediately speaks formally.)

1592
01:04:12,441 --> 01:04:13,570
- Why did he change? - "She looks so young."

1593
01:04:13,571 --> 01:04:14,841
You have to be respectful.

1594
01:04:15,281 --> 01:04:17,550
(She looks so young.)

1595
01:04:17,551 --> 01:04:19,850
She looks super young.

1596
01:04:19,851 --> 01:04:21,080
(Goodness.)

1597
01:04:21,081 --> 01:04:22,250
I'm really surprised.

1598
01:04:22,251 --> 01:04:24,051
I should study about skin again.

1599
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:26,690
You should. You haven't done enough of it.

1600
01:04:26,691 --> 01:04:27,691
(Embarrassed)

1601
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:29,621
How old is Hyeon Jun?

1602
01:04:30,221 --> 01:04:32,191
To build the career she has now,

1603
01:04:32,431 --> 01:04:35,761
she must have lived through the time required.

1604
01:04:36,361 --> 01:04:39,231
I expected her to be around that age.

1605
01:04:41,971 --> 01:04:45,870
I worried that our age difference might be too big.

1606
01:04:45,871 --> 01:04:48,111
I had that worry.

1607
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:52,280
Hyeon Jun must be young too.

1608
01:04:52,281 --> 01:04:54,821
(Yeong Gyeong is conscious of their age difference.)

1609
01:04:55,351 --> 01:04:58,621
(Hyeon Jun's age is revealed.)

1610
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:00,051
I...

1611
01:05:01,091 --> 01:05:02,991
You might be surprised to hear this.

1612
01:05:06,131 --> 01:05:09,031
I have a beard, and I am tall.

1613
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:11,171
So I might look older than I am.

1614
01:05:12,631 --> 01:05:14,001
(Gasping)

1615
01:05:14,441 --> 01:05:16,601
Don't tell me he was born in 2002.

1616
01:05:17,141 --> 01:05:18,511
Is he 25 years old?

1617
01:05:18,971 --> 01:05:20,041
Is he 26 years old?

1618
01:05:20,841 --> 01:05:23,410
- Don't lie. - Don't lie.

1619
01:05:23,411 --> 01:05:24,980
Maybe the boys will be more shocked.

1620
01:05:24,981 --> 01:05:26,657
(They make wild guesses about Hyeon Jun's age.)

1621
01:05:26,681 --> 01:05:30,391
I was born in 1996. I am 30 years old.

1622
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:36,620
(Hyeon Jun and Yeong Gyeong are 7 years apart.)

1623
01:05:36,621 --> 01:05:40,191
I think the age difference is neither big nor small.

1624
01:05:40,801 --> 01:05:42,601
I was relieved.

1625
01:05:48,441 --> 01:05:51,241
(It's Sang Won's turn.)

1626
01:05:51,571 --> 01:05:52,571
(Nervous)

1627
01:05:52,572 --> 01:05:53,711
Our dearie, Sang Won.

1628
01:05:54,141 --> 01:05:57,881
(Finally, they will find out Sang Won's age.)

1629
01:06:01,181 --> 01:06:02,181
I was born...

1630
01:06:04,951 --> 01:06:06,821
(Hesitating)

1631
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:12,491
He graduated from the medical school and became a doctor.

1632
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:16,331
So he might be in his early 30s.

1633
01:06:17,371 --> 01:06:20,401
(Is Sang Won in his early 30s, like Ye Eun predicted?)

1634
01:06:21,771 --> 01:06:25,271
What if he's much younger than the age I expected?

1635
01:06:26,671 --> 01:06:30,041
(Attention is focused on him.)

1636
01:06:30,851 --> 01:06:31,851
I...

1637
01:06:33,851 --> 01:06:35,121
was born...

1638
01:06:37,621 --> 01:06:38,851
in 1999.

1639
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:40,660
I am 27 years old.

1640
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:41,661
(Park Sang Won, born in 1999, 27 years old)

1641
01:06:41,662 --> 01:06:44,430
(He's in his 20s?)

1642
01:06:44,431 --> 01:06:46,891
(Is this right?)

1643
01:06:47,261 --> 01:06:48,401
No way.

1644
01:06:52,131 --> 01:06:53,330
What will they do?

1645
01:06:53,331 --> 01:06:54,400
(She's worried.)

1646
01:06:54,401 --> 01:06:56,071
He's a lot younger than I thought.

1647
01:06:56,241 --> 01:06:58,471
The two ladies must be very shocked.

1648
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:01,940
I was born in 1999.

1649
01:07:01,941 --> 01:07:04,681
(Park Sang Won, born in 1999, 27 years old)

1650
01:07:04,881 --> 01:07:07,011
(Gasping)

1651
01:07:08,521 --> 01:07:09,681
I am 27 years old.

1652
01:07:10,081 --> 01:07:11,450
(Shocked)

1653
01:07:11,451 --> 01:07:12,790
Look at the ladies' faces.

1654
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:14,891
(Goodness)

1655
01:07:14,991 --> 01:07:16,121
This is so fun.

1656
01:07:17,431 --> 01:07:20,461
I'm surprised. I thought he would be older.

1657
01:07:21,031 --> 01:07:22,861
I look old. I am sorry.

1658
01:07:24,271 --> 01:07:26,200
(My goodness)

1659
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:27,900
(Goodness)

1660
01:07:27,901 --> 01:07:30,341
He's younger than I thought.

1661
01:07:30,811 --> 01:07:32,541
She's flustered.

1662
01:07:33,141 --> 01:07:35,181
I was surprised.

1663
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:37,881
He was younger than I imagined.

1664
01:07:39,081 --> 01:07:41,780
- He's so young. - The doctor is in his 20s.

1665
01:07:41,781 --> 01:07:43,461
(Sang Won was younger than they expected.)

1666
01:07:43,921 --> 01:07:46,491
(Who's next?)

1667
01:07:46,651 --> 01:07:48,091
(Well...)

1668
01:07:48,491 --> 01:07:50,461
(Looking away)

1669
01:07:50,591 --> 01:07:52,131
(Looking)

1670
01:07:52,561 --> 01:07:53,591
Ye Eun?

1671
01:07:54,531 --> 01:07:58,371
(Sang Won chose Ye Eun.)

1672
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:02,940
Ye Eun was the one who expressed interest in me,

1673
01:08:02,941 --> 01:08:04,071
so I wanted to know her age.

1674
01:08:05,471 --> 01:08:08,040
(Ye Eun's age is revealed.)

1675
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:09,081
I...

1676
01:08:10,241 --> 01:08:11,481
This is nerve-racking.

1677
01:08:14,181 --> 01:08:15,650
Oh, dear.

1678
01:08:15,651 --> 01:08:16,651
(Hesitating)

1679
01:08:16,652 --> 01:08:17,721
I was...

1680
01:08:19,591 --> 01:08:20,721
born in...

1681
01:08:30,831 --> 01:08:32,971
1989.

1682
01:08:33,331 --> 01:08:35,400
I am 37 years old.

1683
01:08:35,401 --> 01:08:37,071
(Park Ye Eun, born in 1989, 37 years old)

1684
01:08:37,811 --> 01:08:39,310
(Ye Eun and Sang Won are 10 years apart.)

1685
01:08:39,311 --> 01:08:41,410
- Then, they're ten years apart. - Yes.

1686
01:08:41,411 --> 01:08:44,180
I thought you'd be much younger than me.

1687
01:08:44,181 --> 01:08:46,080
- Let's be friends. - It's nice to meet you, friend.

1688
01:08:46,081 --> 01:08:47,981
(Roommates and friends who are the same age)

1689
01:08:48,421 --> 01:08:51,190
- That's amazing. Seriously. - Gosh, really...

1690
01:08:51,191 --> 01:08:53,691
Goodness, I really can't predict anyone's ages.

1691
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:55,020
Gosh, hang on.

1692
01:08:55,021 --> 01:08:56,561
(Shutting his eyes tight)

1693
01:08:56,621 --> 01:08:59,461
(Ye Eun's age surprised everyone.)

1694
01:09:00,361 --> 01:09:03,801
(Now, it's Ye Eun's turn to choose someone.)

1695
01:09:05,201 --> 01:09:06,531
I choose...

1696
01:09:08,401 --> 01:09:09,471
Ji Won.

1697
01:09:10,571 --> 01:09:11,641
- Ji Won. - Ji Won.

1698
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:12,911
Me?

1699
01:09:13,711 --> 01:09:14,711
I...

1700
01:09:14,712 --> 01:09:15,840
(How old is Ji Won?)

1701
01:09:15,841 --> 01:09:16,841
I...

1702
01:09:16,842 --> 01:09:19,051
(How old is Ji Won?)

1703
01:09:23,851 --> 01:09:24,851
I...

1704
01:09:26,021 --> 01:09:28,561
was born in 1990...

1705
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:31,461
She was born in the 1990s.

1706
01:09:32,161 --> 01:09:33,930
- He looks happy. - He's happy right now.

1707
01:09:33,931 --> 01:09:36,331
- Sang Won looks happy. - His facial expression seems happy.

1708
01:09:37,101 --> 01:09:41,801
Born in 1990.

1709
01:09:41,901 --> 01:09:43,940
I'm 36-year-old Park Ji Won.

1710
01:09:43,941 --> 01:09:46,341
(Park Ji Won, born in 1990, 36 years old)

1711
01:09:46,571 --> 01:09:48,410
I'm 36-year-old Park Ji Won.

1712
01:09:48,411 --> 01:09:50,411
They're still nine years apart.

1713
01:09:51,111 --> 01:09:53,981
(Ye Eun is a year older than Ji Won.)

1714
01:09:54,681 --> 01:09:56,180
You might be the youngest woman here.

1715
01:09:56,181 --> 01:09:58,820
- Am I the youngest? - So far, you're the youngest.

1716
01:09:58,821 --> 01:10:00,351
(Is Ji Won the youngest of the women?)

1717
01:10:00,991 --> 01:10:03,191
Honestly, I expected that they might be...

1718
01:10:03,661 --> 01:10:05,430
a few years older than me, but I was still a bit shocked.

1719
01:10:05,431 --> 01:10:08,731
I thought, "Really? I was really mistaken."

1720
01:10:09,961 --> 01:10:14,101
I don't think a year's difference is that important.

1721
01:10:14,971 --> 01:10:18,711
(After learning each other's ages, will these three feel the same way?)

1722
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:21,010
(This time, it's Bon Hee's turn.)

1723
01:10:21,011 --> 01:10:22,731
- Gosh, I feel... - Oh, gosh. It's Bon Hee.

1724
01:10:24,781 --> 01:10:26,581
(Glancing around)

1725
01:10:27,211 --> 01:10:28,881
(Glancing back)

1726
01:10:35,091 --> 01:10:36,121
I am...

1727
01:10:39,361 --> 01:10:41,230
(Buddy Buddy)

1728
01:10:41,231 --> 01:10:43,100
(Cyworld?)

1729
01:10:43,101 --> 01:10:46,330
(Mu Jin expected that their age gap would be pretty big.)

1730
01:10:46,331 --> 01:10:48,701
When I actually hear about her age,

1731
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:51,011
how I might feel was a bit...

1732
01:10:52,941 --> 01:10:54,511
of a concern for me.

1733
01:10:55,441 --> 01:10:57,240
- You don't like me saying "noona?" - Oh, no.

1734
01:10:57,241 --> 01:10:58,641
(You don't like me saying "noona?")

1735
01:10:59,381 --> 01:11:02,381
(I like being called by my name the most.)

1736
01:11:03,281 --> 01:11:04,690
(Then, I'll call you Bon Hee.)

1737
01:11:04,691 --> 01:11:06,451
(Okay.)

1738
01:11:07,561 --> 01:11:09,320
No, she doesn't look that old.

1739
01:11:09,321 --> 01:11:13,591
For the first time, Mu Jin called me "noona."

1740
01:11:13,691 --> 01:11:15,231
At the time, I felt...

1741
01:11:17,031 --> 01:11:19,431
It felt real for the first time.

1742
01:11:20,031 --> 01:11:22,641
"Will we really be okay when we learn each other's age?"

1743
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:25,771
I still think that way.

1744
01:11:28,081 --> 01:11:29,110
How old is she?

1745
01:11:29,111 --> 01:11:30,140
(She had forgotten about their age gap for a little while.)

1746
01:11:30,141 --> 01:11:31,650
- I keep holding my breath. - I really don't know.

1747
01:11:31,651 --> 01:11:32,651
What do we do?

1748
01:11:35,721 --> 01:11:36,721
I...

1749
01:11:37,521 --> 01:11:39,051
(Hesitating)

1750
01:11:39,821 --> 01:11:41,261
Was born in 19...

1751
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:47,730
In 1987. I am 39 years old.

1752
01:11:47,731 --> 01:11:49,100
(Gu Bon Hee, born in 1987, 39 years old)

1753
01:11:49,101 --> 01:11:50,700
I am 39 years old.

1754
01:11:50,701 --> 01:11:52,630
(Nodding)

1755
01:11:52,631 --> 01:11:54,540
- Wait a minute! - They're 12 years apart.

1756
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:55,541
- They're 12 years apart. - They're 12 years apart.
- They really are. - They're 12 years apart.

1757
01:11:56,542 --> 01:11:58,270
Oh, no!

1758
01:11:58,271 --> 01:12:00,610
- This couple is 12 years apart? - These guys are 12 years apart?

1759
01:12:00,611 --> 01:12:01,940
I thought they might be.

1760
01:12:01,941 --> 01:12:04,010
Gosh, they're 12 years apart. What do we do?

1761
01:12:04,011 --> 01:12:05,780
Then, even compared to her own younger brother,

1762
01:12:05,781 --> 01:12:07,697
- He's a year younger. - he's still a year younger.

1763
01:12:07,721 --> 01:12:10,821
- What do we do about this? - I mean... What do we do?

1764
01:12:11,321 --> 01:12:13,150
This will have quite an effect.

1765
01:12:13,151 --> 01:12:14,360
It's understandable that Bon Hee is shocked.

1766
01:12:14,361 --> 01:12:15,361
Of course.

1767
01:12:15,362 --> 01:12:16,642
Earlier, Bon Hee went like this.

1768
01:12:16,961 --> 01:12:18,090
(Bon Hee was physically taken aback.)

1769
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:19,091
Seriously...

1770
01:12:19,861 --> 01:12:20,861
That's what she did.

1771
01:12:21,431 --> 01:12:22,711
Right, she must've been shocked.

1772
01:12:23,061 --> 01:12:24,771
Oh, no.

1773
01:12:26,231 --> 01:12:29,170
I was born in 1987. I am 39 years old.

1774
01:12:29,171 --> 01:12:30,577
(Gu Bon Hee, born in 1987, 39 years old)

1775
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:32,140
I am 39 years old.

1776
01:12:32,141 --> 01:12:34,041
(Nodding)

1777
01:12:37,281 --> 01:12:40,110
- Gosh, that makes no sense. - She looks so young.

1778
01:12:40,111 --> 01:12:41,471
How does she have such great skin?

1779
01:12:41,751 --> 01:12:43,351
What? Why does everyone look so young?

1780
01:12:44,121 --> 01:12:45,791
Ji Won, were you really surprised?

1781
01:12:46,421 --> 01:12:48,591
(Nodding)

1782
01:12:49,121 --> 01:12:52,991
(And Mu Jin just quietly nods.)

1783
01:12:53,561 --> 01:12:55,501
Honestly, I had expected it to a certain degree.

1784
01:12:56,431 --> 01:13:00,030
I had thought that we might be...

1785
01:13:00,031 --> 01:13:01,177
about ten years apart, but...

1786
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:02,201
What do we do?

1787
01:13:02,301 --> 01:13:03,770
(Born in 1999)

1788
01:13:03,771 --> 01:13:05,171
(and in 1987)

1789
01:13:05,471 --> 01:13:09,011
(They have a 12-year age gap.)

1790
01:13:09,441 --> 01:13:10,511
Twelve years apart...

1791
01:13:11,811 --> 01:13:16,421
I think I'd be lying if I said I wasn't concerned.

1792
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:20,651
Honestly, I was a little surprised. I was surprised,

1793
01:13:21,261 --> 01:13:23,161
but Bon Hee must've been quite shocked too.

1794
01:13:26,031 --> 01:13:29,630
My gut feeling told me there might be those who are 12 years younger,

1795
01:13:29,631 --> 01:13:31,230
but I didn't think that it would be Mu Jin.

1796
01:13:31,231 --> 01:13:32,300
This is seriously...

1797
01:13:32,301 --> 01:13:35,901
When I think about if we were to date,

1798
01:13:36,301 --> 01:13:39,371
it makes me worry because I've never done this before.

1799
01:13:41,141 --> 01:13:46,081
(They didn't expect their 12-year age gap.)

1800
01:13:47,581 --> 01:13:49,320
Oh, no.

1801
01:13:49,321 --> 01:13:50,520
(After learning about each other's age)

1802
01:13:50,521 --> 01:13:51,821
This is so confusing.

1803
01:13:52,421 --> 01:13:53,550
I feel so confused.

1804
01:13:53,551 --> 01:13:54,951
(Will they have a change of heart?)

1805
01:13:55,361 --> 01:13:56,821
What will happen now?

1806
01:13:57,591 --> 01:13:59,831
I don't think Mu Jin will be able to hold them together.

1807
01:13:59,931 --> 01:14:01,260
- It won't be easy. - I think he will.

1808
01:14:01,261 --> 01:14:02,977
- Mu Jin? - Mu Jin might hold them together.

1809
01:14:03,001 --> 01:14:05,070
I think Bon Hee might back off a lot.

1810
01:14:05,071 --> 01:14:07,531
- Totally. - I think Mu Jin will hold onto her.

1811
01:14:10,241 --> 01:14:11,241
Sang Hyeon?

1812
01:14:11,242 --> 01:14:14,041
(Revealing Sang Hyeon's age)

1813
01:14:15,311 --> 01:14:16,780
- I think he'll be young. - He will be young.

1814
01:14:16,781 --> 01:14:18,281
This is total chaos, literally.

1815
01:14:18,651 --> 01:14:22,820
Oh, I'm older than I thought.

1816
01:14:22,821 --> 01:14:24,851
Oh, he's in his 30s.

1817
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:29,361
(I've usually dated women who are younger or the same age as me.)

1818
01:14:30,621 --> 01:14:34,701
(I feel like I'm taking on a challenge.)

1819
01:14:35,201 --> 01:14:39,131
(Do you find me too cute?)

1820
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:41,200
(Do I seem like a kid to you?)

1821
01:14:41,201 --> 01:14:42,700
(Yes, you're kind of adorable.)

1822
01:14:42,701 --> 01:14:44,441
(That is true.)

1823
01:14:45,211 --> 01:14:50,911
(Sang Hyeon didn't want to seem just like a younger man.)

1824
01:14:51,011 --> 01:14:52,480
(Also, I thought about this too.)

1825
01:14:52,481 --> 01:14:55,150
(After hearing about our age...)

1826
01:14:55,151 --> 01:14:56,620
(Mu Jin, if you are...)

1827
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:58,650
(a lot younger than me, )

1828
01:14:58,651 --> 01:15:01,051
(that means you have a bigger age gap with Bon Hee than me.)

1829
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:03,290
(Could a rift develop between Bon Hee and Mu Jin?)

1830
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,560
(I did have that thought.)

1831
01:15:04,561 --> 01:15:05,890
He's looking at it as a competitive edge.

1832
01:15:05,891 --> 01:15:08,561
I'm older than I thought.

1833
01:15:09,031 --> 01:15:10,101
Oh, really?

1834
01:15:10,501 --> 01:15:12,971
Don't you think he seems rather happy?

1835
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:17,041
(Will Sang Hyeon be older than Mu Jin?)

1836
01:15:17,911 --> 01:15:20,071
I was born in 19...

1837
01:15:24,481 --> 01:15:29,221
In 1997.

1838
01:15:30,121 --> 01:15:32,550
(Kim Sang Hyeon, born in 1997, 29 years old)

1839
01:15:32,551 --> 01:15:34,420
I am 29 years old.

1840
01:15:34,421 --> 01:15:37,220
(Sang Hyeon is 2 years older than Mu Jin, )

1841
01:15:37,221 --> 01:15:40,591
(and he's 10 years younger than Bon Hee.)

1842
01:15:44,601 --> 01:15:46,400
Hearing that he was born in 1997,

1843
01:15:46,401 --> 01:15:48,771
I thought, "That makes sense."

1844
01:15:49,201 --> 01:15:50,700
I wasn't too surprised.

1845
01:15:50,701 --> 01:15:53,871
(So Hyun had somewhat expected Sang Hyeon's age.)

1846
01:15:55,381 --> 01:15:56,440
So Hyun.

1847
01:15:56,441 --> 01:15:59,010
(Now, lastly, So Hyun's age is revealed.)

1848
01:15:59,011 --> 01:16:00,011
I...

1849
01:16:00,012 --> 01:16:02,221
(Now, lastly, So Hyun's age is revealed.)

1850
01:16:03,081 --> 01:16:08,221
(The younger men all focus on her.)

1851
01:16:09,961 --> 01:16:12,061
I was born in 19...

1852
01:16:13,961 --> 01:16:15,201
About 2 or 3 years?

1853
01:16:15,301 --> 01:16:17,771
Or maybe about 3 or 4 years older?

1854
01:16:20,001 --> 01:16:21,041
I...

1855
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:23,870
(How old is So Hyun?)

1856
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,971
I was born in 19...

1857
01:16:28,681 --> 01:16:31,350
I was born in 1990.

1858
01:16:31,351 --> 01:16:33,810
That makes me 36? Yes.

1859
01:16:33,811 --> 01:16:35,327
(Go So Hyun, born in 1990, 36 years old)

1860
01:16:35,351 --> 01:16:36,351
You two are friends.

1861
01:16:36,352 --> 01:16:39,421
(Along with Ji Won, they're the youngest among the women.)

1862
01:16:41,061 --> 01:16:42,590
- Oh, my! He's smiling. - After hearing her age...

1863
01:16:42,591 --> 01:16:44,560
What do you think that smile means?

1864
01:16:44,561 --> 01:16:45,830
(Ji Yung and So Hyun are 10 years apart.)

1865
01:16:45,831 --> 01:16:46,831
How cute.

1866
01:16:48,601 --> 01:16:52,571
(Meanwhile, Sang Hyeon, who is 7 years younger, looks frozen.)

1867
01:16:54,441 --> 01:16:57,341
I was curious how old So Hyun was,

1868
01:16:57,441 --> 01:17:00,771
but once I heard, I was actually quite worried.

1869
01:17:01,511 --> 01:17:04,080
I think that was why I couldn't hide my emotions.

1870
01:17:04,081 --> 01:17:07,380
Oh, a seven-year age gap must seem like a burden.

1871
01:17:07,381 --> 01:17:09,820
I guess so. She might be older than he thought.

1872
01:17:09,821 --> 01:17:11,950
He thought they'd be only 2 or 3 years apart.

1873
01:17:11,951 --> 01:17:14,631
(Sang Hyeon seems to have a lot on his mind after hearing her age.)

1874
01:17:18,591 --> 01:17:21,431
(Sang Hyeon can't meet So Hyun's eyes.)

1875
01:17:23,031 --> 01:17:25,531
"After hearing about my age, he has a lot on his mind."

1876
01:17:26,501 --> 01:17:29,300
I wanted to look into his eyes and stuff,

1877
01:17:29,301 --> 01:17:33,111
but he wouldn't even smile when our eyes met and avoided me.

1878
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:35,880
"Am I too old for him?"

1879
01:17:35,881 --> 01:17:38,381
I had those guesses by myself.

1880
01:17:38,481 --> 01:17:39,911
Right, she could feel that way.

1881
01:17:40,451 --> 01:17:45,021
(So Hyun is curious about Sang Hyeon's thoughts.)

1882
01:17:46,751 --> 01:17:48,191
(Sighing)

1883
01:17:48,921 --> 01:17:51,231
Has anyone changed their minds?

1884
01:17:52,861 --> 01:17:54,331
Anyone? I'm curious.

1885
01:17:55,201 --> 01:17:56,841
She'd be curious about Sang Hyeon, right?

1886
01:18:01,671 --> 01:18:05,970
(What kind of effect will age...)

1887
01:18:05,971 --> 01:18:09,610
(have on their relationships?)

1888
01:18:09,611 --> 01:18:11,681
Bon Hee looks so concerned.

1889
01:18:12,211 --> 01:18:15,351
Whose heart has been shaken up?

1890
01:18:18,821 --> 01:18:21,860
(The mood seems subtly mysterious after the age reveal.)

1891
01:18:21,861 --> 01:18:24,931
"After hearing about my age, he has a lot on his mind."

1892
01:18:26,761 --> 01:18:28,901
(I think it did weigh heavily on my mind.)

1893
01:18:29,361 --> 01:18:31,531
(I've just faced reality.)

1894
01:18:31,931 --> 01:18:33,530
(As of now, I only have you...)

1895
01:18:33,531 --> 01:18:34,971
(here.)

1896
01:18:37,271 --> 01:18:38,910
(I was...)

1897
01:18:38,911 --> 01:18:40,710
(totally out of my mind earlier.)

1898
01:18:40,711 --> 01:18:42,041
(Because Sang Won is younger?)

1899
01:18:43,081 --> 01:18:45,881
(I thought my relationship with Ye Eun was over.)

1900
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:48,421
(Go to the person you're drawn to.)

1901
01:18:48,851 --> 01:18:50,691
(A night of confusion has come to Yeon House.)

1902
01:18:51,691 --> 01:18:53,921
(I'll get on my knees first and say this.)

1903
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:58,190
(I smiled in front of you and all that.)

1904
01:18:58,191 --> 01:19:00,191
(Would that all be fake?)

1905
01:19:01,701 --> 01:19:04,021
(While listening, So Hyun quietly goes into the bathroom.)

1906
01:19:04,931 --> 01:19:08,871
(I can't believe this.)

1907
01:19:09,501 --> 01:19:11,411
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin begin talking seriously.)

1908
01:19:13,441 --> 01:19:15,140
(It's such a huge age gap.)

1909
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:18,751
(If we're over 10 years apart...)

1910
01:19:19,611 --> 01:19:24,951
(Bon Hee's heart has started to waver after the age reveal.)

1911
01:19:25,651 --> 01:19:26,651
(Sighing)

1912
01:19:28,591 --> 01:19:30,391
(This is driving me crazy.)

1913
01:19:35,701 --> 01:19:38,471
(Today, So Hyun has a special date.)

1914
01:19:39,731 --> 01:19:42,070
(Which younger man is making So Hyun laugh?)

1915
01:19:42,071 --> 01:19:44,941
(Mu Jin)

1916
01:19:45,671 --> 01:19:47,270
(If I had moved in on the same day, )

1917
01:19:47,271 --> 01:19:49,141
(would things have been different for us?)

1918
01:19:51,711 --> 01:19:54,251
(I think that could've been true.)
