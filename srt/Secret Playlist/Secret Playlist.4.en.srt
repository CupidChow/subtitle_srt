What

5
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,769
Ask if you live in a few buildings

6
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,790
It's my house

-Do No. 3? Is it REVI?

14
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,310
you

15
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,500
Are you still chasing my house?

16
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,630
haven't seen you for a long time

17
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,760
I have seen you in the company for a long time, but I have seen you in the company a long time ago.

18
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,070
haven't seen you for a long time

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Song Hanzhu

20
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,950
how are you recently

21
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
that's it

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,929
Employment in school

23
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,930
as always

24
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,490
How do you know you and Revi

25
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,670
We are classmates

26
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,530
He is the guest of my internship program now

27
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,540
I met with a job just now

28
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,460
As you saw him, he drank too drunk

29
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,250
You have entered the TV station

30
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,960
How did you know him and him

31
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,730
He is our company artist

32
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,450
So

33
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,310
Um

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,870
I entered the TAKEON Entertainment Company A & R Group

35
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,980
Now are responsible for playlist

36
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,950
Are you scared

37
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,420
Because it was too surprised

38
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,260
Do you live here?

39
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,150
Um

40
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,700
I think we

41
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,440
I will definitely meet

42
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,140
Hello

43
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,810
You lunatic

44
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,660
What should I do in the future

45
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,860
-= Convey the transfer information
The end of the internship =-

46
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,119
-= Song Hanzhu =-

47
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Etube?

48
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,660
Um

49
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,670
Because Revi has debuted since childhood

50
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,550
Show the entire growth process

51
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,389
Revi, who grew up so good, starred in our playlist

52
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,540
A little momentum

53
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,910
The weight control in the form of short video within 20 seconds

54
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,809
But can I do this

55
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,950
It's just that the preview does not have any amazing quality

56
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
It should not be difficult

57
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,620
Hanzhu, don't you do well well

58
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,950
You are a good person who gives you well to you

59
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,460
come on

60
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,380
I plan to use a short video in this way

61
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,100
Display the growth process little by little

62
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,009
So you need previous photos and videos

63
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,259
Can you send it to me today

64
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,260
Wait a little bit

65
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,380
Should I apologize to her

66
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,760
But what to say

67
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,869
I only have recent photos

68
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,490
It seems that I still have to find a Taoist brother

69
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,280
elder brother

70
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,399
Do you have previous photos in your phone?

71
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,930
Yesterday's incident

72
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,250
Taoist brother

73
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
Yesterday's incident
Brother

74
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,830
I'm sorry yesterday, I'm sorry

75
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,570
that matter

76
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,160
Want to say here now

77
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,430
Ruined

78
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,860
knew

79
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,920
I thought you didn't remember that I wanted to turn it in this way

80
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,090
I accept your apology

81
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,029
Why don't you say that the timid coward is counsel

82
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,120
-= Golden Ghost
Coward
Counseling
Why not say oh =-

83
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,730
Suddenly what is the sleeping person, what is this?

84
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,710
Really

85
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,810
yes

86
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,140
I'm sorry for this

87
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:06,250
Thank you for accepting my apology

88
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,800
elder brother

89
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,530
But what's wrong with your lips?

90
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,010
See you rubbing and rubbing your lips from just now

91
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,650
that

92
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,780
Lips

93
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,800
So this lips

94
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,380
It should be cracking

95
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,800
That's why it is so troublesome, right?

96
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,260
Right

97
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,020
The lips are a bit cracking

98
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,560
But it doesn't mean what I did yesterday

99
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,209
A little painful lips are also likely to be like this

100
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,210
Lips

101
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,300
Please send the video to my mailbox

102
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,640
okay, I get it

103
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,500
no

104
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,680
How can I react so much when I was kissed?

105
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,910
Come to shoot

106
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,340
No
Come on a meeting

107
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,230
I'm leaving now

108
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Be careful on the road

109
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,750
The arranging direction is changed to jazz pop music

110
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,150
The center is placed on the bass guitar

111
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,729
The stage design is like what I said before

112
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,330
Create the feeling of simulation

113
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,510
that

114
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,650
Although it is a private problem

115
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,120
You are a friend of Hanzhu

116
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,380
right

117
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,450
How are you getting close to

118
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,880
Is it a community friend?

119
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,000
We are in the same high school

120
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Is your relationship very good

121
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
still

122
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,900
Just know it

123
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,290
It seems that you are curious about us

124
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,950
us

125
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:56,850
no

126
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,249
I usually see friends after going out of society

127
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,720
Will be very happy

128
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,770
Seeing you don't seem to be very happy

129
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,449
I just think you are not very related to your relationship

130
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,540
Just like what you just said

131
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,730
This is a private problem

132
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,710
How do you feel like working with Dao Kingdom

133
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,720
Follow the image to show the public

134
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,780
Very different

135
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,789
I am afraid that he has leaked the complaint in the company

136
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,200
It's all over all day long

137
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Reason

138
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,720
There is no strange place, right?

139
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
yes

140
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,240
So far

141
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
good

142
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,570
Although I also believe in the little boy of the country

143
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,640
But when you are so big, you will encounter a lot of temptations

144
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,720
I often think that Western I think is easy to be confused by others

145
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,550
in case

146
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
You stare at him

147
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,770
yes

148
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Li Mocun

149
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
It is you

150
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,260
I listen to my classmates and say you are back home

151
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,020
Do you live nearby

152
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,460
Um

153
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
And you

154
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,170
Me too

155
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,920
I am at the nearby Hongren University to go to school

156
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,570
It is the same school as Hanzhu

157
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Do you two live together?

158
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,690
almost

159
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,740
She lives in our house

160
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,770
Do you want to tell Hanzhu?

161
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,560
Said you back to China

162
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,140
Need not

163
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,670
I've seen it before

164
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,990
It turns out that you have met

165
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,010
so fast

166
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,530
I am leaving

167
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,620
see you later

168
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,690
Uh, I'm glad to see you

169
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,510
Damn Song Hanzhu

170
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,360
-= Toys microphone by. PLII =-

171
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,670
How do you know you and Revi

172
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,250
We are classmates

173
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,730
He is the guest of my internship program now

174
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,629
I am going to cooperate with a super artist now

175
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,420
Wait for me for a while

176
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,660
Come to shoot

177
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,900
No
Meeting

178
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,560
Look at the spirit of Song Hanzhu

179
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,809
How long have you resigned

180
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,810
Just come to find now

181
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,370
That is to say, in order to adapt to work dizzy

182
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
but

183
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,240
I haven't seen this

184
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,840
I haven't taken it out except when I first started finishing

185
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,970
That Li Daoguo ...

186
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
What

187
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,490
Nothing at all

188
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,140
Shengxi

189
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:43,700
Um

190
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,070
I have something to ask you

191
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
What's up

192
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,809
My friend consults me troubles

193
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,920
But I don't know how to give her suggestions

194
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,440
What do you do when you have a friend other than me

195
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,240
Corporate friend

196
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,730
It's the new friend of the interns next door

197
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,230
But if she is so troubled by me so soon

198
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,990
What's the matter, she is distressed

199
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
she

200
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,890
Not long ago

201
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,790
-The was confessed by humans -wait for a while

202
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,440
Confession is confession, not

203
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,040
What is similar to confession

204
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,190
ah

205
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,470
that is

206
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,440
Isn't the other party talking directly with her?

207
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,870
Just listen to a word

208
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,850
What

209
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,080
He said longing for her

210
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,369
What kind of fart is this?

211
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,520
How can this be a confession?

212
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,890
I like you

213
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,740
This is the confession

214
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,980
but

215
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,010
That's why it is better

216
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
What

217
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,720
Like this sentence

218
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,280
Like wine and songs

219
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,390
What can be said at any time

220
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,700
But look forward to this sentence

221
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,630
Only when I really think that person is handsome can I say

222
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,050
my friend

223
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,030
That's

224
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,140
Is your friend the same heart as that person?

225
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,410
Boss, what are you doing there

226
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,990
I'm sorting out the warehouse

227
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,860
but

228
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,290
Not doing now

229
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,710
Have to get lung disease

230
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,710
so

231
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,480
The most important sign of interpersonal relationships

232
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,930
Your mind

233
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,229
Is it the same as my heart

234
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,230
Right

235
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,470
Your friend

236
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,270
Is it the same heart as that person?

237
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,020
Why can't I jump?

238
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,170
Do you want to use this?

239
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,710
Um

240
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,859
This is the best one you sent to me

241
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,860
Did you send me to me just let me use it?

242
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,120
That's because you let me send it all first

243
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,050
In short, this is definitely not good

244
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,520
Why

245
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,010
If this video is broadcast, what is my image?

246
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,930
Don't you know that my nickname is the best in the world

247
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,689
That is to deceive all citizens

248
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,980
That's what you really look like

249
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,810
I can't any matter

250
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,910
That's my notebook

251
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
This is my video

252
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,589
Don't be so naive

253
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,639
Give me back when I talk well

254
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,300
Then you promise me not to use this

255
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,330
Give me
Don't

256
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,500
-State me -don't

257
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,980
Give me

258
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,700
Give me me

259
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,820
-State me -don't

260
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,290
With him

261
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,670
I feel that my spiritual age has become ten years old

262
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,170
How can it ...

263
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,070
Catch people ..

264
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,570
Neck

265
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,110
Not a handle

266
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,989
In short, I will use this

267
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,160
If you are really unwilling, go and sue me.

268
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,020
but

269
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,600
Can I ask you a question

270
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,849
No matter how you ask

271
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,769
I will use this video

272
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,630
What does you have to do with newcomers

273
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Why do you ask about this

274
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,800
no

275
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,230
I heard that you have been friends from high school

276
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,300
I think you are very good

277
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,410
Ask everything

278
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,100
Why are you curious about this

279
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,600
What's wrong, why do you have a relationship, why can't you answer?

280
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,010
Can't answer

281
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,250
I don’t want to answer, I have no reason to answer you

282
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,400
What is your relationship

283
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,970
Is it closer than me?

284
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,020
Is it still very close?

285
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:16,129
It's not why elementary school students always ask this

286
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,990
You just answer me honestly

287
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,100
Why do you have a relationship

288
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,610
Is it closer than me
How close is there

289
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,110
What is your relationship

290
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,480
He is my first love

291
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,200
He is my first love

292
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,200
Have a first love

293
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,659
It's high school

294
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,970
Is it a very handsome boy or playing the band

295
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,050
haven't seen you for a long time

296
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,670
Song Hanzhu

297
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,090
He is my first love

298
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,330
He is my first love

299
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,450
It is first love or first love ...

300
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,050
He is my first love

301
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,329
Fly to the sky FLY to the Sky

302
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:21,089
Fly to the sky

303
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,589
Non -stop

304
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:28,330
Let others keep up with me

305
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,420
Li Daoguo's selection and arrangement are very good

306
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,270
Just continue like this

307
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,439
The old man worked hard

308
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,740
It's your first task to prepare very hard, right?

309
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,550
The hard work is me, right?

310
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,810
Brother

311
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,880
Why are you getting angry from just now

312
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,940
me

313
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,930
I am not angry

314
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,590
That's right

315
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,620
Very angry

316
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,110
You just saw the eyes of the newcomer just now

317
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,300
I have to see people through

318
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,090
What happened during the preparation process?

319
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,050
Nothing happened

320
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,870
It may be a bit sensitive to perform tomorrow

321
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
Yeah

322
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,920
Anyway, I put my clothes here and left

323
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,090
good

324
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,320
Am I angry?

325
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,260
I'm not angry

326
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,410
It's like a little angry

327
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,230
But why am I angry?

328
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,920
Shit

329
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,010
It's nice to worry about me

330
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,840
Fortunately, if you have a little cute, otherwise ...

331
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,430
I'm sorry to bother you so late

332
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,130
I want to change the track

333
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,229
Now start to prepare to shoot the last song

334
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,850
-Pecent -Okay

335
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,600
Come to prepare the camera

336
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,350
Lighting preparation

337
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,860
Enter

338
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,200
Already the last song

339
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,100
This time the playlist theme

340
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,050
Come on for you

341
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,040
But I suddenly had such an idea

342
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,400
The most reckless in the world

343
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,790
Maybe just like someone's mind

344
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,320
Even if you don't know

345
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,510
What kind of person is the other person, what kind of person is the other person think of me

346
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,880
Just because I like it

347
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,980
Because she will like it

348
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,140
Very reckless behavior

349
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,560
This song

350
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,430
I thought that these reckless people's endorsement mood was prepared

351
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,239
The original track is not this, right?

352
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,660
It is said that it was hurriedly changed at night

353
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,240
Suddenly why

354
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,790
have no idea

355
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,440
Revi required

356
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,500
I don't know when my heart

357
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,330
You can only install you alone

358
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,950
Daily heartbeat

359
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,690
Do I have to be so patient?

360
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,080
Do I make you feel stressful like this?

361
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,480
Is it just that I think so

362
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:54,360
Don't think I'm too anxious

363
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,380
It's not you, you can't do it

364
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,590
Even this reckless

365
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,030
I want to show it to you

366
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,890
Whenever I think of you, I will be inexplicably happy

367
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:19,640
You will feel inexplicably happy when you look at you

368
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,880
Although I don't know yet

369
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,010
Your mind

370
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,620
-Do the same emotion as you -your answer

371
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,100
But I still want to convey my mind to you

372
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,200
Light again

373
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,330
-= Plalist
Re: vi =-

374
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,159
Wow, emotional

375
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,750
-= Re: vi -My heart [PLALIST] = -
This is very similar to experience.

376

-= Wow, the sensibility is absolutely ... =-

377
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:21,490

-= This is very similar to experience. What do you like? =-

379
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,710

-= Then singing love songs are love
Singing away songs is it broken up?
Don't excessively invest =-

381
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,590
Did you sing away from the song?

382
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,760
Don't excessively invest

383
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:29,529
When spreading rumors, I will sort it into PDF documents and send it to the company
-= 22222 when spreading the rumors
I will organize it to PDF document and send it to the company =-

384
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,710
Revi will sing like this

385
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:31,959
-= Revi will sing like this, really want to see him again =-

386
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,820
I really want to see him again

387
00:23:32,821 --> 00:23:34,930
Admit that the other side of the Revi
- = Acknowledge the other side of the Revi =-

388
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,020
-= Comment
Revi will sing like this
I really want to see him again
Revi is really Revi ... the best, I love you
What to do with this emotion ... The appearance is too outstanding =-

389
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:39,990
Do I make you feel stressful like this?

390
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,499
Is it just that I think so

391
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,240
Don't think I'm too anxious

392
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,920
Revi is handsome

393
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,830
The trailer made by Hanzhu is good

394
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,859
Now the click volume has exceeded 3 million

395
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,680
I just put together the original videos.

396
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,789
Wow comments are also absolutely

397
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,790
- = Comments 230 =-Why is Revi so humane

398
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,339
It has always been the company's positioning and letting go wrong

399
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,740
This is more suitable for him

400
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,550
In this extent, increase the salary of video editing

401
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,600
Wow, the response is really great

402
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,810
I don’t know that Revi is this cute image

403
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,340
It was originally more fatal than handsome and cute

404
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,430
Don't have a daydream

405
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,360
Hey, there are such comments

406
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,080
The video can feel the meaning of admiration for Revi

407
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,550
God

408
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:37,370
Director I sent you the information I said yesterday

409
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,720
Is it posted so soon?

410
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,190
You can get it slowly

411
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,020
By the way, you asked for a long time today, right?

412
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,020
What's wrong with Hanzhu?

413
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,120
Go to school

414
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,849
-The hard -hard -hard work

415
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,170
-Strone is so hungry -so hungry

416
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,060
This is my internship certificate

417
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,619
I received the file you submitted

418
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,380
Because the company's business is busy
- = On-the-job certificate =-

419
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,310
But you do it very carefully and very carefully

420
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,210
Thanks

421
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,390
Will start again next month, right?

422
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,980
Yes, because the internship is to this month

423
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,559
Confirm EClass information for the absent course content

424
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,390
If you still feel not enough

425
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,760
Just ask the classmates who have listened to the class, right?

426
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:35,890
clear

427
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,990
By the way, Song Hanzhu

428
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,750
What do you want to do in the future?

429
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Now

430
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,010
I want to return to reality

431
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,800
Do I make you feel stressful like this?

432
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,350
-There is only I think so -hard -hard -hard

433
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,589
In the end you still prove yourself

434
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,730
you know too

435
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,880
I said that if I want to do it, I will do it

436
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,720
Now that the next one is done, do it well

437
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,480
Ready to post albums

438
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,370
Then this time

439
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,990
Yeah

440
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,140
What do you want to do and do it

441
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,670
Really handsome and handsome, really handsome

442
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,139
Brother is really the best boss

443
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,149
Our company will soon become one of the three brokerage companies

444
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,060
I will do

445
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,750
I really know how to play

446
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,159
When preparing this album

447
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,700
I want to re -contract with you to renew the contract, do you think

448
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,909
You will feel inexplicably happy when you look at you

449
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,910
That brother

450
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,820
As a condition for renewal, you promise me a request

451
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,130
What requires so serious

452
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,759
If you want a huge contract

453
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,930
I have no money

454
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,360
I have someone who wants to bring to the company

455
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,230
Make her a singer of our company

456
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,580
Is my renewal condition

457
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,820
Do you want PLII to sign a contract with the company?

458
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,290
Um

459
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,179
What is this suddenly said?

460
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,310
Didn't you only have to sing in dual singing?

461
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,530
I hope that PLII can continue to make music I want to do

462
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,450
As long as you can do this

463
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,480
It doesn't matter if you don't cooperate with me

464
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,400
Not even if you are a PLII fan

465
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,710
Ah really

466
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,600
I always think this is a bit over

467
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,660
-= Song Hanzhu =-

468
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,890
Isn't it time to work now?

469
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Um

470
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,850
I asked for a long time

471
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,070
That but there is a lot of time left

472
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,540
Shen Xi is also busy doing topics

473
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,670
You know, I only have a friend of Shenxi

474
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,290
besides

475
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,360
I think congratulations to your recording of the show smoothly in person

476
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,239
Then go in ...

477
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,240
Ah wait a minute

478
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,470
Don't be here today

479
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,090
Go to other places to play

480
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,020
Do you have something to block your face?

481
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,670
Didn't you still wear sunglasses last time?

482
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,970
Because you said it was strange before

483
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,640
Ah, how to block this child and face?

484
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,930
Can't fold your knees

485
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,980
That we return to the store again

486
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
correct

487
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,440
Anyway, it's too open here, right?

488
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,470
What to do if people are recognized

489
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,550
Can you see the appearance of the person who just rides a motorcycle

490
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,899
Can't see too fast

491
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,029
Yes, wear a helmet

492
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,340
How can you see it quickly

493
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,810
So if you don’t want to be found, ride faster

494
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,000
-I speeded up -Okay

495
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,740
-= Dingling Bell =-

496
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,870
I have to tell her

497
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,110
That's it

498
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,840
I invite guests to eat more

499
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
that

500
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,300
Let me take off this

501
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,700
The weather is also very hot

502
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,940
I have been wearing very stuffy

503
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,950
What to do if people are recognized

504
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,400
Should we go back too?

505
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,770
Wait a moment

506
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,870
Take it

507
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,879
Help me take it

508
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,170
My arm is going to cramp

509
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,630
Um

510
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,880
Do you also bring this kind of thing with you?

511
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,170
Otherwise, you have to go to the convenience store to buy it

512
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,830
very expensive

513
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,360
Go back to the car now

514
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:04,810
good

515
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,870
Go

516
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,420
It is stopped now

517
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,180
Yeah, when did you stop?

518
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,650
that

519
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,450
Have you said you look forward to me?

520
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,550
Someone said to me

521
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,000
The most important thing in a relationship is

522
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,770
Is your heart the same as my heart?

523
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,520
But sorry

524
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,100
I have different thoughts with you

525
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,320
I think it's very comfortable to get along with you

526
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,850
Being with you always make me honest

527
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,150
I want to be more honest

528
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:31,420
I always have something to move in my heart

529
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,820
I always show me myself

530
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,170
so

531
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,100
I hope it will be fine until this

532
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,170
I hope our relationship

533
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,270
Don't become more special again

534
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,620
Just the same period as a colleague in the workplace

535
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,220
That's the only relationship

536
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,650
Why

537
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:05,870
You know

538
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,150
You are very different from me

539
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,300
besides

540
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,720
My internship is over too

541
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,550
But let's take a look at the last greeting

542
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:04,120
Even if this is so, I have to convey my heart

543
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,120
Hello everyone, I am PLII

544
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,800
Because of personal reasons, it should be difficult to upload

545
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:02,570
Actually I don't know when I will come back

546
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,850
Wait until one day

547
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,670
When I can sing with less heavy mood

548
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,870
I will come back at that time

549
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:15,120
Thank you for listening to my immature singing during this time

550
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:26,800
-= There is a new comment =-

551
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,720
Did you live well during PLII this time?

552
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,970
this person...

553
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,050
Hello Doralee

554
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,500
I live ... a little magical

555
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,970
Doralee you

556
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,050
Do you don’t like singing anymore

557
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,500
No one is just don't like myself anymore

558
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,619
The song is obviously good

559
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,820
I can't say very well, I hate itself like this

560
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,650
So I want to run away

561
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,420
Do you have to say it before you know?

562
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,750
I can feel it when you hear Plii your song

563
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,720
How do you like singing

564
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,350
How warm you are

565
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,470
Even if you don't need the name PLII

566
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,159
Wait until one day you feel better in your heart

567
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,750
Must sing again

568
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:49,870
But why do you tell me this

569
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,170
Because I am a fan of PLII

570
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,220
I hope you can be happy when you are

571
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,470
I will always cheer for you

572
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,720
What are I ...

573
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,570
What am I doing?

574
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,519
Waiting for the days to be wiped out

575
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,249
It's for your time

576
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:21,070
You are getting farther and farther from me

577
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:28,519
What else do I expect

578
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,299
Countless meaning is not needed

579
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,550
only

580
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:40,670
Miss your smile

581
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,499
I will miss you more forever

582
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,350
Nothing can say

583
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,800
You leave now

584
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,020
Can't see it again in the future

585
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:03,719
Why didn't you tell you I love you

586
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,620
In front of your beloved you

587
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,420
Time to stay

588
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,170
No later

589
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,400
You just talk about what you have to do with her

590
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,999
You have to bring that etuber

591
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,870
Is it because of songs or because of love

592
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,519
Of course because of the song

593
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,749
Brother, you know how embarrassing I am because she is because she is

594
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,870
That is to say

595
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,449
I can't understand this too

596
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:50,149
Why do you bring such people to a company

597
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,819
Because the song is very good

598
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,249
Brother, you will know it when you listen

599
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,950
What is the potential of that person in PLII

600
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,550
Brother, you should thank me in the future

601
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:06,270
It's not bad

602
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,050
represent

603
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,620
Shina, why are you here

604
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,720
I passed by here and heard the sound and came in

605
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,200
What are you listening to

606
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,470
demo song

607
00:42:16,471 --> 00:42:18,270
almost

608
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:21,869
very nice

609
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,899
Although the accompaniment is a bit abrupt

610
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,720
But as long as weaken a bit

611
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,600
Can you give it to me on behalf of this song

612
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,720
What

613
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,050
It happened that my current public song is not set yet

614
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,620
This is

615
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,100
What's wrong

616
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:44,620
Have you already said that it is good to give others others

617
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,200
This is what the Tao country asked me so I listened

618
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,970
Do you?

619
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,070
Dao Guo wants to bring the owner of this song to the company

620
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,570
Are they interacting?

621
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,650
Why do you always have the angle of your angle?

622
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,420
What do you know about this?

623
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,770
Follow your lover to change the company

624
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,720
Isn't this very common?

625
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,520
The situation does not seem like that

626
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,749
He seems to be very satisfied with that person's music style

627
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,970
It should be to cooperate with her

628
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,770
But I have to bring her a company

629
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,620
But this is better

630
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,069
What

631
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,870
Write songs for colleagues

632
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,350
It's not difficult, right?

633
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,899
-= Please see our cute Revi =-

634
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,000
Although I also work in this circle, I really

635
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,950
This image is so bad

636
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,400
Actually made this speechless guy a little cute

637
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:50,770
how

638
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,969
You obviously scolded Revi every day

639
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:53,970
But in front of him

640
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,870
"Really handsome"
- = Please see our cute Revi =-

641
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,520
Aren't you like this

642
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,750
Hello

643
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,050
how

644
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,670
never mind

645
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,580
-= Horse representative =-

646
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,469
Mo Cun, you have to bring your person

647
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:15,650
Compared with me, I still look for the team leader ...

648
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,620
First of all, I hope not to leak the message

649
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:22,270
Do you know the ETuber called PLII

650
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,400
Yes

651
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,220
Understand a little bit

652
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:30,250
You go to contact her and take her to the company

653
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:33,720
Only when you see it, you can decide whether to sign a contract

654
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,320
But as far as I know

655
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,520
PLII has never disclosed my identity

656
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,870
Then let the Tao country just okay

657
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,970
This bureau is from the Tao Guo Group

658
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:37,800
They gathered themselves, but they must have me where I have me

659
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:40,970
It is said that I am active in the atmosphere

660
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:42,920
Are you waiting for someone

661
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,050
There is an appointment for me

662
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,200
Have an appointment

663
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,070
I go first

664
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:50,720
Shenxi will come over for a while

665
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,520
-You walk slowly -Okay

666
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,200
I'm going

667
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:58,670
you...

668
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,850
Have you known that I am PLII?

669
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:16,810
-= Love Playing Song =-

670
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,590
-= Thank you for the special appearance of Zheng Xiuying =-

671
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,319
Does she have to maintain mystery to us?

672
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,419
She shouldn't let you be an agent but appear in person.

673
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,799
I never thought of using you

674
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,499
You seem to have a misunderstanding

675
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,350
Are you throwing it?

676
00:47:57,351 --> 00:47:58,449
What is thrown

677
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:59,770
Did they re -assume

678
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,499
Don't you ask me why I returned to South Korea?

679
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,819
Don't talk about others, you can't tell me like this, right?

680
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,899
It was you who conveyed to me at that time

681
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,200
That's why you want to take PLII to our company, right?

682
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,599
Then his ex -girlfriend and now ambiguous girl are in the same company ...

683
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,550
I feel like doing this, you will listen to me and say

684
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:19,949
But what to do? I don't think you will have a chance

685
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:22,359
You came here as a staff member of our company

686
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,949
Still as a man

687
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:26,049
Are you afraid that I and Mo Cun will come back again?

688
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,569
I'm afraid I will never see you

689
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:28,770
So hesitated

690
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,470
Seize here

691
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,620
But what is your name

692
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
plum...

693
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,300
Not

694
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,450
Feel sorry

695
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:00,970
Do not laugh

696
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,450
I will change my name first when I am an adult

697
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,420
do not

698
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,869
Don't change

699
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:08,350
What's the name is pretty good

700
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,920
plum...

701
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:11,420
Li Mocun

702
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Good name
