On the surface, it is still hiding

In the words of sighing

What can fill the empty deficiency

20
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:19,720
It's better to draw me in my heart

21
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,560
My mother is a singer

22
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,360
The underground band was built in the grand

23
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,810
Making songs also shows

24
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,270
It is said to be particularly handsome

25
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,320
I said that because of this

26
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,570
This is the story before my birth

27
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,870
When I appeared in my mother's belly

28
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,910
Our family is not good

29
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,750
Back to the hometown of Dad

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,210
Can't stand on the stage anymore

31
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,630
It is estimated that it started from then

32
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,840
My mother gradually became unfortunate

33
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,850
For you, this is a warm hometown

34
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,760
But for me

35
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,690
For me, this is hell

36
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,560
Hell is hell

37
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,360
Hell

38
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,200
Where no one knows

39
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,030
Give up the only family in the dream life

40
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,100
Mom endured nine years

41
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,900
Then leave us

00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,320

44

How important is the dream?

45
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,410
Later I became curious

46
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,300
Is your mother who miss such a nostalgia, will my mother happy?

47
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,880
Hope she is happy

48
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:25,930
but

I can't ask

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,610

52
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,610
Music is painful for dad

53
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,900
so

54
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,620
I can't sign a contract with the company

55

If I say I want to be a singer

56
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,790
I can't imagine what kind of expression Dad will make

57
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,630
No

58
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,750

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,810

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,590
I am moving

194
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,670
no

195
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,090
Let's post albums

196
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,060
What

197
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,100
You came

198
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,740
Sorry I am late

199
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,570
Yeah, where are you going

200
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,740
The learning team is late

201
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,530
Did you end the internship too desperately?

202
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,960
Dad’s daughter also participated in the learning team

203
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,830
Wait a moment

204
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,660
Aren't you two of you participating in the learning group together?

205
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,660
I found one new

206
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,840
I did not participate in the original learning team during my internship

207
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,760
Saying mom

208
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,300
Why do you eat beef suddenly today

209
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,970
It was sent by you

210
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,350
It is too hard to find a job for you to replenish your strength

211
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,930
Do you remember to say to our dad to say that the meat is very fragrant

212
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,900
Why did you suddenly get the beef?

213
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,070
Didn’t you not eat it last time?

214
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,860
That dad eats it

215
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,910
My daughter is so old, you are still afraid I am hungry?

216
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,040
are not you tired

217
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,710
What are you tiring

218
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,960
It's all old

219
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,670
By the way dad

220
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,870
Um

221
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,760
Nothing is nothing

222
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,470
You also remember to eat well

223
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,390
Don't put food to expire like the last time

224
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,730
Um, take a good rest

225
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,950
Sorry dad

226
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,490
Let me try again

227
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,080
this person

228
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:28,310
As soon as you see you and my heart, the armed forces are lifted

229
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,180
How about it

230
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,600
Not bad

231
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,110
The song is really good

232
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,690
What do you think you think

233
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,390
So you want to play this album, right?

234
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,100
This will be used as a container

235
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,520
Okay, then try it

236
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,340
represent

237
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,700
I know that Brother will agree

238
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,560
Wait for it

239
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,100
I will let it keep the ranking list position

240
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,020
Is it okay

241
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,030
The sing is really good

242
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:04,980
A sound source and album are different.

243
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,410
Did you see his eyes?

244
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,040
What

245
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,800
Eye

246
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,450
Crazy

247
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,830
If you say anything at that time, you will listen to anything

248
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:20,580
If he stops him from knowing what he will do behind his back

249
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,410
Let him go first

250
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,640
It is not too late to stop him at that time

251
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,590
Wow is this REVI's song?

252
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,330
Is he going to take a class?

253
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,660
The voice of the two people is very good

254
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,990
Emotional investment is also very good

255
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,170
Really amazing, I can drink like you like this

256
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,360
That is to say

257
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,250
When we first met, we were still students

258
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,840
time flies

259
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,980
I heard you want to make an album

260
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,060
Is it okay?

261
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,900
There are reasons for not showing their faces, right?

262
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,180
right

263
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,220
So I thought for a long time

264
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,450
Can I do such a dangerous thing?

265
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,020
It's okay to sing like it is now, right?

266
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,560
But I plan to try it

267
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,200
I want to try it

268
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,240
Do you believe that person

269
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,100
Don't believe it

270
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,680
I plan not to consider those anymore

271
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,770
What do I want to do now

272
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,400
Who need

273
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,100
Just consider these

274
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,270
So I was using him

275
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,050
It seems to be changing

276
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,420
At this

277
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,030
-= Song Hanzhu's record =-

278
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,390
I thought about that

279
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,080
How about our album theme diary

280
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,360
Journal

281
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,980
The diary is very frank

282
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,890
No need to pretend, it's okay not pretending not cool

283
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,080
Just show me the original me

284
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,140
you know too

285
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,080
I have been hiding in Tibetan's life. I am quite bumpy

286
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,870
I feel that you will be more bumpy and won't be better than me

287
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,800
But isn't the diary written alone?

288
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,760
right

289
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,440
Then use it as an exchange diary

290
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,920
Did the children write when they were young?

291
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:23,540
Will write a secret there and write what you want to say to the other party

292
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,290
It's no longer myself alone

293
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,980
The diary is the story of myself alone

294
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,350
Right but exchanging diary is the story of two people

295
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,260
that

296
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,520
Can you hold you?

297
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,180
Do you want to die

298
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,630
-= 2023 Summer Song Hanzhu & Li Daoguo's record =-

299
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,540
What is written on the first page of the diary?

300
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,920
so excited

301
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,610
-= Strange people =-

302
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,070
He hesitated for a long time and wrote the question for a long time

303
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,720
Start with the song that I practiced with you yesterday

304
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,250
I thought you were a headset thief

305
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,400
Is a strange person

306
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,210
But the strange thing is to be attracted by you

307
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,410
The first confession of Taoism

308
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,080
Hanzhu Diary

309
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,350
Actually, I haven't written a diary for a long time

310
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,950
My diary was full of worry from a certain moment

311
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,660
Will you write with happy things this time?

312
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,650
I don't think it is necessary

313
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,390
Movie brain agent team

314
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,340
The protagonist finally grew up because of sad things

315
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,050
Could it be that it made you weak at that time

316
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,910
The achievement of you now is strong

317
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,340
Thank you

318
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,680
I realized after I met you

319
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,340
You are not very different from me too

320
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,910
I used to call you the emerging nobles

321
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,850
But it is harmful for you

322
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,210
Actually because of what you said, I feel very heartbroken

323
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,680
But I'm not a weird person

324
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,070
But it's strange

325
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,830
Strange people are strange, so weird

326
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,680
So strange I feel strange

327
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,790
Thank you for being frank to me

328
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,820
Although it is not the kind of confession

329
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,610
I actually have no friends except Shen Xi, but I actually have no friends

330
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,780
Music is a diary, so it is like a diary

331
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,610
Monday, Thursday, Thursday, Friday Saturday Sunday

332
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,120
I feel how to use these seven kinds of music themes

333
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,220
I think of a sentence today

334
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,530
Although it is relatively naive

335
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,690
But it's my story

336
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,360
I have never been sensible and disaster, and then apologize to you

337
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,670
Because you are an artist to make me feel

338
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,390
So don't want to involve you

339
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,570
My reality has no free time to make me close to others

340
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,090
-= 2023 Summer =-

341
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,780
So I feel that I am kept in my own world to live

342
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,290
This is music and PLII

343
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,050
Worry to enjoy a little bit more in the music score

344
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,480
In the future, I will let you smile and open

345
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,270
-= 2023 Summer =-

346
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,820
-= The idea of Taoism =-

347
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,990
-= Not a confession =-

348
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,630
-= Weird people on Monday
Wednesday is not a confession of confession
We are like summer =-

349
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,460
Finally finished

350
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,500
It's great, the best you are really so happy

351
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,060
I told you not to do this anymore, right?

352
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,300
Don't want to

353
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,460
What is your two situations

354
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,020
so

355
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,890
Hanzhu, you are a hidden music blogger

356
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,370
This classmate is a blogger or your fan

357
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,980
So the two of you are making albums together now

358
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,990
Right

359
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,040
right

360
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,220
Sorry I am not intentionally hiding you

361
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,710
So are you two in love?

362
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,180
Is there any secret in the world

363
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,890
Those emotions are available, but

364
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,110
I must know this

365
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,910
So what is the relationship between the two of you now

366
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,710
that

367
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,460
that is

368
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,590
What is our relationship

369
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,180
we are

370
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,460
intern

371
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,380
What

372
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,640
intern

373
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,340
So it's not in the stage of understanding

374
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,290
Intern

375
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,470
You are an intern at the Broadcasting Bureau

376
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,360
Um

377
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,650
I am the relationship of being an intern for him

378
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,860
Where to go

So what is the relationship between the two of you now

What is our relationship

393
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,730
I am treating him as an intern relationship

394
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,060
what a shame

395
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,760

is it here

399
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,510
Shouldn't it

400
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,020
There are too many people living here

401
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,340
have a good meal

403
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,810
I estimate when I see the address

404
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,230
It's really you

405
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,320
But I feel like you are running away

406
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,540
So I escaped?

407
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,720
That's because it is a bit embarrassing to meet like this

408
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,100
It's Hanzhu

409
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,580
What are you doing here?

410
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,750

00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:56,500
The approved time has passed 30 minutes

414
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,320
Do you want to sit in peace here

What are you doing just now

422
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,790
What's wrong

423
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,240
We have no appointment today

424
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,820
Hey Mr. Li Daoguo

425
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,560
What's wrong with Song Souqus

426
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,170
What

427
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,580
Didn't you say

428
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,840
Our relationship is intern

429
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,890
Don't you think so too

430
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,770
You want to be better to me

431
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,260
Not now why do you mention that

432
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,560
Because I am sad

433
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,630
Several of me every day

434
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:54,660
** In order to see him, come to the door

435
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,800
I still smiled at him

436
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,000
I'm so sad and sad, what's wrong

437
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,730
What are you so frank

438
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,570
What can I do

439
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,650
The thoughts in my heart are all drowned

440
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,130
This is a natural phenomenon

441
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,860
Natural disaster

442
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,450
So you can adapt as soon as possible

443
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,880
What to adapt

444
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,610
Adapt to me who likes you

445
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,830
I will soon become formal

446
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,080
Arrange my position

447
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,130
Do you understand

448
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,650
Your bag

449
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,220
What is formal is really strange?

-= Song intern =-

451
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,420
Hello

452
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,920
What's up

453
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:39,020
We are going to recording today, right?

454
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,520
Um

455
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,820
Wait at night ... in my house

456
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,850
Um

457
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,700
See

458
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,350
We met when we were at work

459
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,050
It's not that I deliberately went to him

460
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,170
so

461
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,400
Don't be sad

462
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,250
But why tell me this

463
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,420
Didn't you say it? I have to be optimistic about you

464
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,000
That's why I said

465
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,650
See

466
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,520
I said

467
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,200
What's wrong

468
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,150
Don't you thank me

469
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,850
I just let you go that happened at that time

470
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,870
Thank you

471
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,300
It seems you don't care much about me

472
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,720
Although

473
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,950
I didn't ask because I cared for it

474
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,850
I'm just curious

475
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,300
I care

476
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,700
And very much care

477
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:37,400
Because your location may threaten Hanzhu

478
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,770
I'm afraid that Hanzhu is injured because of this

479
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,320
So I care very much

480
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,320
What qualifications do you have to worry about her

481
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,220
I don’t know if I am worried that I still need to be qualified

482
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,720
And talk about qualifications

483
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,120
We should be almost the same

484
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,000
Perhaps

485
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,350
I am more qualified

486
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,500
I'm really curious, so I asked

487
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,750
Do you often hear people often say that you are obscure

488
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,470
Taoist brother

489
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,620
Why do you run like this

490
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,120

How can this be plagiarism?

504
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,500
Do you want to die?

505
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,700
Is this a lunatic?

506
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,500
Brother, your Japanese has improved a lot

507
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,920
What do people look at? What are you doing?

508
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
In terms of common sense, this is not reasonable at all

509
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,270
This is divided into a small section to compare

510
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,700
Which song can not be exactly the same

511
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,070

-= Today, a shocking plagiarism behavior of Etuber =-

513
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,220
This feels far -fetched

514
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,070
One or two syllables are the same as plagiarism

515
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,750
All the songs in the world are plagiarism

516
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,950
That is to say

517
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,200
I really can't stand it anymore

518
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,550
-This too much -that is

519
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,850
Can this be said to be plagiarism ...

520
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,670
Hanzhu, have you seen this?

521
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:03,720
What

522
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,470
Can you still say that it is not plagiarism?

523
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,520
How can you know this kind of lunatic? Do you know him?

524
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,170
Don't know me for the first time to see him

525
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,300
But why did he like this

526
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,020
Speaking looks like determined to bury you

527
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,770
Do you have to sue him?

528
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,600
Whoever thinks of this is very powerful

PLII plagiarism is a misunderstanding
Please upload the video quickly

533
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,650
Obviously how to clarify that it is estimated to be deleted and run away

534
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,620
So did she hide her face during this time?

535
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,200
It seems like this

536
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,120
Hurry up and apologize to the long -term appearance

537
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,320
If she doesn't come out, we will find her

538
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,250
Which background seems to be playing the bar on the spot

539
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,900
It's about to be nailed to the Internet on the Internet

540
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,150
Go well

541
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:01,050
This is really good

542
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,920
Wait a moment

543
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,200
I have to push the boat smoothly

544
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,430
I'm curious about the true identity of PLII

545
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,050
Can we be a human flesh with her

546
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,770
Do you want to be really flesh?

547
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,320
First open the track will be released according to the original schedule

548
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,670
But the return is a bit ... because there is such a video

549
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,650
It's a bit wrong

550
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,570
So what

551
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,370
It's not that we plagiarize

552
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,720
Have you watched that video

553
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,450
No

554
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,100
I just heard

555
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,550
well done

556
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,650
That is exactly hard

557
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,220
There are 12 sounds in total

558
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,500
There can be 60,000 songs in a day

559
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,700
Take that reunite and say that plagiarism is constantly investigating

560
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,400
How can I write a song?

561
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,450
But in case a controversy

562
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,000
There will be a great blow to the image

563
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,070
We will also carefully confirm

564
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,650
Do not let the dispute expand

565
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,400
good

566
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,370
Be careful, there is no disadvantage

567
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,470
Everyone goes out

568
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,800
But that person

569
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,050
Is it the person that Taoism said before?

570
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,900
Well, she is right

571
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,320
No matter how public opinion is

572
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,800
Public opinion response is so bad

573
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,500
Will the song they cooperate together, will it be okay?

574
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,100
Will she already see the video

575
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,170
Good

576
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,700
I see

577
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,900
elder brother

578
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,200
What's wrong

579
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,350
The representative lets you go now

580
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,900
He said there was an urgent matter

581
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,170
I won't say much about it, right?

582
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,200
elder brother

583
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,000
Didn't you say that you and that person have any relationship, right?

584
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,020
Didn't you just like her music?

585
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,870
But the whole world said
That person's musical talent is fake

586
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,250
She also said that she copied the song of our company artist

587
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,200
If the public knows you cooperate with such people

588
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,550
What do you think of public opinion?

589
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,320
Originally, the company's stock has not been very prosperous recently

590
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,870
Do you want to add chaos to the company?

591
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,750
You also know that she is not plagiarism

592
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,020
You really don't know

593
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,300
Is that video of that video?

594
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:28,870
I know

595
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,500
But Taoism

596
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,770
The important thing is not the truth

597
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,050
But public opinion

598
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,150
If you want to stay as a member of Sez

599
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,400
Still don't cause disputes to be better

600
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,550
-= Copy so much, do you still write it yourself?

601
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,370
What are you doing here

602
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,820
I didn't see the key in the store, so I couldn't go in

603
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,670
Here, the key

604
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,050
What does the company say

605
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,700
Let's cancel the album?

606
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,750
Why do we cancel the album

607
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,650
You know too

608
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,670
Only the comparison of that section of that section

609
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,800
Every song can find similar points

610
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,920
But people don't think so

611
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,370
For those people

612
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,980
I just have no strength

613
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,520
Also copied the shameless person of the Seea song

614
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,170
Chinese bead

615
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,800
Give me the phone

616
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,670

-= Delete =-

618
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,120
There is no such a start now

619
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,650
Those disturbances

620
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,620
As long as you leave the Internet, you will disappear

621
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,200
Those who leave a message

622
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,750
If you really stand in front of you, you can't say a word

623
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,850
So don't be because of those

624
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,700
Make you too hurt

625
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,100
We will record according to the scheduled schedule

626
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,370
Complete album

627
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,370
Nothing has changed

628
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,570
Now you know

629
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,220
Then you work hard

630
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,670
See you in my house in a while

00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,410
-= Hanzhu =-

632

Reporter

633
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,270
You see the video

634
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,070
What can I do?

635
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,020
Do you always encounter such a thing in doing this

636
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,600
The company is still considering how to respond

637
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,650
Okay, please help me write news

638
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:41,750
OK

639
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,870
Sister's influence of this video is simply absolute

640
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,400
There are already three million clicks

641
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,220
Of course, how much did I spend here

642
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,620
Of course it is worth the price

643
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,550
Did you see that video

644
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,220
I just heard of it without me

645
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:03,820
But is that person the person that Taoism said before?

646
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,220
Public opinion response is so bad

647
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:09,050
Will the song they cooperate together, will it be okay?

649
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,720
Let's talk about it

650
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:51,120
I have nothing to say with you anymore

651
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,950
Let me talk to you

652
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,570
Plii has no plagiarism of your song

653
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,450
Why do I

654
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,250
Everyone is the same person singing

655
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:03,300
This degree can help

656
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,870
Plii now

657
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,500
I'm suffering from very wrongdoing misunderstandings

658
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,620
If I publish a position

659
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,770
What can you do for me

660
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:15,450
Can you abandon that person to cooperate with me?

661
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:29,420
I'm sorry for business after the business is over

662

-= Love Playing Song =-

663
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,750
Why is it always sad and angry

664
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:45,450
Isn't it so good?

665
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:46,920
You may not be clear

666
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,250
But the one that is preferred will be even more disturbed

667
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,050
Really

668
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,000
But why is your expression so ugly

669
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,850
You will not tell the interns' sister the truth, right?

670
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:57,890
Hidden until the end

671
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:59,800
Hanzhu is dangerous because you

672
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,400
That's why let me not say anything

673
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,920
My world began to shake instantly

674
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,370
Sure enough

675
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:08,170
Do you have to be soft -hearted to that etuber?

676
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:10,150
Do you bet on your career?

677
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:12,270
I just said here a long time, right?

678
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,920
So -called internship

679
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,570
Just want to understand what kind of person you are
