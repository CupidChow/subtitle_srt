4
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,210
Talk to me

5
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,680
I have nothing to say with you

6
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,620
Let me talk to the public

7
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,080
Say that Plii does not plagiarize your song

8
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,000
Why do I do this

9
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,810
Also as a musician

10
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,820
You can do this little thing

11
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,540
Now PLII

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,200
It's wrong to be misunderstood

13
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,320
If I show my position

14
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,490
What can you do for me

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
You can leave her

16
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,010
Do you cooperate with me?

17
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,010
Not

18
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,630
Suddenly something?

19
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,740
What's wrong with you?

20
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,020
Is something wrong?

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
us

22
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,100
Can't you go back to the beginning?

23
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,710
Let's go back Hanzhu

24
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,470
Mo Cun me ...

25
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,230
talk about it later

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,910
talk about it later

27
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,270
You go around with me and come here

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,470
No matter how long I can wait for you

29
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,390
so now

30
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,390
Just stay like this

31
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,070
That Hanzhu

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,950
There is a good news

33
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,200
Shiya decided to show her position

34
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,420
Say your song is not plagiarized

35
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,070
Ah really?

36
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,750
But why did she do that so

37
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,780
Why is it

38
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,980
Because this is a fact

39
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,700
Also as a musician

40
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,780
It is not difficult to add this matter

41
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,430
but

42
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,240
Why is your expression not good

43
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,100
Is something wrong?

44
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,400
I decided to participate in Shiya's album

45
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,400
One day we

46
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,950
You should meet each other

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,220
Remember your beautiful smile

48
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,320
In countless marriage

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,090
you and me

50
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:17,940
Maybe it is one from the beginning

51
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,930
so we

52
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,930
You should meet each other

53
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,430
Remember you who laugh like a fool

54
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,280
Closely approach

55
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,280
Hold my hand

56
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,010
It should be a rumor

57
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,690
What

58
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,100
Where did I have seen the rumors that they had associated

59
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,220
Not recently

60
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,540
Before

61
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,790
years ago

62
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,780
I have passed between fans for a while

63
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,380
But the artists have a lot of rumors

64
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:12,970
elder brother

65
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,020
I have something to ask you

66
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,490
Do not ask

67
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,559
Would you like to your interns and sister?

68
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,910
Tell me truthfully

69
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,160
hateful

70
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,330
What do you think of my words

71
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,639
I want to be bright in front of you

72
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,610
So tell everything about everything

73
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
What's wrong

74
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Isn't it so good?

75
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,879
You really happen

76
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,190
-Ne.

77
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,919
Work with your girlfriend

78
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,969
Who in this world will like it?

79
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,760
Do you want to be thrown before the relationship?

80
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,389
Do you let me lie?

81
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,140
I mean there is no need to tell her

82
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,190
What you said in order to make yourself feel at ease

83
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,620
It may make your relationship problems

84
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,090
Stand by you and you

85
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,400
I decided to participate in Shiya's album

86
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,130
Where did I see

87
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,990
The rumors they have associated

88
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,730
And you my love

89
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,080
In the world ...

90
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,440
It's really too nostalgic for Song Hanzhu

91
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,320
Hello, despicable Li Daoguo

92
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,900
Can you ask him?

93
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,810
Can you say this?

94
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,510
-That -That

95
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
You speak first

96
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
No

97
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,930
Mine is not an important thing

98
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,380
You speak first

99
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,220
That Shiya

100
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,710
Um

101
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,750
What's wrong

102
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,030
I have dated her before

103
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,650
but

104
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,540
There is no feeling at all now

105
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,460
It's a company colleague

106
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,530
Nothing anymore

107
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,670
Just like the dust in the atmosphere

108
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,910
so

109
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,330
You will definitely not need in the future

110
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,170
Care about her

111
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,000
Then you can't feel sad again because I feel sad again

112
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,320
What

113
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Not someone

114
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,540
Singing a affectionate love song with his ex -girlfriend on TV

115
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,590
I'm very small, right?

116
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,150
Although I am more disadvantaged from all aspects

117
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,840
But I understand you with a lot of magnificent

118
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,090
Why did the topic suddenly turn here

119
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,140
hateful

120
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,830
That's why let me not say anything

121
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,170
That our communication seems to be a bit wrong

122
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,850
It's all because I'm so hard to endure hardships

123
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,960
Shina is really broad -minded

124
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,519
She has no benefit and still like this

125
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,040
-= 'Plague victim's "Shiya, speak of the debate ..." It's just similar "=-
That is to say

126
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,120
If the same is good when working with us

127
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,820
Of course

128
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,990
How much did I burn there

129
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,420
There must be reward

130
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,710
-= Channel analysis
The number of clicks on the channel in the past 28 days is 4.9 million times =-
Wow a thousand people per day

131
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,970
Suddenly betrayed me

132
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Card debt

133
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
what to do

134
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
hateful

135
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,700
After my event this time

136
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,680
To start making albums again

137
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,190
Album

138
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,450
Shouldn't it be a album that cooperates with that blogger?

139
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:15,960
Um

140
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,940
The album that cooperates with PLII

141
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,310
Isn't it interrupted?

142
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,320
They have already clarified that it is not PLII's fault

143
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,730
Of course you have to continue

144
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,100
So do you act with Xiaonan?

145
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,980
Xiaonan rescue that blogger

146
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,710
At the price, you can sing with her

147
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,870
What is your relationship

148
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,590
What is the relationship to cover her so

149
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,120
What is the relationship

150
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,250
Just make the relationship between the album together

151
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,850
Brother, you know too

152
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,890
Once I am determined to go to the end no matter what

153
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,130
good

154
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,560
You have been dying like this

155
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,009
Just like what I said to me now

156
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,290
Always hide

157
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,050
Don't be discovered by others

158
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,060
Let's talk about

159
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,060
What plan do you have in the future

160
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,490
This problem makes me blame me

161
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,120
I don't know how to answer you

162
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,020
I should tell you

163
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,090
Your position is for Hanzhu

164
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,890
Fully will be a threat

165
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,410
I am asking how to protect Hanzhu in this threat

166
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,180
What qualifications do you ask

167
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,740
certainly

168
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,470
Just like what you said, you don't need to be qualified

169
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,970
but

170
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,110
It seems that this problem cannot be confused

171
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,520
You also know that the past time is no power

172
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,380
Hanzhu has become dangerous

173
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
because of you

174
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,010
The two of us had something to say before the shooting

175
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,310
Can you go out?

176
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,070
Huaxin, you too

177
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,710
yes

178
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,750
What do you want to say

179
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Let's go here

180
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,780
What

181
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,560
Captive you

182
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:43,940
I quit

183
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,010
What do you mean by you suddenly

184
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,870
Have you forgotten the agreement with me?

185
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,899
I will help you post a position

186
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,840
That's what happened before I knew you caused the parties before the parties

187
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,220
Do you have evidence

188
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,610
Li Xiaonan

189
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:08,470
Do you have evidence to prove that I did it?

190
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,289
It seems that Cai Hot is also contacted you this time

191
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,700
This is all means

192
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,320
-Se said -it seems that it is really connected

193
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,230
I say a long short saying

194
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,730
Cooperate with your behavior

195
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,980
So far
So you just

196
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,420
Let's go here

197
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,449
Next week's final exam

198
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,800
yes

199
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,329
Everyone knows the scope of the exam

200
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,060
All the contents I have learned

201
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,739
yes

202
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,140
Okay, see you next week

203
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,180
It's really the last exam now

204
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,960
The college career will end next week

205
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,100
Then we are

206
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,490
Unemployed

207
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,830
Nomad

208
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,640
But you are not a thorough unemployed tourist

209
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
You have a sideline business

210
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,750
sideline

211
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,210
musician

212
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,010
Hello

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,600
Didn't you go to tell someone else, right?

214
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,140
The president doesn't know my parents and don't know

215
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,350
We Zhong'er didn't know

216
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
What do you do?

217
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,190
Hanzhu Sorry

218
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,170
fine

219
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,030
It's okay

220
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,610
I have seen it many times there

221
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,190
Where did you see it?

222
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,350
hateful

223
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,300
-= Shiya former agent =-

224
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,880
This guy is too entangled

225
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,270
-= Shi Yaqian agent feed
Uncosty's call Shiya's former agent
Unconducting the call Shiya former agent =-
Hey

226
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,059
-= Didn't it mean to help us realize justice =-
Isn't it to help us realize justice?

227
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,560
-= Ah what's going on !!!! =-
Ah what's going on?

228
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,700
Me

229
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,030
For Shiya, it's just a stepping stone bridge. You person
- = Add blacklist =-

230
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,220
Elegant

231
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Absolutely

232
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,960
This can be done

233
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,100
-= SD network lesson =-

234
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,480
-= Hanzhu, etc., do you have time? =-
Wait, will there be time?

235
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,910
so amazing

236
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,750
You actually come to me

237
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,270
That's right

238
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
For a long time

239
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,280
I am avoiding you

240
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,020
But now I feel that I can't go like that anymore

241
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,890
I only know one thing in the near future

242
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,620
My ambiguous attitude

243
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,460
Will hurt a lot of people

244
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,140
so

245
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,430
I must say it today

246
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,520
What do you want to say

247
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
sorry

248
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,440
That's it

249
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,150
I really cherish this paddle

250
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,180
I'm afraid it won't be used after it is damaged

251
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,820
But after the passage of time

252
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,710
It is still so damaged

253
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,669
you know too

254
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,410
This state can no longer pop up a good sound

255
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,170
so

256
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,380
I want to save it for my precious memories

257
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,530
Is it really okay?

258
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
that person

259
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,870
It's completely different from the world you live

260
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,690
Maybe because of him

261
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,300
Shake your life

262
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,450
Ok, I know

263
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,860
Is it necessary to be him?

264
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,480
That's right, Mo Cun

265
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,870
My world has always been narrow

266
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,610
Self -drawing boundary

267
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,160
I didn't want to get out of my world

268
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,930
But he will always push me behind

269
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,370
Ask me what I am afraid of

270
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,440
Make me bravely break through

271
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,680
Say I can do so

272
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,460
so

273
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
I want to try it once

274
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,029
No matter the end of the road we are going

275
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,620
Is it a cliff or a flower road

276
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,210
I just want

277
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,020
Brave to the end

278
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Um

279
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,710
The weather is great

280
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,250
That is to say

281
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,780
Earlier than I expected

282
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,470
This is like this

283
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,740
I also want to sing with you quickly

284
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,800
so

285
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,210
I can feel sad again

286
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,090
Are you a child?

287
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,200
Why do you always want to play with a small temper

288
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,230
You may not know

289
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,130
Originally, people who prefer more are more insecure

290
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,940
In this short time I cooperated with her

291
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,760
I have always thought about you

292
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,070
What do I want

293
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,900
Really become clear

294
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,020
What's this

295
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,530
I also worked for a while when you were working

296
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,130
But if you want to listen now ...

297
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Don't listen now

298
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,100
Go home and listen to it

299
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,750
-= To you =-

300
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,720
How different you are from the beginning

301
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:18,940
I don't know why it will always be attracted by you

302
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,250
Even if you have a bad mood

303
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:33,620
I will follow you gradually getting cheerful

304
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,210
I like you

305
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,910
Although a little shy

306
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,340
But I can no longer hide

307
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,100
Even if pretending is not

308
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,660
To be honest, I still think of you

309
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,680
It will also make me smile with my love

310
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,070
Haven't listened yet?

311
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,050
-= Li Daoguo =-

312
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:29,710
Um

313
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,060
What are you doing

314
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,630
I'm going to sleep

315
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,520
What's wrong

316
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,090
Look outside the window

317
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,470
Huh

318
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,330
Hey you

319
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,270
Why did you come here suddenly

320
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,010
like

321
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
I said I like it

322
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,840
Give me this kind of music

323
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,920
I also say that there is no meaningful words

324
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,030
Then you are a foul

325
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,690
So I

326
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,340
like you

327
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,010
Wow is the sea

328
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,530
It's a gift to give you

329
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,730
Give me a surprise gift for my good song

330
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,750
Hello

331
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,100
You sing with your ex -girlfriend ...

332
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,800
Why suddenly say this again

333
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,410
Actually I am jealous

334
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,490
But I also feel that I am very filled

335
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,089
Immediately reflected

336
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,090
How to reflect

337
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,450
After the internship, the internship begins to turn right

338
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,240
Then I also end the internship

339
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,930
Starting to righteousness

340
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,820
Sweet and sour sauce is still soy sauce
I want soy sauce

341
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
Open my mouth

342
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,070
Um, the taste of the sea

343
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,590
-= Li Daoguo wishes you a good results! =-

344
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,050
-= How about sleeping?
Well, you also got up early
Uh, I opened my eyes very early
Did you go to school?
I am going to go for a good grade! =-
I wish you a test for you Good results

345
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,350
Oops, Hanzhu is sorry

346
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,510
It doesn't matter

347
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Nobody

348
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,230
I'll pick it up for you

349
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
Not this

350
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,050
What

351
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,740
nothing

352
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,310
Then you take a good exam

353
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,110
Ah obviously this is

354
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,180
Do you want to dig and look at it?

355
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Knowledge

356
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,740
Are the courses finished?

357
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,550
not yet

358
00:27:45,551 --> 00:27:47,570
You also graduated at the end of this semester, right?

359
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,380
almost

360
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,489
Brother thought for a while

361
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,620
It seems that I didn't get close to you during school

362
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,660
It is a pity

363
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:04,080
But it's not necessary to get close to now, right?

364
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,740
It is indeed

365
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,950
Actually I have a lot of curiosity to ask you

366
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,580
what

367
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,460
Hanzhu

368
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,770
Song Hanzhu?

369
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,360
What's wrong with her

370
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,880
Brother had a good opinion of Hanzhu

371
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,430
But you also know that Hanzhu doesn’t like to be close to others

372
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,290
Will not socialize

373
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,350
So you are curious about her

374
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,330
That Hanzhu

375
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,970
Is she interested in music?

376
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,170
For example, do you like to sing or what kind of musical instrument will

377
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,840
For example

378
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,989
Guitar or something

379
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,990
Is it just her?

380
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,340
She can't touch that kind of thing at all

381
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,870
It's a big deal to play music

382
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,350
Is it all to this?

383
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,230
What's wrong with that padders?

384
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,860
What music bar

385
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,260
I seem to have heard that she is part -time over there

386
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,960
But that's just a part -time job

387
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,170
So where is that place

388
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,630
It's basically the end now

389
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,550
What do you want to do when this is done?

390
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,510
Now that you have done what you want to do

391
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,640
It's time to do what to do, right?

392
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,070
Music may ...

393
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,860
Two occupations to be the secondary business

394
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:32,270
You are really uncomfortable

395
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,990
It's just a lack of moral employer

396
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,420
What will you do in the future

397
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,830
Well, of course

398
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,260
have no idea

399
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,250
What

400
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,000
Even if you make a plan

401
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,750
Will be unwilling

402
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,630
Why worry about it in advance

403
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,010
Any more

404
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,690
You have to be in this dangerous world

405
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,590
Is there no plan to go without goals?

406
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,050
Even if there is no such thing

407
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,660
My goal is also very clear

408
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,630
Song

409
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,860

411
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,410
I will continue to make my music

412
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,180
I will also listen to your song

413
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,720

Ah, it is obviously nearby

Very hungry

417
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:54,850
-Do you are not hungry -go to eat

418

Revi

419
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:10,500
Let me think about it

420
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,540
So interesting

421
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,600

426
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,060
We will meet later

-= False communication with fans ... Sez member Revi,
not in the preparation of albums but in love ?? =-

434
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:39,219
Recently, I am not active because I am preparing an album

Let everyone wait for him for a while

436

It is not facts that it is revealed
- = not facts =-

438

It's an enthusiastic with a certain female

439
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,979
That woman is the same as REVI at Hongren University students

440
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,109
The same session as him

441
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,489
Do a team subject with him in a professional course

442
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:00,490
Become very close

443
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,890

Hanzhu hasn't seen it for a long time

447
00:35:24,486 --> 00:35:25,620
I saw you in the news

448
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,419
I just saw you in the news

449
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,560
It's you

450
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,539
Hello, I am Mispatch reporter Wu Taishuo

451
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,540
Can you pass the phone?

452
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,080
My world began to shake instantly

453
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:50,160
-= SEZ's REVI, and ordinary women are glory?
The woman is Ms. S Hong Ren University, who is the same as REVI.

454
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:51,640
And your world is also

455
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,240
Just storm called

456
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,719
To say that the advertising contract should be temporarily retained

457
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,939
ABS is also here to email

458
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,220
Variety shows to be canceled

459
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,140
Know you out first

460
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,960
who is it

461
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,180
who's that person

462
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Is it PLII, right?

463
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,420
elder brother

464
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,140
That's it

465
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,319
Ms. S, Ms. S, is PLII

466
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,960
You two are not lovers

467
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,300
I met for the upcoming album

468
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
Very perfect

469
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,099
Brother is definitely not good

470
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,840
Whatever

471
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,900
You know

472
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,180
PLII has never disclosed an excessive identity

473
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,759
If the parties who open their love news are PLII

474
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
so what

475
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,620
so what

476
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,860
For a oil pipe blogger

477
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,880
Do you want to gamble your SEZ and the company?

478
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,040
is that so

479
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,980
You can't do it, I'll do it

480
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,280
I'm ready to report the materials right away

481
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,700
If you do this, I wo n’t stand by

482
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,140
What can you do

483
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,940
Do you have any way to solve this incident?

484
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,900
Choose

485
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,540
Explain according to what I said

486
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,500
Or leave Sez

487
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,899
So can't contact REVI now?

488
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,279
-= Special parking lot for knife surface =-

489
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,280

Today's date is canceled

491
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,180
He should be more stunned than me

492
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,560
Also there must be messy over there

493
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,679
Who is that guy

494
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,240
The last time there was this love news

495
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,260
Who is old and holding you and not let go

496
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,880
I think about it and I can't guess who it is

497
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,380
If you have any doubtful objects, you can grasp it to teach

498
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,459
Where are you now

499
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,839
I am at the door now

500
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,900
I am passing

501
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,100

Are you here?

-Dad yet -Haven't you come yet?

505
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,700

Why don’t you come yet?

507
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,880
Not

508
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,380
No one, but in order to prevent it

509
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,580
Um

510
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
Thanks

511
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,020
What is the company's situation now

512
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,860
You know what you can't change

513
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,380
Sometimes I don't know but it's better

514
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,140
I have to know some

515
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,600
What can I do?

516
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
please

517
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,600
Tell me all

518
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,620
Aidou has love news

519
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,440
You probably know what will happen?

520
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,880
Almost

521
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,200
Revi is Aidou

522
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,000
More strike

523
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,180
If it is not solved as soon as possible, it will become more and more troublesome

524
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,540
So what to do

525
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
I don't know

526
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,580
Revi refuses to explain

527
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,840
If the duration is too long

528
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,640
May be fired

529
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,660
I plan to close the door home?

530
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,200
Store?

531
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,800
These flies disappeared for a while before they disappeared

532
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,880
Where did this smell the taste?

533
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,340
sorry

534
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,700
Blame me

535
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,819
Need not

536
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,060
There are no guests in the store without opening the store

537
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,220
Take this opportunity to travel

538
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,020
Thanks to a group of flies, I can go on vacation

539
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,040
The president may be closed today

540
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,000
Goodbye next time

541
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,540
Are you alright

542
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,040
to be honest

543
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,380
I'm scared

544
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,080
Because everyone has encountered difficulties

545
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,160
I'm afraid of this

546
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,520
Chinese bead

547
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,380
It's hard to defeat yourself in life

548
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,080
To guard each other

549
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,300
Only in this way can you defeat

550
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,360
So don't feel guilty

551
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,860
How are you?

552
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,880
Choose

553
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,480
According to the explanation I said

554
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,820
Or leave Sez

555
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,400
If the duration is too long

556
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,400
May be fired

557
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,100
You have the ability to make the people around you unfortunate

558
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,540
I want to sing my song all the time

559
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,780
Listen to this song

560
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,380

Where is it

565
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,100
Is the fate that stars need to bear

566
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,420
It's equivalent to the weight of the crown

567
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,040
Can you still say this?

568
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,540
Are you okay?

569
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:22,240
It's chaotic during the day and it's quiet now

570
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,380
Sorry for me, blame me

571
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,040
You have a lot of problems

572
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,040
The biggest problem is this

573
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,920
Why to bear everything alone

574
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,500
This is not your business but our business

575
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,760
What needs us to solve together

576
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,760
So don't think of one person to bear it alone

577
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,340
Taoist country

578
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,520
Um

579
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,680
Thanks

580
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,540
Thanks

581
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,880
Everything

582
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,120
Before me

583
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,940
Sing with me

584
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,060
like me

585
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,640
Everything

586
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,780
This kind of words are generally used to say goodbye

587
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,160
What happened to you will scare me

588
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,920
Before the matter is calm

589
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,700
I feel that I can’t meet again recently

590
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,840
Want to say these to you

591
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,440
deeply appreciated

592
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,820
Hello everyone, I am PLII

593
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:52,520
-= Love Playing Song =-

594
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,539
How can you hide your family

595
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,979
How can you? Hanzhu

596
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,839
Didn’t you say that you will not escape anymore in the future

597
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,979
Why do you have to give up now

598
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,939
Because everyone will be destroyed

599
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,979
That's not a lover but an enemy

600
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,239
What should Hanzhu do

601
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,599
Let go of Hanzhu

602
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,359
I will definitely find a way

603
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,220
Do you have to go too on the road that will fail?

604
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,700
I can only be a burden on your side

605
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,259
There is you in my dream too

606
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,679
Can't Hanzhu still can't contact?

607
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,899
This is the best choice

608
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,140
Chinese bead

609
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,580
found it
