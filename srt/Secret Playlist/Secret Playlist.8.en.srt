Let's do it here

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,680
This is right

44
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,480
Why do you say so suddenly

45
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,990
I'm so happy recently

If I am by your side, you can't fly higher

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,920
For you, I'm burden

We really met to prepare for the album

51
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,140
It has nothing to do with this

52
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,440

Go to Seoul to sing the song I like again

93

I believe these words are desperately persisted

94

00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,930
Hanzhu is all nine years old

She is the child's mother who has emotions

107
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,180
What emotions can she abandon her flesh and blood

108
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,220

After a few years, the news came like this

112
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,540
My brother is the most pitiful to raise the child by himself

113
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,730
Why does it become like this at a young age

114
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,200
It seems to be hit by the car that escaped by the accident when the performance was performed

115

Oh a bad woman

116

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,820
I actually have something to say this time when I come back

129
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,910
I have been playing music with my dad

130
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Like a mother

131
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,340
I know it's all on the news

132
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,720
Then why don't you say anything

133
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,890
Either ask me if this is true

134
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,640
Either angrily, how can I treat you so much

135
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,190
What should I say?

136
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,150
You must have your reason

137
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,450
You should be tired today

138
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,030
Go back to rest

139
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,490
Do you know why I never told my dad?

140
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,630
Because I have no confidence to see my father's back

141
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,800
My mother cried alone all night. Dad would only escape like this

142
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,340
You ignore her

143
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,130
Is this a family?

144
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,260
How can family members do this

145
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,310
You should ask at least once, at least once, at least once

146
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,310
But father

147
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,770
She gave up my dream for me

148
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,490
what can I say

149
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,619
So you have to ask her more

150
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,820
She gave up her dream for dad

151
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:25,660
Mom ended here for nine years

152
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,210
Why do you think this is

153
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,170
Mom has only dad

154
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,509
Dad has grandma and aunt

155
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,470
But mom really only has dad

156
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,680
Dad ignored her

157
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,680
So my mother lost her dream

158
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,430
Also lost the family

159
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,900
Get away from my mother from me

160
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,900
Not a mother's dream

161
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,440
But dad

162
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040

163
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,000

We try to delete the romantic atmosphere

173

How about changing the style like this

174

This is too much, it is completely different songs

Don't say it anymore

00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,000
This song is not made casually

189
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,300
It's hard

190
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,220
Our songs that are hard to make

191
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,800
Do you really want to watch it be destroyed?

192
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,970
Do you really want this

193
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,890
What I want is

194
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,520
Hurry up to solve the current situation

195
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,400
As long as it can be solved

196
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,780
It doesn't matter what the song becomes like

197
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,070
Don't deliberately say what hurts people

198
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,540
I won't shake it for this

199
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,160
Chinese bead

200
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:55,750
Ready to the recording and contact me

201
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,240
-= Thanks

202
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,950
-= Hanzhu Diary =-

203
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,630
Do you want me to stand here all the time

204
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,760
Why are you suddenly here

205
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,440
It's so late, the company staff came to my house

206
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,980
How do I understand this

207
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,110
I submitted resignation

208
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,990
What

209
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,910
I don't need to continue to stay in the old -fashioned company

210
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,080
Then you are not as a staff member

211
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,720
You let go of Hanzhu

212
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,000
I returned to South Korea for Hanzhu

213
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,060
Compared to other goals

214
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,100
I want Hanzhu more

215
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,150
This means

216
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,110
I like it more so you let you open it, right?

217
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,020
You

218
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,870
What did you give up for Han Zhu

219
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,660
Don't let go of the things in your hand at all

220
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,450
I want to get more

221
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,500
This is your greed

222
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,710
Don't you know

223
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,960
If you have always been Revi

224
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,940
The two of you can never be publicly disclosed

225
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,020
It seems that you are safe and sound

226
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,850
I thought you would cry at home and cry

227
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,830
Do you want me to cry now?

228
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
forget it

229
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,980
I have something to say to you

230
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,329
This is formed like this

231
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,710
Cunning

232
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,629
After plagiarism, there are 100,000 subscribers

233
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,960
Cui Chengtai came to me a while before

234
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,300
I think the guy feels wrong

235
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,620
I feel that he knows you are playing music

236
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,380
Ouch, brother to pick you up

237
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,100
Not this

238
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,810
What

239
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,270
And he asked where you are doing part -time job

240
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,110
Now you just doubt it, right?

241
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,530
No evidence

242
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,570
If not

243
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,200
Just change evidence

244
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,379
Cui Chengtai, a damn garbage

245
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,040
I want to kill him

246
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,330
He will never let him go this time

247
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,250
You go quoted Cui Chengtai over

248
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,470
The rest are given to us to solve

249
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,410
Senior is hot, right?

250
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,579
What do you say

251
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,780
I know all you know, just talk about it

252
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,199
Brother Zhien really doesn't know what you are talking about

253
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,820
Song Hanzhu and Revi

254
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,040
Do you don't need their follow -up reports

255
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,520
I have a big melon

256
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,390
what do you want

257
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,519
Let Song Hanzhu recognize his identity

258
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,249
Nothing pretends to pretend to be noble every day

259
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,700
Really upside down

260
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,540
This is the same as my brother's idea

261
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,120
So what is the melon

262
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,040
Before that, I wanted to hear the exact answer

263
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,560
This will be uploaded to the hot youTube, right?

264
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,479
Of course

265
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,360
Brother will completely break them down in the name of coffee fever

266
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:10,169
So you are hot, right?

267
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,940
yes

268
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,830
What you see is the true face of coffee fever

269
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,280
What to install

270
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,780
Who are you

271
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,450
I am asking who you are

272
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,449
I will always shoot

273
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,530
Don't think about moving your brains

274
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,400
Damn

275
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,579
So what do you want to do

276
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,080
So far, all the videos you upload are deleted

277
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,929
Not only mine

278
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,900
Other people's videos must also be deleted

279
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,790
If I say no

280
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,929
Then there's no way

281
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,180
Exposure your true face gives you as a meal to the black fans

282
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,770
You know the things later, right?

283
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,080
Just delete the video, right?

284
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,500
Also apologize

285
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,830
What

286
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,610
People who have insulted you before

287
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,370
Then we pretend not to know your true face

288
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,110
I want to ask a question

289
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,430
Why do you put forward this requirement

290
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,050
Just expose it directly

291
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,520
I want to bury you directly according to my mood

292
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,560
But then I won't become happy

293
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,980
You are scolded and you can't bring me comfort

294
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,090
Hello, I am a hot hot

295
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,409
Due to my mistakes judgment and behavior

296
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:43,570
I really apologized to PLII and Revi, which have been affected by the recent scandal

297
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,470
madman

298
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,850
Make your hair like this

299
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:56,169
The guy's hair should be pulled out on the playground

300
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,829
And dragging his mouth down and cut into pieces

301
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,830
Shenxi

302
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,220
alright

303
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,050
Chinese bead

304
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,440
Too beautiful

305
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,449
Who combed your hair so shiny

306
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,770
Can be slippery

307
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,420
So shiny

308
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,200
It's a comb, not you

309
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,890
I am sad

310
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,150
let me see

311
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,900
Then the scourge of my break has been solved by me

312
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,299
I want to lose my temper to you

313
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,960
You can't do something guilty to you

314
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,200
I am leaving

315
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,940
Thank you for your sincerity

316
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
What do you say

317
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,009
Fortunately, they were solved

318
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,010
That is to say

319
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,830
But how could you think of putting other videos also let him get off the shelf

320
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,760
I just feel like that to do that

321
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,070
genius

322
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,880
Have you seen the video

323
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,890
Thanks to you don’t have to recording

324
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,910
Is that a good thing?

325
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,810
What do you want to do our album?

326
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,760
Although this time spent peace this time

327
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,090
But there may be such a thing again

328
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,960
Those who follow us have become a lot

329
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,840
Then follow your wishes

330
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,480
But you have to know

331
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,920
No matter what choices I make

332
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,110
What kind of result

333
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,280
Don't blame you

334
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,860
It is the decision I made for myself

335
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,380
Now you know

336
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,160
-= Li Daoguo =-

337
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,480
What do you suddenly come here?

338
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,410
If you want to say that unknown album

339
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,900
elder brother

340
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,900
Let me graduate

341
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,740
What

342
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,740
Feel time

343
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,860
Are you now because of that talent like this

344
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,639
Trainee's 5 -year debut 7 -year contract 12 years

345
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,450
You came here like this

346
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,540
But you actually give up here for a person

347
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,060
It's because of myself

348
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,060
Prescribed

349
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,450
My debut is my dream is all of mine

350
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,450
That really has never changed at once

351
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,280
But I have a new dream now

352
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,260
But because of this people's pain

353
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,240
I realize that this is not a dream that can be possessed together

354
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,720
I realize that I should stand up myself

355
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,769
I have seen a lot of people like you

356
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,560
This is just the wind that blows

357
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,850
You will definitely regret

358
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,700
I'm ready

359
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,130
Obviously you can see the failure of the failure

360
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,440
You have to leave, right?

361
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,540
You know

362
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:07,150
As long as I make up my mind, I will do the end

363
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,660
I want to embark on a new way

364
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,070
Thank you for this time

365
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,249
No matter what choices I make

366
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,499
What kind of result

367
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,250
Don't blame you

368
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,180
It is the decision I made for myself

369
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,580
Chinese bead

370
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,270
Chinese bead

371
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,740
aunt

372
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,170
Chinese bead

373
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,770
The users you dial for temporarily no one answered

374
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,649
The hospital called

375
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,980
There was a traffic accident at the intersection

376
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,480
Mr. Song Zhentai

377
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,540

378
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,570
Is there

379
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,900
-= Patient's name Song X Tai =-

380
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,340
You are here

381
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,750
How to make an accident

382
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:43,430
It's just slipping when I take a takeaway

383
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,990
Why should Dad send takeaway

384
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,990
Do you want to see your daughter get angry?

385
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,420
In order to fill in you

386
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,380
What

387
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,079
Seoul's house prices are not ordinary expensive

388
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,600
So I want to fill in you

389
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,700
Just go to part -time job

390
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,120
Why suddenly want

391
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,650
Can't always stay at my sister's house, right?

392
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,370
I have never said that I can't say

393
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:18,420
Should I see a lot

394
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,490
Real

395
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,820
Why is it like this

396
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,080
What happened to dad?

397
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,959
Then I really become a person

398
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,510
Haven't you considered these

399
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,629
Do you want your daughter to turn your daughter into an orphan?

400
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,510
How can you say that?

401
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,820
I was almost scared to death

402
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,280
Afraid of my dad left me

403
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,560
I'm really scared

404
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,150
Why is it like this

405
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,630
What are you crying?

406
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,410
Dad is sorry for you

407
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,370
do not Cry

408
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,660
Hanzhu's father is injured, now I have been in the hospital now

409

410

411
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,859
I seemed to think at the time

412

00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,520
I can't help you now

414
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:20,100
In this way, we pass through our own long tunnel

416
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,540
-= During the recording =-

417
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:47,190
I can't hide my heart

418
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,970
I don't want to show it either

419
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,120
But what should I do if I have trapped

420
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,570
Just look at you

421
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,180
Don't read lyrics

422
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,000
like you

423
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,740
Although shy

424
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,550
But it cannot be hidden

425
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,129
Sing very feeling

426
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,530
But can you take a shot?

427
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,840
Do you want to drink some water?

428
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,669
Why are you getting angry?

429
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,590
Do you know how many times have you recorded?

430
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,660
If you are in this state, cancel this song, right?

431
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,620
I will definitely complete within today

432
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,950
Agreed

433
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,910
Rest meeting

434
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,990
I didn't expect him to be so severe

435
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,470
do you know

436
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,890
You brought that person here

437
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,880
-= Two months ago =-

438
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,510
Do you really want to leave the company?

439
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,570
After the brothers are retiring, they only participate in SEZ activities

440
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,070
So you have to meet a better person

441
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,170
Accumulate better experience

442
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,760
I have told your company to your post

443
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,240
How can my brother be like this

444
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,099
When I first worked with my brother

445
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,030
You don't say we will work together for a lifetime

446
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,580
Brother's acting in the entertainment industry depends on me?

447
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,209
Speaking of which

448
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,060
Are those who say casually?

449
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,670
For brother

450
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,690
Am I just a normal agent who passed by?

451
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,980
It's not that I don't mean that

452
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,510
This is for your future

453
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,520
My future depends on you

454
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,630
How can a person only care about themselves

455
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,920
Sorry, sorry

456
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,819
Wait for me

457
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,739
Li Daoguo's entertainment industry life

458
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,880
Responsible for my Linhe Town

459
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,100
Have you sorted everything?

460
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,730
Thank you for this time

461
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,210
It's a pity that you are about to have some feelings for you

462
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,249
What do you want to do in the future

463
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,270
have no idea

464
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,290
Start think about it now

465
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,710
Hello

466
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,060
What happened to me suddenly

467
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:04,509
I heard that your dream was to open a company

468
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,619
is that so

469
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,620
yes

470
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,730
Indeed

471
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,780
That dream will be realized by my brother to help you realize

472
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,490
You know

473
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,590
My brother just resigned from the company not long ago

474
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,299
Because the financial advisory market is very popular in this matter

475
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,479
But the love points we have accumulated

476
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,929
I want to give you the first chance to invite my brother

477
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:31,659
I don't seem to need that kind of opportunity

478
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,399
You know that my brother is not very sensible

479
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,049
But people are still very kind

480
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,259
Although there is no common sense, people are still very kind

481
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,429
Although there is no degree of doing things

482
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,430
But people are really kind

483
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,760
Drink it

484
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,540
I think I feel awesome

485
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,660
Go, go as a boss

486
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,500
You really watch it every day

487
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,970
Is there any news?

488
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,000
nothing

489
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,000
This has become a habit

490
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,250
It's all about letting you put it

491
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,820
What's the matter, why did the gypsum be removed so quickly

492
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,650
Um, I don’t wear it

493
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,450
Dad is fine

494
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,070
That's what the doctor said the calculation, put it on soon

495
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,670
Chinese bead

496
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,370
Talk to my dad

497
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,220
Actually dad

498
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,520
Once a fan of your mother

499
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,570
And it is the number one fan

500
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,199
Listen to the side ear

501
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,999
The wave of waves last summer

502
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,220
Like your story

503
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:32,500
Rehabilitation quietly

504
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,420
Waiting for your performance is great

505
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,269
I am fascinated by your mother's singing

506
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,070
I followed each show

507
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,820
You

508
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:09,000
Then I prepared such a big bouquet and took it to find her

509
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,049
I told her that I would make an exclusive performance field

510
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,600
So marry me

511
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,350
I was 22 years old

512
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:27,600
He is a guy who has been to the army.

513
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,200
But you also know this thing in life

514
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,470
Bloody is not good

515
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:48,050
Your mother can't sing the songs that you want to sing

516
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,370
At that time I was really ...

517
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,020
I really want to run away

518
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,270
I am a noticeable person

519
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,450
Unbelievable husband

520
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:13,150
Can't always be a dad who is unbelievable again, right?

521
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,220
This is how your mother performed

522
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:26,919
There was a black cat before Hongda before

523
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,250
I don’t know if there is any more now

524
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,700
Song Hanzhu

525
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:45,900
What you do is worldwide music

526
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,000
Just do what you want to do

527
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,150
Over there

528

-= Black Cat =-

532
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:34,550
Dream fragments that cannot be retained

533
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:41,150
One piece and two pieces disappear

534
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,370
It seems to be turning in place

535
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:51,250
In the endless stingy

536
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,950
I also devoted to it today

537
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:08,070
Even if you know it is a lie

538
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,050
Cover up

539
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:24,219
A word mixed with sigh

540
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:32,220
As if it only contains my truth

541
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,470
Do you really don't come to the graduation ceremony?

542
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:20,770
Um

543
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,670
I don't want to go, I have to hear strange words

544
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,370
I'll get a graduation certificate in the department in the department for a while

545
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,119
knew

546
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,900
Then remember to come to graduate party later

547
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,320
good

548
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,049
Congratulations on you

549
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,800

What day is it today?

552
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:48,400
I heard that today is the graduation ceremony of Hongren University

553
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:51,370
However, there should be not many graduates in the later stage

554
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,050
Hanzhu also graduated this time

555
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,520
What's this

556
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,970
What's wrong

557
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,470
I found a strange thing

558
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,900
Recipients write lunatic

00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,150

561
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,760
-= Crazy collection =-

562
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:35,680
-= 2023 Summer Song Hanzhu & Li Daoguo's record =-

563
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,400

564
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,770
-Chot a photo of you -I'll take it for you

565
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:03,850
Chinese bead

566
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:08,320
found it

567
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,100
Hello

568
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,120
I haven't seen Hanzhu for a long time

569
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,720
do you know

570
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:17,770
I felt alive before it was like constantly debt

571
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,120
What grandma is this?

572
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,620
Some people cherish that I will make me feel uncomfortable

573
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,650
It is helpful to be troubled by others

574
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:32,620
So I decided not to be owed debt or owed others' debts

575
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:36,420
Just lock a person to shrink his life

576
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:39,020
But after meeting you

577
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,920
Throughout my armed forces

578
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:45,020
Accepted the heart that came to me quietly

579
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:46,300
Please give me this

580
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,550
Make me understand

581
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,150

582
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:51,650

583
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:54,170
PLII

584
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,320

585
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,050
Instead

586
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,400
Don't hide

587
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:05,520
Use everything to share it

588
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,820
Then what do you want to share with me

589
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,750
This gift is too simple, right?

590
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,500

00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:46,550
Wait a little first

596
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:47,969
Right

597
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:50,070
This kind of thing must be cautious

598
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,200

599
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,519

Pass up

606
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:27,300
You have a little different from the beginning

607
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:33,220
I don't know why my heart is attracted by you

608
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:38,570
Even if the mood has always been bad

609
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:44,570
But I gradually follow you to become cheerful

610
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:49,420
I can't hide my mind either

611
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:54,020
Although I also want to try to deny

612
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:00,250
But what can I do if I have trapped in

613
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:05,050

Although shy

616
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:17,270
But it can't be hidden

617
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,599
Even deny

618
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,300
