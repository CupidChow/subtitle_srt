4
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,250
Do you know the blogger named PLII

5
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,220
know a little

6
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,400
You contact her and take her to the company

7
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,420
But PLII

8
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,040
As far as I know, she has never revealed to the outside world

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,450
Just go to Taoism

10
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,930
This is the head of the Tao country

11
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,470
I still have an appointment

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,580
Can't say too long

13
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,020
What are you looking for me

14
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,620
You are PLII

15
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,300
Do you plan to continue hiding in the future?

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Do you understand

17
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,320
How can I not know

18
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,750
You use that performance every time

19
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,820
But know that I am a PLII

20
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,970
No one except you

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,700
Others can't know

22
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,120
So continue to keep secret for me in the future

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,850
If you have someone else to know except I

24
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,510
who

25
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:52,840
Revi

26
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,140
You seem to have misunderstood now

27
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,020
He used to misunderstand I am PLII

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,380
no

29
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,430
Although he doubt

30
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,100
But this matter has passed

31
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,300
-The later -I have already told the company

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,280
Revi will sign you into the company

33
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,440
I am here today because of that is also because of that

34
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,900
you

35
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,420
Have you known that I am PLII?

36
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,990
-Hhanzhu -turns out to know

37
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,330
How is this going

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,150
The instructions of the representative

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,580
Let me bring PLII into the company

40
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,170
Brother, you should not know who the PLII is

41
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,820
You know

42
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,710
Hanzhu is PLII

43
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,200
Yes

44
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,940
Then I ask you again

45
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,190
Are you here as an employee of our company or

46
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,910
As a man

47
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,010
If the former is the arbitrary behavior of ignoring the program

48
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,550
If the latter is mixed with private feelings in business

49
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,840
No matter which one is enough to be a problem, right?

50
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,320
Mixed private feelings in business

51
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,410
I'm sorry for this

52
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,360
The consequences of this I am willing to be responsible

53
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,850
I also have something to be curious

54
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,080
You have been around Hanzhu before

55
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,230
Is it because Hanzhu is PLII?

56
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,090
I am asking you if you use it

57
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,080
The kindness of the other party

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,420
I never thought of using her

59
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,440
That occasion is for Hanzhu

60
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,710
Create the occasion that it is inconsistent with the will of the parties

61
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,190
Is it really for that person?

62
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,390
I think you need to think about it again

63
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,380
Hello

64
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:43,980
haven't seen you for a long time

65
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,140
Chinese bead

66
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,510
Do you think I am that person like this?

67
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,370
Or you are interested in me

68
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,220
Interested in me

69
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,000
At first I thought you were PLII

70
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,240
But slowly I know

71
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,840
You are not PLII

72
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,140
Even if you are just Song Hanzhu

73
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,740
Also a good person

74
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,470
Don't like it

75
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,260
I look forward to you

76
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,990
I am very longing for you

77
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,760
Even if pretending not to draw a clear boundary

78
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,540
on the one hand

79
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,300
I still believe those words are sincere

80
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,690
Want to believe those words are sincere

81
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,310
Like a fool

82
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,470
Didn't you say you want that blogger to sign a contract with the company?

83
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,150
You can see people who can say whether to stamp

84
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,220
Isn't it a virtual person who keeps mysterious to us?

85
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,230
That thing is a bit complicated now

86
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,720
Can you give me some time again

87
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,550
What's so complicated by things

88
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,430
Is it so difficult to meet when you meet?

89
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,180
And if you want to sign a contract with our company

90
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,310
You shouldn't let you be an agent to come forward

91
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,850
Didn’t she even say this?

92
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,780
Yeah

93
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,230
It's not a PLII problem, it's my problem

94
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,900
So wait

95
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,020
Can you wait?

96
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,940
You can't

97
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,950
Haven't negotiated with that person, okay?

98
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,960
You who have no countermeasures

99
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,120
Yeah, you can't have any thoughts

100
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,150
Shina is waiting too much. What can I do?

101
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,750
Why suddenly mention her

102
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,500
where you go

103
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,170
You look very anxious

104
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,510
I'm going to find you

105
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:58,990
That happened

106
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,480
I just heard that you are with the representative

107
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,080
I'm going to find you

108
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,960
-The people you want to sign into the company -don't dream anymore

109
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,780
What

110
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,150
It is impossible to give you the PLII song, don't dream anymore

111
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,920
Is that person who let you say that

112
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,560
no

113
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,990
I plan to solve it with me

114
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,000
It is impossible to tell your business to PLII

115
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,200
How can I accept this

116
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,470
Is Hu Zuo who is similar to his former boyfriend?

117
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,600
You don't want to see me better

118
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,910
So I want to block my way, right?

119
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,990
whatever you think

120
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,870
No matter what you miss me in the future

121
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,030
I don't care anymore

122
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,390
Isn't it passive but actively stopped

123
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:54,860
elder brother

124
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,680
Although I don’t know if I can ask this question at this time

125
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,770
Then don't ask

126
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,330
-Plii is the intern sister -let you not ask you anymore

127
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,590
People can't say what they want to say

128
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,900
It seems that your reaction seems to be right

129
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,800
I really guess people's psychology

130
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,910
Then take this opportunity

131
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,660
Don't be a agent, go as a side to write a teacher, right?

132
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,560
Really

133
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,600
Where can I leave my brother?

134
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,030
elder brother

135
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,590
That's why you want to sign PLII to our company, right?

136
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,140
Love in the company will not be so easy to be discovered by the outside

137
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,360
What

138
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,820
No matter what

139
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,510
Our brother is so indifferent

140
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,810
Wait a minute

141
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,650
So the ex -girlfriend is now an ambiguous girl in the same company

142
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,320
Wow

143
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,660
What love drama are you filming?

144
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,040
This is not the case, this is the case, the situation

145
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,190
Don't be too advanced

146
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,690
I was rejected before I said my outlet

147
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:54,670
What

148
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,820
What does it mean

149
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,910
I am very happy if I look at you

150
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,030
Are you sorting out the files?

151
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,680
Yes PD

152
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,050
You can touch the fish on the last day

153
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,420
Everyone will say you because you are perfunctory

154
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,810
That's why I want to do it better because it's the last one

155
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,670
Who is the senior and who is the juniors

156
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,760
This time is working under such people

157
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,360
Really hard to you, Hanzhu

158
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,370
Who are such people?

159
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,480
You should be more clear at this point, right?

160
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,200
I don’t want to quarrel with you in front of Hanzhu on the last day

161
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,900
Oh, if you think it is good to perform on the last day

162
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,420
You are a good predecessor

163
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,250
Then she is also a fool

164
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,930
You are really

165
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,040
Can't see your two harmonious appearances in the future

166
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,120
It's the most regrettable

167
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,740
Hanzhu, you did not become slippery at first so quickly

168
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,920
It is really high to make people eat and eat

169
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,180
So on the last day, let's eat delicious food, right?

170
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,800
No matter what it is, it is great to be grand and gorgeous.

171
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,940
How about Hanzhu?

172
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:07,870
good

173
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,640
good

174
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,080
It's vinyl record

175
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,610
How much is these worth?

176
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,680
Superb

177
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,800
Whoops, the old soil is like seeing vinyl records for the first time

178
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,870
The first time I saw so much watching this is also vinyl records

179
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,010
It's okay to get wine and vegetables

180
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,700
If you are not enough, go outside and buy it.

181
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,580
-Thank you -Okay

182
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,310
I said it, please eat delicious food

183
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,170
I think of PD and say I like it here

184
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,640
So want to come together

185
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,330
Then I buy the most expensive wine here

186
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,700
-The boss -yes

187
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,550

I don't know you will come

208
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,840
I also suddenly received contact

209
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,080
The boss is here a set of tableware

210
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,740

217
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,990
Do you want to do it?

218
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,100
Why not sign

219
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,830
Do you want to draw your stroke

223
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,080
What is the decision to do?

224
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,830
Didn’t you say you won't do it?

225
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,350
Do you want to do?

226
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,200
Still don't do it anymore

227
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:23,770
Have to do it

228
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,390

Answer

231
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,600
Can't you get out of the trip?

232
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,610
I go out and buy some sobero

233
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,850
Feel you like this

234
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,160
I plan to say first

235
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,590
Is it fun

236
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,540
Looking at me who wants to hide desperately

237
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,070
Pretend not to know how to look at me

238
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,540
Is it fun

239
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,090
Is not fun

240
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,970
Not fun at all

241
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,210
Uncomfortable and uncomfortable

242
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,320
Then why do you keep pretending not to know

243
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,780
I'm afraid I won't see you again

244
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,790
If I honestly tell me, I know you are PLII

245
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,840
I'm afraid you will escape

246
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,380
so

247
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm afraid I won't see you anymore

248
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,500
So I hesitated

249
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,670
sorry

250
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,600
I really don't know

251
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,860
What you said

252
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,000
Which are sugar -coated artillery, which are true

253
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,180
I really don't know at all

254
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,160
No

255
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,210
I do not want to know

256
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,830
The more you want to know, the more you feel like you have become a fool

257
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,790
one person

258
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,670
It must be a purpose for another person

259
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,910
There is no reason for good intentions

260
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,510
I am certain

261
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,860
Knowing this, I still make me unable to lift my head like a fool

262
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:19,780
I'm still annoying

263
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,050
so

264
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,500
I hope you don't make me a fool anymore

265
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,320
please

266
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,660

I didn’t see you when I went to the interview

269
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,210
Just to commemorate the end of the internship period

270

Open a small celebration banquet

271
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,350

Um

302
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,670

304
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,020
Is there a music show starring in a singer, right?

305

How about it

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,240
What can I do?

307
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,030
It's very tired and ordinary

308
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,200
The stars are very bright when they are seen on TV

309
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,510
But real people are also very ordinary

310
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,270

317
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,550

379
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,580
After going, I have a tall blonde sister.

380
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,250
Open the party every day like that

381
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,000
I said it

382
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,530
Even if we want a different place

383
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,690
Also one day will meet again

384
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,090
You can only use this in the future

385
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,590
Hurry up and go away

386
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,320
Why can't the crazy boy say suddenly

387
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,940
I just don't want to go

388
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,040
Berkeley is not the name of the dog next door

389
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,460
I can't go if others want to go

390
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,460
Why don't you go through the exam and don't go?

391
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,320
Not want to go

392
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,930
I said I don't want to go

393
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,530
Don't say

394
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,430
Especially don't tell Song Hanzhu

395
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,910
If you dare to say it, you will go through

396
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,540
Is it a madman?

397
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:46,880
Hello

398
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,510
Do you know you always make the people around you unfortunately

399
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,050
Greeze with me for a long time

400
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,290
Why is it so aggressive

401
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,480
You can't just live in your own sloppy life

402
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,430
Why let the people around you lower the level and cooperate with you

403
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,620
what do you want to say in the end

404
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,450
Don't talk about the corner

405
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,480
Li Mocun

406
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,470
Why did he give up Berkeley because you gave up Berkeley

407
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,850
What

408
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,860
what do you mean

409
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,710
Did you ask if you don’t know?

410
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,030

412
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,090

Do you mean because of me?

414
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,130
Otherwise it is because of who

415
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,270
For you, this may be a warm and affectionate hometown

416
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,160
But for me

417
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,040
This is hell

418
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,860

After a beep, transfer to the voice mailbox for you

429
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,300
It's time to catch up with the plane

430

Safety arrives

441
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,120
Put your luggage behind the apartment

442
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,730
Walking

443
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,220
What kind of thought I thought back to China?

444
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,250
I heard that there are also many big companies that rush to ask you

445
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,790
Because she is still holding

446
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,090
What

447
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,550
I want to be later

448
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,620
Be with her again

449
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,580
What are you talking about?

450
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,680
-Doed you drinking -ah really

451
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,960
-Re Dao Guo -Zhen Shen

452
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,510
There is a tragedy famous song

453
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,890
-Lian quiet -you have to listen to the version of PLII cover

454
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,600
How did you go back to your hometown

455
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,430
ah

456
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,640
The internship is over

457
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,950
Come here if you have time

458
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,190
And you

459
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,600
me too

460
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,850
I'm busy at work, come back and see my family

461
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:33,850
ah

462
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,440
yes

463
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,740
What we do is the same job

464
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,400
But are you okay? Li Daoguo ...

465
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,790
No right is REVI

466
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,750
Isn't it a singer of your company?

467
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,520
After all, it's a company's business

468
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,260
There is no way to be fried

469
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:56,890
Even there are not there

470
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,900
There are many companies that can go to

471
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,410
What you just said

472
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,480
It sounds at employment students

473
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,850
If you are very obscure, do you know?

474
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,110
Don't you ask me?

475
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,660
Why do you say to you

476
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,670
Why do I go back to South Korea

477
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,160
What are you asking?

478
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,150
You also have your own ideas, right?

479
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,160
I don't think it's too late

480
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,710
If later

481
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,400
I'm afraid I really can't see you anymore

482
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,980
I'm afraid I will never see you again

483
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,350
If I tell you the truth, I know you are PLII

484
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,930
I'm afraid you will escape

485
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,340
so

486
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,100
I'm afraid I will never see you again

487
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,750
Have a place

488
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,260
If you make a mistake, it must be

489
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,600
Have you turned back?

490
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,360
Be careful on the road

491
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,150
The same to you

492
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,280
Did the two of you re -associate?

493
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,710
I ask you if you are reunited

494
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,510
End is the end

495
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,400
Why can't I be entangled

496
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,940
Even if you have this hobby

497
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,680
Isn't it too much?

498
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,050
Hello

499
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,850
I don't care about others

500
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,140
But how can you say this to me

501
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,880
The person who talked to me at the time was you

502
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,220
Did I lie?

503
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,000
Still threatening you to break up

504
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,910
no

505
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,140
That's your choice

506
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,340
Just like your mother to your uncle

507
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:40,570
Don't want to hear you say that you have given up your dream for you

508
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,970
I don't want to be responsible, so I ran away, right?

509
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,200
I'm so entangled now

510
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,650
Don't you think it's too murderous?

511
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,200
You are worried about what you have to do

512
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:53,740
What

513
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm afraid I will reconcile with him

514
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,140
Are you afraid of yourself?

515
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,540
Don't talk nonsense

516
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,050
This is how to do

517
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,450
Even if he and I do not return to good

518
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,000
I don't necessarily give you this opportunity

519
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,940
Is this my fault?

520
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,800
very nice

521
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,420
Can you drink so much, do you still drink so much?

522
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,420
How could those who could still stay in the blood vessels

523
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,420
The metabolism is all discharged

524
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,020
Boss, I want to eat conch noodles today

525
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,220
Please come to a conch noodle

526
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,450
You should let your aunt see what you look like now

527
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,450
Didn't I say

528
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,800
If you dare to tell my mother, I will kill you

529
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,770
So why do you want to see me today

530
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,880
Rejected, right?

531
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,370
What do you refuse

532
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,770
I'm sorry, haven't confessed yet?

533
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,170
Feel sorry

534
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,850
How did you know

535
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:03,740
Obviously

536
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,170
Um, our company's printers know all

537
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,230
-= Kailin Noodles =-

538
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,510
Say you want to send you a faxes and say this matter

539
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,370
What the printer knows, she doesn't believe it

540
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,080
What does it mean

541
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,740
I did something wrong, she thought I was a liar

542
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,200
This is true

543
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,600
I see people are really accurate

544
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,540
I know she is very smart

545
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,740
People who rub the powder on their faces cannot easily believe

546
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,710
Can it be a little serious?

547
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,880
I really don’t know who I should tell you to find you

548
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
sorry

549
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,000
sorry

550
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,020
I'm really sorry for my aunt's son

551
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,450
I answered you seriously

552
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,680
I have a way

553
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,370
any solution

554
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,020
Ask her

555
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,510
Ask her

556
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,140
Just as you have no feet

557
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,020
Seek her

558
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,650
Desperate to ask her

559
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,880
Make your palms through your palms

560
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,250
Just ask her

561
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,450
is that so

562
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,600
Do you really ask her

563
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,220
People who know I am PLII

564
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,450
only you

565
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,250
Isn't there anyone who knows except me?

566
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,420
Who is

567
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,940
Revi

568
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,620
But how do you know

569
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,310
There should be a lot of bees around PLII

570
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,250
-= PLII should have a lot of bees around. Because your voice is very similar to honey. =-
Because your voice is very much like honey

571
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,450
-= I like your song very much to shoot the wall
My house has become a small apartment! =-

572
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,620
I like your song very much to shoot the wall

573
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,450
My house has become a small apartment

574
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:23,200
-= You are really perfect. =-

575
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,800
You are really perfect

576
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,200
Every video of this person has a message

577
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,220
-= Doralee =-

578
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,080
Is it a guitar?

579
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,920
-= Practice the 79th day of the guitar =-

580
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,340

582
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,540
Who is it so late?

583
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,080
Who is

584
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,130
Do you open the door casually?

585
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,000
what's wrong with you

586
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,750
How to find here

587
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,240
All of the same company

588
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,420
Talk about work

589
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,400
By the way, see you

590
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,640
So come here

591
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,200
This is not a visit but a break in

592
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,930
Hurry up before I get angry

593
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,130
Will the guests just drive away when they come?

594
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,020
Too too much

595
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,350
I haven't invited you, which guest, you are a guest

596
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,000
If you don't leave, I will call someone

597
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,770
What's wrong

598
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:09,130
Want to see the news of Shiya often in and out of Revi's house?

599
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:12,950
Don't sit on?

600
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,550
I like to stay here

601
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,020
After speaking

602
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,330
Let's cooperate with a project together

603
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,600
What

604
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,370
You are preparing an album

605
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,910
I am about to release the album

606
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,350
Is it a win -win situation?

607
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,640
Are you throwing?

608
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,200
broke up

609
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,260
In the future, I am a colleague encouraged to each other

610
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,330
right

611
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,150
He is as ambitious as you

612
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,730
Go to the world, so I want to see the world more

613
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,400
Who does he associate with me in the future, it has nothing to do with me

614
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,750
so what

615
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,310
Do you come to me like a blanket that has leaked the air?

616
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,770
Why not do it?

617
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,330
Actually the little blogger's song

618
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,330
It doesn't matter if you can't get it

619
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,170
Is she amazing?

620
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:04,910
Then what

621
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:11,280
This happened

622
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,420
I feel that our relationship can return to the past

623
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,930
senior

624
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,330
Filial piety

625
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,800
I no longer like you anymore

626
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:32,000
I didn't know how to work hard to become a suitable person for you

627
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,880
Accept your repeated impermanence

628
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,860
But I won't be in the future

629
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,680
So don't find it suddenly in the future

630
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,930
She is not a little blogger nor

631
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,880
She sings better than you

632
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,420
Can write songs than you

633
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,220
More handsome than you

634
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,930
You are not qualified to say this

635
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,080
Li Daoguo

636
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,800
I'm writing songs

637
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,730
Can you leave?

638
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,710
my waist

639
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,570

What's wrong

642
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:33,200
The last time I stepped on the bad headphones

643
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,350
Is it expensive to outrageous headphones?

644
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:37,440
Um

645
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,600
How many people in South Korea have that headset

646
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,460
Who knows

647
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,600
It's expensive and limited edition

648
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,860
It should be a chaebol or an artist or something, right?

649
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,200
