NA card is my dream company

38

After finding a job, remember to invite me for dinner

I haven't interviewed yet

40
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,870
I can definitely be admitted

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,049
If you can't get a test

42
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,710

-= Forexter to ask the NA card final interview =-

44
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,150
As long as you have passed the current threshold

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,940
Can be a good adult

46
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,700
So everything will get better

47
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,859
I thought so

48
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,040
When I was in college, I still had a minor major

49
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,830
I have been a sales for five years

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,490
It is a good opportunity to me

51
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,049
And now it is also a good opportunity for me

52
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,040
Can change my life

53
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,889
Sorry Song Hanzhu

-= Interview member =-
We seem to have always asked one person

55
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,350
Nothing

56
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,560
The credits are very high in language scores

57
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,340
Self -introduction is well written well

58
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,280
But the key is that it is not interesting

59
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,199
When choosing a marketer

60
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,429
Compared to the resume of the well

61
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,950
The characteristics that value more prominent

62
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,949
For example, is this person creative

63
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,790
Do not pay attention to this field and have it enthusiastic

64
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,540
Although this candidate is very serious

65
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,040
But it seems that I don't have a great interest in this field

66
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,550
Why do you apply for our company

67
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,429
Why can the application company still

68
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,469
Just to make money

69
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,930
I will ask these useless things

70
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,600
Is it amazing to go to a big business?

71
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,189
Forget it, that kind of place

72
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,190
Don't go if you are admitted

73
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,310
Let me do it

74
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,439
Forget your rest today

75
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
There are not many customers

76
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,440
Look at that person is not here now

77
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,570
Who is

78
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,780
I didn't expect him to persist very much

79
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,120
What's wrong

80
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,530
Rich and unemployed travelers

81
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Is it unemployed to travel with people?

82
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,870
Did you find PLII?

83
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,330
I didn't find it

84
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,380
To be precise, I found someone like PLII

85
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,090
what does that mean

86
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,590
I don't know it's like this

87
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,680
That is guess

88
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,890
Shouldn't you look for certain evidence anymore?

89
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,650
yes

90
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,480
What's wrong with what

91
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,900
Why do you think Plii hides his identity

92
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,740
that

93
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,530
I don't know either

94
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,610
look

95
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,700
We don't know what she needs to hide her identity

96
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,620
Shouldn't find her out directly, right?

97
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,670
It looks a bit like extreme fanatic fans

98
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,249
Why are you suddenly sensible

99
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,130
This is the attitude that mature fans should have

100
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,650
Pride for you Li Daoguo

I will let you participate in musicals or original soundtrack

114

I can still send you to KTV

115

That is to say, the meaning of multiple angles

120
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,029
So you also need to do your future

I resumed my fans and let me eat with my friends

257
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,419
Didn't he ask me what to do for you?

258
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,689
I said that after my sweat bead participated in the study team

259
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,999
Do part -time jobs if you are too late to eat

260
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,049
So it would be better to send some snacks

261
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,210
I only said these

262
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,390
But I still have to eat his face

263
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,600
I didn't expect it to be like this

264
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,770
So why should he ask you that kind of question

265
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,980
That must be interested in you

266
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,690
What

267
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,560
Otherwise why ask that kind of question?

268
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,900
and

me

271
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,660
You still asked Revi why he was shy to study again

272
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,699
Not because it is because

273
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,200
So you have to cheer

274
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,550
It is hard to be interested in yourself for your favorite artists

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,600

It's not that he asked me if you have any difficulties recently

289
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,610
I said that our Hanzhu is painful because of acute gastritis

290
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,549
But I didn’t expect that he would send you a rolling cabbage juice

297
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,549
I bought it myself

298

okay, I get it

Probably a few people

307
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,659
I didn't tell me

308
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,449

It seems that there is something important for you

Well with you

317
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,980
After all, there are many people who are uncomfortable

318
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,640
If you have no guest, you are not tired at work

319
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,739
Do you know how much it costs a day here?

320

600,000 won

321
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,630
It is much cheaper than my expectations

322
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:37,390
Do you think I am that talent like this?

323
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,480
Is it interested in me?

324
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,340
What

325
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,570
This is not

326
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,279
Then I don’t understand why you are like this now

327
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,929
Give those who have no relationship

328
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,079
Spend money to come to her

329
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,689
You have never thought of standing in her position

330
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,670
Will it be very uncomfortable and burdened?

331
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,260
no

332
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,439
I just want to get closer to you

333
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,689
So why are you close to me

334
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,690

335
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,670
I am interested in me

336
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,810
Although our first acquaintance is a bit embarrassing

337
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,100
But you are the first friend I have made in my university

338
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,430
So I want to be closer to you

339
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,500
I never thought this would make you feel burden

340
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,990
Feel sorry

341
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,660
-If will I have a burden in the future, I will be careful -no need

342
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,670
Don't do anything

343
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Why

344
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,950
Why can't I do anything

345
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,030
Recently people say

346
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,100
The artist is the emerging nobleman

347
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,180
I am still wondering what it means

348
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,910
But I understand when I see you

349
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,599
I go to school like you simply for someone who is interested in

350
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,090
Group homework is like playing games at home

351
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,800
But for me, it is the reality of suffocation

354
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:13,750
So I don't want to play with you to spend money on the game of every family

355
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100

00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,759
Make friends with strangers in the new semester

374
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,650
How do you pay

375
00:23:56,651 --> 00:23:58,299
Is that important now?

376
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,329
What are you going to do?

377
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,669
Are you not ready albums?

378
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,070
You tell the company that the album is ready to stop for a while first

379
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,140
Hello

380
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,660
Brother said to stop for a while

381
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,980
Laugh

382
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,440
No matter what you happen, you have to complete the album

383
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,409
Li Daoguo's guy

384
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,940
Regardless of persuading him to threaten him to hit him

385
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,460
No matter what the method is used, I have to take the album to my eyes

386
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,230
Do you understand

387
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,810
Didn’t you see it last time?

388
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,060
Revi doesn't listen to us at all

389
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,759
I got a few times in a row

390
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,640
Just do whatever you want

391
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,400
When to endure him?

392
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,849
But the song is really a bit rotten

393
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,960
I don't feel attentive

394
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,630
I just left like that on the way to recording

395
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,010
This is completely ignored us

396
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,999
I don’t want to assist Revi anymore

397
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,310
It's really limited

398
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,320
so be it

399
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,770
Let the old lady go

400
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,500
The newcomer who starts to work tomorrow

401
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,469
But okay?

402
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,169
I heard that he graduated from Berkeley Conservatory

403
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,929
Let him wipe his butt at the beginning

404
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,459
Do you want to wipe

405
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,190
OK

406
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:43,770
What is that person called

407
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,440
-= Li Mocun =-
Li Mocun

408
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,680
Well, I just arrived

409
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,300
I plan to go to a place first before passing

410
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,669
What happened to you

411
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,169
After drinking, I fell on the stairs

412
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,250
It is said to be hospitalized for at least three weeks

413
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,359
So group homework should not be done anymore

414
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,369
What should I do

415
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,519
Is it a problem for group homework now?

416
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,460
Are you OK

417
00:27:45,461 --> 00:27:46,709
Just make a plaster

418
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,270
It's good to be alive

419
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,440
Feel sorry

420
00:27:50,441 --> 00:27:53,489
It's okay, I'll find someone else

421
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,229
I asked the assistant

422
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,759
The rest is a bit

423
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
What's wrong

424
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,090
Who is left

425
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,980
Li Daoguo Cui Shengtai

426
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,259
Xinyi

427
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,469
You last semester with Cui Shengtai, right?

428
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,470
Hello

429
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,309
He is absolutely not good

430
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,549
That guy pretend to be a person in front of his classmates seduce

431
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,390
Pass the scandal behind the back without acceptance

432
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,000
I should expose him at that time

433
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,590
Otherwise, what about Revi?

434
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,519
Xinyi, I said it last time

435
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,779
Isn't that meaning not that

436
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,550
It's really only him left

437
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,009
Don't add personal feelings

438
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,360
Just cooperate

439
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,679
As a team

440
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,339
No, he can't do it

441
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,219
I look at it myself and look for it.

442
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,310
Rest

443
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Um

444
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,429
Hanzhu, do you need a team member?

445
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,180
Damn to scare me

446
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,479
What's wrong this time

447
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,770
Just say something if you say something

448
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:26,100
I'm afraid I will have a burden after I finish talking

449
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,310
You follow me now to make me more burden

450
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,480
no

451
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,720
I think you seem to need a team member

452
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,560
How about with me

453
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,180
Will you do PPT?

454
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,180
what is that

455
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,010
Don't you know PPT

456
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,190
Need to know

457
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,370
That's why I don't do it with you

458
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
P ..

459
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,700
P ..

460
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,899
Although I don't know what it is

461
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,499
But I also say that people who do it

462
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,389
I really won't give you a little burden

463
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,569
Will not make trouble

464
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,770
I am confident

465
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,450
Feed over there

466
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,089
What is their relationship

467
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:06,750
That is to say

468
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:07,820
Why are you together?

469
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,310
what happened

470
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,399
You are a great burden and disturbing people for me now

471
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,469
I'm finished what you want to say

472
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,480
I am leaving

473
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,340
Is the eyes opened too much?

474
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Chinese bead

475
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,360
Hello Hanzhu

476
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,299
Hello senior

477
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,949
I heard from the teaching assistant just now

478
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,200
Xinyi is hospitalized

479
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,570
Is it serious?

480
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,959
She said that she would recover soon after receiving treatment

481
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,750
Ah, that's fine

482
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,220
By the way, what to do if your group homework

483
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,770
That
Do you want to do it with your brother?

484
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,100
It happened that my brother is also looking for a team member

485
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,389
I even have test scores

486
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,539
Thank you for your proposal

487
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,730
Let me think about the operation of the group

488
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Mr. REVI

489
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,509
I don't want to steal this

490
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,680
It is for group operation for a while

491
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,880
But who are you

492
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,350
I am Li Mocun

493
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,349
It's a trainee

494
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,349
Practicing growth is so outstanding

495
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,259
It's so enthusiastic about practicing so late

496
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,030
Thank you for your praise

497
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,730
I am not a trainee

498
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:41,930
You are

499
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:45,100
I am the new employee of Group A & R this time

500
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,230
I just want to go to you privately

501
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,730
I just met like this

502
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,200
Why do you meet me

503
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,820
I heard you refuse to recording

504
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,980
Can you ask?

505
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,840
You didn't hear from your colleagues

506
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,619
The song is too bad

507
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,589
Then you tell me the style of the song you want

508
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,200
I will do my best to find similar songs

509
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:15,470
Do you have no style you want?

510
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,939
No special requirements

511
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,609
Just blindly oppose the company's opinions

512
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,759
I think it is to oppose it

513
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,260
This is generally called a prestige in the society

514
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,699
You mean I am a blessing in the company

515
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,430
It looks like that according to social concepts

516
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,900
OK

517
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,540
I originally wanted to sort out a one -time saying

518
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,970
There is a method of response

519
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:48,929
I now plan to cooperate with a very powerful artist

520
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,750
Wait a while

521
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,469
Keep confidential to the company

522
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,080
I will say it myself

523
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,140
besides

524
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,360
I have to keep this secret if I take this

525
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,060
Like rumors

526
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:26,750
-= Emergency Medical Center =-

527
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,390
So do you have no progress now?

528
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:35,830
Um

529
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,980
How did you get familiar with her

530
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Give her a fudge

531
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,319
Ask her to eat or eat

532
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,240
Then I became friends from that day

533
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,429
Not more expensive than that

534
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,420
She doesn't like to refuse

535
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,010
What is good for the little fudge?

536
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,580
Small acceptance

537
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,359
We Hanzhu hate owing others to be human

538
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,879
Even your birthday can't even

539
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,860
Wow to live so tired

540
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,650
There is no gap to get in at all

541
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,710
PlayList replay

542
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,620
Do you watch that too

543
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,170
Occasionally

544
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,230
This is the favorite program of Hanzhu

545
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,109
That's it for today's class

546
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,999
Everyone in the group is still doing smoothly

547
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,209
yes

548
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:35,110
But there are still students who did not submit a group list

549
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,079
As of today's mailbox submission

550
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,189
Otherwise, you will deduct 5 points

551
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,129
Well everyone has worked hard today

552
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,120
You have worked hard

553
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,150
What is it?

554
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,420
That Hanzhu

555
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,769
I invited a knowing producer

556
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,550
perhaps...

557
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,970
Then I don't have a group with you either

558
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,320
Hanzhu

559
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,819
You heard the professor said, right?

560
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,420
Just a group with my brother

561
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,470
Are you because of Shengxi?

562
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,600
That is really a misunderstanding

563
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,150
Shengxi came first to seduce my brother, my

564
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,270
What

565
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,149
Feed this time

566
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,750
I didn't say this in order to consider Shengxi's image

567
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,650
I'm really difficult too

568
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,469
You know too

569
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,900
Shengxi originally liked to show mercy everywhere

570
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:57,150
What a lunatic says?

571
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,050
What

572
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,770
what did you just say

573
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,599
Pretend to be a good person in front of people so proactive

574
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,099
But scolding people behind

575
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,900
Do you think others don't say because you don’t know?

576
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:12,790
Please converge a little before provoking major events.

577
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,970
You can't treat me like this

578
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,520
Do you have any other people to do group homework together?

579
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,150
I want to go with him

580
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
All right

581
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:44,069
Although I don’t know how to do it, I have become a group with you

582
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,399
But I still think you are very affordable

583
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,919
So please pay more attention not to cross the border.

584
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,369
Um, don't worry

585
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,799
I can keep the boundaries

586
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,170
When I was a kid, I didn’t step on a dancing house once a line.

587
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:03,050
So you said who the producer you are invited is

588
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,370
Playlist's producer of Gao Xizhen

589
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,020
What

590
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,320
How can you say this now?

591
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,550
I'm not afraid you will feel burden again ...

592
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,429
The producer of Gao Xizhen is another code.

593
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,469
That's my favorite show

594
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,000
Producer of Gao Xizhen ...

595
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,300
It's really an endless wait for what should I do first

596
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,350
You have to sign a signature ...

597
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,970
Will she not like to sign a signature

598
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,399
Really bad

599
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,300
If you see, I will do it, right?

600
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:45,100
As long as the group homework is over
Don't go back to the ground with him

601
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,339
As long as the group operation is over

602
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,870
We should be closer than before

603
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,620
That's ... guitar paddle

604
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,270
But what is the source of this

605
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,320
-= What is a variety producer? =-
What

606
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,950
This, wait a minute, wait

607
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,029
Hezhen

608
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:17,470
Where did this program interview work information investigation found?

609
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,270
This is what my agent helped me find me

610
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,470
Q & A and blog?

611
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,070
Thanks

612
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,120
Q & A and blog

613
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,469
no...

614
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:34,250
Do you mean you are looking for the answer to college homework in Q & A and blog?

615
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,369
Don't talk about why your homework is your agent to do it

616
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,610
What's wrong, can't he do it for me?

617
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,870
no

618
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,500
You are an adult, you should do it yourself

619
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,850
It's okay, it was, Hhe -town all helped me do a good job

620
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,619
What do he help you do

621
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,869
Help me open an account

622
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,250
Help me buy a movie ticket ticket ticket

623
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,200
Help my home express delivery

624
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,970
Also help me buy new socks and underwear ...

625
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,170
You shouldn't hear this, right?

626
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,200
It's my secret private affairs ...

627
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,849
Do you have a salary of 100 million?

628
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,069
Although this one is good, we have a good relationship

629
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,320
But it will not share the economic situation of each other

630
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,950
You listen well

631
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,250
Now we have a rule at the beginning of our group

632
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:26,370
Do your own things yourself

633
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,500
Can't use the help of anyone

634
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:33,970
cannot

What am I doing now?

645
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,250
It's much better than from the beginning

647
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
well done

648
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:45,870
Really

649
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,370
Is it really okay?

650
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,170
Why don't you believe others speak?

651
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,220
Because the reaction is too different from the beginning, it is a bit strange

652
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:57,270
Nothing I just think I don’t deserve to guide you

653
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,220
I can't even care about it myself

654
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,450
Now the preparation for interviews is over, right?

00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,800
Why do you put 50,000 won?

10,000 won

658
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,170
I have always wanted to come once like this

659
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,270
Have you ever been to coin -to -coin training room?

660
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,999
I sing in the practice room every day

661
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,350
Or sing on a music program

662
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,950
Otherwise, singing at the concert

663
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,020
There is no reason to come here

664
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,320
Like this

665
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,749
But do you know a few songs of 10,000 won?

666
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,750

Thirty ...

669
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,070
I haven't sang so much during the concert

670
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,470
Then you can sing too

671
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,519
What's wrong, I watch in the TV series

672
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,650
Everyone will come here to release the pressure

673
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,000
You also shouted refreshing, will you feel more comfortable?

674
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,520
Then you say you want to come here because ...

675
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,379
My heart

676
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,289
Empty Empty

677
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:33,679
Empty and empty

678
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,089
My lips murmured

680
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,099

Even if time passes

683
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:51,479
Even if everything changes

684
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,979
I love you too

685
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,880
I am also the protagonist today a day

686
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,740
Meet you, a handsome person

687
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:08,090
Wish you need you

688
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,720
Now this moment

689
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,419
I really can't sing anymore

690
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,300
What should I do if there is a song left? Continue to sing

691
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:30,450
You come to sing

692
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,100
If I sing now

693
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,900
He will be discovered by him as PLII

694
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:39,800
Is the time finally arrived?

695
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:51,000
-= Say, don't hesitate =-

696
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,899
quietly

697
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,239
It gradually became important in my heart

698
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,810
Can't go like this again

699
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,069
How could I do this

700
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:13,349
Fascinated by you

701
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,519
I don't know the reason

702
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,670
So

703
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,719
Just let him die now

704
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,759
Why do you always wander next to me

705
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,399
I care about you no matter what you do

706
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,209
I will miss you no matter what you do

707
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:30,429
Why do you always wander next to me

708
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,650
what do I do

709
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,509
Always think of you

710
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,970
Say, don't hesitate

711
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:45,020
no...

712
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,950
No, no ...

713
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,350
No, no

714
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,150
The sound of the pig's neck ...

715
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,950
How could it be the same person as the sound of the sound

716
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,420
Yeah, where must it be wrong?

717
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,100
It's me wrong, it's me

718
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,520
Such a person cannot be PLII ...

719
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,670
Go to Re. Feel cafe at 4pm tomorrow afternoon

720
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,250
I don't go, I won't go

721
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:26,270
I know this is a false transaction. Why do I have to go?

722
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:55,470
What's wrong

723
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,020
Did you get something on my face?

724
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,370
is either or...

725
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,870
You look a little different today

726
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,800
What do you say

727
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,070
Producer

728
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,370
Hello, I am Song Hanzhu who sent you an email

729
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,000
I am very happy to see you, I am Gao Xizhen

730
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,749
Then I will ask you the next question

731
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,549
I heard that you have been a student at a medical school before

732
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,550
is this real

733
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,349
That's right

734
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,799
But your second grade suddenly drops out from the medical school

735
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,650
Re -enrolled in the Academy of Images

736
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,949
Is there a special reason?

737
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,349
What I want to be a producer

738
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,019
Not a doctor

739
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,819
But dropping out from the medical school should not be an easy decision

740
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,599
What did you think at the time?

741
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,650
I am...

742
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:48,199
Just think about one thing

743
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,120
What I do when I do is the happiest

744
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,699
Of course, if you are a doctor, you should make a lot of money

745
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,550
But I don't think I will be happy

746
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,919
But if I do the job of a TV station

747
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,899
Although I won't make a lot of money like a doctor

748
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,669
But I think it will be very interesting

749
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,620
so

750
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:04,469
I rushed to the past regardless of it

751
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:08,269
Think back now I was really reckless at that time, right?

752
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,649
You are handsome

753
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:10,949
-Thank you -Okay so

754
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:14,170
Have you regret it for that recklessness?

755
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,249
You are on a safe way to go

756
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,870
Suddenly chose other roads

757
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,250
It should not be easy, right?

758
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:24,700
I am

759
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,250
I should regret it because I don't have recklessness

760
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:32,349
I really met many people after I was a variety producer

761
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:33,850
Then I realize

762
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,770
Dreams that cannot be realized

763
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:38,199
Will always be buried in my heart

764
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,520
In the end, I will always turn back to that place

765
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,169
so

766
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,399
If I did not take a reckless adventure at the time

767
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,719
It should always regret it all the time

768
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,869
so

769
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:54,250
I hope you must have a reckless courage

770
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,170
So

771
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,819
Are these almost enough?

772
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,669
It's enough

773
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,570
Thank you all for your hard work

774
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,399
Will it be edited?

775
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,800
After we edit it

776
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,399
Will send it to you again

777
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,600
I know

778
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,650
What's wrong, do you have something to say?

779
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,450
that...

780
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:16,170
Anyway, this should be the first time and the last time I have seen you

781
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,400
I have something to tell you

782
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,050
what is it then

783
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,470
You are really handsome

784
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,699
Really very, very very very very very very very like

785
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,170
You are really very, very handsome

786
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:33,270
You are my role model

787
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,920
I still received such a fierce confession for the first time

788
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:39,570
Thank you

789
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,149
Hanzhu, you will become more than me

790
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:46,500
More and more handsome people

791
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,700
thank you

792
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:59,010

798

Keep the boundary

799
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:26,950
What are you

800
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,539
Because my appearance, no matter where I go

801
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,620
It will be glowing and full of artist atmosphere

802
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,400
I'm afraid it would be bad if someone recognizes it

803
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:39,049
Have you ever thought about wearing sunglasses like this night

804
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:42,000
It looks more like an artist

805
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:46,800
Yeah

806
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:54,400
The way artist's thinking is really different from ordinary people

807
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:58,950
so what

808
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,450
What kind of plan this ordinary person is next?

809
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:06,619
The recent interviews should be selected

810
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,150
Have to start from the material to prepare

811
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,520
And you

812
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,220
I have to return to the company again

813
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,750
The company said she wants to release a new album

814
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,120
I'm postpon

815
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,670
I'm going to rest again

816
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:28,700
It seems that you are really here to play

817
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,470
But thanks to you

818
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,200
I created a lot of good memories for me

819
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,620
Thank you

820
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:38,700
I have never experienced campus life since the age of eleven

821
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:40,800
By the way

822
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:44,820
Bending

823
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:51,130
This is...

824
00:51:51,131 --> 00:51:54,099
-= To. Hanzhu =-

825
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,200
Actually I thought you were PLII

826
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,170
It's because I want to do a good relationship with you because of this

827
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,370
But I understand with you with you

828
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,520
You are not PLII

829
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:10,249
Even if you are just Song Hanzhu

830
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,820
Also a good friend

831
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:18,200
When others make friends

832
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,220
But that's not my preference

833
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,600
-If you really feel burden ... -Thank you

834
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,950
The matter of the producer of Gao Xizhen

835
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,120
And this album

836
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,520
I can't experience these things without you

837
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:38,900
Thank you

838
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,070
Make these beautiful memories for my boring university life

839
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,970
It is so difficult to let these guys throw it away

840
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,060
-= Love Playing Song =-

841
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:08,010
-= Thanks for the special appearance of Jiang Shengyan, Zheng Xiujing, Trendz =-

842
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,370
Do you want to work with me

843
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:12,670
Why are you here

844
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,570
Do you know why I choose you

845
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,169
You go to Dao Guo

846
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,800
Confirm if he is seeing others

847
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:23,420
Did you have a first love?

848
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,769
The sweating heartbeat in my hand is particularly fast, anyway, it is strange anyway

849
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,869
Is she PLII?

850
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,220
Then you just like her

851
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:32,770
No way...

852
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,720
He won't want to confess, right?

853
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:50,050
My Hanzhu really likes fudge

854
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,200
I will be the owner of a fudge shop in the future

855
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,100
Hello

856
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,070
Hello

857
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,850
Do you want to eat this

858
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,350
Thank you
