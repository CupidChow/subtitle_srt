-What-Give me a handle

8
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,670
Why do you have to give you your hand suddenly

9
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,070
hurry up

10
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,310
How are your mood now

11
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,970
Sweating and sticky

12
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,160
I just held my hand with others not long ago

13
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,330
so what

14
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,860
But there is a problem

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
What's wrong

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,459
There is also an illegitimate meal grasping your hand

17
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,460
Don't want to let you go

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,740
No

19
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,040
I don't want to let go

20
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:25,780
What

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,219
Heart jumps quickly

22
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,420
Still sweat

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,880
But I am not willing to let go

24
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,380
It's strange anyway

25
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,460
That person will not be PLII, right?

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
no

27
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,270
Then you just like her

28
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,280
But what is the difference between that person is PLII?

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,480
Of course

30
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,209
Face your favorite singer nervous

31
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,530
It is completely different from the heart of the woman who knows

32
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,080
One is longing for love

33
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,170
So who is that person?

34
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,960
Love bean actor

35
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,290

36
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,420
Not a professional classmate

37
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,550
Wow

38
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,609
This brother refuses to go to study on campus drama

39
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,810
It turned out to shoot the real campus drama

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,160
What is the use

41
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,730
I have no chance to meet again in the future

42
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,500
I voted three resumes a day

43
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,330
I feel that the soul is gone

44
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,080
How many you have cast

45
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,170
No voting a lot

46
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,960
About 100

47
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,170
100 are called and not voted a lot

48
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,720
If you cast a little more

49
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,920
You have to cast all the companies from the Republic of Korea

50
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,600
Early employment can be independent

What is it?

Absolutely

54
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:28,919
Shouldn't it be wrong?

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,080
what

56
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,580
Here is clearly written by Song Hanzhu

57
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,090
Congratulations to you Hanzhu

58
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,389
I also said that I messed up a sorrowful face

59
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,670
It turned out to be pretended

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,300
It seems that the interview is very successful

61
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,220
Miss Song Hanzhu

62
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,430
Is this really your ideal job?

63
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,190
I don’t know what the job I really want to do is now

64
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,740
I have always worked hard to complete what I should do

65
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,490
If you ask me if this is my ideal job

66
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,080
My answer is it

67
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,120
My NA card is selected

68
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,920
On the way to determine the direction

69
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,010
The only one I can choose the most perfect choice question

70
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,359
There are things that I choose

71
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,590
No matter what

72
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,430
Will work hard to do it

73
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,160
I think the results are displayed in the records you see

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,450
Hello

75
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,370

76
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,299
This is pretty good here

77
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,580
Very unique and warm

78

Very atmospheric

79
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,130
You can come here next time

80
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,010
I can go to the TV station

81
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,969
It's okay, I want to meet

82
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,039
Thank you coffee

83
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
yes

84
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,390
But what are you looking for me?

85
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,350
Do Miss Hanzhu interested in working with me?

86

What

87
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,199
Our group is recruiting interns

88
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,320
Time is about two months

89
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,410
that

90
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,629
The intern is a bit bad, right?

91
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,080
It is also short time

92
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,210
Isn't that like that

93
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,960
You give me this proposal to make me feel amazing

94
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,719
I see the video you sent to me last time was very good

95
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,439
The editing is very good and the subtitles are also very emotional

96
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,279
There are also details

97
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,809
I have confirmed when I sent mail beforehand

98
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,930
Compared to those

99
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,990
You said you like the show of PlayList the most

100
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,250
I'm very satisfied with this

101
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,160
Can I think about it again and reply to you

102
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,620

Regret hitting the ground

When classmates buy cars and buy houses

117
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,800
I have blood and tears in my heart

118

I know Brother doesn't trust me

149
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,109
I asked what kind of music I want to do before

150
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,390
I couldn't answer it either

151
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,869
But I really want to make music this time

152
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,870

Hey this is what you will show me in the future

I am my new interns this time

160
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,249
It looks like that to ask you

161
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,850
The whole body is hard

162
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,160
Not bad

163
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,070
I envy your youthful enthusiasm

164
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,579
I will be unfamiliar for the first time

165
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,860
But it will also be excited

166
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,580
I also envy you

167
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,000

I also have your debut album

170
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,670
That is the black history that my real fan only knows

171
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,309
Can you put it in the corner of the room

172
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,310
please

173
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
Kidding

174
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
Prove it to me

175
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,900
You can do it yourself

176
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,740
Then I will let you continue

177
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,650
Love is not easy

180

Live hard every day

181
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:05,090
Don't let that person know

182
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,280
Can't make him suffering from pain

183
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,240
Keep this sentence

184
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,940
I have forgotten that I live in my own life

185
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:27,990
Don't let him cry

186
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,960
Hurt too much

187
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,720
Cry too much

188
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:42,470
I can't say I'm sorry

189
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,390
Avoid it like this

190
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,860
But you know my heart

191
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:56,890
We must meet again

192
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,629
In fact, even more nervous than on the stage

193
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,139
Usually I also like this show very much

194
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,719
This picture is too big

195
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,059
Show a little bit

196
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,420
Hanzhu, do you want to do this part

197
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,340
me

198
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,420
-= Successfully send email =-

199
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,200
How to work so much

200
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,490
How does Hanzhu feel after this time?

201
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,949
Amazing

202
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,049
Can see the handsome and great person in front of me

203
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,929
I also want to be such a handsome person

204
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,379
But never associate with men on TV stations

205
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,799
They can only talk like empty can

206
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,179
empty

207
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,140
Is there any difference between a TV woman?

208
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,649
-Stoly -Where

209
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,059
I said differently

210
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,420
I feel like before

211
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,049
The two of you look really familiar

212
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,050
-what? What

213
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,729
Hanzhu, how can you tell such a scary thing and say something like such a scary thing

214
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,230
In the future, please try this unreasonable speech

215
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,110
Hanzhu, understand her

216
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,660
Really extreme

217
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,039
And we have a meeting of the performers today

218
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,400
You can go to the conference room before 1 o'clock in a while

219
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,500
good

220
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,870
Which of the next performers?

221
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,260
Why are you here

222
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,590
Why are you here

223
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,769
I didn't tell you in advance

224
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,690
The conditions I interviewed last time made some transactions with our Revi

225
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,250
She

226
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,519
This

227
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,319
It is a new intern we group in our group

228
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,770
I recruited

229
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,670
Do you two know

230
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,040
How to know

231
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,499
that

232
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,710
Is the classmate of the same major in the school

233
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,269
By the way, Hanzhu is responsible for early interviews

234
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,239
You are a friend Revi, and you will feel that this is better.

235
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,870
Right REVI

236
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,679
Yes, I know

237
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,870
fine

238
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,370
Then the next matter

239
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,060
I met again

240
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,140
Yeah, I thought I couldn't see it in the future

241
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,459
How do you live

242
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,140
How about the previous interview?

243
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,970
Can't pass so here

244
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,929
I thought

245
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,530
You are very capable of thinking that you can choose here.

246
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,269
No way

247
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,620
There is a formal staff over there. This is an intern

248
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,460
Please give me more advice in the future

249
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,259
Me too

250
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,480
We come on

251
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,760
What

252
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:23,820
Is REVI the guest of your show?

253
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,110
Big hair

254
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:28,359
Feeding this is even the fate in fate, right?

255
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,530
Isn't that like that?

256
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,530
Hanzhu, do you associate

257
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,459
it's not like that

258
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,290
You want

259
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,529
You form a group with two of the artists you like

260
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,909
This is already a lottery ticket

261
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,520
You met him as a guest on the internship show

262
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,589
This is really fate

263
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,610
The TV series will be scolded like this

264
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,149
Do you really don't feel much

265
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,590
My person who has nothing to do with it will be excited

266
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,340
no

267
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,750
I also think it's amazing to meet him like this

268
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,489
Hey, you are not fast, come,

269
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,729
Do you know how much popcorn I have ate here?

270
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,000
I killed me

271
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,359
People from sister companies should know that my sister looks like

272
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,639
Don't talk about it, I will kill you

273
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,225
The boss wants 300 spicy chicken feet here

274
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:23,020
-= Soup chicken feet =-

275
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,729
I took shochu myself

276
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,389
Don't worry about taking a cup yourself

277
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,569
How do you feel when you go to meet

278
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:26,859
Do you feel easy to do?

279
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,569
Why do my sister invite me

280
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,729
Because I am my cousin?

281
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,319
You forgot me to help you interview, do you want to promise me a condition?

282
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,049
So it's even strange

283
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,359
Your great work experience

284
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,669
I might become a flaw

285
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,629
My work experience is very great

286
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,659
You will not become a flaw

287
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,600
Don't worry about drinking this

288
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,160
I should thank you, but I think you have your appetite upside down

289
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,690
What about Hanzhu

290
00:17:52,691 --> 00:17:55,049
You won't give her the back door because she is my friend

291
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,959
Are you getting more and more serious recently?

292
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,399
Should my sister worry about you

293
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Do you want to tell your aunt

294
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:02,050
You are not so attractive to your favorite brother

295
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,380
But she is really capable

296
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,650
Although a bit quite satisfactory

297
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,850
But she is very smart and efficient

298
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,680
A little gentle

299
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,179
Oh, always

300
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,639
She is very good

301
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,090
Don't squeeze her too much care

302
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,610
knew

303
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,839
Wow, what should I do if I want to take Revi

304
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,969
I'm going to go to him so much

305
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,269
What happened to him?

306
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,530
Played

307
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,240
He said he didn't need the help of the company to do it by himself

308
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,249
Wow, do you really want him to do it by himself

309
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,339
Is that possible?

310
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,460
You can't let him discredit the reputation of the company, right?

311
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Mo Cun
is the team leader

312
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,089
You have to follow the REVI this time

313
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,539
This is the special instructions representing

314
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,049
I know

315
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,489
He has to tell you some questions about this

316
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,510
Let you go to the representative room for you to see it

317
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,010
Then I passed

318
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,699
By the way, even if you don't have any hope for REVI

319
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,509
Programs like playing song make newcomers follow

320
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,480
It's too much

321
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:22,569
What's wrong

322
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,089
Didn't you say that you want to make the newcomer be responsible for REVI?

323
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,179
The words are so saying

324
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,969
But music variety show

325
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,159
Selection

326
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,280
And prepare for the stage to do it by yourself

327
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,870
Can he finish it?

328
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,700
What are you listening to

329
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:39,770
Ah this

330
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,730
This is the recording belt of the newcomer composer recently

331
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,180
I feel pretty good, do you want to listen?

332
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,720
I seem to have heard this

333
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,900
Who is this person

334
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:58,379
Call Tomak

335
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,879
I have returned to South Korea recently after graduating from Berkeley

336
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,299
And the news

337
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,540
He looks very handsome

338
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,660
What should this child do?

339
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,359
Isn't this Mo Cun's song?

340
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,719
Where is Tomak Li Mocun?

341
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,469
He recently graduated from Berkeley

342
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,770
Back to South Korea

343
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,530
Handsome

344
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,350
Tomak

345
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,680
Li Mocun Tomak

346
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,110
Li Mocun

347
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,100
This is definitely the same person

348
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,170
Mo Cun, do you know why I choose you?

349
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,610
Why choose me

350
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,929
Isn't your dream be the president?

351
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,779
Saying in front of the president is to be the president

352
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,630
I feel that you are very confused but very satisfied with you

353
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,840
There are few ambitious young people like you recently

354
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,290
So I want to say

355
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,839
I want you to take a business class this time

356
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,080
what is that

357
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,920
Go and follow Taoism

358
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,089
Do you know the guy of the Tao country now refuses the company's support?

359
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,709
He said he wanted to write lyrics in person

360
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,169
The contract is about to end.

361
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,210
So

362
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,870
What I want to do is

363
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,679
You follow him to see if he saw others

364
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,730
Is there anyone who contacted outside

365
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,610
Hello

366
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,049
I am the elder brother of Dao Guo, Lin Hezhen, Lin Hezhen

367
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,889
It's okay to help me from Hezhen

368
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,169
What do you do for you

369
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,610
Send courier to my house

370
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,929
And buy new socks and underwear

371
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,040
Ah that underwear

372
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,420
What

373
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,449
nothing

374
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,719
I am a played intern Song Hanzhu

375
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,529
Today's early interview with REVI

376
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,659
By the way, I heard that you did a group job with the big brother of the country

377
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,639
Help my elder brother very hard

378
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,519
I apologize to you for him

379
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,129
Oh, nothing

380
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,159
You have worked too hard

381
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,130
Also help us use Q & A search information

382
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,649
I apologize with this

383
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,740
Marshmallow

384
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,550
Thanks

385
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,320
-Is let me take this -ah, okay

386
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,950
This way, please

387
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,549
My elder brother is not very sensible

388
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,210
But people are pretty good

389
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,349
He has no common sense yet

390
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,890
But people are pretty good

391
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,889
He has no politeness

392
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,870
But people are really good

393
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,300
yes

394
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,199
This is where the artist rests

395
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,940
Outside the window is a park

396
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,479
fine

397
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,200
right

398
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:48,869
Put the bag here, I will take you to visit other places

399
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,220
Hello

400
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,049
Um is pretty good

401
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,780
Do you participate in the played song

402
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,680
Yes

403
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:03,959
I am responsible for helping you participate in that show

404
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,219
Choose composer preparation stage

405
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,320
If you need it, you can tell me at any time

406
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,760
You don't seem to hear it yet

407
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,199
I decided to do all myself this time

408
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,370
No matter how you say, you will need basic assistance

409
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,780
Remember to contact me

410
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,780
Why is he so annoying

411
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,360
It's hard to be annoying without reason

412
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,109
In addition to the recording studio and practice room

413
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,010
We are not bad as ordinary companies

414
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,990
-= A & R: Artist and
Repertoire's abbreviation. Refers to the department of a record company or publishing company =-

415
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,809
That's the place for group A & R

416
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,480
The relationship with the elder brother of the country is a bit

417
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,140
not too good

418
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,580
Why is it not good

419
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,240
Say a long time

420
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,770
Brother Dao Guo rejected the company's preparation album

421
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,490
Why

422
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:10,160
He said he didn't want to play with your son anymore

423
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,199
Make lyrics and composition in person

424
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,589
It seems to have a very serious artist disease

425
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,820
That's the disease

426
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,760
Ah, I'll go

427
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,740
Let's continue

428
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
OK

429
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,450
I'm ready

430
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,199
Ah

431
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,570
Let's start

432
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:00,099
First of all, please explain the theme of this playback song

433
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,139
OK

434
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,949
The theme I choose is

435
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,530
Come on for you to ignore everything

436
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,519
-= Playing song =-

437
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,239
Is there any special reason for you to choose this theme?

438
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,979
I have been insisting on doing things around me recently

439
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,599
So I heard a lot of bad words

440
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,610
Stupid and ignorant, ignore everything

441
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,280
But I think

442
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:29,869
Anyway, there is only one time in life I think about it

443
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,869
No matter what the result, no matter what others say

444
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,900
I want to do what I want to do

445
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,869
So I want to ignore everything as I am like me

446
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,260
Brave people say cheer

447
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,849
No matter what the people around you say

448
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,510
Your choice is not wrong

449
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,590
Please insist on that resolutely

450
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,300
I said

451
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,910
Help me listen to the song

452
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,010
What

453
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:30,130
I did a arrangement and I didn't know how others listened

454
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,100
Why let me listen

455
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,179
Isn't there many people in the company?

456
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:38,070
Actually I have done a lot of annoying things recently

457
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,340
Um

458
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,470
I guess I can't help help

459
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,770
Any questions

460
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,700
I really want to start singing, it feels quite nervous

461
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,479
Are you not doing well in front of fans?

462
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,749
I am my fan's idol

463
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,550
Not your idol

464
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,249
Then I am your fan in these five minutes

465
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,410
You sing well

466
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:36,270
Go home

467
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,850
Give your mood to the sun

468
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,560
I think of you

469
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:54,830
I think of a lot of things and start to be sad

470
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,940
Tomorrow

471
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:07,080
We can't do anything now

472
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,300
I can only embrace your back

473
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:19,500
Saying everything will get better

474
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:29,039
It feels like there should be something that can be done

475
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,750
Become anxious

476
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:41,529
Your heavy back and long every day

477
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,970
It's a pity

478
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:53,640
I hope you will really happen tomorrow

479
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,360
Because you are qualified

480
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,390
Are you crying?

481
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,120
I'm sorry I shouldn't ask you

482
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,100
So don't cry anymore

483
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
sorry

484
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,980
But is it so ugly?

485
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,510
Why suddenly cry

486
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
No

487
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,170
Because it's great

488
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:47,040
I just feel good

489
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,220
Is it really bad?

490
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,820
Why is it suddenly

491
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,420
Because it is very good

492
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,080
Because the song is very good

493
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,850
Where is the garbage special effect

494
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,340
Right

495
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,419
I thought it was PLII, so I was tempted

496
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,970
It's tunious but not

497
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,680
She is just Song Hanzhu

498
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,050
Then why is this

499
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,710
That is you like her

500
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,080
shut up

501
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,340
what do you know

502
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,770
is it right

503
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,750
-= Copy to the new folder =-

504
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
yes

505
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,339
The theme I choose is

506
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,250
Come on for you

507
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,850
No matter what others say

508
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,450
Your choice is right

509
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,200
Hope you can stick to your impulse

510
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,449
I heard that the house next to the house has also retired

511
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,170
Why

512
00:31:25,171 --> 00:31:27,509
Isn't it associated with male love beans on the same show?

513
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,340
That's why you retire

514
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
I heard it was a breakup

515
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,650
Oh, I know how long they can't talk about it

516
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:35,880
Too

517
00:31:35,881 --> 00:31:37,279
Record the same show with your ex -boyfriend

518
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,419
Meet every week

519
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,850
Really uncomfortable

520
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,800
The fans over there seem to be known

521
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,909
Breaking up and being exposed again

522
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,219
It's all messy

523
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,220
Well

524
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,219
So you can't get related to the people over there

525
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,769
I can make money anymore over there

526
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,050
This can only be exposed and scolded

527
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,020
Life will be difficult

528
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,910
Real

529
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,820
Tomorrow will be very good tomorrow
- = song list =-

530
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,540
Hope you encounter

531
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:16,080
Because you are qualified

532
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,940
I hope you put down your burden and become happy

533
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:29,140
I will pray for you sincerely

534
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,800
fine

535
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,420
Not just good, I was touched

536
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,650
It should be very popular

537
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,339
How about this theme song Youth Special

538
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,080
Youth special

539
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
Pretty good

540
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,650
I think Youth Special is very good

541
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,650
Now that this is the case

542
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,939
Using youth will be reminiscent of the image

543
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,309
Perform brainstorming

544
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,310
OK

545
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,540
However, when it comes to youth, you cannot fall into your first love

546
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,340
You are too upright, right?

547
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,219
But the familiar taste is indeed attractive

548
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,539
It's like this spicy cabbage soup

549
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,049
First love is the unchanged best -selling theme

550
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,310
Just like this fried meat

551
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,370
Revi, do you have a first love?

552
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,619
I won't tell you

553
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,249
Recently, the company will not let them talk nonsense

554
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,850
How natural just now

555
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,680
What about Hanzhu you

556
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,340
me

557
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:32,449
Um

558
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,510
I am curious about Hanzhu's first love

559
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,370
Feeling that you have a high vision

560
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,400
First -love

561
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,220
Heaven

562
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,420
How old is it?

563
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,480
What kind of person

564
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,339
When I am in high school

565
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,820
He is handsome and band

566
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,600
These settings feel like innocent comics

567
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,540
What is that person doing now

568
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,619
I haven't contacted for a long time

569
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,880
It should not be in South Korea now

570
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,079
Fans hate love stories really have a reason

571
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,570
haven't seen you for a long time

572
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:24,880
It's not a long time, right?

573
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,280
I also met at Yun Chengqing's feast

574
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,570
You haven't changed at all

575
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:31,079
I heard that you are going to play a song list

576
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,110
How do I feel that I can get angry

577
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,250
If it is on fire

578
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,510
Can you be interested in me again?

579
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,310
I know you only pick a very hot artist to fall in love

580
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,280
You should know that I am not interested in you, right?

581
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,820
Take good shooting

582
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,450
I will look forward to

583
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,249
When it comes to my first love reminds me of my first love

584
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,399
My first love looks like Revi

585
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,079
How can it be

586
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,650
What are you undulating me?

587
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,540
You have no first love

588
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,540
Don't talk about going to a shochu bar

589
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,910
Study? Let's have some beer again

590
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:20,770
Beer?

591
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,020
Artillery

592
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,170
Go

593
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,910
In the future, you can only have this guitar

594
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,309
Heaven

595
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,620
How did you get such a good position

596
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,539
Thank you for the same period

597
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,110
I need to say it in the future

598
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,710
Can I ask you a question?

599
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,200
Um, please ask

600
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,709
Hanzhu She

601
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,600
Hanzhu, what's wrong with her

602
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,000
Her first love

603
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:04,170
Does Qiu Xiaoli Hanzhu look like Qiu Xiaoai?

604
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,250
Not the first love

605
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,850
never mind

606
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,710
What am I doing like a little bit?

607
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,200
Song Hanzhu

608
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,820
I have left so long, why don’t I get it?

609
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,630
-= Love poisoning-Come and play PLII adaptation =-

610
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,220
Is PLII

611
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,399
Everyone around me is opposed

612
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,620
I am actively promoting

613
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,450
Then I heard a lot of gossip

614
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,079
Don't know giving up and not growing up

615
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
Hello

616
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,310
Where are you

617
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,340
What's wrong with the company

618
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,020
No matter how the result others say

619
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,739
You go slowly

620
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,000
Thanks a lot

621
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,999
How can I be so casual

622
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,399
Where is the casual

623
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,079
Of course, you have to be interviewed after singing a song

624
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,650
That's right

625
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:25,820
Singer singing interviews and singing interviews

626
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,449
Hanzhu, go back first, let's confirm something at all

627
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,419
Okay, I'll go first

628
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,940
-Gei -OK

629
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,480
Why did you just call me?

630
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,570
-Sto hard -goodbye

631
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,020
Why did you come here so late

632
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,400
Suddenly miss you

633
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,050
I want to tell you

634
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,280
If you have time, go and talk about it

635
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,910
no

636
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,570
no

637
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,450
Leave here first

638
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,820
Where are you going?

639
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,879
I will leave the key here

640
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,570
Remember to lock the door when you leave

641
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,220
Don't forget to check out

642
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,620

The only place where you can come is here

644
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,200
sit down

645
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
Um

646
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,540
Would you like to tell her that I already know that she is PLII

647
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,200
What should I say

648
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,800
I won't be to confess to me, right?

649
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,910
That's not

650
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,049
Do you want to drink this?

651
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,450
Um I like to drink whiskey very much

652
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,369
What's wrong, can you drink high wine?

653
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,540
What is not

654
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,910
I can drink it

655
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,049
My nickname is the alcoholic god of Aidoujie

656
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,510
do not you know

657
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,850
-I have something to say -don't want

658
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,479
Drink a drink first before starting

659
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
Come

660
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,820

Um

You can drink it

663
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,820
What I want to say is

664
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,480
Today's wine is delicious

665
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,740
Drink another cup

666
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,140
Drink it

667
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,970
What's wrong, can't you drink anymore?

668
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
no

669
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:51,480
I want to drink side by side

670
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,450
It's almost dangerous

671
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,000
So why do you say that kind of words

672
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,220
I

673
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,000

Don't talk about you drink a lot

677
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:52,480
I really like you very early

678
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,969
How long do we know

679
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:04,970
What kind of nonsense to say

680
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,110
Don't you like you

681
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,140
Instead

682
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,220
I

00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,450

I like you

687
00:43:32,371 --> 00:43:33,569
This is the confession

688
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,970
That person is the same idea

689
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:39,339
I haven't seen Song Hanzhu for a long time

690
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,399
You are Song Hanzhu friends, how do you know it

691
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,249
Are you curious about us?

692

I'm sorry yesterday

693
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,019
Do you want to say that here?

Hmm sorry

696
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,819
Always touch

697
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,849
There are a lot of temptation to drink miscellaneous thoughts

698
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:53,219
It is when I love chaos

699
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,139
What does you have to do with newcomers

700
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,479
What's wrong with what happened?

701
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,310
Why not answer

702
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,339
It's my first love

703
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,620
Just looking at the eyes of the newcomer seemed to kill him

704
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:04,969
