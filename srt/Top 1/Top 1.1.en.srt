1
00:00:09,692 --> 00:00:11,661
Can somebody tell me

2
00:00:11,686 --> 00:00:15,778
the difference
between gravity and gravitation?

3
00:00:16,872 --> 00:00:18,958
Yes, Dexter Morabe?

4
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:23,828
Ma’am, gravity is the attractive force

5
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:26,442
that pulls any object
towards the Earth’s center.

6
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:30,294
- How about gravitation?
- Ma'am, it's the same thing.

7
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:32,810
So, you mean there’s no difference?

8
00:00:34,793 --> 00:00:36,888
- Yes, Ms. Azenith Lalu?
- Ma’am!

9
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:41,903
Unlike gravity, gravitation can
either be attractive or repulsive.

10
00:00:41,928 --> 00:00:44,224
It is the fundamental force that exists

11
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:46,231
between two objects that have mass,

12
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:49,606
it is directly proportional
to the product of their masses

13
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:53,450
and inversely proportional to the square
of the distance between them.

14
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:55,887
That’s correct, Miss Lalu.

15
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:01,683
In today's time,

16
00:01:01,864 --> 00:01:06,099
does a literary work need to be
published in book form

17
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:10,966
to be considered a formal part
of Philippine literature?

18
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:13,349
Do you have something to say, Azi?

19
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,997
Sir, when a literary work is published,

20
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:19,989
it receives formal recognition
from its readers.

21
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:21,660
In this way,

22
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:25,380
it becomes a legitimate part
of Philippine literature.

23
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,739
Do you wish to add to that, Dex?

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,558
Sir, nowadays, with the internet,

25
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:35,489
computers are more used
instead of buying printed books.

26
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:38,517
These websites
are considered the publishers

27
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:40,471
of modern Philippine literature.

28
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:42,661
Dex is correct! Good!

29
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:49,105
And f of x plus delta-x

30
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,007
is equal to f of x plus
f-prime of x times delta-x,

31
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:56,114
plus f-prime of x times delta-x,

32
00:01:56,288 --> 00:01:58,935
find the value of the square root of 10

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,921
to the nearest mixed fraction. Go!

34
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,194
Both of you got the correct answer:

35
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,396
Three and one-sixth.

36
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,044
But...

37
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,161
Azi finished first.

38
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:49,505
Dude!

39
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,501
What now?

40
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:55,567
Miss Top One beat you
in the recitation again.

41
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:59,021
She just wrote her solution faster,

42
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,250
but our brains work at the same speed.

43
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:03,880
Oh... Our bro here really
doesn’t want to lose.

44
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:05,044
Competitive!

45
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,618
But he still lost!

46
00:03:07,477 --> 00:03:09,192
Babe, don’t do that!

47
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:13,247
Stop teasing Dex.
Can’t you see he’s upset?

48
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:17,411
Babe, I brought you some snacks.
Eat first.

49
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:18,840
Wow!

50
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:22,418
Well at least, when it comes to love,
you’re ahead of Azi...

51
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:25,388
I don't think
she’s ever had a boyfriend.

52
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,341
I bet she’s still a virgin...

53
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:29,606
- but she has a lot of medals!
- Stop it already!

54
00:03:29,631 --> 00:03:30,631
What?

55
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:35,317
Babe, do you want me
to help you cool off?

56
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,854
So? Let’s go?

57
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:43,824
Cool off?

58
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:45,643
More like heat things up!

59
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,643
Babe, there's someone there!

60
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:45,360
There's no one there.

61
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,045
What did you say?
You want to go to college abroad?

62
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:09,620
Yes, Ma...

63
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:11,348
That's why I'm asking
for your permission now

64
00:05:11,373 --> 00:05:14,069
before I submit my applications.

65
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:17,858
Also, I need parental consent
on the forms.

66
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:21,678
But, dear, tuition fees are more expensive
if you study abroad.

67
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:24,741
We might not afford those expenses.

68
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:28,163
Pa, I'll be applying
for scholarships.

69
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:31,397
If I study in Japan,
or Singapore,

70
00:05:31,763 --> 00:05:35,333
the scholarship can cover
even my living expenses,

71
00:05:35,358 --> 00:05:37,887
so you won't have to worry about costs.

72
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:38,912
Is that so?

73
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:42,468
Well, go ahead and apply.
Who knows, you might get lucky.

74
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:46,358
Why do you sound doubtful that our child
will get a college scholarship?

75
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:49,882
She got into that private school
because she's smart.

76
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:52,936
She was accepted as a scholar
because she's always the first honor.

77
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,843
You really take after your papa, dear.
Always Top One.

78
00:05:57,868 --> 00:06:01,077
- Am I right, dear?
- Top One when it comes to books.

79
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:04,085
But when it comes
to life skills, Row Four.

80
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:08,100
At least our child here
has the guts to study abroad

81
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,647
even while she's still a student.

82
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:11,060
And you?

83
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:15,335
If you had gone abroad to work,
our life would’ve been better.

84
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,853
We might have even migrated.

85
00:06:18,065 --> 00:06:19,748
But where are you now?

86
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:21,210
Still a supervisor?

87
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:26,046
While your colleagues at the company
are now senior managers?

88
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:30,468
You're really weak!
Lacking in ability!

89
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,483
- Why am I always the one you blame?
- Who else?

90
00:06:34,513 --> 00:06:37,546
You do nothing
but blame me for everything!

91
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:40,632
Who else should I blame? Azi?

92
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,474
Bro, surely Azi is
No Boyfriend Since Birth,

93
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,379
given she's a consistent honor student.

94
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:57,143
She has no distractions.

95
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:58,923
Unlike someone we know, right?

96
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:01,029
Always flirting around,

97
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:03,192
that's why he couldn't
get past being Top Two.

98
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:04,217
True!

99
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:06,770
But seriously, bro.

100
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,903
If Azi loses focus on her studies,

101
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:13,786
you could overtake her
in the rankings.

102
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:16,872
What if we find her a suitor?

103
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,160
But who?

104
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:21,568
Babe,

105
00:08:21,757 --> 00:08:24,457
why don't you court Azi?

106
00:08:25,063 --> 00:08:27,622
Are you crazy? Why me?

107
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:30,138
Are you suggesting these clowns?

108
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:32,451
Azi will definitely
just ignore them.

109
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:33,857
That hurts!

110
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,513
And babe, if someone as handsome,
and smart as you

111
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:39,765
gives her attention,

112
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,778
there's no way she won't feel flattered
and be interested in you.

113
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:49,005
You know, Misia, stop it.
You’re disgusting.

114
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,598
Dex, are you home?

115
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,965
Yes, mom.

116
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:58,976
Manang cooked dinner
for you before we left.

117
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:01,622
She put it in the fridge,
so just heat it in the microwave.

118
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:05,075
You go ahead and eat,
don’t wait for us.

119
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,138
We’re helping your brother
find a condo near his med school.

120
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:10,617
Okay?

121
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,294
Okay, mom.

122
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:15,490
Don’t forget to lock the front door
before you go to bed.

123
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,724
We might come home late.

124
00:09:19,054 --> 00:09:22,224
- Sure, mom.
- Why do you sound out of breath?

125
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:26,583
- What are you doing?
- I’m working out. Got to go.

126
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,422
Were you serious about
your suggestion earlier, Misia?

127
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:54,754
That I should court Azi?

128
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:01,004
Of course.

129
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:02,992
Is it hard to do?

130
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:04,326
Wait...

131
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:07,536
I only said you should court her
enough to distract her,

132
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:09,262
so you can outrank her in class.

133
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:11,012
But I’m not giving you permission

134
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:13,434
to fall in love with her,
or even have sex with her.

135
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:15,301
Look, Dex...

136
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,133
you’re doing this for yourself…

137
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:20,489
and for us.

138
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:22,925
If you become
the valedictorian of our class,

139
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:25,747
I’ll give you the best graduation gift

140
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:27,715
you can ever ask for.

141
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:29,325
What’s that?

142
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:33,176
I’ll let you put your Dex junior

143
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:35,114
in all of my holes…

144
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,881
Ma’am, what’s that?

145
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:49,054
Since the second semester
is fast approaching,

146
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,480
you have to start working
on your research,

147
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:55,273
or capstone projects,
which are a requirement for graduation.

148
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:59,078
Being in the STEM strand,
you can do research,

149
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:02,140
a feasibility, or comparative study,

150
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:06,328
or make an invention
in line with science,

151
00:11:06,353 --> 00:11:10,343
technology, engineering,
or mathematics.

152
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:12,656
Then, Ma'am, what's the container for?

153
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:16,007
Calm down, okay?
Don’t get too excited.

154
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,382
You are doing the project in pairs.

155
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,011
There are exactly the same amount of males
and females in this class.

156
00:11:23,036 --> 00:11:25,681
I’ve already written
the names of the male students

157
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:28,007
and placed them in balls in this container.

158
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:31,288
I’ll ask the female students
to pick a ball.

159
00:11:31,313 --> 00:11:34,773
The name of the person in the ball
will be her partner.

160
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:36,092
Is that clear?

161
00:11:36,273 --> 00:11:38,374
- Yes, Ma’am!
- Yes. Ma’am!

162
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,765
If there are no more questions,
shall we start with you, Azi?

163
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:51,703
- And your partner is?
- Dexter Morabe.

164
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,531
- Nice.
- Dexter Morabe.

165
00:11:55,712 --> 00:11:58,726
Ma’am, can I just work solo?

166
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:03,132
I can handle the project on my own.
I don’t need a partner.

167
00:12:03,298 --> 00:12:05,812
- Ma’am!
- Oh!

168
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:07,398
- Ma'am!
- Dex?

169
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:11,125
Ma’am, I can also do the project alone.

170
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:12,875
I don’t need a partner either.

171
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:14,750
Oh!

172
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,775
Quiet please...

173
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,750
Azi... Dex...

174
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,932
you two are supposed to be
the model students in this class.

175
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:23,531
And you’re the ones
not following the rules?

176
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:25,655
Rules are rules.

177
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,914
I’m sorry, but you have to learn
to work together on a project.

178
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,851
And that goes for everyone.

179
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,489
- Understood?
- Yes, Ma’am!

180
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:50,374
Hey! What the hell!

181
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:52,058
Why did you withdraw?

182
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,435
I was close.

183
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,103
I'm not enjoying it anymore.

184
00:12:55,128 --> 00:12:56,486
It hurts!

185
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:58,249
What's your problem, anyway?

186
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:05,460
I got pissed off at Azi earlier.

187
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,710
The nerve of her
to refuse to be my partner.

188
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,726
Does she think she's the only one capable
of doing the project alone?

189
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:16,086
You shouldn't have let her get to you.

190
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:18,752
Can't you see?

191
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:23,437
This is your opportunity to
get close to her and distract her.

192
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:26,140
Remember our agreement.

193
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:29,562
You’re not allowed to fall in love,
or have sex with Azi Lalu.

194
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:35,703
Babe, I talked to our principal earlier.

195
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:38,804
I need to go to Canada
with my parents for three weeks

196
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:42,242
for our permanent residency status.

197
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:45,078
The school allowed me to attend classes
in hybrid mode while I’m there.

198
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:46,684
I’m gonna miss you...

199
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:53,686
But so you won’t miss me too much,

200
00:13:53,886 --> 00:13:55,686
I'll leave you something
to remember me by...

201
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:57,656
Ready for round two?

202
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,523
Perfect timing,

203
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:02,897
I haven't climaxed yet.
I'll finish inside, okay?

204
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:03,922
Sure,

205
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:07,945
but you know which hole, right?

206
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,906
They're all equally hot...

207
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:35,770
Azi, wait!

208
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:40,196
What about our project?

209
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:42,172
Have you thought of a topic yet?

210
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,180
Not yet, but I'll handle everything.

211
00:14:45,205 --> 00:14:47,071
You can just help me with the presentation.

212
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:50,633
I won't allow that.
Do you think I'm a freeloader?

213
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:52,117
It's not like that.

214
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:55,140
It's just easier for me
if I work alone.

215
00:14:55,165 --> 00:14:56,165
Look, Azi...

216
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:58,578
we need to work together on this.

217
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:26,574
Are you uncomfortable around me?

218
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:28,738
How about...

219
00:15:29,938 --> 00:15:31,950
Let's each come up with
our own research topic,

220
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:33,810
then let's meet up next week.

221
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:34,973
Sound good?

222
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:36,288
Sure.

223
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:42,402
Damn, guys.

224
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:44,465
Azi really got some nerve.

225
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:48,371
She even said
she'll do our project,

226
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:50,082
”for both of us.”

227
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:52,307
If she were a guy,

228
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:54,495
I would've punched her
in the face long ago.

229
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:57,723
- That was insulting.
- If I were you,

230
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,838
I would even kiss Azi.

231
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,684
Just imagine,
no hassle with the project,

232
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:05,035
and high grades!

233
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:07,247
You’re really an idiot, you know that?

234
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,582
What if someone reports you to our teacher
for not doing anything?

235
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:13,331
You won’t get to graduate then.

236
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:15,784
But she offered to do it all, didn't she?

237
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:17,497
It's on her.

238
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:19,634
Well, I’m different.

239
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:22,341
Bro...

240
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:26,808
I think you'll have a hard time
cracking the code with Azi.

241
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,145
Sorry to tell you this,
but you're just not on her level.

242
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:32,895
Hey, man, don't say that.

243
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:34,758
Don't you believe in Dex?

244
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:37,590
He's got this.
He just needs to find the right password.

245
00:16:37,615 --> 00:16:38,615
Nah!

246
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:42,439
Dex is screwed with Azi.
Let's even bet on it.

247
00:16:42,464 --> 00:16:44,181
Alright, how much?

248
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:49,029
Five grand if Dex gets Top One?
Another five grand if he dates Azi?

249
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:50,795
- Call!
- Put it here!

250
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,582
Would you two idiots just stop?
You’re not helping!

251
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:01,558
Dex, your dad called earlier.
He was asking about you.

252
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,519
He wants to know
if you'll graduate as valedictorian.

253
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:08,131
He wants to come
home to put the medal on you.

254
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:12,184
Shall I tell him to book a flight
now in time for your graduation?

255
00:17:12,757 --> 00:17:14,855
Mom, I’m not sure.

256
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:21,865
What do you mean you're not sure?
About graduating?

257
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:24,153
No, mom...

258
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:26,411
I'm not sure if--

259
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:29,317
if I’m graduating
at the top of my class.

260
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:30,731
Oh, Dex.

261
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:32,887
I hope you can assure
your dad as soon as possible

262
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:34,465
so he can come home.

263
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,795
I’m sure he’ll be as proud of you
as he is of your brother.

264
00:17:38,051 --> 00:17:41,012
By the way, Manang and I
are at your brother’s condo again.

265
00:17:41,037 --> 00:17:44,262
We’re helping him fix his place
before he starts med school.

266
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:47,574
There's food in the fridge.
You know what to do.

267
00:17:48,124 --> 00:17:49,356
See you later.

268
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:51,278
Okay, mom. Bye...

269
00:17:56,386 --> 00:17:57,725
Hi, babe!

270
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,677
I miss you...

271
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:01,871
Do you miss me too?

272
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:04,738
I could really use some company right now.

273
00:18:05,346 --> 00:18:06,598
Surely,

274
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:08,816
you miss this too...

275
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:16,007
Babe...

276
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:19,207
Suck on it... Please...

277
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,443
Pull it out, babe.

278
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:32,270
So I can hold it...

279
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:34,457
and lick it...

280
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:36,590
just like this...

281
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:42,764
You’re good.

282
00:19:43,912 --> 00:19:46,201
No, you’re amazing!

283
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,271
Babe,

284
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:51,045
this is not our first time, right?

285
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:59,608
What if our research topic is

286
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,572
"Artificial Intelligence

287
00:20:02,597 --> 00:20:05,558
and the Future of Philippine Education"?

288
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,780
Right?

289
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:10,850
It's very relevant nowadays,
especially for Gen Z like us.

290
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,264
Here, it says,

291
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:17,124
"The quality between AI and human work
can be distinguished

292
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:19,624
when most core curriculum classes

293
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:21,897
require critical thinking,

294
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:24,928
analysis, and reflection.” Right?

295
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:27,764
Look at you.

296
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:52,608
- What--
- I’m sorry!

297
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:08,624
Before we end this class,

298
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:12,528
let us give Azenith Lalu
a round of applause

299
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:17,408
for remaining Top One
for the whole Grade 12 level

300
00:21:17,463 --> 00:21:20,216
at the end of the second quarter.

301
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:23,670
Congratulations, Azi!

302
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:27,044
Okay, take a break!

303
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:32,228
- Ma’am...
- Yes?

304
00:21:32,253 --> 00:21:34,093
I have a question
regarding the lesson earlier.

305
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:37,692
You should worry, Dex.

306
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:40,233
Just two quarters left,
and we're graduating.

307
00:21:40,347 --> 00:21:41,491
If I were you,

308
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:44,811
you should consider giving up
the valedictorian spot to Azi.

309
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,880
Yeah, bro. This isn't
like a basketball game

310
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,163
where clutch time lasts
just a few minutes or seconds.

311
00:21:50,514 --> 00:21:51,914
This is the academics.

312
00:21:52,904 --> 00:21:56,069
Bro, it’s not over till it’s over.

313
00:21:56,675 --> 00:21:59,288
Why don't we push through with our bet?

314
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:02,210
Bro! He’s really confident!

315
00:22:02,537 --> 00:22:06,366
Yeah, don’t you know?
Dex is the man, y’all!

316
00:22:06,522 --> 00:22:08,473
I’ll call. Five thousand bet, okay?

317
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:09,725
- Are you down?
- I’m down!

318
00:22:09,898 --> 00:22:11,010
It’s on!

319
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:21,735
What's this?

320
00:22:22,261 --> 00:22:23,261
An apology.

321
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,286
And a peace offering too.

322
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:27,842
I'm sorry.

323
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:30,249
I know I shouldn't
have done that.

324
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,491
Rest assured, it won't happen again.

325
00:22:32,528 --> 00:22:33,959
Try it again,

326
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:36,542
and I won't hesitate to
report you to the Principal.

327
00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:37,578
Whoa!

328
00:22:40,017 --> 00:22:43,725
I think we won’t be able to concentrate
in doing our research project

329
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,750
here on campus.

330
00:22:44,892 --> 00:22:47,687
Do you want to do it at my house?
Let’s just try it....

331
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:50,336
Azi, feel at home!

332
00:22:50,361 --> 00:22:53,936
You said you’re usually alone here?
Where are your parents?

333
00:22:54,657 --> 00:22:57,272
My dad works abroad.

334
00:22:57,297 --> 00:22:59,232
He’s based in Europe.

335
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:02,505
While my mom is always
with my older brother--

336
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,670
You have a sibling?

337
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,217
Yeah, there’s a big age gap between us.

338
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:08,032
He’s in med school now.

339
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:11,084
So, intelligence runs in your family.

340
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:15,483
My brother was valedictorian in elementary
and high school.

341
00:23:15,508 --> 00:23:17,561
He also graduated summa cum laude
in college.

342
00:23:17,586 --> 00:23:18,983
Meanwhile, I’m just...

343
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:23,280
Oh, wait!
I'll just prepare some snacks.

344
00:23:23,305 --> 00:23:25,678
You can go ahead upstairs.
The study area is there.

345
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:26,746
Okay...

346
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:37,319
Are you done with your research?

347
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:41,803
So, why did you stop?

348
00:23:46,295 --> 00:23:49,792
I wanted to ask you something. Can I?

349
00:23:50,048 --> 00:23:52,842
- What is it?
- What makes you excel in our academics?

350
00:23:52,905 --> 00:23:54,982
I mean, don't you get tired?

351
00:23:56,526 --> 00:24:01,085
It's simple. I need to
graduate at the top of our class

352
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,928
to secure a college scholarship abroad.

353
00:24:05,825 --> 00:24:09,404
Abroad? Why?
There are plenty of good colleges here.

354
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,983
If I study in another country,
I can find a job there after graduation.

355
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:16,569
I really have no plans of coming back
here to the Philippines.

356
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:18,577
Huh? What about your parents?

357
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:21,225
They're the reason I want to leave.

358
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:25,366
I want to get away
from them... escape.

359
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,959
I'm tired of my life here.

360
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,169
What about you,
what's your motivation?

361
00:24:32,407 --> 00:24:35,186
If I top our graduating class,

362
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:39,686
I hope my efforts would be recognized

363
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:41,460
by my parents.

364
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:45,655
I hope they’ll be proud of me
like they are of my brother.

365
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:51,432
It feels like only
my brother matters to them...

366
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:53,608
like he's their...

367
00:24:54,444 --> 00:24:55,569
their only child...

368
00:24:56,781 --> 00:24:58,491
Being smart is tough, isn’t it?

369
00:24:59,686 --> 00:25:03,280
But I’m sure
you wouldn’t want to be dumb.

370
00:25:06,024 --> 00:25:08,506
- I have one more question.
- What is it?

371
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:13,320
Did you catch Misia and me
at the library before?

372
00:25:16,576 --> 00:25:18,513
You watched us, didn’t you?

373
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:21,415
Did you enjoy what you saw?

374
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,097
Hey! What’s that you’re watching?

375
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:37,552
- Nothing!
- What nothing?

376
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:39,815
What is it?

377
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:42,223
- Let me see! Give it to me!
- It’s nothing!

378
00:27:45,092 --> 00:27:46,092
What's this?

379
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,249
Misia, how could you do that?

380
00:28:00,274 --> 00:28:02,193
I don't need your explanation!

381
00:28:02,435 --> 00:28:04,974
You know what?
We’re done!

382
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:07,164
I don't want to see you anymore!

383
00:28:22,914 --> 00:28:25,662
Let’s continue the project
on another day.

384
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,740
You should rest for now.

385
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,511
You had a rough day.
I'll just go home.

386
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:37,691
Can you stay a little longer?

387
00:28:38,146 --> 00:28:40,898
Just be with me for a while… please?

388
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:47,861
Can I ask you something?

389
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:51,456
I know Misia is your girlfriend, but...

390
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:53,334
do you really love her?

391
00:28:58,189 --> 00:29:01,732
I wouldn't be this upset
if I didn't love her, right?

392
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:07,925
Maybe it's just your ego that's hurt,
and not really your heart?

393
00:29:08,188 --> 00:29:10,691
Because even though you're her boyfriend,

394
00:29:11,231 --> 00:29:12,649
who’s good-looking,

395
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,873
who comes from a well-off family,
and, most importantly, is smart...

396
00:29:18,412 --> 00:29:21,185
But she still went
for someone else.

397
00:29:21,604 --> 00:29:23,606
Your ego can't accept that.

398
00:29:25,524 --> 00:29:27,638
That's why if I get into a relationship,

399
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:29,810
I'll look for someone
who's my equal.

400
00:29:30,513 --> 00:29:33,046
Someone who can match me in every way.

401
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,795
So there won't be any imbalance
between us.

402
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:39,488
I hope you do the same.

403
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:43,677
Because you deserve
somebody better than Misia...

404
00:29:43,706 --> 00:29:45,625
Much, much better...

405
00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:53,774
Oh, sorry, Dex. I fell asleep.

406
00:36:54,191 --> 00:36:55,692
Where were we?

407
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:58,570
It’s okay, Azi.
You look exhausted...

408
00:36:59,154 --> 00:37:00,154
You should take a rest.

409
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:51,481
Surprise, babe!
I’m back!

410
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:53,356
What are you doing here?

411
00:37:53,966 --> 00:37:57,489
Of course, I missed you.
Didn’t you miss me?

412
00:37:57,514 --> 00:37:59,215
Really? You missed me?

413
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,380
I don’t think so.

414
00:38:01,456 --> 00:38:03,512
Babe, come on, I’m sorry!

415
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:09,199
I missed you so much that
I just had to find a proxy for you there.

416
00:38:09,224 --> 00:38:10,473
That’s all it was.

417
00:38:10,529 --> 00:38:14,106
Besides, he didn’t even
get to penetrate all my holes.

418
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:18,442
But for you,
I’m ready to let you in all my holes.

419
00:38:18,467 --> 00:38:21,153
If you want, we can do it here and now...

420
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:34,430
Didn’t I tell you we’re done?

421
00:38:35,422 --> 00:38:38,384
Babe, are you serious?
You’re joking, right?

422
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,560
Just please...

423
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,710
Get out now!

424
00:38:56,688 --> 00:38:59,399
Class, at the end of the Third Quarter,

425
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:03,791
I’m happy to announce
that we have a new...

426
00:39:03,951 --> 00:39:07,806
Top One in the whole Grade 12 level.

427
00:39:08,322 --> 00:39:11,497
In the person of Dexter Morabe!

428
00:39:11,522 --> 00:39:13,649
A round of applause, please.

429
00:39:13,983 --> 00:39:16,915
- Congratulations!
- Bro!

430
00:39:17,502 --> 00:39:19,540
Okay. Good day, class!

431
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:22,804
[background chatter]

432
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:24,423
You’re really great, bro!

433
00:39:24,783 --> 00:39:26,463
Can you believe it, man?

434
00:39:27,169 --> 00:39:30,079
Uh, Dex, congratulations!

435
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:33,494
But there’s still one quarter left
before graduation,

436
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:35,947
so don’t get too comfortable.

437
00:39:35,972 --> 00:39:38,002
The goal line is still far away.

438
00:39:38,172 --> 00:39:40,329
May the best student
finish at the top.

439
00:39:40,354 --> 00:39:42,915
If you say so.
Thanks, Azi.

440
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:51,595
Bro, it’s a miracle
she congratulated you...

441
00:39:51,952 --> 00:39:53,120
What’s up with that?

442
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:56,829
Yeah, bro. What’s up with that...

443
00:39:58,048 --> 00:40:01,376
- Damn, bro, really?
- No way!

444
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:04,787
Damn, Dex. You’re the man!

445
00:40:04,922 --> 00:40:07,841
You’re the man, bro!
So, what now?

446
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:09,610
You lost the bet to Dex and me.

447
00:40:19,761 --> 00:40:21,727
Azi, aren’t you worried

448
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:23,970
that Dex has overtaken you in the rankings?

449
00:40:24,914 --> 00:40:27,921
He put in the effort to get there,
so he deserves it.

450
00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:31,024
Did he put in the effort,
or did you slack off?

451
00:40:31,049 --> 00:40:33,750
Did you know Dex’s friends bet

452
00:40:34,753 --> 00:40:39,610
that he could overtake you in the rankings
by courting and distracting you?

453
00:40:39,664 --> 00:40:43,391
- In fact, I was the one who suggested it.
- My god, Misia.

454
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:45,676
How low can you go?

455
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,614
You’re really trying
to ruin Dex to me

456
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:49,375
after he broke up with you?

457
00:40:49,418 --> 00:40:53,633
And he replaced me with you?
Why? What do you have that I don’t?

458
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,099
What can you do that I can’t?

459
00:40:56,124 --> 00:40:57,751
Do you really want to know?

460
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:00,604
Yes, show me.

461
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,844
Prove that you’re better than me.

462
00:41:03,872 --> 00:41:06,286
That you deserve
Dex more than I do.

463
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,969
You're really
asking for it, huh?

464
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:41,121
I’ll ask my friends to add
some computer graphics

465
00:42:41,175 --> 00:42:45,695
to our audiovisual presentation,
and then we’re done.

466
00:42:45,992 --> 00:42:50,210
I’ll take care of printing and bookbinding
the research paper.

467
00:42:51,174 --> 00:42:54,921
I hope we get the highest grade.

468
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,170
It's possible.

469
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:01,765
That’s what all our teachers and classmates
expect from us,

470
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,570
so I hope we do.

471
00:43:10,648 --> 00:43:12,110
Is something wrong?

472
00:43:12,596 --> 00:43:15,848
Not really. It’s just...
Misia talked to me.

473
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:22,271
Is it true that you and your friends
made a bet on me?

474
00:43:27,883 --> 00:43:29,301
Answer me.

475
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,041
Did you really love me?

476
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,487
Or did you just use me?

477
00:43:37,562 --> 00:43:39,002
I just used you.

478
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,621
Look at me and say it.

479
00:43:45,953 --> 00:43:48,831
Did you love me,
or did you just use me?

480
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:53,365
I just used you!

481
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:09,713
Oh, Azi!

482
00:44:09,976 --> 00:44:11,245
You came right in time,

483
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:14,018
come join us for dinner.

484
00:44:14,978 --> 00:44:16,229
Hey, Azi!

485
00:44:16,598 --> 00:44:19,893
Change your clothes quickly
and come down here.

486
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,377
What's going on with your daughter?

487
00:44:24,643 --> 00:44:27,916
Leave her be.
Graduation is near,

488
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:31,448
- she might be stressed with school work.
- Stress? What stress?

489
00:44:31,495 --> 00:44:34,026
Azi, come down here!

490
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:35,552
Stupid!

491
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:38,461
You’re so stupid, Azi!

492
00:44:40,976 --> 00:44:42,937
You let yourself be fooled,

493
00:44:44,364 --> 00:44:46,385
be used by a guy?

494
00:44:47,979 --> 00:44:50,125
How could you be so dumb, Azi?

495
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:54,591
So stupid!

496
00:44:57,756 --> 00:44:59,315
So, so stupid!

497
00:45:33,705 --> 00:45:35,086
You know, Azi...

498
00:45:36,323 --> 00:45:37,714
I admire you...

499
00:45:38,494 --> 00:45:41,465
because you know exactly
what you want in life.

500
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:44,074
You know how to love yourself,

501
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:47,599
and because of that,
you also know how to love others.

502
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,544
As for me...

503
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:55,159
I just know I need to succeed
just for my parents.

504
00:45:56,001 --> 00:46:00,360
What if I can't achieve this?
Would they still love me?

505
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:04,276
I haven't experienced
being loved by someone else,

506
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:07,262
so I don't know how
to love others either.

507
00:46:08,635 --> 00:46:12,555
So when you asked me
if I loved you, or just used you,

508
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,780
I really didn't know how to answer.

509
00:46:16,734 --> 00:46:20,830
I don't want to tell you that I love you
when I'm not sure

510
00:46:21,391 --> 00:46:24,698
if what I feel for you is love.

511
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:29,784
I'm afraid of making a mistake
because it might blow up in my face.

512
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:32,104
And if that happens,

513
00:46:33,305 --> 00:46:35,159
I don't want you to get hurt.

514
00:46:35,713 --> 00:46:38,566
So it's better if you just
stay away from me.

515
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,922
And that’s the reason why I said
that I only used you.

516
00:47:27,507 --> 00:47:31,177
Azi, Dex, congratulations
on your research project

517
00:47:31,202 --> 00:47:33,955
on AI and the Future
of Philippine Education.

518
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:34,993
Job well done!

519
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,250
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you, ma'am.

520
00:47:36,275 --> 00:47:38,517
And good luck to both of you.

521
00:47:38,685 --> 00:47:42,021
I know you both deserve
to be the class valedictorian,

522
00:47:42,046 --> 00:47:44,424
but we can only select one,

523
00:47:44,517 --> 00:47:47,775
so may the best student win.

524
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,876
- Thank you, Ma’am.
- Thank you, Ma’am.

525
00:47:57,587 --> 00:47:58,896
Azi, wait...

526
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:05,681
I just want to tell you something...

527
00:48:06,032 --> 00:48:08,197
I wanted to apologize to you.

528
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:12,133
It's not necessary anymore.
I also have faults.

529
00:48:12,158 --> 00:48:14,251
I allowed myself to be vulnerable.

530
00:48:14,276 --> 00:48:16,970
Lesson learned. Then we move on.

531
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:18,415
That's how it is.

532
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,526
Is that so?

533
00:48:21,424 --> 00:48:22,970
Do you have anything else to say?

534
00:48:23,336 --> 00:48:24,415
Nothing more.

535
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,118
In that case...
see you at the graduation rites.

536
00:48:27,143 --> 00:48:30,376
Like Ma’am said,
may the best one win.

537
00:48:58,237 --> 00:49:00,689
Congratulations, Miss Valedictorian.

538
00:49:01,555 --> 00:49:02,746
Thank you.

539
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:05,657
And congratulations to
you too, Mr. Salutatorian.

540
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:09,806
- Did your parents make it?
- It's just my mom and my brother.

541
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:13,592
They went back to the car already.
I stayed behind to greet you.

542
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,837
Where are you heading for college?

543
00:49:14,862 --> 00:49:18,701
I got accepted to a tech university
in Singapore on a full scholarship.

544
00:49:18,726 --> 00:49:21,104
I'll be taking general subjects first.

545
00:49:21,129 --> 00:49:24,939
I'll decide on my specialization later.

546
00:49:24,964 --> 00:49:26,937
How about you?

547
00:49:26,962 --> 00:49:29,220
I got into the double-degree program

548
00:49:29,245 --> 00:49:33,235
in engineering and entrepreneurship
at a state university.

549
00:49:33,954 --> 00:49:35,892
Also on a full scholarship, of course.

550
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:41,993
Dex, thank you.

551
00:49:43,242 --> 00:49:46,251
Because of you, I've
come to know myself better.

552
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:48,415
Azi, thank you too.

553
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:52,341
I've learned so much about life from you.

554
00:50:04,986 --> 00:50:06,314
- Good luck.
- Good luck.
