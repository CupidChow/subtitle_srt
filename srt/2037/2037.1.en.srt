1
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,727
Mom!

2
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,677
I told you to not wait.

3
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:34,307
Ta-da!

4
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:38,282
It's not as good as pizza.

5
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,536
But it's your favorite, sticky rice cake.

6
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:42,674
It resembles you.

7
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:45,211
No, it doesn't.

8
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:54,220
Is it tasty?

9
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,700
Very much.

10
00:03:08,426 --> 00:03:12,500
This cosmos flower is way bigger than the one we saw yesterday.

11
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:16,984
But, Mom, don't bring me more.

12
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:19,797
They must feel pain, too.

13
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:25,091
Let's go.

14
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:36,060
Ta-da! Speaking practice time. You have to do it even if you don't want to.

15
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,005
You have to be able to converse with people who don't know sign language.

16
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:44,247
It's too hard and embarrassing.

17
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:45,541
You still have to do it.

18
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:50,025
Dad isn't around anymore. When I'm not around, what will you do?

19
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:53,683
You would be so sad if I had to take a break from school.

20
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:55,886
Right? Let's do it.

21
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:59,861
Let's practice again.

22
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:07,802
Hello.

23
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:10,107
Hello.

24
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:12,971
You should continue the conversation and respond with

25
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:16,770
"It's nice to meet you."

26
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:23,015
It's nice to meet you.

27
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:26,890
What is your name?

28
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,029
Kwon Kyeongsook.

29
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:31,759
Mom, you are doing so well.

30
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:38,940
Dad's hospital bills, all the loans... We paid them all back.

31
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:43,282
And now I'm healthy, too.

32
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,327
Can't you quit your part-time job?

33
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:48,041
I wish you could just focus on your studies.

34
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:52,992
I don't work for the money. It's fun!

35
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,305
I'm fine.

36
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,721
Mom, drink this often. You really should, all right?

37
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,890
[Tea is good for the bronchi. Which would work better?]

38
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:30,710
Did I not brew it right?

39
00:05:38,643 --> 00:05:40,270
Mom.

40
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:43,025
Mom.

41
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:55,851
Are you all right?

42
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:52,505
[2037]

43
00:06:52,506 --> 00:06:54,545
Did you kiss? Did you?

44
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:56,748
Wow!

45
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,260
Hey! I forgot.

46
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:02,351
Hey, did Yoonyoung pass her government employee test?

47
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:04,981
No, she failed Korean history just by a few points.

48
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:08,195
Wow. Then, she'll definitely pass next time. Right?

49
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:09,699
You bet!

50
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,744
But can you take the government employee test

51
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:14,391
without graduating high school?

52
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:18,341
How many times do I have to tell you that the test doesn't have degree requirements?

53
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:22,349
Our cutie doesn't remember anything, other than food. Right? Eat some more.

54
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,035
Eat up. Now that you say it, I remembered.

55
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:27,066
What is it?

56
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:29,371
I came prepared.

57
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:31,826
Oh, you have good sense.

58
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,497
She's coming. Hide it.

59
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:38,840
I told you guys not to eat outside food here.

60
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,431
The smell is distracting to the other customers.

61
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:43,433
Sis, this is food.

62
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:46,063
And this is food, too. You can't discriminate.

63
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:47,802
If my boss finds out, I'll get in trouble.

64
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:52,618
Sis, the boss here is really nice. Everyone knows that.

65
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:56,303
Right. Sis, sit down for a second.

66
00:07:56,303 --> 00:08:01,085
Your mom, she really doesn't know you're not back at school?

67
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,427
So you're not going to enroll again?

68
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:06,414
Why would she? It's unnecessary.

69
00:08:06,414 --> 00:08:09,211
Yoonyoung is so smart she can just take the GED.

70
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:10,662
Right.

71
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:12,950
That's true.

72
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,718
All right. This is our present.

73
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:20,875
Next time, you will certainly pass and become a government employee.

74
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,187
Eat slowly and make sure to chew.

75
00:08:23,188 --> 00:08:24,732
- You can do it!
- Fighting!

76
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:28,520
Yoonyoung, do you want YEOT for good luck?

77
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:32,575
Mom!

78
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:34,413
Did you get really hurt?

79
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:37,137
No, it's just a little bit.

80
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:40,106
But you still got hurt.

81
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:43,306
I'm sorry, I'll be careful.

82
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:45,836
Promise to be careful.

83
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,910
Right.

84
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,445
Please watch out for my mom.

85
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:52,825
And please let me know if anything happens.

86
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:56,332
Okay. The hospital said that she was okay.

87
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,710
So don't worry too much.

88
00:09:57,711 --> 00:09:59,913
All right. Thank you.

89
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,011
Let's go.

90
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:23,757
Kyeongsook.

91
00:11:32,216 --> 00:11:35,036
Easy does it.

92
00:11:46,695 --> 00:11:50,969
[My pretty mom, I'll be a little late. So don't wait for me outside in the heat. Stay home!]

93
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,424
Yoonyoung looks like her mother.

94
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:02,008
Yoonyoung keeps getting prettier

95
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:04,989
Because she resembles you.

96
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:10,385
She looks like her dad, that's where her good looks come from.

97
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:13,124
I don't know what you're saying.

98
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:15,169
But now that she's no longer a minor,

99
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:19,342
before she graduates, marry her to me.

100
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:25,956
There aren't men like me around.

101
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:30,916
I will make her happy every night.

102
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:37,087
Don't joke around about my daughter!

103
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:50,463
I guess she understood that part.

104
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:09,926
Yoonyoung.

105
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:12,707
Hello, sir.

106
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:14,438
Can I get one iced coffee?

107
00:13:14,438 --> 00:13:19,813
Of course. You're so kind to my mom, so this one is on the house.

108
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,399
But what are you doing here at this hour?

109
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,107
I went to the glasses store and stopped by on the way home.

110
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,163
I see, let me go get your drink.

111
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:33,934
You can take your time.

112
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,444
Yoonyoung!

113
00:15:45,881 --> 00:15:48,060
Yoonyoung!

114
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,386
Yoonyoung!

115
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:51,880
Your mother must be worried.

116
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,740
Yoonyoung,

117
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,138
you're smart.

118
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:21,029
So, you should know better.

119
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,929
If you report me, I will kill your mother.

120
00:17:27,443 --> 00:17:29,145
Oh, wait...

121
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:33,531
It's been awhile since that crippled father of yours died.

122
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:38,670
Maybe I should make her feel like a woman before I kill her.

123
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:43,842
Like I did to you.

124
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:06,695
Yoonyoung!

125
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,178
Yoonyoung!

126
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:18,995
I suddenly miss Kyeongsook.

127
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:26,518
Yoonyoung!

128
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:57,947
Yoonyoung!

129
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,080
Yoonyoung!

130
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,493
You should eat a little.

131
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:34,387
The body is too badly damaged to call this voluntary manslaughter.

132
00:19:34,387 --> 00:19:35,430
Goodness.

133
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:38,264
You could've hit him without killing him.

134
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:42,078
Look, don't take me wrong.

135
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:44,416
I'm not saying you did it.

136
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:48,549
Let's say the two of you had some sort of an agreement.

137
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:53,300
Whether it was about money or taking care of your mom.

138
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,298
If he was still alive,

139
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:58,530
we could do cross interrogation or

140
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,200
use a lie detector test to find out the truth.

141
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:08,657
There's no case where murder is accepted as an act of self-defense.

142
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:12,421
An act of retaliation, cannot fall under self-defense.

143
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:16,576
And if we want the self-defense ruling, we would have to prove the sexual assault.

144
00:20:16,576 --> 00:20:18,066
The two of you knew each other.

145
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:21,282
And kept in contact often, because of your mother.

146
00:20:21,283 --> 00:20:23,737
So the evidence from the scene isn't enough.

147
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:32,146
Plus, the perpetrator is dead. The legal matters are very complicated.

148
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:41,429
I don't care as long as my mother isn't hurt.

149
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:48,193
Your mother may suffer even more.

150
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:50,215
When you get sentenced,

151
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:54,750
even if you appeal, you have to go to jail before and during the trial.

152
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,347
And you don't have student identification. Your birthday has passed, too,

153
00:20:57,347 --> 00:21:01,183
So most likely, you won't be tried as a juvenile, you will have to go to prison.

154
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:08,844
Why don't we go public and get help from women's

155
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:12,550
rights organizations or social organizations?

156
00:21:19,632 --> 00:21:21,880
From all those people,

157
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,622
I'm scared of all the attention.

158
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,169
I don't want to do that.

159
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:33,250
Mom,

160
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:36,464
look at me.

161
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:41,524
Mom.

162
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:51,863
I have a favor to ask of you.

163
00:21:51,863 --> 00:21:55,519
Please do it for me.

164
00:21:58,636 --> 00:22:05,047
Mom, don't do anything for me.

165
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:10,308
Even if someone says they will help us, don't accept it.

166
00:22:13,974 --> 00:22:16,340
I'm already exhausted by people,

167
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:21,490
around me and at school watching me.

168
00:22:21,496 --> 00:22:26,731
I don't want the world to look at us with pity.

169
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:30,580
I... I...

170
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,563
I wouldn't be able to stand that.

171
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,528
I...

172
00:22:43,442 --> 00:22:46,479
I killed a man.

173
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:51,223
It wasn't your fault!

174
00:22:51,224 --> 00:22:55,857
Some people will point at me and call me a murderer.

175
00:22:55,858 --> 00:22:58,837
Mom, I don't think...

176
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:03,874
I'll be able to stand it.

177
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:14,729
I will announce the verdict.

178
00:23:15,272 --> 00:23:19,830
Case number 2017 Hight Court Agreement 174.

179
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,541
Defendant...

180
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:24,489
Jeong Yoonyoung.

181
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:27,922
We need the words of the perpetrator of the

182
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:29,936
sexual assault committed against the defendant.

183
00:23:29,936 --> 00:23:32,340
But due to the death of Kim Cheolmin,

184
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:35,471
the case leads to a lack of evidence.

185
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:38,510
This attack and retaliation cannot be

186
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:43,560
looked at as an act of self-defense.

187
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:49,540
However, there are other factors

188
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,550
to take into account, and thus,

189
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:55,034
the defendant Jeong Yoonyoung is...

190
00:23:56,153 --> 00:23:58,483
sentenced to five years.

191
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,170
What did he say?

192
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:09,797
[She's got 5 years.]

193
00:24:24,244 --> 00:24:26,221
Mom!

194
00:24:37,462 --> 00:24:39,872
No!

195
00:25:47,201 --> 00:25:49,520
Time to report.

196
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:55,349
She looks pretty.

197
00:25:56,219 --> 00:26:00,083
Tell me your name, crime, and sentence.

198
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:02,738
My...

199
00:26:02,738 --> 00:26:04,568
name is…

200
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:07,323
We'll hear from the new girl later.

201
00:26:07,324 --> 00:26:09,678
She looks like she's going to faint.

202
00:26:10,622 --> 00:26:14,545
But shouldn't she still report?

203
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:20,032
Put down your things and rest.

204
00:26:31,748 --> 00:26:34,744
Hey! I told you not to touch!!

205
00:26:38,637 --> 00:26:39,706
Hey, don't.

206
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:43,643
I said, don't this bitch!

207
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:46,434
Starting up again!

208
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:48,455
Don't!

209
00:26:48,455 --> 00:26:51,360
Wait! Wait!

210
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,846
Are you okay? She has anger management issues. She keeps blowing up.

211
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:58,074
You okay?

212
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:01,614
Woah, she's bleeding.

213
00:27:01,614 --> 00:27:03,402
I'm fine.

214
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:05,964
Oh, dear…

215
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:08,052
Hey!

216
00:27:09,657 --> 00:27:12,663
Because of your spit, it will get more infected.

217
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,963
Gross!

218
00:27:18,842 --> 00:27:21,555
What? It won't get infected!

219
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,468
Spit heals everything.

220
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:29,070
Is that why your face looks like that?

221
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,283
Shut the fuck up!

222
00:27:31,284 --> 00:27:36,308
My face is well taken care of, no thanks to you! Back off!!

223
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:04,013
Oh god, my arm.

224
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,758
Big Sis.

225
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,387
Big Sis.

226
00:28:19,472 --> 00:28:22,410
Please pray for her.

227
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,889
She was crying all night.

228
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,902
You can pray for her.

229
00:28:27,604 --> 00:28:32,671
I'd feel like I'm sinning even more if I pray, so I can't.

230
00:28:33,491 --> 00:28:35,453
You're not afraid of sinning,

231
00:28:35,454 --> 00:28:39,270
you're just afraid you'll feel more guilt. That's why you can't.

232
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:43,710
Oh…

233
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,720
Okay, take a deep breath.

234
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:49,097
Wipe it.

235
00:28:49,097 --> 00:28:50,910
Good job!

236
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,480
You'll get it.

237
00:28:52,488 --> 00:28:55,552
So weak! Only your tongue is working out, huh?

238
00:28:55,552 --> 00:28:58,260
Go down! One, two.

239
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,540
Come on, hurry up.

240
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:04,777
Be careful. Free supplies.

241
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:08,503
The soap will give your face mold.

242
00:29:08,503 --> 00:29:11,107
The toothbrush will rot your teeth.

243
00:29:11,108 --> 00:29:12,770
The towel will make your face blotchy.

244
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,951
The socks have so little material, so they'll give you athlete's foot.

245
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:19,407
Cut the crap will you?

246
00:29:19,408 --> 00:29:23,040
If you want to give them to her, just do it without the bullshit.

247
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,710
You just do your reading.

248
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,175
If she weren't my jail roommate,

249
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:30,805
I would've killed her alrelady.

250
00:29:40,742 --> 00:29:42,653
Use them well.

251
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,751
Thank you.

252
00:29:45,752 --> 00:29:49,259
You're pretty. You have baby skin,

253
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,012
and you're young.

254
00:29:51,012 --> 00:29:53,733
Lucky you, huh?

255
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:59,029
Since we have a new family member, let's have a feast for breakfast!

256
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,450
We ate like this last night.

257
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:03,346
Also, this is all Haesoo's food.

258
00:30:03,346 --> 00:30:05,665
Shut up and just eat,

259
00:30:05,665 --> 00:30:07,587
will you? Unless you want to go to the doctor first thing in the morning.

260
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:09,491
You thief bitch!

261
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:13,724
What? You have a lot of money outside from all your scam and fraud.

262
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:15,686
You have to give back in places like this.

263
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:18,317
You have to expiate a little.

264
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:21,264
You always talk of expiation! Sick of it!

265
00:30:21,264 --> 00:30:24,128
You guys are so simple and impulsive.

266
00:30:24,128 --> 00:30:27,151
I'm just happy because I'm eating for free.

267
00:30:27,151 --> 00:30:29,913
Come here.

268
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:31,301
Wow.

269
00:30:31,302 --> 00:30:33,305
Relax and eat up.

270
00:30:33,305 --> 00:30:36,112
Whether in here or out there, it's all the same. You'll manage.

271
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:38,007
Just go with the flow and mingle.

272
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:41,321
You learn this bitch is like this, that bitch is like that.

273
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:45,439
Big Sis used to be a teacher.

274
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:48,778
So she speaks in a way that's so easy to understand.

275
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:52,161
Penal labor is literally forced labor.

276
00:30:52,161 --> 00:30:55,934
So since we have to work, make sure you're full!

277
00:30:57,855 --> 00:31:01,335
New one, where do you want to work?

278
00:31:01,335 --> 00:31:03,907
Sarang, Rose, that idiot,

279
00:31:03,908 --> 00:31:07,123
and Haesoo, the idiot, all work at the repair shop.

280
00:31:07,124 --> 00:31:09,961
And Big Sis and I work at the woodworking shop.

281
00:31:09,962 --> 00:31:12,300
Big Sis is really amazing.

282
00:31:12,301 --> 00:31:13,811
She is a death row inmate so

283
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:16,015
she doesn't have to work, but she still does.

284
00:31:16,015 --> 00:31:17,393
Shit, I must be out of my mind.

285
00:31:17,394 --> 00:31:19,563
That big mouth!

286
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,650
Excuse me.

287
00:31:22,654 --> 00:31:26,562
Which place pays you best?

288
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:28,264
Huh?

289
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:34,565
The repair shop pays best, but the work is shit.

290
00:31:34,565 --> 00:31:36,874
You get hurt and bleed.

291
00:31:36,874 --> 00:31:39,503
I'll do that one.

292
00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:40,882
I have to earn money.

293
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:43,946
You're a level 4 so you won't be paid much.

294
00:31:43,947 --> 00:31:45,116
Two to three dollars.

295
00:31:45,117 --> 00:31:46,118
In one day?

296
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:46,904
In one month.

297
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,314
Hey, don't joke around.

298
00:31:48,314 --> 00:31:51,327
You'll get 30-40 dollars a month.

299
00:31:52,297 --> 00:31:56,011
Try out the repair shop.Try other ones out, too.

300
00:31:56,012 --> 00:31:59,609
Then decide what fits you best.

301
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:01,272
Okay.

302
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,724
But...

303
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:10,198
You are you ranked higher?

304
00:32:10,198 --> 00:32:12,886
Why is your uniform pink?

305
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,402
What? My clothes,

306
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:17,346
these!

307
00:32:17,347 --> 00:32:19,767
She's a model prisoner.

308
00:32:19,768 --> 00:32:22,616
Not on the catwalk but here in jail, she's the good one.

309
00:32:22,616 --> 00:32:25,362
I can't agree.

310
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:28,994
The world is so unfair, whether it's here or out there!

311
00:32:28,995 --> 00:32:32,275
How is that idiot a model prisoner?

312
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:34,665
Pink suits me so well.

313
00:32:34,665 --> 00:32:36,343
Hey!

314
00:32:36,344 --> 00:32:40,392
Stop talking nonsense. Eat up, and get ready for work.

315
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:43,481
Yes, Big Sis. Should I give you a chicken wing?

00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:09,083
Hey there, get back in line.

318
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,662
Go!

319
00:33:15,864 --> 00:33:17,549

00:33:47,594 --> 00:33:49,890
Can you answer properly?

00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,403
Yes, I am here to work.

327
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,255
What's your inmate number?

328
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:01,037
It is 2037.

329
00:34:01,037 --> 00:34:02,331
Remember that number.

330

You expect to get paid?

00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:36,607
You think the hard-earned tax dollars of

353

citizens are paid out to you so you can spend it?

How dare you! It's her first time.

355
00:36:42,304 --> 00:36:46,345
Besides, we do get paid for the work.

356
00:36:46,345 --> 00:36:48,563
And on special occasions if we make a request,

357
00:36:48,564 --> 00:36:51,152
we can use that money as our allowance to buy things here.

00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:45,603
If you ever feel your life's in danger,

365
00:37:45,603 --> 00:37:47,356
run and press that button.

366
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:50,587
The guards will come save you.

367
00:37:50,588 --> 00:37:52,508
You're exaggerating.

368
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:54,121
Why you brat!

369
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:56,266
I'm holding myself back.

370
00:37:56,267 --> 00:37:59,031
Because I don't want to add more years and serve life in here.

371
00:37:59,031 --> 00:38:00,315
Why?

372
00:38:00,316 --> 00:38:03,112
So you can leave and become a pimp?

373
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:04,240
What?

374
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:07,288
Are you being nice to the new one

375
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:10,042
so you can sell her once you're out?

376
00:38:10,043 --> 00:38:13,684
How can you have such a filthy mouth?

377
00:38:13,684 --> 00:38:16,790
Don't listen to her. It's all a lie.

This girl is different from the rest of us.

You, bitch, belong here, but this one,

381
00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:26,033
she's in here unfairly.

382
00:38:26,034 --> 00:38:27,087
Is that so?

383
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:30,917
Then, why aren't you writing to the judge every day?

384
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:33,381
I told you I'm holding myself back

385
00:38:33,382 --> 00:38:35,603
because I don't want a life sentence.

386
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:39,685
You have no other future than being a pimp,

387
00:38:39,686 --> 00:38:42,451
so why don't you kill Haesoo and become a lifer?

388
00:38:42,451 --> 00:38:44,027
That's what I'm saying.

You come here, huh!

Let's just live here forever.

I'm really sorry, but...

can you guys please be quiet?

402

Child,

403
00:39:31,396 --> 00:39:33,884
what's your name?

404
00:39:34,755 --> 00:39:36,741
It's Yoonyoung.

405
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:07,810
I had a son.

406
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:17,030
A drunk driver hit and killed him, and drove away.

407
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:25,054
So you know what I did?

408
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,160
The driver eventually turned himself in, but I set his house on fire.

409
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:35,010
I ended up killing his five family members who were asleep in the house.

410
00:40:40,745 --> 00:40:46,355
When I'm awake, my guilt chokes me.

411
00:40:46,355 --> 00:40:50,305
When I'm asleep, the people I killed choke me.

412
00:40:53,738 --> 00:40:56,517
Don't hold it inside.

413
00:40:56,517 --> 00:41:00,225
Write letters, pray, do something, anything to let it out.

That's how you live on.

415
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:35,568
Mom,

416
00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:41,930
it's me, Yoonyoung.

417
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,819
You're not sick, right?

418
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:47,100
If you feel any pain, go to the hospital.

419
00:41:47,101 --> 00:41:49,656
Don't worry about the money.

420
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,410

Mom, I'm sorry.

423
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:27,632
Did she get hit in the head with a hammer?

424
00:42:28,786 --> 00:42:31,766
We need to send her to see the doctor.

425
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:34,462
She's adjusting quickly.

00:42:45,294 --> 00:42:46,420

00:42:46,421 --> 00:42:48,132
Huh?

428
00:42:48,926 --> 00:42:51,797
How can I send a letter?

429
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:56,399
You put your letter in an envelope and then put a stamp on it.

430
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,444
I know that, but...

431
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:00,314
See that?

432
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:04,507

How can this be?

529
00:53:35,811 --> 00:53:39,177
She's just a kid! She should be running around in a school uniform.

530
00:53:39,177 --> 00:53:43,148
Seriously... How far along is she?

531
00:53:43,148 --> 00:53:46,248

532
00:53:46,249 --> 00:53:50,514
This is big. She's going to end up having that baby.

533
00:53:50,514 --> 00:53:52,186
Of course, she'll have the baby.

534
00:53:52,186 --> 00:53:54,232

Oh no...

543
00:54:20,259 --> 00:54:24,366
So it's not easy to prove that is was a sexual assault.

544
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:27,476
Because of that, It wasn't ruled as an act of self-defense,

545
00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:29,776
but rather, bodily injury resulting in death.

546
00:54:29,776 --> 00:54:34,212
A bastard like that deserves to get his brain squashed to death.

547
00:54:34,212 --> 00:54:36,499
What's wrong with that?!

548
00:54:36,499 --> 00:54:40,130
That's the law.

549
00:54:41,076 --> 00:54:42,886
You're kidding, right?

550
00:54:42,886 --> 00:54:46,158
So did you end up here because you followed the law?

551
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:48,471
Fuck you.

552
00:54:48,471 --> 00:54:51,998
Well, I don't know about the rest of us, but Yoonyoung's different. It is not her fault.

553
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:55,729
Shit. Who out of all of us isn't being wrongfully accused!!

554
00:54:56,915 --> 00:55:02,416
But there's nothing we can do.

555
00:55:02,416 --> 00:55:05,758
The baby's done nothing wrong. Yoonyoung has to give birth!

556
00:55:05,758 --> 00:55:11,185
Fuck! The baby is at fault! Its very existence itself is wrong! Fuck!

557
00:55:12,379 --> 00:55:14,490
Hey, fuc—

558
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,129
You—

559
00:55:16,129 --> 00:55:17,981
Hey!

560
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,502
Why you bitch!

561
00:55:20,502 --> 00:55:23,659
I was nice to you because you were an orphan.

562
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,206
But now you just act up like you don't know anything! Shit.

563
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,876
You want to die?

564
00:55:27,877 --> 00:55:30,631
Great! Go ahead!! Kill me! Go!

565
00:55:30,632 --> 00:55:31,592
You crazy bitch!!

566
00:55:31,593 --> 00:55:33,378
Stop!

567
00:55:35,225 --> 00:55:38,481
You think dying is that easy? Killing is that easy?

568
00:55:38,482 --> 00:55:43,002
I could kill all of you here tonight, nothing changes for me. I'm still the same death row inmate.

569
00:55:43,575 --> 00:55:46,529
Is it the same for you guys? Huh?

570
00:55:52,134 --> 00:55:53,861
Sir!

571
00:55:55,014 --> 00:55:57,144
- Open the door.
- Yes.

572
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,508
Oh no... Now, now...

573
00:56:38,508 --> 00:56:42,299
You can't let your heart freeze up like this.

574
00:56:43,903 --> 00:56:45,898
Sweetie...

575
00:57:01,147 --> 00:57:04,220
Even if it's hard, you have to push through.

576
00:57:16,219 --> 00:57:18,138
Teacher…

577
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:30,422
I want to live…

578
00:57:39,983 --> 00:57:41,836
Yes,

579
00:57:43,189 --> 00:57:45,217
you have to.

580
00:57:46,946 --> 00:57:49,092
You have to live well.

581
00:57:59,707 --> 00:58:02,141
Rose...

582
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:04,598
Rose, this...

583
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,900
Goodness! This is driving me crazy!

584
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:09,940
Here, here!

585
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,229
It ain't easy, is it?

586
00:58:13,258 --> 00:58:15,294
Lay down.

587
00:58:16,522 --> 00:58:19,202
Don't do anything, just lay down.

588
00:58:29,682 --> 00:58:32,011
What are you going to do now?

589
00:58:37,229 --> 00:58:39,768
Stop thinking about it and just take care of it.

590
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:41,496
Why you!

591
00:58:41,496 --> 00:58:43,616
Are you the mom!

592
00:58:44,362 --> 00:58:47,992
What has the baby done wrong!

593
00:58:47,993 --> 00:58:50,373
Rose, you say something!

594
00:58:50,374 --> 00:58:53,271
Well, it's not a baby yet.

595
00:58:53,271 --> 00:58:55,232
- It's just a fetus.
- Hey!

596
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:56,593
What a joke!

597
00:58:56,594 --> 00:58:59,099
You guys are all just words, you can't really be of any help.

598
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,687
Want me to help you? This is what you do.

599
00:59:01,688 --> 00:59:03,941
Why would you carry such a son of a bitch in your womb!!

600
00:59:03,942 --> 00:59:05,695
Hey!! Shit. You come here.

601
00:59:05,696 --> 00:59:07,740
You crazy bitch, what are you saying!

602
00:59:07,741 --> 00:59:10,871
What do you think you're doing!

603
00:59:10,872 --> 00:59:12,509
Pitiful bitch!

604
00:59:12,509 --> 00:59:15,140
Once a prostitute and you became a pimp, so does that make you feel some sympathy?

605
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,637
Since your womb is gone, are you jealous of the baby or something?

606
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,400
Shit. Yeah, I'm jealous.

607
00:59:22,312 --> 00:59:25,818
I didn't know when back then.

608
00:59:25,819 --> 00:59:29,141
But since I've lost it, I'm jealous!

609
00:59:29,141 --> 00:59:32,630
You son of a bitch!

610
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:33,580
Fuck you!

611
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,862
Seriously, fuck you!

612
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:38,677
Crazy bitch. Why were you even born?

613
00:59:38,678 --> 00:59:40,880
Fucking bitch.

614
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,350
You fucking bitch!

615
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:45,430
Mother fucker!

616
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:49,820
Fuck you! I should kill you!

617
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,791
What are you guys doing fighting here?

618
00:59:53,792 --> 00:59:55,844
Lock'em up!

619
01:00:03,436 --> 01:00:06,157
Feel sorry for what you've done.

620
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:28,193
If you don't eat, it's only your loss.

621
01:00:28,194 --> 01:00:31,367
Whether you like it or not, you have to eat to live.

622
01:00:36,586 --> 01:00:40,384
If there's anything you want to eat, request it.

623
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:47,398
The warden said you can use the money in custody.

624
01:00:47,399 --> 01:00:49,845
So don't worry about money.

625
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:02,736
Why can't I visit? Visit.

626
01:01:02,736 --> 01:01:05,200
Wait… Wait.

627
01:01:06,019 --> 01:01:08,106
You can take your time.

628
01:01:13,158 --> 01:01:15,220
It's okay.

629
01:01:19,823 --> 01:01:22,119
Did anything happen to my daughter?

630
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:25,382
It's nothing like that.

631
01:01:26,152 --> 01:01:28,271
Wait.

632
01:01:35,747 --> 01:01:39,003
Your daughter is refusing all visits.

633
01:01:41,174 --> 01:01:44,363
Why... Why...

634
01:01:44,363 --> 01:01:46,100
Why?

635
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,888
Why?! My daughter...!

636
01:01:52,855 --> 01:01:54,920
I'm sorry.

637
01:01:55,491 --> 01:01:57,823
There's nothing I can do to help.

638
01:02:00,045 --> 01:02:05,420
I'm sorry. It will be difficult for you to visit today.

639
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,720
Thank you.

640
01:02:41,002 --> 01:02:46,577
I'm sorry. It will be difficult for you to visit today.

641
01:03:40,962 --> 01:03:45,472
Big Sis told me to bring this to you because you're not eating anything.

642
01:03:56,452 --> 01:03:58,962
Those bitches.

643
01:04:01,662 --> 01:04:03,850
Hello, everyone. Nice to see you all.

644
01:04:07,824 --> 01:04:10,730
Wow, you're really pretty.

645
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:14,328
Can you guys get out?

646
01:04:14,328 --> 01:04:20,691
Our sis wants to talk to this pretty one.

647
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:28,500
Our sis just wants to have a chat.

648
01:04:48,696 --> 01:04:50,506
Hey, Pretty.

649
01:04:51,253 --> 01:04:53,374
2037.

650
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,758
I hear you're the youngest ace here.

651
01:04:59,828 --> 01:05:02,016
Do you know me?

652
01:05:02,016 --> 01:05:05,046
Do you really not know our sister?

653
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:09,079
I'm the bitch from Bulgwang.

654
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:12,577
I'm the bitch from Ssangmun.

655
01:05:15,635 --> 01:05:20,440
Let's go to the bathroom together.

656
01:05:29,772 --> 01:05:32,594
If I kill you, this will be my sixth murder.

657
01:05:32,594 --> 01:05:34,097
Do you want to watch?

658
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:35,716
What are you doing, Sis?

659
01:05:35,717 --> 01:05:38,147
I told you not to bother the girls in my room.

660
01:05:38,147 --> 01:05:41,378
All right, I understand.

661
01:05:41,378 --> 01:05:42,991
I made a mistake.

662
01:05:42,991 --> 01:05:47,489
But you still need to be punished for ignoring my warning.

663
01:06:22,394 --> 01:06:25,842
I told you to get rid of the baby not you, bitch.

664
01:06:25,842 --> 01:06:29,283
You don't have the guts to kill yourself. What's with this fucking shit!

665
01:06:30,201 --> 01:06:31,953
If you can't kill yourself,

666
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:33,866
then have the baby! Abandon it, raise it, or kill it.

667
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:36,504
Do whatever, you fucking bitch!

668
01:06:36,505 --> 01:06:38,682
What is going on!

669
01:06:41,223 --> 01:06:43,534
1733.

670
01:06:48,429 --> 01:06:52,450
If 2037 lost her baby, that would have added murder to your list.

671
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:54,875
Please don't make trouble here.

672
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,790
Instead of suffering like this,

673
01:07:08,786 --> 01:07:12,894
why don't we get help from the press or some civic groups?

674
01:07:12,894 --> 01:07:18,197
If we can get the public opinion on your side, it will be a lot of help to you.

675
01:07:18,197 --> 01:07:23,439
I'm sorry. I don't want to get any help.

676
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:29,234
Why not? I mean, we can't even if we wanted to.

677
01:07:29,235 --> 01:07:31,707
Yeah!! You have to get help!

678
01:07:31,707 --> 01:07:34,954
There's the baby! And you are still so young.

679
01:07:34,955 --> 01:07:38,804
You have to get out of here as soon as possible and live your life.

680
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:41,668
I'd rather spend 5 years here.

681
01:07:41,668 --> 01:07:46,040
It would be much more painful to live in shame hiding from the rest of the world forever.

682
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:49,760
I'm sure some people will have sympathy,

683
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:54,001
but people will know I have a baby and that I am a murderer.

684
01:07:54,001 --> 01:07:57,542
And when my frail mom finds out I am pregnant,

685
01:07:58,636 --> 01:08:03,084
she will really die.

686
01:08:03,084 --> 01:08:05,875
She's suffering enough as is.

687
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:08,560
A mother is much stronger...

688
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,664
than you may think.

689
01:08:13,664 --> 01:08:16,037
But I still don't want to see...

690
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:19,736
my mom getting hurt.

691
01:08:19,736 --> 01:08:21,797
You're right.

692
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:26,220
As a woman, a normal life is so much better

693
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:29,270
than one receiving pity from everyone.

694
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,825
All right then.

695
01:08:31,593 --> 01:08:33,630
Let's put our faith in...

696
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:37,720
a request for retrial.

697
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,552
We should also request a jury.

698
01:08:40,553 --> 01:08:42,720
The jury and the judge will...

699
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,100
understand what you're going through.

700
01:08:45,813 --> 01:08:51,908
Then, an abortion will be possible by proving a sexual assault.

701
01:08:51,909 --> 01:08:56,417
So don't punch your stomach or hurt yourself in any way.

702
01:08:56,418 --> 01:09:01,954
Don't. Let's ask them to push up the retrial date.

703
01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:03,966
Ask who?

704
01:09:04,726 --> 01:09:08,316
Everyone who's awaiting trial...

705
01:09:08,317 --> 01:09:12,574
thinks their case is urgent and that their trial date should be pushed up.

706
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:14,663
Shit. What do we do?

707
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:23,612
2037.

708
01:09:24,933 --> 01:09:27,213
Is the date set for the retrial?

709
01:09:27,213 --> 01:09:32,598
No. But from now on, 2037 will be in the security division working full-time.

710
01:09:32,598 --> 01:09:33,825
Why?

711
01:09:33,826 --> 01:09:36,706
It's a special order from the warden. Let's go.

712
01:09:36,707 --> 01:09:38,386
Can't I just keep working here?

713
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:41,976
They pay you more than here, so don't worry and just move.

714
01:09:41,976 --> 01:09:45,224
Besides, it's much easier to go to the nurse's office from there.

715
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:48,997
Sir!

716
01:09:53,824 --> 01:09:56,078
Why you!

717
01:10:06,098 --> 01:10:08,470
The work's not that hard.

718
01:10:10,733 --> 01:10:13,764
You open up all the goods purchased from outside,

719
01:10:13,764 --> 01:10:17,380
and you check to see if there's anything fishy in there.

720
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,875
If it's medicine, it goes to the nurse's office.

721
01:10:19,876 --> 01:10:27,139
And the letters... go to the different rooms.

722
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,226
Yes.

723
01:10:29,696 --> 01:10:32,651
You can clean a little bit.

724
01:10:32,652 --> 01:10:36,611
And if anyone below me makes you run errands, you can let me know.

725
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:38,414
Okay?

726
01:11:00,897 --> 01:11:05,831
Mom, you're doing okay. Right?

727
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:14,447
I can't bare to see you.

728
01:11:15,502 --> 01:11:21,712
Just one year, can you wait just one year?

729
01:11:22,673 --> 01:11:28,514
If I work hard and become a model inmate, they'll even let me study.

730
01:11:30,808 --> 01:11:35,031
Always keep your inhaler nearby.

731
01:11:35,031 --> 01:11:38,439
So make herbal medicine and drink it often.

732
01:11:39,584 --> 01:11:42,110
Don't worry about me.

733
01:11:43,309 --> 01:11:45,731
I love you, Mom.

734
01:13:00,356 --> 01:13:05,316
You're six months pregnant, but the baby is very small.

735
01:13:05,316 --> 01:13:09,616
The baby weighs only 300g.

736
01:13:09,616 --> 01:13:11,252
Do you know why?

737
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:13,649
The baby reads the mom's mind.

738
01:13:13,649 --> 01:13:17,207
Because the mom is rejecting the baby, the baby is hiding away in the womb.

739
01:13:17,207 --> 01:13:19,710
And that's why there are no changes to your body.

740
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:23,860
The baby being so small, will there be health problems?

741
01:13:23,861 --> 01:13:28,745
All the organs and overall health of the baby are good.

742
01:13:28,746 --> 01:13:32,420
And the heartbeat is very strong, too. Listen.

743
01:14:06,697 --> 01:14:08,890
2037.

744
01:14:09,703 --> 01:14:11,471
Yes.

745
01:14:14,921 --> 01:14:17,868
Is there anything you want to eat?

746
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:25,709
Sticky rice cake.

747
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:29,749
Sticky rice cake?

748
01:14:31,921 --> 01:14:33,950
It's okay.

749
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:55,376
If you're so curious, ask her yourself!

750
01:14:55,377 --> 01:14:57,480
All right, all right!

751
01:14:58,342 --> 01:15:00,596
What did they say at the hospital?

752
01:15:01,731 --> 01:15:04,060
They said I'm six months along.

753
01:15:07,025 --> 01:15:09,020
Six months?!

754
01:15:10,282 --> 01:15:14,115
Your stomach is not showing at all but you're six months?

755
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:17,838
They said the baby is hiding.

756
01:15:17,839 --> 01:15:21,936
Hiding? The baby is hiding in the stomach?

757
01:15:21,936 --> 01:15:24,719
The baby knows how I'm feeling.

758
01:15:26,339 --> 01:15:29,653
Wow. Knows the mother's feelings.

759
01:15:29,654 --> 01:15:35,049
Don't hide. I thought you lost the baby, I was so worried!

760
01:15:35,049 --> 01:15:37,919
- You should be worried because it's not!
- Shit.

761
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,578
Lila, give this to the youngest.

762
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:44,457
Sure!

763
01:15:47,573 --> 01:15:51,100
Youngest, our youngest baby.

764
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:54,840
This will keep you warm. Sleep tight.

765
01:16:33,624 --> 01:16:39,583
Watch it! Must you wash while I'm in here?

766
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:41,680
Then stop peeing.

767
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:45,947
I am finished now, you rascal!

768
01:16:51,535 --> 01:16:54,498
Please let me do something.

769
01:16:54,499 --> 01:16:57,086
It's fine. I'll get in trouble.

770
01:16:57,087 --> 01:17:00,534
- I'll do it.
- Go away.

771
01:17:04,769 --> 01:17:07,022
Will you stop spitting!

772
01:17:07,023 --> 01:17:11,967
Big Sis, this would be clean enough for the little one. Right?

773
01:17:15,249 --> 01:17:19,307
Oh, wow! It hasn't been long since breakfast but you're hungry again.

774
01:17:19,307 --> 01:17:21,118
I'm not hungry.

775
01:17:21,118 --> 01:17:24,558
Someone give her something to eat. The baby is hungry!

776
01:17:24,559 --> 01:17:27,281
- Am I a prison pantry to you?
- Of course.

777
01:17:27,281 --> 01:17:29,244
Ugh, you stupid bitch.

778
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:33,933
That's not her being hungry, it's the baby moving!

779
01:17:33,933 --> 01:17:36,214
Baby moving?

780
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:43,304
The baby is swimming inside the womb.

781
01:17:43,305 --> 01:17:45,970
Swim?!

782
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:49,990
Seriously! My god!

783
01:18:09,482 --> 01:18:10,775
1733.

784
01:18:10,776 --> 01:18:11,620
Yes.

785
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:12,930
Visitor.

786
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:14,182
A visitor?

787
01:18:14,182 --> 01:18:17,330
Since you've been here, it's your first visitor. Right?

788
01:18:17,331 --> 01:18:19,485
I don't have anyone to come and visit me.

789
01:18:19,485 --> 01:18:21,181
Is that something to be proud of?

790
01:18:21,181 --> 01:18:23,509
Go to the admin office, first.

791
01:18:31,543 --> 01:18:33,478
Good.

792
01:18:34,182 --> 01:18:39,907
Let's pick a bank and create an account for you.

793
01:18:40,669 --> 01:18:42,580
Why?

794
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,807
Why do I need a bank account?

795
01:18:47,808 --> 01:18:50,104
Ah, well...

796
01:18:51,549 --> 01:18:55,481
Your father's name is Yoo Dongwon. Right?

797
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,311
I don't know anyone like that.

798
01:18:57,311 --> 01:19:01,743
Okay. The paper says your father is Yoo Dongwon.

799
01:19:01,743 --> 01:19:07,722
He was working at a construction site but he fell and died.

800
01:19:08,959 --> 01:19:12,934
He left behind some inheritance. About $8000.

801
01:19:12,934 --> 01:19:15,871
I don't need anything like that.

802
01:19:15,871 --> 01:19:18,210
I knew you would say that.

803
01:19:18,211 --> 01:19:20,215
But there's this procedure.

804
01:19:20,216 --> 01:19:23,179
Who else would get the money? It has to go to a family member.

805
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:25,991
So just open an account.

806
01:19:25,991 --> 01:19:29,441
You'll be getting some insurance payment later, too.

807
01:19:29,442 --> 01:19:33,723
You can take care of that when you get out.

808
01:19:38,585 --> 01:19:40,563
Here, take it.

809
01:19:45,131 --> 01:19:47,268
What about the body?

810
01:19:51,736 --> 01:19:56,144
Hey! Are you curious about it?

811
01:19:57,448 --> 01:19:59,710
What about the body?

812
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:02,507
They couldn't reach the family,

813
01:20:02,508 --> 01:20:04,761
and he didn't have a home.

814
01:20:04,762 --> 01:20:08,010
It was determined a body with no affiliation, so they cremated the body.

815
01:20:59,839 --> 01:21:04,815
I solemnly swear that I will speak the truth under oath.

816
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,631
The prosecution can proceed.

817
01:21:17,892 --> 01:21:19,871
Members of the jury,

818
01:21:20,956 --> 01:21:24,387
the lawful assessment has shown already that this

819
01:21:24,387 --> 01:21:26,976
cannot be proven to be an act of self-defense.

820
01:21:26,977 --> 01:21:29,030
To put it simply,

821
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:34,473
if a thief comes in with a knife, you can't shoot him dead with a gun.

822
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,245
In other words,

823
01:21:36,246 --> 01:21:38,825
if you use a weapon,

824
01:21:38,825 --> 01:21:42,917
or if you cause the other person more harm than the other person did to you,

825
01:21:42,917 --> 01:21:46,216
it can be ruled as excessive self-defense.

826
01:21:46,216 --> 01:21:47,976
Okay...

827
01:21:49,313 --> 01:21:54,080
Even if the defendant truly was sexually assaulted,

828
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:58,457
murder cannot be considered an acceptable retaliation.

829
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:01,545
The jury must also already know

830
01:22:01,546 --> 01:22:05,629
Article 11 subparagraph 1 of the Constitution states:

831
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:10,120
"All people are equal under the law."

832
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:14,070
This is the logic and foundation of the law,

833
01:22:14,872 --> 01:22:18,561
and critical to society's rules.

834
01:22:23,882 --> 01:22:28,350
Now the defense may proceed.

835
01:22:30,704 --> 01:22:35,387
Your honor, the defendant would not like to speak further.

836
01:22:39,989 --> 01:22:45,165
Does the defendant not want to give a final statement?

837
01:22:52,915 --> 01:22:54,893
I will.

838
01:23:00,681 --> 01:23:03,168
I did kill someone.

839
01:23:05,499 --> 01:23:08,036
You don't have to believe me but...

840
01:23:11,218 --> 01:23:14,056
I was also sexually assaulted.

841
01:23:14,056 --> 01:23:16,962
I will do as you say.

842
01:23:16,962 --> 01:23:21,222
If the judge says five years, I'll do it. If the judge says 10 years, I'll do the 10 years.

843
01:23:24,578 --> 01:23:27,008
I will serve my time that you give me...

844
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:32,561
and then return home and live with my mom.

845
01:23:37,321 --> 01:23:39,460
As if this were all a dream,

846
01:23:41,412 --> 01:23:43,959
as if nothing had happened...

847
01:23:47,499 --> 01:23:50,229
I just want to go back to my mom.

848
01:23:55,357 --> 01:23:57,242
But...

849
01:24:03,113 --> 01:24:05,811
For me... this place is so scary...

850
01:24:09,109 --> 01:24:11,089
and difficult.

851
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:21,500
[Today is the day of the Trial by Jury.]

852
01:24:37,191 --> 01:24:39,520
We will now announce the verdict.

853
01:24:41,949 --> 01:24:46,134
The jury's verdict and the judges' verdict are the same.

854
01:24:46,134 --> 01:24:52,436
We reverse the original verdict.

855
01:24:54,225 --> 01:24:56,311
Even if there was no sexual assault

856
01:24:56,312 --> 01:24:58,899
and the relationship was a consensual one,

857
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:02,933
it is clear that the encounter was violent and coercive.

858
01:25:02,933 --> 01:25:06,090
Thus, even though it cannot be ruled as an act of

859
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:10,664
self-defense due to the severity of the defense,

860
01:25:10,664 --> 01:25:13,345
given the circumstances,

861
01:25:13,346 --> 01:25:16,394
there is enough reason to take the situation into account...

862
01:25:17,813 --> 01:25:21,068
and the sentence can be shortened.

863
01:25:21,069 --> 01:25:23,439
However,

864
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:26,203
due to the charge of lethal injury,

865
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:28,885
Defendant Jeong Yoonyoung...

866
01:25:31,131 --> 01:25:34,680
is sentenced to one year.

867
01:25:44,817 --> 01:25:50,536
A particularly cold winter has gone by, and spring has arrived at last.

868
01:25:50,537 --> 01:25:53,083
The first song of the day is

869
01:25:53,084 --> 01:25:55,490
"Across the River Spring Arrives"

870
01:25:55,490 --> 01:26:00,020
[Correction]

871
01:26:19,053 --> 01:26:21,265
Hey! Be careful, and at least try to hide it.

872
01:26:21,266 --> 01:26:24,354
If they know you made a knife out of a nail, you'll go into solitary confinement!

873
01:26:24,355 --> 01:26:26,400
Why do you care, Sis?

874
01:26:26,401 --> 01:26:29,273
Did you just call me Sis? Wow

875
01:26:29,273 --> 01:26:32,536
You've finally become a human being now. You can leave this place tomorrow.

876
01:26:32,536 --> 01:26:34,466
Bullshit.

877
01:26:34,466 --> 01:26:36,194
You crazy!

878
01:26:37,706 --> 01:26:41,263
Can we please speak more elegantly?

879
01:26:41,264 --> 01:26:42,473
Bullshit.

880
01:26:42,474 --> 01:26:45,313
Shit, the baby is listening... Shit

881
01:26:45,314 --> 01:26:46,857
I'm so sorry.

882
01:26:46,858 --> 01:26:50,072
Where are you? Wow, the baby's hiding.

883
01:26:50,073 --> 01:26:54,914
Come out. Get some sun, swim freely.

884
01:26:54,915 --> 01:26:57,763
If you have no sense, at least have some sensitivity.

885
01:26:57,763 --> 01:26:59,633
Are you asking for it?

886
01:27:02,306 --> 01:27:04,601
If only I got caught just a month later,

887
01:27:04,602 --> 01:27:07,120
I wouldn't be here being humiliated and treated like this.

888
01:27:10,906 --> 01:27:14,903
These ladies got caught for:

889
01:27:14,903 --> 01:27:16,416
a prostitution ring,

890
01:27:16,417 --> 01:27:20,775
pyramid scheme fraud, and violence! I am not like them.

891
01:27:20,775 --> 01:27:24,558
I am in for adultery. I got caught just a month before the adultery law was abolished.

892
01:27:26,938 --> 01:27:30,611
Wow! You're going to make a passsing mosquito vomit.

893
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:35,746
You were seeing three men at once!

894
01:27:35,747 --> 01:27:39,337
Sis, you can't explain love in numbers!

895
01:27:39,338 --> 01:27:41,666
Then how about theft?

896
01:27:41,666 --> 01:27:43,745
Oh, that...

897
01:27:43,745 --> 01:27:48,647
I took their stuff because I was angry I had to sleep with such scumbags!

898
01:27:48,648 --> 01:27:53,331
Wow, really you're a total mess, you bitch!

899
01:27:58,409 --> 01:28:02,022
Is there anything you want to eat or do?

900
01:28:02,022 --> 01:28:03,566
No.

901
01:28:06,851 --> 01:28:09,538
But I do miss something.

902
01:28:10,542 --> 01:28:12,719
What is it?

903
01:28:14,283 --> 01:28:18,189
I miss cosmos flowers.

904
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:23,134
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

905
01:28:28,144 --> 01:28:31,968
You have to eat a lot of fruit.

906
01:28:31,968 --> 01:28:34,865
It's good for the baby. Here!

907
01:28:34,865 --> 01:28:36,075
I'm okay. I'll pass.

908
01:28:36,076 --> 01:28:38,890
It's not okay. Open up.

909
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:42,650
You need to gobble it up for the baby.

910
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:45,010
It's a good thing.

911
01:28:45,010 --> 01:28:46,471
Youngest,

912
01:28:46,472 --> 01:28:50,020
- can you help me organize my books?
- Sure

913
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:57,467
Which books should I give you?

914
01:28:58,329 --> 01:29:00,100
You're pregnant, just stay still.

915
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,837
I'll help. Which book is it?

916
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:05,342
No! You wouldn't know one book from another, bitch!

917
01:29:05,343 --> 01:29:07,471
Shit.

918
01:29:07,472 --> 01:29:11,271
I know books! You bitch!

919
01:29:11,272 --> 01:29:13,149
If she went to a 4-year university,

920
01:29:13,150 --> 01:29:16,188
she would've easily been a pseudo-religious cult leader.

921
01:29:16,188 --> 01:29:19,988
I graduated from a 4-year university, although it was in one of the smaller cities.

922
01:29:22,336 --> 01:29:26,260
4-year universities are only in Seoul!

923
01:29:27,763 --> 01:29:30,141
You absolute idiot!

924
01:29:30,142 --> 01:29:32,062
Get lost!

925
01:29:32,063 --> 01:29:33,358
Shit.

926
01:29:34,485 --> 01:29:35,903
Get me the knife.

927
01:29:35,904 --> 01:29:39,451
Why are you giving me bullshit?

928
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,947
Here. Have it.

929
01:29:57,947 --> 01:30:01,496
Really? You love this book.

930
01:30:01,497 --> 01:30:04,618
Yup. I love all of them,

931
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,264
so don't waste precious time and

932
01:30:10,265 --> 01:30:12,919
use the time for yourself.

933
01:30:14,147 --> 01:30:16,000
Thank you.

934
01:30:16,636 --> 01:30:18,181
You're welcome.

935
01:30:18,181 --> 01:30:20,159
Oh~

936
01:30:22,189 --> 01:30:24,300
Is it possible...

937
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:27,924
for an ex-convict to take the government employee exam?

938
01:30:36,065 --> 01:30:38,190
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

939
01:30:39,948 --> 01:30:41,727
Clean up.

940
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,545
Let's get your temperature.

941
01:30:50,093 --> 01:30:52,014
It's normal.

942
01:30:52,014 --> 01:30:54,685
Any other pain or discomfort other than your headaches?

943
01:30:54,686 --> 01:31:00,270
I go pee more often, but other than that, I'm fine.

944
01:31:01,074 --> 01:31:04,565
That part's inevitable so try to bear with it.

945
01:31:04,565 --> 01:31:08,113
Also, taking medicine too often isn't good for you. Try not to take it if you can.

946
01:31:08,113 --> 01:31:11,829
I can't sleep at night because of the headaches.

947
01:31:11,829 --> 01:31:14,902
It feels like you're coming in to get the pills too often these days

948
01:31:14,902 --> 01:31:17,883
I will prescribe some medication for the headaches. Take them here.

949
01:31:17,883 --> 01:31:21,797
I'll take it later, when I really need it.

950
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:25,522
Are you hoarding the medication?

951
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:28,629
No, I really am sick.

952
01:31:36,395 --> 01:31:37,856
Sir!

953
01:31:44,728 --> 01:31:46,722
2037.

954
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:50,872
2037.

955
01:31:54,431 --> 01:31:56,108
What are you doing there?

956
01:31:56,109 --> 01:32:01,929
I had headaches so I'm coming back from seeing the doctor.

957
01:32:01,929 --> 01:32:04,383
Is it really bad?

958
01:32:04,383 --> 01:32:07,606
No, I'm better now.

959
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:11,072
Okay, so then can we speak for a moment?

960
01:32:11,072 --> 01:32:12,909
Yes.

961
01:32:15,322 --> 01:32:16,775
This is chrysathemum tea.

962
01:32:16,776 --> 01:32:19,930
It's good for headaches.

963
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:23,204
Thank you.

964
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:25,600
Drink it while it's warm.

965
01:32:33,334 --> 01:32:37,674
Hide it and then have it for yourself.

966
01:32:39,696 --> 01:32:44,012
Thank you also for the supplements and vitamins.

967
01:32:45,165 --> 01:32:49,257
My youngest daughter is around your age.

968
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:54,000
So I feel sorry when I see you.

969
01:32:55,376 --> 01:32:59,417
I feel that the adults have wronged you.

970
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:04,403
Let me know if you ever need help.

971
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:08,394
Also,

972
01:33:09,046 --> 01:33:15,149
why don't you just rest in your room until you go into labor?

973
01:33:18,148 --> 01:33:22,406
It's more bearable when I move around.

974
01:33:25,788 --> 01:33:27,642
Go ahead, try it.

975
01:36:13,874 --> 01:36:16,003
Mom.

976
01:37:33,082 --> 01:37:36,547
Just borrow it and then return it.

977
01:37:36,548 --> 01:37:38,760
Why would you make a needle?

978
01:37:38,761 --> 01:37:42,090
Girl, so that we can keep using it.

979
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:45,356
Be careful!

980
01:38:00,053 --> 01:38:04,619
You're really good at drawing.

981
01:38:08,404 --> 01:38:11,400
Why do you like cosmos flowers so much?

982
01:38:12,687 --> 01:38:15,650
It's a girl who is shy.

983
01:38:16,386 --> 01:38:17,930
Like my mom.

984
01:38:17,931 --> 01:38:21,230
- The cosmos flowers?
- Yes.

985
01:38:21,939 --> 01:38:25,612
When the flower shakes with the fall wind,

986
01:38:25,613 --> 01:38:29,019
it looks like a shy girl.

987
01:38:29,019 --> 01:38:32,835
Yoonyoung must be this pretty because you take after your mom.

988
01:38:32,836 --> 01:38:37,511
My mom is way prettier. Much more prettier!

989
01:38:37,512 --> 01:38:38,888
Oh, by the way!

990
01:38:38,889 --> 01:38:41,269
I asked the warden,

991
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:43,690
and it turns out that five years after being released,

992
01:38:43,691 --> 01:38:46,195
ex-convicts can take the government employee exams.

993
01:38:46,196 --> 01:38:48,307
Really?

994
01:38:52,959 --> 01:38:57,443
Don't loose hope just because your body is locked up.

995
01:38:59,222 --> 01:39:00,433
Yes.

996
01:39:09,492 --> 01:39:13,333
Look. Cute, huh?

997
01:39:13,334 --> 01:39:15,085
So adorable.

998
01:39:15,086 --> 01:39:17,767
- What's with the color?
- Why?

999
01:39:17,767 --> 01:39:19,803
Do you want the baby to be dressed as a prisoner?

1000
01:39:19,804 --> 01:39:22,193
This is the only fabric I have.

1001
01:39:22,193 --> 01:39:24,605
You, go over there and keep watch.

1002
01:39:24,606 --> 01:39:27,099
- Why?
- Shit!

1003
01:39:28,781 --> 01:39:34,040
This moment, we have to prepare with sincerity.

1004
01:39:34,041 --> 01:39:37,256
We have to make more clothes, make more diapers.

1005
01:39:37,257 --> 01:39:39,551
And we have to make a comfortable

1006
01:39:39,552 --> 01:39:42,349
blanket and pillow, too.

1007
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:45,020
I know it. Pack the thread.

1008
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:47,024
That fearless bitch!

1009
01:39:47,025 --> 01:39:48,946
Pack the thread.

1010
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:54,332
Run! Hurry!

1011
01:41:12,205 --> 01:41:14,892
What the hell is this?

1012
01:41:17,298 --> 01:41:19,935
Who did this?

1013
01:41:23,235 --> 01:41:26,742
Uh-oh, seems like you'll go to the punishment room.

1014
01:41:26,742 --> 01:41:28,644
Shut up!

1015
01:41:31,768 --> 01:41:33,605
Why you crazy bitch!

1016
01:41:33,606 --> 01:41:35,609
I'm not crazy.

1017
01:41:35,610 --> 01:41:39,241
You said something that got me thinking.

1018
01:41:39,242 --> 01:41:41,829
So the baby can't be wearing prison clothes.

1019
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:45,045
You idiot! Do you have a brain?

1020
01:41:45,046 --> 01:41:46,797
Is my uniform not a prisoner's uniform?

1021
01:41:46,798 --> 01:41:49,428
It is! But today is Sunday.

1022
01:41:49,429 --> 01:41:53,228
Sunday is marked red, so pink makes sense.

1023
01:41:53,229 --> 01:41:54,855
Ugh, you idiot!

1024
01:41:54,856 --> 01:41:57,569
What does pink have to do with Sunday?

1025
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:58,988
They don't really—

1026
01:41:58,989 --> 01:42:01,369
The baby's going to get scared. Shh!

1027
01:42:01,370 --> 01:42:05,503
Your legs are super sexy.

1028
01:42:14,229 --> 01:42:15,897
Are you okay?

1029
01:42:15,898 --> 01:42:18,026
You scared the shit out of me.

1030
01:42:18,027 --> 01:42:24,932
They said it's just stomach cramps, so thank goodness.

1031
01:42:27,755 --> 01:42:30,455
Using an English name is better, right?

1032
01:42:30,455 --> 01:42:32,764
Okay... Rose.

1033
01:42:32,765 --> 01:42:34,184
Tiffany.

1034
01:42:34,185 --> 01:42:35,478
Natasha.

1035
01:42:35,479 --> 01:42:36,814
Jessica.

1036
01:42:36,815 --> 01:42:38,526
If it's a boy, then what?

1037
01:42:38,527 --> 01:42:40,773
Of course, it's Daniel Henney.

1038
01:42:41,742 --> 01:42:47,251
David. Richard. Michael Johnson.

1039
01:42:47,251 --> 01:42:49,099
So what if the name is fancy!

1040
01:42:49,099 --> 01:42:51,903
Might as well call it Juju.

1041
01:42:51,903 --> 01:42:56,680
All things aside, shouldn't we consult with Yoonyoung about the baby's name?

1042
01:42:58,233 --> 01:43:00,653
That's true, but...

1043
01:43:00,654 --> 01:43:03,394
she hasn't even accepted the existence of the baby.

1044
01:43:03,394 --> 01:43:06,749
She's going through a lot, so we have to set it up for her,

1045
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:11,007
and when she needs it, it'll all be ready for her.

1046
01:43:11,008 --> 01:43:15,809
How about a Korean name, Boni?

1047
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:17,862
Boni?

1048
01:43:17,862 --> 01:43:22,697
Well, the inner skin of a chestnut is called boni.

1049
01:43:22,698 --> 01:43:25,955
It's the part that protects the fragile inside.

1050
01:43:26,832 --> 01:43:33,493
The baby should grow up to be a person that can protect the weaker ones.

1051
01:43:34,305 --> 01:43:38,229
Boni could be for both a girl and a boy. Not bad at all, Big Sis.

1052
01:43:38,230 --> 01:43:39,565
That's right.

1053
01:43:39,566 --> 01:43:41,485
No! Hell No!!!

1054
01:43:41,486 --> 01:43:43,355
What!!

1055
01:43:45,061 --> 01:43:48,081
No, absolutey not. I really really hate it. Just a husk, dead skin.

1056
01:43:48,082 --> 01:43:50,628
It's not dead skin! It doesn't mean husk!

1057
01:43:50,629 --> 01:43:54,179
It's something that protects the weak and the fragile. We want the baby to be that kind of a person.

1058
01:43:54,179 --> 01:43:56,140
Bullshit. What a joke.

1059
01:43:56,141 --> 01:43:58,644
Husk! Dead skin!

1060
01:43:58,645 --> 01:44:01,034
That's a bad name! It's just like my life. I hate it.

1061
01:44:01,034 --> 01:44:03,196
How about core? Huh, Big Sis?

1062
01:44:03,197 --> 01:44:05,501
- Core! Coco?
- Coconut?

1063
01:44:05,501 --> 01:44:07,204
Boni.

1064
01:44:07,205 --> 01:44:12,046
It sounds nice and has a nice meaning.

1065
01:44:12,046 --> 01:44:14,125
It's Korean.

1066
01:44:48,245 --> 01:44:52,628
[I did my own cleaning today. Hope you'll like these. Cheer up, 2037!]

1067
01:46:09,866 --> 01:46:12,603
How's this? Is it okay?

1068
01:46:14,375 --> 01:46:18,214
This hand is so cute.

1069
01:46:18,215 --> 01:46:19,801
This one's for the feet.

1070
01:46:19,802 --> 01:46:21,713
Wow!

1071
01:46:26,023 --> 01:46:28,201
So pretty.

1072
01:46:28,201 --> 01:46:30,205
Shit!

1073
01:49:11,687 --> 01:49:15,885
- I'm so tired.
- You haven't done anything.

1074
01:49:18,325 --> 01:49:19,577
Yoonyoung!

1075
01:49:19,578 --> 01:49:21,522
Yoonyoung!

1076
01:49:22,685 --> 01:49:24,229
Her water broke!

1077
01:49:24,229 --> 01:49:26,542
She's still breathing! Water, water!

1078
01:49:26,543 --> 01:49:28,629
- Hurry up and bring water!
- Yoonyoung, wake up!

1079
01:49:28,630 --> 01:49:32,846
Guards!! Fucking guards!

1080
01:49:32,847 --> 01:49:37,689
Is anyone there? Someone is dying here!

1081
01:49:37,690 --> 01:49:39,024
Guards!!

1082
01:49:39,025 --> 01:49:40,570
Take deep breaths and push.

1083
01:49:40,571 --> 01:49:41,488
Push.

1084
01:49:41,489 --> 01:49:43,826
Doctor, she has dilated 10 centimeters.

1085
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:48,419
Can you hear me? Push. Push till the end.

1086
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:50,965
You have to push more.

1087
01:49:50,966 --> 01:49:53,304
- Please wake up.
- Nurse Push the baby out!

1088
01:49:53,305 --> 01:49:54,222
Yes.

1089
01:49:54,223 --> 01:49:56,351
Patient! Push harder!

1090
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:59,148
At this rate, it is dangerous for the mother, too.

1091
01:49:59,149 --> 01:50:00,485
You have to breathe!

1092
01:50:01,446 --> 01:50:02,915
What are you doing?

1093
01:50:02,915 --> 01:50:05,869
Are you going to kill the baby?

1094
01:50:14,764 --> 01:50:17,901
What is all this?

1095
01:50:26,161 --> 01:50:27,905
It's...

1096
01:50:30,487 --> 01:50:32,307
All addressed back to this room.

1097
01:50:32,307 --> 01:50:35,414
There is too much bleeding. At this rate, she will go into shock.

1098
01:50:35,414 --> 01:50:37,517
Patient Yoonyoung, please wake up!

1099
01:50:37,518 --> 01:50:39,521
Are you really not going to push?

1100
01:50:39,522 --> 01:50:42,785
Both you and the baby could die!

1101
01:50:44,657 --> 01:50:46,785
- Help her push!
- Yes.

1102
01:50:46,786 --> 01:50:48,789
Patient!

1103
01:50:48,790 --> 01:50:51,052
Please wake up.

1104
01:50:58,176 --> 01:51:05,065
I'm leaving this letter in case I don't return.

1105
01:51:06,401 --> 01:51:11,319
Teacher, you are hurting, too. Right?

1106
01:51:12,063 --> 01:51:19,310
You took care of my wounded heart and mind, and

1107
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:23,370
that helped me keep going forward.

1108
01:51:24,004 --> 01:51:28,553
I know you prayed for me, as well.

1109
01:51:28,553 --> 01:51:33,322
Thank you so much and I am sorry.

1110
01:51:33,322 --> 01:51:39,050
Sister Haesoo, I am so sad because I wanted to go

1111
01:51:39,050 --> 01:51:45,380
to college and read a lot of books like you.

1112
01:51:45,389 --> 01:51:49,864
But I am so happy I got to know you.

1113
01:51:50,982 --> 01:51:53,321
When you gave me the history books,

1114
01:51:53,322 --> 01:51:57,050
I thought to myself,

1115
01:51:57,050 --> 01:52:03,210
"I want to give life and studying another chance."

1116
01:52:03,756 --> 01:52:06,560
Thank you for finding out what I liked

1117
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:12,051
without even asking, and helping me so much.

1118

Our Troublemaking Sis.

1119
01:52:15,090 --> 01:52:21,040
I'm so upset I met you so late in life.

1120
01:52:21,044 --> 01:52:24,620
I was kind of sad because I felt like you were the only one

1121
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:30,560
who didn't know how much love you hold for others.

1122
01:52:30,563 --> 01:52:35,010
You're a great sis, one that

1123
01:52:35,010 --> 01:52:37,950
I want to show off to others.

1124
01:52:38,913 --> 01:52:43,840
I wish I could stay longer and pester you.

1125
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:46,010
I'm sorry.

1126
01:52:46,753 --> 01:52:49,950
I relied on you a lot.

1127
01:52:49,950 --> 01:52:52,430
And I loved you a lot.

1128
01:52:56,490 --> 01:53:01,100
Pretty face, pretty heart, pretty body.

1129
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:05,040
Which is why men won't leave you alone.

1130
01:53:05,049 --> 01:53:09,960
But I hope you meet Mr. Right who will

1131
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:15,560
love you for who you are and stay with him.

1132
01:53:16,306 --> 01:53:21,320
You always looked so pretty to me because you were

1133
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:26,940
ready to love and be loved. I was jealous of that.

1134
01:53:28,312 --> 01:53:34,074
I wish I could see you in your wedding dress.

1135
01:53:38,974 --> 01:53:43,140
I have a request for you, Cool Sis.

1136
01:53:43,709 --> 01:53:46,410
When you go out into the world, try growing

1137
01:53:46,410 --> 01:53:49,420
your hair and putting on some makeup.

1138
01:53:49,429 --> 01:53:51,910
You don't know this but I think

1139
01:53:51,910 --> 01:53:56,030
you're the prettiest person I've ever met.

1140
01:53:57,470 --> 01:54:00,996
Also, you're not bad because you were abandoned,

1141
01:54:00,996 --> 01:54:05,390
I think it's bad that you think you were abandoned.

1142
01:54:06,163 --> 01:54:12,060
I don't think your parents abandoned you.

1143
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:14,830
I think they protected you.

1144
01:54:16,383 --> 01:54:20,580
If I said this to you in person, you might beat me up so I'm writing a letter.

1145
01:54:21,636 --> 01:54:27,750
Please, don't hide and cry anymore.

1146
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:29,710
Please!

1147
01:55:33,193 --> 01:55:36,647
How is the mother?

1148
01:55:36,647 --> 01:55:37,909
It won't be easy but

1149
01:55:37,910 --> 01:55:40,630
we have to hope she'll regain consciousness.

1150
01:57:42,826 --> 01:57:48,003
Yoonyoung, Mom bought you pizza.

1151
01:58:01,947 --> 01:58:11,007
In your next life, I hope you'll live like a 7-year-old at 7...

1152
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:21,730
and a 15-year-old when you are 15.

1153
01:58:23,306 --> 01:58:28,660
Mommy is so sorry.

1154
02:00:01,450 --> 02:00:03,350
Boni.

1155
02:00:16,275 --> 02:00:22,710
You have to become a pretty girl.
