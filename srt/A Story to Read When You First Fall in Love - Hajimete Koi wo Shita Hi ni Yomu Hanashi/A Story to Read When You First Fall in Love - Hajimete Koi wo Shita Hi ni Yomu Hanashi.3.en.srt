<i>[A Story to Read When You First Fall in Love]</i>

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,820
<i>[Previous Episode]
Can you help me to get admitted into the University of Tokyo?</i>

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,730
<i>I want him to become the person he wants to be.</i>

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:13,190
<i>Call her now. Why not settle your twenty-year long unrequited love?</i>

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,560
<i>So I don't have any leeway to look for a husband.</i>

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,860
<i>I really want him to pass the exam no matter what. Right now, I'm crazy about him.</i>

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,510
<i>I... do like her.</i>

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,010
<i>Then, I'll give you my number, too.</i>

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:27,790
<i>Yeah.</i>

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,230
<i>It's 090...</i>

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:37,270

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,500
<i>The number you have dialed cannot answer...</i>

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,290
Oh?

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,150
Junko's phone is busy.

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,600
What? At this hour?

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,410
It's me.

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,540
Hello?

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,080
You called me so late. I thought there was an emergency.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,400
I'm sorry. You seem like you're into rock music, so I thought you'd be staying up late.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,700
Rock? Oh, this?

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,380
- I don't like rock music at all.
- What?

22
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,620
This is all an act.

23
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,030
Student popularity is vital to teachers at the major cram schools.

24
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,740
Smart idea.

25
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,250
Since you're a popular teacher, Teshigawara-sensei,

26
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,830
have you thought of a good method to teach Yuri?

27
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,940
I already told you yesterday that it's impossible.

28
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,150
It's impossible for Minami High student to pass the exam, even for me.

29
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,180
But I believe that he can make a miracle happen.

30
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,540
Harumi-sensei,

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,180
miracles are called miracles because they usually don't happen.

32
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,820
- Manager-
- Teshigawara-sensei,

33
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,860
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,190
If you don't elaborate in detail why it's impossible,

35
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,310
Harumi-sensei wouldn't understand.

36
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,450
Simply, there's not enough time.

37
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,670
<i>[The Road to the University of Tokyo]</i>

38
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,950
Just like Harumi-sensei said,

39
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,900
even if he picks either Science-1 or 2,

40
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,620
he has to take tests on seven subjects at the National Center Test.

41
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,560
If you spend one month on each subject, it'll take seven months. But instead,

42
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,470
if he aims for a private school, he only has to take tests on three subjects.

43
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,790
You know? If he only has an eye for the University of Tokyo, you're definitely asking for a failure.

44
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,960
How will you accomplish this as his teacher?

45
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,390
He is determined to get into the University of Tokyo.

46
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,470
Then let's say

47
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,620
he manages to study for all seven subjects

48
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,850
and gets a chance for the second round,

49
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,870
this is the actual battle.

50
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,370
That's why I'm planning on getting him ready by the summer of his senior year.

51
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,220
What subject is Yuri good at?

52
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,230
Nothing in particular... but I'm thinking of focusing on mathematics and turning it into his specialty.

53
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,930
Idiot! The key subjects to pass the entrance exams

54
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,490
are Japanese and English. They are both humanity subjects.

55
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:12,310
Those who apply to science majors are all good at math. So he can't exceed them in math.

56
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,310
His progress in English and Japanese is the most important.

57
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,490
Japanese?

58
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,040
Contemporary literature is the hardest to improve in a short period of time.

59
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,470
It requires the ability to think and a reading comprehension skill.

60
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,680
But Ancient Chinese and Ancient Japanese are relatively easier to get good scores.

61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,240
But as he continues studying,

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,120
there will be a subject that he won't be good at.

63
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,590
Then he'll run out of time.

64
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,660
That's what I think.

65
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,900
As I thought, these are mere blinds, right?

66
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,790
Wow!

67
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,570
He's right. Just like Teshigawara-sensei explained,

68
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,510
that's the case for ordinary students.

69
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,180
As for him, base on the fact that his hair is pink,

70
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,660
he may not be normal.

71
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,200
That's right. He's not ordinary.

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,520
He's different from those smart students we teach.

73
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,120
He has more determination than other kids. So if we teach him in an extraordinary way, he might pass.

74
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,780
What a positive thinker!

75
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,400
Harumi-sensei, why couldn't you get into the University of Tokyo?

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,130
Pardon?

77
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,240
If Yuri is as positive as you are,

78
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,680
he just might pass, but I think the chances are slim.

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,900
What do you mean?

80
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,840
I know from my experience, but

81
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,590
kids who get into the University of Tokyo are optimistic.

82
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,980
He is.

83
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,910
And honest.

84
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,910
He is.

85
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,680
And they can do the same thing every day over and over again.

86
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,560
Somewhat, he can.

87
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,330
And the most important element is

88
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,980
having emotional stability.

89
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,500
Unless he can do well at the actual exam, it'll be useless.

90
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,530
<i>Is she mentally unstable?</i>

91
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,860
Is something wrong?

92
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,840
I understand why I failed to get into the University of Tokyo.

93
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,760
Is it because you're emotionally unstable?

94
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,910
"I've waited for your return for three long years.

95
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,130
I'm about to share my pillow with another man for the first time tonight."

96
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,280
Is that even Japanese?

97
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,420
Yes, from one thousand years ago.

98
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,170
What happened in a thousand years?

99
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,660
Let's start by studying Japanese history.

100
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,580
The Catalpa Bow is a poem from the Tale of Ise.
<i>(T/N: It's written in the Heian period.)</i>

101
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,060
The story of a man

102
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,400
who left his lover in the countryside

103
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,330
and went to the capital and didn't return for three years.

104
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,980
The woman waited for him in sorrow.

105
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,420
That's when a man approached her fervently,

106
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,490
and she promised her hand in marriage to the man.

107
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,300
- What does that mean?
- In the old days,

108
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,770
a man visited a woman every day when he wants to propose.

109
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,470
Basically, he crept into her bedroom at night.

110
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,350
That's a bit twisted way of saying.

111
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,430
Well, that was the common practice in the Heian period.
<i>(T/N: From year 794 to 1185)</i>

112
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,100
That's creepy.

113
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,850
On the day of her wedding,

114
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,420
her ex-lover returned and told her:

115
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,110
"Please open the door."

116
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,840
That's the worst timing ever.

117
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,680
Right. Then...

118
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,700
the woman recited this poem.

119
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,050
"For the three long years,

120
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,530
I've waited for your return. But tonight,

121
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm about to share my pillow with another man for the first time."

122
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,740
And the man replied to her with this poem.

123
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,310
"Catalpa bows, spindle bows, and zelkova bows. For many years,

124
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,690
as much as I have, please show your affection."

125
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,030
What do you think it means? It doesn't have to be precise, so take a guess.

126
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,170
"Wagaseshigagoto" means

127
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,310
"You did the same thing

128
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,760
that I did." Am I right?

129
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,680
They both cheated!

130
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,000
Would such a poem be worth bequeathing for a thousand years?

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,850
What about you, Yuri-yuri? Take a guess.

132
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,120
"If that's the case,

133
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,300
I hope you'll live a happy life."

134
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,980
Very close! Not too far off.

135
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,270
No way.

136
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,620
Look here.

137
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,770
"Just like how I loved you for a long time,

138
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:39,270
please love your new spouse with affection."

139
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,330
What a nice man.

140
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,110
But the woman couldn't bear to hear that because she still loved him.

141
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:52,020
It was a sorrowful poem. Her reply was also heartrending...

142
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,520
It's the guy's fault for leaving her hanging for three years.

143
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,660
He wasn't into her. I bet he had another girlfriend at the capital.

144
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,460
Men are always cunning, even in that era.

145
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,520
By the way, why are you here today, Eto Mika?

146
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,360
You don't have a lesson today, do you?

147
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,120
<i>I couldn't say this in front of Yuri-yuri earlier because I was afraid it'd put him off,</i>

148
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,360
<i>right now...</i>

149
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,230
<i>I'm crazy about him.</i>

150
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,170
I'm here to assist Kyo.

151
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,360
Well, I'll go buy some tea for you, Kyo.

152
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,140
Okay, where was I?

153
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,630
Harumi.

154
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,890
Don't you remember anything about that night?

155
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,150
About what?

156
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,350
It's nothing.

157
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:51,530
Anyway, both in classical literature and English, you must memorize the translations.

158
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,120
Darn it. I think this is harder than memorizing English vocabulary.

159
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,520
Use proper language. Don't skip a letter when you speak.

160
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,450
Let's speak in proper Japanese in our lessons from now on.

161
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,020
If you use improper language on your contemporary literature exam,

162
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,070
they'll mark you down.

163
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,860
Ya seem kinda different today, dontcha?

164
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,900
In other words, "You seem a little different today, don't you?"

165
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,860
You can't speak casually.

166
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,310
From now on, consider everything you see, you hear,

167
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,350
and you say will be related to your entrance exams.

168
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,670
That's the road to the University of Tokyo.

169
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,480
What's wrong?

170
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,260
I've come to this conclusion after receiving some advice.

171
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,030
This is the right approach for someone like me who is emotionally unstable.

172
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:44,410
The same goes for you, Mika. Let's focus on the entrance exam from now on-

173
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,920
I'm pretty smart and can get into a good college through a letter of recommendation.

174
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,100
It's pointless for girls to put so much effort into studying.

175
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,290
If I become too successful, men won't like it.

176
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,610
It'd be nice if I get a good paying job and all.

177
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,080
I don't want to be like you, a bookworm walking dead.

Hey, I don't mind ya bein' here, but could'ya just shut up?

180
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,500
What? You're so mean.

181
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,530
"I do not mind you being here, but could you please be quiet?"

182
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,890
You were taught to use proper language when you were a kid, right?

183
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,150
Don't treat me like a kid.

184
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,660
You are one.

185
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,790
You're a kid, aren't you?

186
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,380
Okay. Time is up. Bye, Teacher.

187
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,540
Goodbye. Good day to you, Mika.

189
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,890
"Are you seriously going to speak like that?" Yes, I am.

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,750
Oh.

191
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:05,420
Hello, Masashi. Sorry. I know you called me last night.

192
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,110
Well, I do have something I want to talk about.

193
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,670
But it's not urgent.

194
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,680
You see,

195
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,530
there's something I would like to discuss with you.

196
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,700
Me, too. I need your advice on something.

197
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,680
You're hardworking and honest,

198
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,530
and you're emotionally stable. How can I become like you?

199
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,040
Yes, that's true.

200
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,150
I'm a cool guy, after all.

201
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,740
Alright, I got it. Then,

202
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,630
see you on Tuesday.

203
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,350
Bye now.

204
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,960
Hooray!

205
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,690
I did it!

206
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,690
Did you finally ask her out on a date?

207
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,250
It took me ages to get to this point.

208
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,950
You're emotionally unstable.

209
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,530
Shut up. Alright!

210
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,770
I have to take that day off.

211
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,410
- The next day is the presentation.
- What?

212
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,820
I'll work overtime even if it kills me.

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,760
Totally unfair.

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,540
Mr. Yakumo.

218
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,280
Good work today.

219
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,960
Well, well, it's you, Mr. Yakumo.

220
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,900
It's nice to be entrusted with big projects one after another.

221
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,330
Graduates of the University of Tokyo are dominant in our company.

222
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:03,300
I'm so envious of you. I should've studied more when I was younger.

223
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,410
Then I wouldn't be suffering like this, right, Kato?

224
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,540

227
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,630
suddenly back out of contract, and it's been chaotic.

228
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,950
It's a trivial matter compared to the work you're in charge of. How embarrassing.

229
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:28,080
I'd love to get your helps since you're such an elite. Just kidding.

230
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,250
I won't help someone else to get credit.

231
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:36,130
Instead, we'll take over this project.

Well, it's just a ramen shop near your work.

Sorry. There's something I wanted to ask you.

what kind of studying method would motivate you?

259
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,760
I want a handsome teacher to teach me. So delicious.

260
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,620
I asked the wrong person.

261
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,940
Are you asking for that boy?

262
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:48,370
Yes, I've been thinking of a more suitable study method for him, but I can't think of any.

263
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,640
It's fine to aim high in your work, but

264
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,030
you should also look for a potential husband at the same time.

265

How old will you be when he takes the exam?

266
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,800
- 33 years old.
- What?

Matchmaking parties are exhausting and I love staying at home.

I wish there's a guy who would drink beer with me at home.

269
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,730
But people like me won't meet anyone because we always stay at home.

That's right! I'm single because

00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,190

Guys I've known for a long time?

277
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,190
Someone who is close, like your own family.

278
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,870
It's more comfortable to be with a guy like that.

279
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,910
Maybe you'll see him as a man and makes your heart flutter.

00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,680
Where can I find that kind of man?

281
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,150
Yakumo doesn't count as a man in her eyes.

282
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,550
Wait. Wasn't she at the blind date?

Yes, with Kyo.

00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,960
You've had your eyes on him even at the blind date, right?

You handled men well, so I wanted to recruit you to my bar.

Hey now.

290
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,330
I've always had older boyfriends since middle school.

291
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:21,270
One of them was my tutor. He was a college student in his twenties.

292
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,810
Since we did it many times, he could've got arrested if we were caught.

293
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,550
Eto Mika, it's too much excitement for Junko.

294
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,420
We did get caught in the end, but he said I forced him into this.

295
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,870
I was serious about him, but he ruthlessly betrayed me.

296
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,350
He had a job offer from a company.

297
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,870
I realized at the moment that adults don't act very maturely.

298
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,920
Since Kyo has no painful experience like I have,

299
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,470
that's why he trusts you blindly.

300
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,280
<i>Welcome.</i>

301
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,890

There is no hope for him.

303
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,280
I'm not that terrible.

304
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,250
Not all adults are losers like Jun.

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,020
She's just a rare case, like no other.

306
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,280
It's true that some adults are incompetent like me, however-

307
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,820
I hate cunning adults who are quick to admit their flaws. Thanks for the meal.

308
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,310
What? Are you leaving already?

309
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,770
Eto Mika.

310
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,140

313
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:45,020
I guess she had to put the blame on others in order to survive.

314
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,280
Hey, Jun. You should pay close attention to her.

315
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,760
She has been betrayed...

Despite being a teacher, I can still see your wildness in you.

337
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,750
Sometimes, I'm surprised myself that I became a teacher.

338
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,780
I think people who didn't

339
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,690
enjoy their school life are more suitable to be teachers.

340
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,830
I remember all the good and bad things that our old teachers used to say.

341
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,490
Well, I guess.

342
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,110
It's fun to be a teacher.

343
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,440
Were you called in because your students shoplifted?

344
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,650
It must be tough being a school teacher.

345
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,630
However, it turned out to be a misunderstanding.

346
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:20,380
Our school is known for being notorious, so our students are falsely accused all the time.

347
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,870
They pushed the police officer and ran away.

348
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,020
I need to escort them to the police station to apologize.

349
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,430
Escort them?

350
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,050
It's really depressing.

351
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,120
Sorry for the wait.

352
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,010
<i>We have the same line of work and I feel comfortable with him.</i>

353
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,820
<i>This is kinda nice. If...</i>

354
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,780
<i>we can relax and drink like this at home.</i>

355
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,230
But somehow...

356
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:52,350
after talking to you, I think it's not so bad to be a teacher.

357
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,250
I'm glad that we have met again.

358
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,620
<i>Oh dear, my heart is racing.</i>

359
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:12,590
<i>What should I do? I have to say something. Think of something. </i>

360
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,250
Masashi!

361
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,690
Do you remember Masashi Yakumo, my cousin?

362
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,060
I do. Doesn't he work at a major trading company?

363
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,580
That's him.

364
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,290
<i>Thank you, Masashi, for saving me from an awkward silence.</i>

365
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,160
<i>God bless you.</i>

366
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,320
Thank you.

367
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,840
I'll check and get back to you soon. Goodbye.

368
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,660
Mr. Yakumo.

369
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,630
I signed a contract with Maggie Chen.
<i>(T/N: Chinese actress)</i>

370
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,030
A Hong Kong based investment fund that helped me to win a bid for a plant in Vietnam

371
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,200
has recently expanded by purchasing this company.

372
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,020
That's amazing.

373
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,120
You knew each other?

374
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,720
Yeah. On top of that,

375
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,550
as a promotion for reopening, I will have them

376
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,040
give away eco-friendly jute bags to first 1,000 customers.

377
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,560
Those are the fair-trade ones.

378
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,390
Fair trade!

379
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,420
It'd be good for our company's image.

380
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,840
- It'll be a highlight of the event.
- That's right.

381
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,060
An elite?

382
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,860
As I expected from Yakumo, his life is going smoothly.

383
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,020
What does he do there?

384
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:20,450
It's something called energy division. He just returned from working overseas not too long ago.

385
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,190
He always buys me weird souvenirs.

386
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,420
Just wait for me, Junko.

387
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,470
So you haven't given up on your date yet?

388
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,550
Of course not.

389
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,360
The plan for the date will be

390
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,250
cruising around Tokyo Bay and drink at the jazz bar. When the mood is right...

391
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,350
There's a surprise!

392
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,820
A live band plays a song to convey my message to her.  What do you think?

393
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,380
Why can't he apply his business skills

394
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,000
for his romance?

395
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,560
Surprise!

396
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,550
"Aren't you drinking too much?"

397
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,720
By the way, our high school classmate who came to the wedding

398
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,440
was also talking about Yakumo.

399
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,310
Wedding? Whose wedding?

400
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,080
Mine.

401
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,470
Did you get married?

402
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,310
When I was 24.

403
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:23,020
I was young and thoughtless, so I got married on a whim.

404
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,210
I see.

405
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,060
Well, I better get going now.

406
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,040
My friend, Yamashita.

407
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,030
Why are you acting weird suddenly?

408
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,860
I enjoyed spending time with old friends.

409
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,630
Well then, have a nice evening.

410
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,230
<i>It's terrifying. Too scary. I wish I could disappear!</i>

411
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,470
<i>I was so sure that he's single.</i>

412
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,590
I was carelessly drinking with someone else's husband.

413
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,230
<i>[Infinite Challenges, Bright Future, Aim High, Minami High School]</i>

414
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,130
Yuri.

415
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,890
- Are you serious about going to the University of Tokyo?
- What?

416
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,030
Recently I met Ms. Harumi... and she told me.

417
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,960
- Were you alone with her?
- What?

418
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,360
Yeah, we just had a drink.

419
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,300
I'm your homeroom teacher.

420
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,200
Even just a little, I'll support you as much as I can.

421
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,370
- No, thanks.
- What?

422
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,980
I can manage on my own.

423
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,360
Seriously? Are you still pursuing the boy with pink hair?

424
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,560
- Can't I?
- Mika, you're too intimidating.

425
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,890
He might find you annoying.

426
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:01,680
Annoying? I'm serious about him. What's wrong with that?

427
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,290
She said she's serious!

428
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,860
You turned your ex off too.

429
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,430
Oh yeah!

430
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,430
But when someone else confessed to her

431
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:15,120
she fell for him.

432
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,880
<i>"Ana Osoroshi."</i>

433
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,490
The hole is scary?

434
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,490
Claustrophobia!

435
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,790
"Ana Osoroshi."

436
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:28,760
"Ana" is an interjection, so it means "Wow, it's scary."

437
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,470
This person was impressed by the amount of knowledge Shonagon Sei had.
<i>(T/N: An author in the Heian period.)</i>

438
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,010
Class is over.

439
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,930
Kyo, what's your plan for dinner?

440
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,320
You're really annoying.

441
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,080
Yuri-yuri, do you have time after this?

00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,960
<i>[Okonomiyaki, Hungry Jungle]</i>

00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,830
<i>[The Tale of Genji]</i>

444
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,120
Here, Yuri-yuri.

445
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,080
- What's this?
- Oh?

446
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,560
- What's this?
- What's this?

447
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,680
Are you reading manga for a breather from studying for the entrance exam?

448
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,730
Junko is wise. You know too well of your student.

449
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,930
The manga is a study guide for classical literature.

450
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,360
Right. I knew that. Come on, study!

451
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,520
Study!

452
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,890
Learn from the manga.

453
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,880
As you said, classical literatures don't even sound like common Japanese.

454
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
So I thought it'd be best  to learn the storyline

455
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,950
and historical background from manga.

456
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,550
Are you serious about using manga as a study guide?

457
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,500
I'm serious.

458
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,700
Yuri-yuri, these are for you. And these are for you, Eto Mika.

459
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,460
Read them when you have free time.
<i>[The Rose of Versailles]</i>

460
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,960
- My mom used to read this.
- I've read them before.

461
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,270
I saw them at the hospital.

462
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,800
- Yeah, at the hospital.
- How nosy.

463
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,640
I told you I'm not taking the entrance exam.

464
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,950
You should always keep your grades up, even if you're on a recommendation.

465
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,620
Do you feel good about yourself

466
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,030
when you play a good teacher?

467
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,220
I didn't ask you for this. You're annoying.

468
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,670
- Eto Mika, you're rude.
- That's right.

469
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,230
How could you say Zunko-sensei is a good teacher?

470
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,040
Watch it!

471
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,080
I was just kidding.

472
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,180
Does a single woman in her thirties have fun leering at high schoolers?

473
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,670
Don't be stupid. It's a crime to have a romantic relationship with high schoolers.

474
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,090
Are you teaching Kyo for your own sake?

475
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,270
You're using Kyo to achieve your unfulfilled dream.

476
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,470
You, knock it off.

477
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,610
- Leave.
- Kyo.

478
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,880
- Mika.
- W-Wait.

479
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,360
- Mika...
- Hold on a minute.

480
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,690
- Mika.
- Ouch!

481
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,450
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

482
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,710
Mika!

483
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,280
Eto Mika is acting strange today.

484
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,390

00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,190
Only this guy?

<i>[Sanno Seminar]</i>

498
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,900
With that said, the word "tari"

499
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,780
doesn't complete the sentence.

500
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,950
It's used as a connective particle.

501
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,460
By the way, Eto Mika didn't show up today.

502
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,870
By the way...

503
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:31,490
did you stop speaking proper Japanese?

504
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,110
Sorry. I forgot about that.

505
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,210
Finding the best method of studying for you

506
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,760
requires many trials and errors.

507
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,420
Hey, did you read the manga?

508
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,900
Not yet.

509
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,190
Why not? Wasn't that interesting to you?

510
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,260
Every kid loves to read manga.

511
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,990
You know, when I was little,

512
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,770
my mom didn't allow me to read manga.

513
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,900
So when I read it after growing up,

514
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,820
I was impressed how well written the story is.

515
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,490
It's more interesting to learn history

516
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,820
through manga.

517
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,690
Such as the Record of the Three Kingdoms.

518
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,430
If you go to a used bookstore,

519
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,750
you may find a variety of manga about history and classical literatures.

- Yes?

Do you have a boyfriend?

523
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,730
- Why do you ask that now?
- How about your cousin from the other day?

524
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,760
Masashi and I are nothing like that.

525
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,330
Are you seeing anybody casually

526
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,470
who is not your boyfriend?

527
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,190
I'm not. What kind of question is that?

528
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,320
Is that a new way to bully people?

529
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,270
I bet you go out with a guy

530
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,580
to have a drink with.

531
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,440
- Yuribo, I'm preoccupied with your exam, I can't think of-
- Yamashita said,

532
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,880
he had a drink with you alone.

533
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,140
I met him by coincidence.

536
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,470
To be honest, I only see him as a friend.

537
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,180
Young fellows like you may not understand this, but

538
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,100
sometimes it's easier for adults

539
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,840
to have conversation over a drink.

540
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,070
Enough about me.

541
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,140
You should focus on your study more just like the rest of the students.

542
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,480
- Yuri-yuri, the class hasn't finished yet.
- I'm leaving.

543
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,420
Leaving? Wait, Yuri-yuri. Ouch!

544
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,930
Did he boycott your lesson?

545
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,230
I'm surprised he lasted this long.

546
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,480
For a Minami High student, passing the exam of the University of Tokyo is a stretch.

547
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,680
It doesn't mean that he has given up yet.

548
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,140
The girl didn't show up, either.

549
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,740
The cutie from Asakura Girls' School.

550
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,180
I was sure I understand my students well,

551
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,390
but it's the quite opposite.

552
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,140
I am a failure as a teacher.

553
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,680
You're finally becoming aware of your role as a teacher.

554
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,690
Whoever take a job seriously, tend to agonize over it.

555
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,980
We're dealing with people here.

556
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,360
Students can sense it when you're reluctant.

557
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,840
That means you haven't done your job as a teacher.

558
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,190
It's quite an improvement.

559
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,780
<i>Excuse me.</i>

560
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,470
I'm quitting the school.

What?

562
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,790
- Why?
- Teacher,

563
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,500
Kyo...

564
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,630
and your friend with heavy makeup...

565
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,200
Have you worried that if they'd ever come to hate you one day?

566
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,700
Sorry?

567
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,960
I don't know

568
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,460
how can I make people love me.

569
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,790
As much as I love them.

570
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,300
- Eto Mika?
- They love me at first.

571
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,000
But they all betrayed and dumped me as soon as I fall for them.

572
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:23,530
I'm just so happy when they treat me kindly.

573
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:29,510
I fall for them as soon as they fall for me.

574
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,630
Let's talk in a separate room.

575
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,720
Why did they all come to hate me in the end?

Did something happen?

578
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,290
We shouldn't be walking side-by-side,

579
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,840
since you're wearing school uniform, Mika.

<i>[Motels]</i>

581
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,260

we split up in the end.

583
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,400
But I've never

forgotten about you, Mika.

585
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,340
Such a liar.

Shall we go in here?

588
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,950
What's the matter?

589
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:32,890
I wish someone tells me this is wrong.

590
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,110
I wish someone is here to stop me.

591
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,830
What is your business with my student?

592
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,770
My name is Harumi.

593
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,980
I'm Mizuno.

594
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,230
Well, she was curious about love motels,

595
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,780
so she pestered me to take her in.

596
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,550
Girls these days are quite a handful,

597
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:04,150
being curious about such places. She was pushing her luck.

598
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:07,040
So troublesome.

599
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,130
Lift your chin up and take a close look

600
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,000
at this piece of trash.

601
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,340
If you have business with Ms. Eto,

602
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,180
then let's have a proper conversation between two adults.

603
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,650
That won't be necessary.

604
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,150
Let's go.

605
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,830
Eto Mika.

606
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:53,960
Stop saying

607
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,670
"I was betrayed" so easily.

608
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:03,010
Stop shifting the blame on others.

609
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,250
Take responsibility for your action

610
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,990
when you fall for someone.

611
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,520
For instance, even if the person you love doesn't reciprocate your feelings,

612
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:25,320
or if your lover's feelings for you change,

613
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:30,890
even so, you should be glad  that you have loved him.

614
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,700
Fall in love with a man who deserves your love.

615
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,800
Even if you fall out of love,

616
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,110
you should be thankful for the wonderful love.

617
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,110
Teacher.

618
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,390
Well said for someone who doesn't much love experience.

619
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,860
Indeed.

620
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,310
Why are you here?

621
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,800
Are you scared of me?

622
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,010
I treated Kabu to a hamburg steak with cheese this time.

<i>Hamburg steak!</i>

624
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:29,340
Your house is impressive.

625
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,570
What did you want to talk about?

626
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,720
Harumi-sensei might take the day off tomorrow.

627
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,900
What did you do to her?

628
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,130
I bet she run around to look for me,

629
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,440
she might have injured her lower back again.

630
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,950
I understand just a little

631
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,160
what makes Harumi-sensei attractive.

632
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,270
She may not look it, but she's mature.

633
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,910
She acted like a sophisticate adult.

634
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,760
What are you saying?

635
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:10,740
So it can't be helped that she treats you like a little boy.

636
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,660
Why do you love her so much

637
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,000
when you know she won't love you back?

638
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,190
Is it because she is worthy of your love?

639
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,990
Don't tell me... is she your first love?

640
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,520
If you have free time,

641
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,430
why don't you study too?

642
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,970
What?

643
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,720
If you study like your life depends on it,

644
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,370
you might find what you're looking for.

645
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:58,540
You're my first love.

646
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,420
I've made up my mind.

647
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,180

00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,670
Hello? This is Yakumo. It's been a while.

699
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:21,370
May I ask where the Kaijokisen ship is right now?

700
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,010
This is mechanical energy at point B.

701
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,470
If you look at this, the mechanical energy is...

702
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,220
You see this often. This is the subject.

703
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:34,050
"Be inclined to" means "You want to do something." This is a famous expression.

704
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:38,030
You should memorize it. This is called reducing agent,

705
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:41,900
because it's an element that loses an electron

706
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:46,000
<i>to an electron recipient.</i>

707
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,830
- It's this way.
- No, it's the other way.

708
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,500
It's that way, right?

709
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,110
It should be in front of that building.

710
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,720
We found it.

711
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,140
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

712
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,650
Do you have any comic books about history?

713
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:09,890
Oh, there are those books on the third floor.

714
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:12,910
- I think.
- Thank you.

715
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:19,120
Wow! This is my first time coming to a used bookstore.

717
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,860
Is he skipping class today?

718
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,070
I guess Yuri is

719
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:39,080
an ordinary boy, after all,

720
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,520
Hey Kyo, if you finish reading all the manga

721
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,330
won't it surprise Zunko-sensei? Right?

722
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:56,100
Magic encyclopedia? You are not going to read it!

723
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,570
I know it's difficult, but I'd like to receive it by 11:00 pm.

724
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,220
Yes. I'm counting on you.

725
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,910
Hey Kyo. Aren't there a lot of universities around here?

726
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,840
- Yes.
- Is the University of Tokyo here too?

727
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,890
I'm not sure.

728
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:22,040
I'm going Yokohama now to pick up the tote bags.

We can do this. See you.

732
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,620
What?

733
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,190
- Isn't he Zunko-sensei's cousin?
- Hey!

734
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,550
- Pull yourself together!
- Are you okay?

735
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,130
Call an ambulance!

736
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,860
Please don't call an ambulance.

737
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,350
I'm all right.

738
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:02,290
Ah, well... does it hurt anywhere?

739
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,350
Do you have water?

740
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,850
Hello? I'd like to speak to Harumi-sensei.

741
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,560
- They should focus on that.
- Excuse me!

742
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,880
I'll explain that in detail.

743
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,340
Harumi-sensei, where are you going?

744
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,760

Oh, thank you.

Yurian!

749

Over here!

750
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,790
Masashi, are you okay?

751
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,470
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

752
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,480
It's just fatigue.

753
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,150
I have to go to the Yokohama port

754
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,390
and deliver the packages to Iseshima.

755
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,600
- You're not in good shape now.
- He's right.

756
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,160
You should ask someone else to do it.

757
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,130
From Yokohama to Iseshima...

758
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,630
That would take a least five hours!

759
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,840

00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,890
Alright. I'm coming with you.

Thank you, everyone. You can go home.

763
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,660
Masashi, lead the way.

764
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,360
What are you saying?

765
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,310
There's no way you can drive us there.

766
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,410
Who do you think I am?

767
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:32,200
A long time ago, I was your rival once before.

768
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,860
I can do it. I will be able to do it if I try.

769
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,840
- Seriously?
- You're in a critical situation, right?

770
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,800
You wouldn't be this way otherwise.

771
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,850
I know you've worked so hard to get here.

772
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,740
Masashi, your pride...

773
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,600
Let me help you protect it.

774
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,380

Promise me you won't crash.

782
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:31,840
I'll try not to.

783
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:42,520
I'm sorry to bother the students preparing for the exam.

784
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,560
Would it be bothersome?

785
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:50,620
If a 32-year-old woman

786
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:54,950
gets a love confession from a high school student,

787
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,720
would it be a bother?

788
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,940
I'm sorry.

789
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,090
Please forget what I said.

790
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:20,230
Drive safe.

791
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,270
No way.

792
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,900
It's getting interesting!

793
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,380
I know, right?

794
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:38,960
Watch the speed.

<i>You are speeding too much! What are you thinking?</i>

796
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,400
I haven't driven since the time

797
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,150
when I helped Miwa move three years ago.

798
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,560
- So I'm a little rusty...
- Hey, change the lane!

799
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,730
You've got to be kidding me.

800
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:01,500
Why are you in the car, Yurian?

801
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,140
Did you just realize that now?

802
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,910
How could you now notice me?

803
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:06,750
Get off. Get off now.

804
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:10,020
If I let my cute student die, I wouldn't be able to die in peace.

Harumi, watch it!

806
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,650
I'm going to die.

807
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:33,150

Jun...

815
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,730
I went to the University of Tokyo,

816
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,180
but it didn't make my life better.

817
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,390
People always talk down to me out of jealousy.

818
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:17,580
I fend those off,

819
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,690
and in order to get what I want,

820
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:22,070
I have to work twice as hard as everyone else.

821
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,380
Besides...

822
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,990
I haven't been able to get what I really want yet...

823
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,540
Thank you for calling me.

824
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:59,780
It's a bad habit of his since he was little.

825
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:04,270
He gets sick only when he's alone.

826
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:06,550
I just happened to be there.

827
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,990
For the past several days,

828
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:13,380
I've been really upset with you.

829
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:19,690
If you are not serious, you can forget the university exam.

830
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,970
You have no time for a detour.

831
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:29,500
You want to get into the University of Tokyo while skipping the cram school? Don't make me laugh.

Every single day.

835
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:46,950
People put constant effort in order to take the entrance exam,

836
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:51,360
but only a handful of students will pass.

837
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,700
Like Masashi.

838
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,560
If you skip again,

839
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:05,050
