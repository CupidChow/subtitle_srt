It's unheard of that you've never been in love at age thirty-two.</i>

<i>You couldn't get into the University of Tokyo, your job is lame, and even marriage is hopeless.</i>

4

<i>Having a daughter like you is an embarrassment to the family.</i>

5

<i>Do you consider permanent employment?</i>

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,230
<i>He's a pathetic piece of trash that is worthless to society.</i>

<i>You shouldn't submit to the person who treats people</i>

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,960

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,370
<i>Can you help me to get admitted into the University of Tokyo?</i>

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,090
<i>But I want to be excited about life just once.</i>

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,290
<i>I want my heart to flutter.</i>

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,180
<i>Teacher, here. I want to be a unique adult.</i>

<i>Alright, let's start our lesson.</i>

<i>[November, 2017]</i>

15
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,020
This sentence has two objects.

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,050
The pattern of the sentence is called S-V-O-O.
<i>(T/N: Subject, Verb, Object, Object)</i>

17
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,630
The person comes first when you have more than one object.

18
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,060
So the verb, "give" come before objects.

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,830
Then the word "you", come before "my email address".

20
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,670
Harumi-sensei, it's getting late.

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,290
- His parents might be worried.
- Oh.

22
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,730
I'm sorry. I didn't notice it.

23
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,530
Yuri, it's finished for today.

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,370

How come you are still up?

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,250
You've been working a lot of overtime lately. Are you busy?

30
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,610
Yes, I'm assigned to a new student.

33

Are you going on a trip?

35
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,270
Well, our wedding anniversary is coming up soon.

36

Congratulations. Then let me do something to celebrate it.

37
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,830

<i>[Female: 48,000 yen, Male: 58,000 yen]</i>

70
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,290
When you talk about hypothetical situations in the past,

71
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,810
you use the past perfect subjective. When you translate it,

72
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,210
pay attention to the different types of tenses.

73
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,810
Pay attention to

74
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,800
- the different types of tenses.
- That's all for today's lesson.

75
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,630
You have a year and a half till the entrance exam.

76
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,950
First, we need to decide on your major, Yurihei.

77
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,530
- Yurihei?
- In the University of Tokyo,

78
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,720
the Humanities courses are divided into Hum-1, Hum-2, Hum-3.

79
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,410
The Science courses are divided

80
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,410
into Science-1, Science-2, and Science-3.

81
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,750
When you are a junior in college,

82
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,960
your major you will be officially finalized.

83
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,970
This is the rough idea of majors you can choose.

84
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,900
Which major are you interested in?

85
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,210
Forget what I asked. Think about it once you get in.

86
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,400
In order to pass the entrance exam,

87
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,030
let's pick the major with the highest chance of passing.

88
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,600
Your only goal is to become a student of the University of Tokyo. Are you okay with that?

89
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,990
Yes.

90
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,710
In that case, you should avoid the Humanities courses

91
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,030
since there are memorization based subjects, and you don't have enough time.

92
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,900
The ones I would recommend is either the Science-1

93
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,300
which accepts a larger number of students.

94
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,900
Or the Science-2 which has the lowest passing score.

95
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,410
- What about the Science-3?
- The Science-3 is...

96
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,910
for prodigious genius students, which is the hardest to get in, so forget it.

97
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,840
The hardest to get in.

98
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,790
If you want to get in, don't be too greedy.

99
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,370
There's a person who applied to

100
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,660
the hardest humanity course, hoping that her parents would be happy

101
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,860
if she'd become a lawyer or a prosecutor.

102
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,410
As a result, she ended up failing miserably.

103
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,470
And the person is sitting right in front of you.

104
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,360
That means...

105
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,640
you failed to get into the Humanities-1.

106
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,900
- Indeed.
- What did you want to be?

107
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,710
I don't even know that today.

108
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,410
There he is!

109
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,020
- Found him!
- You're done with your lesson, right?

110
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,790
Can I borrow him for a while?

111
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,430
- We'll borrow him.
- We'll borrow him!

112
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,790
Hey, where are you taking Kyohei, Zunko-sensei?

113
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,670
I'm sending him home, so he doesn't get kidnapped by you guys.

114
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,280
Hey, let me go.

115
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,760
A guy who takes the entrance exam of the University of Tokyo

116
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,720
has no time for matchmaking parties.

117
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,930
What?

118
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,940
The teacher at our school said

119
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,710
there are things more important than studying.

120
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,390
A punk like you normally don't listen to your teacher anyway.

121
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,740
Sorry but I can't hang out with you guys.

122
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,000
I have a quiz tomorrow.

123
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,400
Kyohei...

124
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,250
- Is Zunko-sensei capable enough to teach you?
- Hey now!

125
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,440
If you fail, your dad will destroy the entire cram school.

126
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,960
What kind of person is he?

127
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,730
I know!

128
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,750
How about we'll study after the matchmaking parties?

129
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,400
Great idea!

130
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,090

- What a nice place.

140
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,510
Why did you drag me into this?

141
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,800
Okay. Stop.

142
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,640
Listen carefully.

143
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,510
A matchmaking party is a battle.

144
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,730
Yes, Ma'am.

145
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,960
That's what an amateur says. The key to a success is teamwork.

146
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,760
First, each of you should act a role with different personalities.

147
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,350
Yes, Ma'am!

148
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,610
Study after taking care of your business.

Their life can be ruined if they don't date a right girl.

174
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,510
For your students, I'll make sure they'll make the right decision.

175
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,060
- Since you can't do it.
- Right.

176
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,570
I didn't expect much from Minami High, but

177
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,130
not bad at all.

178
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,560
I know.

179
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,320
Let's go home, Miwa.

180
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,410
Oh right. Hey, listen.

181
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,350
What was written on the letter

182
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,340
you wrote to yourself when you were fifteen?

183
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,300
I bet it was written "Did you get into the University of Tokyo?"

184
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,440
or, "Are you married already?" Right?

185
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,920
It said, "Have you become the person you wished to be?"

186
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,800
That's a perfect question to adults who live in despair.

187
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,630
I bet my 15 year-old-self would hate the current me.

188
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,890
You may be lacking in many ways, but

189
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,640
you can at least get married to make your young-self's dream come true.

190
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,040
Blind dates are the best textbooks for finding a marriage partner.

191

We've come here to educate you.

192
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,530
Okay! The strategic discussion is over.

193
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,740
- Okay!
- Coach!

194
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,710
I'm debating if I should cut my hair short. Will I look good in short hair?

195
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,170
Mika, I'm sure you will look great

196
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,740
- in short hair.
- Agreed.

197
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,970
Do you think so?

198
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,320
That girl is something.

199
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,900
Talking about hair style is

200
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,840
a good topic because your eyes meet often.

201
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,490
That's a very helpful tip.

202
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,830
Kyohei, what do you think?

203
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,570
- I guess it's good.
- Really?

204
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,970
I'm so glad that I came today.

205
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,970
I was invited to this, but

206
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,700
I wasn't sure if I should come or not.

207
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,250
What? Why is that?

208
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,060
At the previous blind date,

209
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,330
I was asked to liven up the mood.

210
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,810
So I talked about different topics, but then...

211
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,270
the boys rumored that I was a loose woman.

212
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,900
There was a boy who liked me, but

213
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,100
even that person misunderstood me.

214
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,690
I know.  You just wanted to liven up the mood, right?

215
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,080
Exactly!

216
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,130
Beware. She is a horrifying blame-shifter.

217
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,800
A blame-shifter?

218
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,110
A woman who poses herself as a victim

219
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,430
never takes any responsibility for her own action.

220
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,470
If you date her,

221
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,360
- she would  blame on you for everything.
- What!

222
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,670
Oh well. Let's ask their phone numbers now.

223
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,350
We can talk more after that.

224
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,180
- Got it.
- Got it.

225
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,230

226
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,890

Sorry, we'll leave soon enough.

229

Well, that's not right. We'll pay on our own.

There you are.

347
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,560
Good morning, Yurinohito!

348
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,360
Harumi?

349
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,500
It's crazy trying to recruit students from our school.

350
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,920
Ask them to assign you to a better school.

351
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,470
Why are you even saying things like that?

352
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,650
I thought it'd be fun because you're here, Yurizo!

353
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,290
What's with you?

354
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,850
Endo and Nara look somewhat adorable for me.

355
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:03,190
They're way better than students who only focus on their own studies

356
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,030
and don't pay attention to class.

357
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,950
There aren't even many students who are in the classroom in the first place.

358
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,960
Look.

359
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,930
I'm definitely getting a pay cut.

360
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,440
A pay cut?

361
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm just here for my first meeting today. Do you know Yamashita-sensei who is in-charge?

362
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,250
- Was it you? Are you listening to me?
- It's him.

363
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,140
Tell me the truth. You guys did it, right?

364
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,180
We said no.

365
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,680
I can't believe a word you guys say.

366
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,440
Geez.

367
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,630
Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you. I know you're busy.

368
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,410
- I'm from Sanno Seminar.
- Harumi?

369
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,720
Yamashita?

<i>[Episode 2]</i>

373
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:36,160
I never imagined you would become a teacher.

374
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,930
Same here.

375
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,490
I never thought you would...

376
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,000
Did you think I would become a lawyer or a bureaucrat?

377
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,570
I'm also a teacher. But I just teach at an unknown cram school.

378
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,390
On top of that, I strained my back.

379
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,450
- But you look well.
- Yes, I'm good.

380
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,550
You seem like you're doing well... or not.

381
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,390
You overheard me, didn't you? Before I realized it,

382
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,010
I ended up using the same phrase as my old teacher, who I hated.

383
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,340
I'm the worst.

384
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,350
The other day, I also said

385
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,550
the same phrase my mother used to tell me.

386
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,020
- I see you have a child.
- No, no.

387
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,770
I don't. I'm unmarried, single, and free.

388
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,240
- Free?
- Yes.

389
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,270
That's why I accidentally said it to my student.

390
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:35,380
I said romance gets in the way of entrance exams.

391
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,960
Even teachers should apologize when they made mistakes.

392
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,840
You sure were cool.

393
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,240
You know...

394
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,410
I...

395
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,480
back then... <i>I wanted to become a teacher</i>

396
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,970
like how you taught me.

397
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,620
Yamashita.

398

<i>[Sanno Seminar]</i>

399
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,330
You understand the grammar up until here. Well done.

400
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,700
But I still have a lot to learn.

401
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,250
Where you fall short is vocabularies.

402
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:30,080
You can't master English, unless you memorize vocabularies.

403
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,710
You memorize with your right brain, so you could try using your left hand.

404
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,300
Really?

405
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,070
My point is, there is more to life than college.

406
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,660
You're not getting much sleep lately, are you?

407
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,490
Sleeping is a waste of time.

408
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,750
Listen up.

409
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,100
Taking exams is...

<i>[Study -> Routine]</i>

411
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,070
You should incoporate your study into your daily life.

412
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,800
If you overdo it, you won't hold up till the end.

413
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,880
Got it?

414
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,750
We'll end today's lesson here.

415
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,950
You know...

416
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,690
What is it?

417
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,890
You sounded like a real cram school teacher just now.

418
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,180
Were you and Yamashita classmates?

419
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:25,330
Yes. I think, we were in the same class in the 11th grade.

420
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,280
But I never thought he'd become a teacher.

421
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,540
<i>It must be boring teaching at this school.</i>

422
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,540
<i>Doing boring stuff seriously is what it means to be an adult.</i>

423
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,700
"Doing boring things seriously is what it means to be an adult."

424
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,520
That's what Yamashita said.

425
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,060
Yamashita

426
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,500
was the only person in my entire life

427
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,660
- who has ever confessed to me.
- What?

428
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:57,680
Back then, I just failed the exam for the University of Tokyo, I was lacking in confidence.

429
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,860
I wasn't sure of my feelings for him.

430
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,660
So I laughed it off and ran away.

431
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,240
But,

432
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,070
whenever I face a hard time after being an adult,

433
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,450
I recalled his confession.

434
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,360
On days when I couldn't love myself for some reason,

435
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,390
I was comforted many times for knowing

436
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,860
that someone had looked at me once.

437
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,720
So I'm sorry. I take back what I said before.

438
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,290
Yurian, I want you to experience romance while studying.

439
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,600
Because a girlfriend could give you courage.

440
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,500
Probably. Well, I'm not really sure.

441
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,360
Does that mean

442
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,550
someone praises me for what I've done.

443
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,200
You don't need a relationship for that.

444
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,220
Like what you told me...

445
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,180
when we first met.

446
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,490
<i>Invincible pink.</i>

447
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,200
<i>What a nice color.</i>

448
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,520
A compliment like that

449
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,640
can strive people to press forward.

450
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,510
Yurian.

451
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,380
That's why I wanted you to tutor me-

452
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,050
Ouch! Not again!

453
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,920
My lower back!

454
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,930
- Are you okay?
- It hurts!  No!

455
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,390
I'm okay. Ouch.

456
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,170
No! It's the test period, so students aren't allowed inside.

457
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,010
That's not the time for this.

458
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,590
Ouch!

- Oh, there.

- Huh?
- I definitely recommend

00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,240
the grilled giblet. Oh, good work today.

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,560
Did you just say something?

476
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,040
What?

477
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,060

00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,520
about Kyohei Yuri?

482
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,950
What?

483
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,220
What about him?

484
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,660
Take a look.

<i>The college enrollment rates among high school graduates are declining...</i>

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,860
<i>What?</i>

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,930
<i>You shouldn't submit</i>

You better make sure his son passes, otherwise he could make your life a living hell.

497
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,240
What if he holds the cram school accountable for it?

498
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,170
I can't believe a student of Minami High wants to get in the University of Tokyo.

499
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,480
Tell me about it.

500
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,170
That's ridiculous.

501
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:52,960
The student is the one who is responsible for the outcome.

502
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,360
The student is the one who holds a pen and takes the exam.

503
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,740
It has nothing to with parents.

504
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:04,630
It's my duty to teach students with all my might if they need my help.

- Are you okay?
- Stay back! It's contagious.

512
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,250
Contagious? A strained back?

513
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,190
Please return to your seats. It's dangerous.

514
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,700

515
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,700

00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:23,510
A person becomes a full-grown adult in twenty years! It's the life span

523
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,830
- of a panda-
- Okay, I see your point.

524
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,760
If you do, take prompt action.

525
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,050
Your cousin might be at a matchmaking party right as we speak...

526
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:37,070
Even if she's in her thirties who failed in a college exam, job hunting, or getting married...

527
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,470
Hold on now.

528
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,720
Those all true,

529
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,700

530
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:47,300
Sorry. You seemed so pathetic, incompetent, spineless-

531
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,540
Hold on!

532
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,440
I was about to call her now.

533
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,370
Then do it.

534
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,270
Do it. Right now.

535
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,670
Okay, I'm calling her.

536
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,710
Hello, Junko. This is last minute, but...

537
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,530
What? It's not a good time?

538
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,140
I see.

539
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,570
It's good that you're busy.

540
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,000
Do you have a question?

541
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,060
What does it mean when a high school boy

542
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,480
rest his head on your lap and glares at you?

543
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,080
The young rival is aggressive!

544
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,510
Well... that means, Junko.

545
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,390
You know...

546
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:49,370
a pubescent boy does that to a random girl who means nothing to him.

547
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,590
I also used to do that to girls who I wasn't interested in

548
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:56,350
all the time. Not just on their laps,

549
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,860
I rested my head on their elbows, ankles, and all sorts of places.

550
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,160
Ouch. It hurts.

I'm Mika Eto, student at 11th grade of Asakura Girls' High. I'll be joining this cram school!

560
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,140
Hey.

561
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,770
How do you find out about this place?

562
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,730
It wasn't easy to find you.

563
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,250
The girl who went to middle school with you didn't know...

564
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,610
I searched you on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook...

565
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:47,030
But I couldn't find you anywhere on social media.

566
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,940
Then finally...

567
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,060
I found the hamburg steak guy.

568
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,670
<i>Hamburg steak!</i>

569
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,660
He made me buy him a hamburg steak...

570
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,240
- So he is the traitor.
- Oh!

571
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,220
You're the scary blame-shifter!

572
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:09,240
This is all your fault, Kyo.

573
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,540
Youngsters sure have their ways.

574
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,230
You can pass your exam and fall in love!

575
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,930
You just want to get a pay raise, don't you?

576
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:23,910
I'm just trying to avoid a pay cut. Don't underestimate "the exploitative cram school".

577
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:27,350
Ms. Eto, you can complete your registration here.

578
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,110
This way, please.

00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,840
She's a new student. Please help her with her application.

580
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,980
Sorry, Kyohei.

581
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,000
But that hamburg steak was delicious.

582
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,990
It was so juicy.

583
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,380
- You are annoying.
- It was juicy.

584
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,400
Whoa!

585
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,330
What a cool car.

586
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:52,400
There you are, Kyo. Is it true what she says?

587
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,000
Why can't we study together?

588
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,360
I told you, our cram school tutors students individually!

589
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,910

590
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,680
Masashi, what brings you here?

00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,660
<i>Masashi, I'm really sorry. I have to cancel today's dinner.</i>

592
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,670
Matsuoka told me you strained your back again.

593
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,510
I was in the area, so I figured I'd take you home.

594
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,270
What? Zunko-sensei, did you have a boyfriend?

595
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,490
No, he's my cousin.

596
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,140
Oh, cousin?

597
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,640
Are you the one who's aiming to get into the University of Tokyo?

598
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,210
- What? The University of Tokyo?
- That's right.

599
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,690
This is Kyohei Yuri.

600
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:36,080
He's aiming for the science courses, so I might ask for your help in the future!

601
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,370
If a guy like you with pink hair gets in,

602
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,500
that university may become a little interesting.

603
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,830
Are you a graduate of the University of Tokyo?

604
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,780
I'll help you out anytime since you're Jun's student.

605
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,360
No, thanks.

606
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,490
I'll manage on my own.

607
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,870
Good. That's the spirit!

608
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,220
Oh, no.  I have to get going.

609
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,700
Are you going somewhere?

610
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,280
A seminar for cram school teachers. I have to study, too.

611
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,400
Should I drive you there?

612
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,740
Really? That'd be great.

613
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,380
Take care, guys.

- Bye.

615

Bye bye.

616
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:26,080
I've never thought Junko-sensei has such an elite cousin.

617
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,990
He probably knows a lot of elites he can introduce her to.

618
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,380
Kyo.

619
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,460
You like that teacher, don't you?

620
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,860
I can understand how you feel a little.

621
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,780
My mom raised me by herself, so I'm attracted to older

622
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,460
and mature guys.

623
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,950
It's not what you think.

624
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,960
Don't tell her anything stupid.

625
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,820

626
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,280

00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,470
But he's improved so much in a short period of time.

630
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,370

632
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,170
when I look at that boy, I've started to realize something.

633
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,290
Like what?

634
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,000
I realized that studying is fun.

635
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,690

636
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,060
There was a guy in a research room at college.

637
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,590
He didn't study until he got into high school.

638
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:46,230
But he had an extraordinary ability to focus

639
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:51,490
on games and everything, not only for studying.

640
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,520
He was also self-motivated.

641
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,790
Then, he will be fine.

642
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,840

643
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:07,330

It's about her ability.

Hey, you guys. Face forward.

699
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,550
Teacher, what's your bra size?

700
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,190
Idiot. She won't tell us!

701
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:44,100
I mean, how will studying help us?

702
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,160
It's useless.

703
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,620
I totally agree.

704
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:11,540
I don't mean to brag, but I've studied so hard since I was young.

705
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:17,220
And it didn't help me a bit when I searched for a job or a husband.

706
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:23,020
I studied without thinking, just because I was told to.

707
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:29,400
As a result, I'm here right now,

708
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,480
giving you a lecture to promote my school.

709
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,800
I'm a screw-up teacher on the verge of getting fired.

710
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,260
You are no good, then!

711
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:47,000
So if you think studying is meaningless,

712
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,670
then don't study.

713
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,940
But you know...

714
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,320
even if you don't care about yourself,

715
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,790
what about when you have someone you care about?

716
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,150
Not being able to protect your beloved person will be

717
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:08,670
more miserable than not being able to protect yourself.

718
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:13,890
When you marry someone and get a loan for a house,

719
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:18,840
and pensions, medical and life insurance in case of occurrences.

720
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:24,070
It's your loss if you don't study at least to understand the complicated contracts.

721
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:26,370
You could get scammed in the worst case.

722
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,570
You think it's still a long way ahead.

723
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,110
But you'll be surprised when you passed thirty,

724
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:38,230
your back and knees will suddenly get weakened.

725
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,880
Especially your lower back.

726
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,440
- I don't want to carry you again.
- It looked painful.

727
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,560
And...

728
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,880
when you have a child who looks just like you in the future,

729
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,790
you will want to support their dream.

730
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:59,660
What if you lack knowledge, wisdom, or ability in order to do so?

731
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:08,590
Imagine what kind of person you want to be.

732
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:12,170
And think what kind of studies do you need to become that person.

733
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,180
The knowledge and effort you gain from studying

734
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,940
will surely help you, even when

735
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,970
you screw up in your life like I have.

736
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,500
So I wish you the best of luck.

737
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,330
For your own sake,

738
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:40,840
and the sake of your precious people in your future.

739
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,350
Teacher,

740
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:55,630
I want you to teach me first how to find your beloved person.

741
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:01,360
Sorry, I'd like to know that myself, too.

742
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,820
What? You don't know?

743
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,170
Go to matchmaking parties.

744
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,870
- By hitting on girls.
- There is no way you could.

745
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,840
- I'd like to hit on girls.
- I like doing both.

746
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:18,870
It was my first time seeing my students listen quietly to a lecture.

747
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,340
It wasn't what I originally planned, though.

748
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,000
You haven't changed.

749

- Can I go to the cram school today?
- What?

760
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,330
- But...
- I told him I wouldn't take the exam unless I study with you.

Then my dad gave in and said to do whatever I want.

- What?
- You failed the most difficult exam in  Humanities courses.

772
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,790
If I pass the exam for Sciences-3,

773
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,940
I will be able to clear out the inferiority you are feeling.

00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,230
but now that she is striving to work her way up again.

874
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:33,700
I like her now even more that I don't want to give her up.

875
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,660
- What?
- Is that bad?

876
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:42,100
Masashi, that's great!

877
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,210
I'm sorry. I've underestimated you.

878
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,350
Let's win Junko's heart together!

879
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,880
- You are a nice person!
- Let's make a toast.

880
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,940
Cheers!

881
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:54,080
That calls for...

882
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,890
The order for pink Dom Pérignon!

883
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,320
- Thank you.
- Hey!

884
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,760
<i>Junko, are you still awake?</i>

885
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:13,960
♫ <i>Happy Birthday, I just want you to say it to me</i> ♫

<i>any of the future you pictured.</i>

891
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:47,960
<i>Not only that, I found something more important</i>

892
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:52,270
<i>than "The person I want to become" that you coolly worded.</i>

893
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,410
<i>I'm spending busier days than you would have expected.</i>

Oh? Junko's phone is busy.

900
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:24,550
What? At this hour?

901
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:28,570
<i>I hope you could...</i>

902
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,680
<i>like who I am now as well.</i>

903
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:38,500
It's me.

904

00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,590
<i>Harumi, do you have a boyfriend?</i>

907
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:51,820
<i>Of course, I will make it in time.</i>

908
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:55,310
<i>Who do you think I am? There is no way I can't do it.</i>

909
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:59,410
<i>Would it bother you if a high schooler confesses his love to you?</i>
