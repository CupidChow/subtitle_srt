Nobody wants to work.

235
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:02,220
From a historical point of view, the more developed a country is, the more people have free time.

236

The leisure of humans has given rise to science and philosophy.

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,430
The University of Tokyo.

355
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,800
I'll pass. It was nice working with you.

356
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,230
Wait, Harumi-sensei. Do you call yourself a teacher?

357
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,920
If the student of Minami High enrolls in the University of Tokyo, he could be in the Guinness Book.

358
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,050
It'd be a good advertisement for the school if he passes. Why don't you personally teach him, Manager?

359
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,370
My job is strictly administrative only.

360
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,680
Tell me. Isn't the poster false advertising?

361
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,120
I wouldn't call it false advertising.

362
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,430
This is just an encouragement to achieve one's goal.
<i>[We promise to make your dream come true]</i>

363
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,160
We encourage students in a positive way.

364
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,720
Take a seat.

365
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,950
Sure.

366
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,450
Yuri, can you take the scholastic aptitude test first?

367
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,270
How many hours have you been studying per day?

368
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,530
I haven't. I haven't even touched a textbook since middle school.

369
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,160
Laziness isn't something you should be proud of. This test is for 9th graders.

370
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,210
- When I was a 6th grader, I studied so hard-
- Harumi-sensei.

371
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,390
Sorry about that.

372
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,370
I thought you hated studying. What made you change your mind?

373
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,730
My dad said I don't need to attend cram school.

374
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:53,790
He changed his mind after meeting an arrogant teacher here.

375
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,870
- He means you, Harumi-sensei.
- My apologies.

376
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,570
So I've decided to enroll in the University of Tokyo

377
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,850
by studying in the damn cram school.

378
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,830
- He called it "damn school".
- My apologies.

379
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,790
Okay.

380
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:12,280
I'm going to speak to you as a human being.

381
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,680
Fall in love right now.

382
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,920
- What?
- What was that?

383
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:25,570
One out of five people in their 30s stays unmarried for life.

384
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,520
Is the speech worth standing up for?

385
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,980
- I just don't want him to have any regret in his life.
- Say what?

386
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,960
If you wait to fall in love until you're older,

387
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,300
love may not come around so easily.

388
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,020
I only realized it now

389
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,190
that it may be too late for me to love someone.

390
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,440
Is she mentally unstable?

391
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,600
Perhaps.

392
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,720
You're doing this just to oppose your father, aren't you?

393
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,400
So what?

394
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,440
Don't let someone else affect your decision, or choose your path for someone else's sake.

395
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,550
Ever since I was young,

396
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:15,240
I had one goal in my life which is studying at the University of Tokyo to fulfill my parents' wish.

397
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,770
I wasn't able to play with my friends or date boys.

398
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:26,660
But none of those mattered as long as I could study at the University of Tokyo.

399
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,710
However,

400
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:34,110
when I failed the exam, I lost my reason in life.

401
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,770
My life seemed meaningless because I couldn't find anything else I desired.

402
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,550
I failed...

403
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,160
what I regret the most was I didn't choose my own path.

404
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,450
Harumi-sensei.

405
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:54,200
Sorry. I was too self-assertive.

406
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:59,920
Such a lier. Didn't you tell me to be wild?

407
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,720
Because you're incompetent, you're not confident to help me pass the exam.

408

409
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,340

410

Did you get fired?

411
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:28,280
Yes, I'm sure I'm going to be.

- What?

415
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,370
I'm unemployed and a stupid old woman.

416
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:44,970
Think about it. The workplace wasn't suitable for a thirty-two-year-old stupid old woman

417
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,700
to find a first love.

418
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,280
You should look for a new job of your dream.

419
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,260
Unlike men, jobs will never betray you.

00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,600

Do adults run away from the police,

530
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,060
or yell at parents?

- Sounds good.

545
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,550
Please, teach me.

Alright, next. When as shown in Figure 1,

549
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:14,070
which way does the motor spin? A or B?

550
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,980
Answer it by using Fleming's right-hand rule.

551
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,990
Fleming?

552
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,820
Is it something like this?

553
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,820
- Fleming is sick.
- There is no such rule that would make your fingers cramp.

554
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,370
Current, field, and motion.

555
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,090

00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,960
Oh! It's "E".

557
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,630
Correct.

The motor is...

Hey,

I'm no longer going to be a teacher.

561
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,940
If you can get through this test,

562
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,610
why don't you try attending cram school again?

563
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:04,610
It doesn't matter what your parents want.

564
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:09,140
The knowledge that you obtain from studying is your own.

565
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,170
You're a weird adult.

566
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,930
You dumb brat.

567
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,820
But, you'll become an adult in a few years too.

568
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,940
When you are an adult, you can't blame your parents for your problems.

569
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,240
I'm weird, but that's my own problem.

570
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,220
Life isn't easy, though.

571
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,380

- What happened?
- My lower back.

575
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,500
My lower back hurts because I haven't run in a while.

576
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,480
You're not a grown-up woman, you're a grandma!

577

We're almost there. Hang in there.

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,520
Kyo? We're fine. We are almost at the osteopathic clinic.

Good luck with work!

00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,310

- Sorry, Granny.
- Granny?

00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,150
- Are you okay, Granny?
- Granny?

00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,860
Don't call me that!

Was it boring for you to teach at the cram school?

No, not at all.

589
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,300
Cram schools are different from normal schools.

590
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:47,410
Students are here for one reason, that is to study.

What's the best thing about being an adult?

620
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:46,950
My answer is that I got freedom.

621
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:51,910
- Freedom?
- I can do whatever I want of my own free will.

622

00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,660
There isn't. Nothing.

628
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,200
There's nothing that I want to do.

629
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,490
Now I obtained my freedom, but I feel like I'm lost.

I feel like I've always been searching for that,

I'm the manager, so I don't need to entertain customers.

What did you mean by "seven-second man"?

675
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,320
He came to me for advice when we were in middle school.

676
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,360
He told me that when he stared at girls for seven seconds, they all fell for him.

677
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,250
He seriously believed that he had a special ability.

678
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:50,690
Masashi must have been mentally unstable from studying too much.

679
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:54,470
Boys who can run fast were popular in middle school.

680
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,900
I mean, when he stared at them,

681
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,060
many girls must have fallen for him.

682
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,840
Damn it, he's always been a winner in his life.

683
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,790
I wonder about that.

684
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,500
He was complaining that he couldn't make his beloved one falls for him.

685
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,740
He may be having the same problem now.

686
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,420
Excuse me? Can we order dessert, too?

687
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,930

00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,710
I know you're high schoolers,

691
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:26,610
but if you extort money from the unemployed woman in her 30s, you're going straight to hell.

It's a long story.

00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,560
- Oh, where's Yuri?
- He's having a family meal.

696
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,970
His family is pretty rich.

697
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,710
That's good that he reconciled with his father.

698
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:50,790
He's not eating with his dad, but with his grandma.

699
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,920
I guess we're kind of responsible

700
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,280
for what happened between Kyohei and his old man.

701
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,820
How so?

702
