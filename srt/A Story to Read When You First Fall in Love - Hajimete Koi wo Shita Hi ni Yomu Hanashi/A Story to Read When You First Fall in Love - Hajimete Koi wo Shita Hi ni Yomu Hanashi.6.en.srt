Of course not!

Why are you going?

353
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,040
To look for my potential husband.

354
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,410
I bet graduates of your high school have respectable backgrounds.

355
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,390
I bet they are.

356
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,800
Do you still hate talking about failing to get into the University of Tokyo?

357
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:30,010
Haven't you started to like your current self after meeting Yurihei?

358
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,950
That's true, but...

359
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:39,030
- If you get a boyfriend at the reunion, Yurihei might give up on you.
- What?

360
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:45,930
Perhaps he might come to his senses.

361
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,800
Okay, I'll go.

362
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:01,690
Yurihei is the one who can spur you on the most.

363
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,660
Of course. I'm staking my life on this exam after all.

364
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,790
Here is the Hungry Jungle's signature dish, "Letter from the Amazon".

365
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,150
We didn't order this, either.

366
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,300
Seriously?

367
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,370
Really? Are you coming?

368
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,000
Okay.

369
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,210
Then, I'll call you again.

370
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,530
Hooray!

371
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,640
Should I wear a suit?

372
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,340
Or wearing a suit to a class reunion

373
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,500
is too lame?

374
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,560
What are you doing?

375
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,990
Stretching. It feels good.

376
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,510
It seems like your cousin is attending the class reunion.

377
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,790
You were eavesdropping!

378
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,620
I'm happy for you.

379
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,400
Despite how busy we are, my hard work paid off

380
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,640
for reserving the venue. Although, it wasn't a work-related task.

381
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,460
I'm really sorry. You see? I'm apologizing.

382
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,330
Organizing a class reunion was harder than I thought.

383
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,390
People didn't respond to the RSVP fast enough.

384
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,940
It's not something you should do when you're abroad on a business trip.

385
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,890
- Right.
- It was an easy task, anyway.

386
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,460
I just reserved a restaurant that's in the same building as my gym.

387
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,820
Hey, you are

388
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,790
actually a good guy.

389
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,900
You can thank me with a Bottega wallet.

390
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,530
- You sound like Matsuoka.
- Who is that?

391
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:40,090
You're so sly. You want to show off your popularity at the class reunion,

392
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,120
and trying to get your cousin jealous.

393
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,450
I know I'm being sly, but...

394
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:49,670
I'm popular among girls except for Junko.

395
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:53,670
Why can't I show off my strong point?

396
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,370
Couldn't it be your flaw?

397
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,870
The fact that you're popular is just because of your educational background and your social status.

398
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:05,770
Wait. Don't you want to admit my strength?

399
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,220
I have those too.

400
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,120
It sounds obnoxious to others, but

401
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,660
if I didn't have a great educational background or social status,

402
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,500
I feel like I would have a great encounter

403
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,250
with someone genuine.

404
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,010
You have a point.

405
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,330
I wonder

406
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,670
if I met Junko, not as my cousin in the first place,

407
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,970
I should've been married to her by now-

408
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,460
You wouldn't have. You would've never met her and that's the end of the story.

409
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,460
Maybe we would've had kids. I bet they would've been cute.

418
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,520
Okay.

419
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,720
Could I ask you something?

420
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,910
I want to prove that it is a trigonometric function instead of a periodic function.

421
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,530
A periodic function?

422
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,610
Let's see.

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,310

Okay. I will.

426
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,390
See you.

427
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,380

428
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,040
I'm sorry. Could you keep working on your assignment first?

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,240
Of course not.

439
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,760
You're working at a trading company​, right? You must be busy.

440
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,530
Yes, but I finished my work for today.

445
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,310
Now? My work is related to the energy industry.

Mainly, I'm working overseas.

Wow. You're amazing.

449
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,670
Okay.

450
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,600
Where is Matsuoka?

451
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,070
I'm sorry. What was your name again?

452
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,780
Well... I'm Saki, Saki Tanaka.

453
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,290
But, I transferred to Shizuoka when I was an eleventh grader.

454
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,950
So you must have forgotten me.

455
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,560
That's not true.

456
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,080
If you didn't transfer, we would've remembered you for sure.

457
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,510
- Right?
- Yes. Are you living in Tokyo now?

458
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,980
Yes, I got married.

459
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,430
Darn it.

460
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,530
So you're married.

461
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:15,740
I got divorced last year.

462
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,630
My ex cheated on me. It's so embarrassing.

463
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,350
Having a beautiful wife like you, yet

464
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,590
how could he cheat on you?

465
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:27,330
I think my marriage failed because I devoted my all to him.

466
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,120
Having a devoted wife is awesome.

467
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,100
Yes.

468
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,270
Really?

469
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,930
Is she plotting to con someone?

470
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,720
Can you tell us more?

471
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,950
Therefore, f(x) is not a periodic function.

472
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,350
But how come substitute "X" for "Minus P"?

473
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,690
That's because...

474
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:52,130
X plus P equals zero.

475
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,870
The right side of the equation is solved, right?

476
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,210
Yes.

477
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:07,090
I'm sorry. Excuse me for a second.

478
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,110
What? You can't come?

479
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,250
I'm really sorry.

480
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,200
I see...

481
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,580
Okay. Don't work too hard.

482
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,390
Sorry about that.

483
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,280
Let's try a practice question on the trigonometric function.

484
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,800
Okay.

485
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,790
My daughter is only three years old, so I have to work.

486
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,870
Compared to you guys,

487
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,220
my job is...

488
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,630
Oh! Are you okay?

489
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,450
Sorry. I'd like to come to a place like this.

490
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,880
I must be tired from overwork.

491
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,000
It must be hard for you. If there's anything you need, just call me.

492
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,940
Because I'm a lawyer.

493
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,600
Are you?

494
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,610
If you need a dental checkup for your child, you can count on me.

495
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,620
I have my own dental clinic in Mita.

496
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,590
I love children too, so call me anytime.

497
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,960
You can count on me for anything.

498
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,760
I heard Yakumo is single.

499
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,280
- Maybe I have a chance with him.
- Let's try talking to him.

500
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,520
A lawyer, a dentist,

501
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,030
a tax accountant,

502
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,020
and a CEO.

503
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,810
Not bad at all.

504
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,560
<i>[Sorry, I can't make it.]</i>

505
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,470
What?

506
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,970
By the way, did you know Makise

507
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,050
had a crush on you?

508
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:02,060
But you completely ignored her.

509
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,350
I think she got married.

510
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,560
We're all

511
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,530
- single though.
- Yes!

512
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,920
Can such a miraculous thing happen?

513
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,620
I wish Junko could see how popular he is.

514
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,670
It's Yamashita.

515
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,240
- Yamashita.
- Oh!

516
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,840
Yamashita!

517
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,220
What a fine man.

518
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,620
Come over here, Yamashita.

519
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,340
- We've been waiting for you.
- Hey, Yamashita.

520
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,020
Wait! Wait! Wait!

521
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,820
Long time no see, Yamashita.

522
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,450
I'm Saki.

523
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,000
You know, Saki Tanaka.

524
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,450
Oh, Tanaka. Were you in the same class as me?

525
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:49,060
Harumi said she can't make it tonight.

526
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,020
She can't?

527
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,020
Did she say something about me?

528
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,860
Well... you know...

529
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,740
Yamashita.

530
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,730
Long time no see.

531
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,640
Oh, Yakumo.

532
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,790
Yamashita is Kyohei Yuri's teacher.

533
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,730
What? Really?

534
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,840
Oh, yes. I'm his homeroom teacher.

535
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,740
So I get in touch with Harumi now and then.

536
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,940
Oh, I see.

537
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,560
Hey, Yamashita, are you married?

538
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,630
I was.

539
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,270
I just got divorced.

540
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,200
You got divorced?

541
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,020
Do you have time after this? Why don't the three of us go for a drink?

542
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,560
Right?

543
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,280
Fine by me.

544
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,350
Then, it's a date.

545
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,710
Okay.

546
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,210
Bye.

547
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,770
Goodbye.

548
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,490
Hello, Junko?

549
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:58,270
The party just ended. The second round will be at a bar called Rouge.

550
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,200
You should be done working by now.

551
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,610
You better come.

552
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,410
What in a world?

553
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,430
Geez.

554
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,370
The heck?

555
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:31,020
Oh no! These are brand-new.

556

<i>On the day you wear new shoes,</i>

557
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,960
<i>you'll be cursed with a downpour!</i>

558
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,900
Am I cursed?

559
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,280
Excuse me.

560
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,670
Not at all.

561
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,600
What a sudden downpour.

562
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,290
The weather forecast said it would be sunny today.

563
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,090
<i>Your lucky item is</i>

564
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,300
<i>emerald green sneakers.</i>

565
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:15,570
Oh, the shoes...

566
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,580
Right, your new shoes got wet.

567
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,690
No, I didn't mean mine.

568
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:28,030
These’re just sneakers, so I don't mind getting them wet.

569
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,550
Do you play sports?

570
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,080
I just came from a gym.

571
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,950
Well, I'm a dancer.

572
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,660
Pardon?

573
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,840
I'm an unsuccessful dancer.

574
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,640
Oh... a dancer.

575
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,310
I can't make a decent living with it though.

576
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,230
Money means nothing.

577
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:58,530
Having something you're passionate about

578
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,410
is wonderful.

579
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,620
Listen...

580
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,830
If you like,

581
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,350
how about we have tea somewhere

582
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,570
while we wait for the rain to stop?

583
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,940
Although I'm dressed like this.

584
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,590
Sure.

585
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,380
Thank you.

586
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,580
Here is your drink.

587
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,210
Matsuoka is late.

588
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,250
Isn't her name Tanaka?

589
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:53,490
Yeah... that's her maiden name.

590
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:57,450
Don't look so awkward. You're being too obvious.

591
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,420
I'm not.

592
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,910
It seems you're still close to Harumi.

593
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:07,460
She told me you give her weird souvenirs.

594
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,730
Jun is totally absorbed in preparing Yuri for his exam.

595
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,410
Well, since you're his homeroom teacher,

596
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:22,040
she must have to contact you a lot for work.

597
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,070
Say,

598
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:35,330
- has nothing ever happened between you and Harumi?
- What?

599
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,470
What do you mean? Why the sudden question?

600
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,550
Because...

601
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:43,500
you had a crush on her the whole time, yet you've never made a move.

602
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,040
Don't tell me you can't get it up.

603
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,690
You know,

604
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,520
you're still an idiot just like I remember.

605
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,620
Right back at you.

606
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,690
Do you call yourself a man? You're over thirty, for goodness's sake.

607
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,820
It's precisely because I am over thirty,

608
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,330
a real man doesn't act irrationally.

609
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,320
We, as humans, if something is precious to us-

610
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,300
I'm asking you about your own feelings, not about people in general.

611
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:15,280
I confessed to her in high school,

612
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,710
because I was head over heels for her.

613
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,450
I gave up after she rejected me.

614
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:26,300
But I was attracted to her again after reuniting.

615
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,250
I've kept wanting to call her but I stopped myself.

616
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,150
But I called in the end because I couldn't hold myself back.

617
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,400
It's been a long time since I've felt this way.

618
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:50,090
I spent the night in Harumi's room the other day.

619
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,590
Well, we were both wasted at that time.

620
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,560
Yakumo, you're a real man after all.

621
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,410
But I don't need your permission to pursue her.

00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:37,540
International tensions between the US and the Soviet Union were at their peak but In 1955,

640
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,230
the Big Four Summit was held in Geneva by the leaders of the US, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France.

641
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,220
I heard Yama-pyon was beaten by his wife.

642
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,470
His wife must have super strength.

643
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:49,440
I heard his wife has left him.

644
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,500
Did he cheat on her or something?

645
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,280
An adultery?

646
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,340
In the socialistic country that was oppressed under Stalin's administration,

647
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,330
people's demand for freedom grew rapidly...

Hey.

Aren't you married?

650
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:19,100
Well, it's not something I should be discussing with my students,

651
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,830
but we're divorced.

652
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,690

653
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:27,510
I didn't cheat or have an affair, so don't spread false rumors.

00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:40,280

There's no need to apologize.

Whether to Yakumo, who hasn't made a move in  twenty years,

661
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,780
or to you who unexpectedly​ appeared after ten years,

I'm confident that I won't lose.

663
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,490

like Yamashita?

677
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,890
What are you saying?

678
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:23,200
Then... are you guys dating?

679
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,240
I'm not in that kind of relationship with him. What kind of question is that?

680
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,690
If you're not dating him, why did you let him stay in your room?

681
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:35,080
Did Yamashita tell you that?

682
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,690
That was...

683
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,980
Do you like him?

684
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,700
Are you going to marry him?

685
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,210
Calm down now.

686
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:48,260
Yamashita is really just a friend.

687
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,060
He escorted me home that day because I was drunk.

688
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,670
And then we slept...

689
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,310
You slept?

690
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:01,130
That's not what I meant. We fell asleep.

691
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,560
Gosh, Yamashita is so mean!

692
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,490
- He told you out of all people.
- What?

693
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:12,790
I really didn't want anybody to find that out, especially you.

694
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,170
Especially me?

695
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:19,400
You know why, don't you?

696
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,170
Anyway, I didn't have sex or the other way around.

697
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,580

she didn't want anybody to find that out, especially me.

706
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,970
She looked flustered and said I should know why.

707
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:10,210
That means she likes me!

708
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,560
No matter how I see it, we have mutual feelings, don't you think?

709
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,330
Whatever. Just come back quickly.

710
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,470
Hooray!

711
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,230
I'm finished.

712
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,730
Then, let's stop here today.

713
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,000
Okay.

714
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,410
Come in.

715
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,420
How did I do?

716
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,930
You did well.

717
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:02,380
You must know it yourself that you have improved.

718
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,700
I do.

719
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,360
Still,

720
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,230
you're not there yet.

721
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,890
I know.

722
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:18,010
Hey, I would like to ask you one more time.

723
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,820
Do you still want to choose

724
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,750
the hardest science major, Science-3?

725
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:28,390
<i>I'm taking the exam for Science-3. If I pass the exam,</i>

726
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,480
<i>ii might help you to overcome your trauma of failing the exam.</i>

727
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,050
Even if you don't pass this time, it might take a year or two,

728
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:39,140
but do you still want to major in Science-3?

729
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,370
What's most important to you?

730
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:45,210
I can't wait two or three years.

731
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:49,470
Any major is fine, so I want to pass quickly

732
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:55,220
because I have something to tell you, Harumi.

733
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:04,210
In that case,

734
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:08,180
you should choose Science-1, because

735
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,240
it accepts the highest number of students.

736
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:14,030
At all costs, I will

737
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:18,750
let you get into the University of Tokyo straight out of high school.

738
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:23,150
I understand.

739
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:29,100
Then stop with your stupid farce.

740
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:35,740
You tried to hook me up with Eto and acted like an old lady.

741
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,890
You don't have to remind me.

742
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,670
As much as it pisses me off, I'm fully aware

743
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,120
that you're older than I am.

744
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,510
Your age, you being my teacher, or your social status...

745
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,920
none of those matter to me.

746
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,280
It wouldn't be nice

747
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,290
if we've met under normal circumstances.

748
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,950
But for me,

749
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,110
I'm glad that I became your teacher.

750
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,230
Because I can help you get into the University of Tokyo.

751
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,070
Now, let's go home.

752
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,500
What happened to your face?

753
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:54,940
You've ignored my calls and texts, so I waited for you.

754
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,230
Do you have time for me now?

755
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,390
- No.
- Give me an hour.

756
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:03,080
I refuse.

757
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,620
Then what about tomorrow?

758
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,050
I can't comply with your request.

759
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:10,430
Hey, hear me out. Are you running away again?

760
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,550
What do you want to talk about?

761
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:30,830
Well...

762
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,430
I just wanted to continue where we left off the other day.

763
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,970
Continue?

764
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:39,760
You left me hanging after I touched your boobs.

765
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,170
I'm going home.

766
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:46,020
My bad. It was just a joke.

767
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,430
Do you think I'll let you off easy after touching me without my permission?

768
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:53,690
I stopped in the middle because I want your permission to proceed further.

769
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:58,940
It's meaningless doing it with you

770

771
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:03,760

00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,410
Today

773
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,040
I talked to Yuri about you.

774
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,510
He told me to back off.

775
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,070
That's when I realized,

776
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:21,500
it's pathetic trying to act mature and beating around the bush.

777
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:25,260
That's why

778
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:29,940
I came here to tell you in person.

779
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:34,590
It's not because I liked you in the past.

780
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:40,410
Now, I can't get you out of my head.

781

- I'm Junko Harumi, a teacher from Sanno Seminar.
- Okay.

817
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:03,220
Yuri first came to our cram school one year ago.

818
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,960
It was the fall of his second year in high school.

819
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,020
At that time, his academic skill wasn't even at the level of middle school students.

820
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,780
He aimed for the University of Tokyo from there.

821
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:17,240
<i>At first, I was against it.</i>

822
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,610
<i>I was so sure that he wouldn't make it.</i>

823
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:23,670
<i>But he had no doubt from the start</i>

824

<i>that he would make it.</i>

However could you please admit him to your cram school?
