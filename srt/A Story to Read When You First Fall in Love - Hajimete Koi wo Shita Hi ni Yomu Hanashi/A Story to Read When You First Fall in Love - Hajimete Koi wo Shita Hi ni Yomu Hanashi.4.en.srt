00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,260
I'm home.

176
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,950
What was the sound?

177
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,390
My walking stick.

178
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,100
Back pain again? Go take a bath and keep yourself warm.

179
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,180
Thank you.

- I'm No. 8.

182
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,220
Really?

183
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,540
Yuri-yuri, here is an application form for the training camp.
<i>[Study Camp to Overcome Your Weakness]</i>

184
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,310
With your parents' consent...

185
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:26,460
With your parent's consent, can you have him stamp his seal here?

186
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,550
Got it. He wouldn't oppose it.

187
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,610
I'm so happy that I'll be able to teach you the entire time.

188
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,780
If possible, I wish to go alone with you.

189
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,890
That statement was inappropriate!

190
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:49,060
He'll definitely improve if he gets a private lesson for four days straight.

191
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,580
This will be the fastest way.

192
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,920
Does that mean you two will sleep in the same room?

193
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,670
I'm just kidding. He's only seventeen.

194
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,130
I would be arrested!

195
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,900
Oh, right! I made this for you, Yuri-yuri.

196
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,890
A booklet for the study camp?
<i>[A booklet for the study camp during the Golden Week]</i>

197
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,260
Where is mine?

198
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,510
You'll be fine without it, won't you, Eto Mika?

199
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,390
I even made a checklist so that you won't forget anything.

200
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:20,640
- Don't forget to bring your dictionary. Here.
- Somehow...

201
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,770
you sound like a mom.

202
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,600
Not a mom. I'm more like a dad.

203
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,880
There are a lot of non-traditional families nowadays.

204
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
And everyone has maternal instinct.

205
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,280
Maternal instinct?

206
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,860
Did something happen with your mom?

207
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,580
Hey now. Oh, right! A pillow!

208
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,030
Do you need your own pillow for a good night's sleep?

209
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,330
Sleep deprivation is not good, Yuri-chan.

210
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,810
You can have it.

211
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,330
- What's wrong, Yuri-chan? Wait.
- I'm leaving.

212
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,790
Yuri-chan, what's wrong?

213
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,460
You're really insensitive to people's feelings.

214
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,880
Really? I'm trying my best, though.

215
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,960
On top of his studies,

216
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,850
I'm worried about him if he's eating or sleeping well.

217
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,060
What are you, his mom?

218
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,540
After missing the chance to marry,

219
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,380
my maternal instinct of a thirty-something-year-old woman is overflowing.

220
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,770
I'm really hopeless. I should go home and pet my dog.

221
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,620
Is it really maternal instinct?

222
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,180
It's not? Is it some kind of disease?

223
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,510
No. Well I don't know.

224
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:43,870
In any case, you're my first love, Harumi.

225
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,770
So I'd like to see you live a happy life.

226
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,370
By the way, since when did you become such a nice person?

227
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:58,080
Well... I just thought this world would be a better place,

228
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,780
if people like you are happy.

229
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,730

- For your information, I'm a sociology teacher.

232
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,460
- Are you now?
- Geez.

233
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,250
You're really dense, Junko.

234
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:19,210
I asked you out many times before confessing to you. But you never noticed my feelings.

235
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,300
I didn't?

236
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,620
I feel sorry for guys who fall for you.

237
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,040
I envy those who happily married in young age.

238
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,060
What's happiness, anyway?

239
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,580
You don't think about what happiness is

240

241
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,170

I'm attending the study camp for my school.

Of course, I'll be staying in a hotel for three nights.

00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,690
<i>you can't do anything until your 18th birthday!</i>

348
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,330
<i>If she violates the law, she will die of shock. So resist it no matter what.</i>

349
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,920
- Kyo, there you are.
<i>- Good luck to you!</i>

350
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,240
What are you doing out here?

351
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,570
Nothing really.

352
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,950
There aren't any people around. I love this place.

353
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,550
What are you doing?

354
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,770
I have something to tell you.

355
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,960
The two idiots are flirting.

356
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,350
We came to the camp to improve our scores.

357
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,460
We can't focus on our study with those guys around.

358
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,090
It's better to study at the cram school.

359
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,530
What's with his hair?

360
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,120
Oh yeah. I should call my father and have him complain to the school.

361
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,670
Good idea. Let's make a complaint.

362
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,690
You guys,

363
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:03,590
there may be people with blond hair or blue hair at the examination venue.

364
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:11,090
If you can only concentrate in the most comfortable environment, you'll be in trouble.

365
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,080
That's one of the reasons for holding this camp.

366
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,770
Our intellect is totally different from that idiot.

367
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,230
I'm sorry to inform you, but the test result shows it all.

368
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:27,360
That's the most unfortunate things to hear from our students.

369
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,660
Because I know you are sacrificing your free time for your study.

370
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:41,100
You try so hard, and the result of your hard work

371
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,780
is to look down on others? That's pathetic.

372
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,110
We are teaching you so you can have a bright future.

373
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,200
Excuse us.

374
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,380
You're as cool as ever.

375
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,160
Who... Masashi?

376
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,000
Why are you here?

377
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,460
Our company's resort is nearby,

378
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:14,130
so I rode a bus to get here. Then... what a coincidence!

379
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,220
I'm all alone.

380
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,900
Why don't you come over for a drink after work? There is an open air bath with a great view.

381
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,190
You were relegated?

382
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,690
Relegated? I'm not.

383
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,490
Training... Yeah, training.

384
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,250
I came to the leadership training held by our company.

385
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,500
It was decided at the last minute.

386
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,740
I see.

387
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,170
Right.

388
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,950
I brought souvenirs for everyone.

389
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,290
Oh, thank you.

390
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:46,220
It's important to show courtesy at a workplace in Japan.

391
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,760
If you look at the world...

392
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,340
- Harumi-sensei!
- A souvenir...

393
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,750
We have to practice!

394
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,510
Sorry, I'll be right there!

395
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,270
Thanks. See you!

396
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,130
Three days left.

397
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,520
Hi, there.

398
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,560
Thanks for your help the other day.

399
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,840
I just found out that my company's resort is nearby

400
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,710
and I have a training there.

401
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,560
If you would like, come hang out with us.

402
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,040
See you.

403
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,820
Wait.

404
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,800
Masashi!

405
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,170
Yes?

406
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:55,320
- You forgot this.
- Thanks.

407
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,150
It's quite cold outside.

408
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,770
It is. You must be cold.

409
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:02,950
I forgot to bring a jacket because I left in a hurry this morning.

410
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,350
What?

411
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,520
Then...

412
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,570
I'll lend you this. I have another one back at the hotel.

413
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,930
Thanks.

414
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,450
Then I'll give you this in return.

415
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,750
What's this?

416
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,950
It's a reward for the students. Good-luck candy.

417
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,670
Thanks.

418
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:28,180
Is the open-air bath open till late hour?

419
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,670
Yeah. It's open 24 hours. Come anytime.

420
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,240
Great!

421
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,600
Yuri-yuri, where are you going?

422
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,680
For a walk.

423
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,740
You can't! Your lesson will start soon! You can't be late.

424
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,550
I know.

425
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,780
If you know, don't go. We're at a study camp.

426
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,510
Don't tell me what to do. You're annoying.

427
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,550
What's wrong with him? I wonder if something happened.

428
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,780
Human brains can't process negative statements.

429
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,690
<i>[Test Rank: First Place]</i>

430
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,750
<i>[Test Rank: Second Place]</i>

431
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,590
That's the right answer. Excellent.

432
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:28,190
The theorem is the basic of the trigonometric function. You have to memorize it.

433
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,880
Harumi, can you help me for a second?

434
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,270
What does this emphasis mean?

435
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,480
Let's see. Oh, here?

436
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,860
The word "the picture" is not a verb, so when you...

437
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:48,380
That woman wants to send the pink hair to the University of Tokyo.

438
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,030
And that girl

439
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,260
joined the school to pursue the pink hair.

440
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,850
He's getting on my nerve. He's just a delinquent.

441
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,480
Right?

442
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,720
I think he's cool.

443
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,110
Unlike you guys.

444
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,210
We'll prepare some towels. Please bring towels.

445
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,620
We can go into the open-air bath...

446
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,850
We can't go in.

447
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,370
We can't!

448
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,450
Hello?

449
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,680
- Teacher, do you know where Kyo is?
- What?

450
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:49,320
I can't find him anywhere. He's not in the boys' room either.

451
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,990
No, I haven't seen him.

452
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,960
A boy with pink hair would stand out, so...

453
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,360
If you're looking for Yuri,

454
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,750
he was smoking in the lodge on the hill behind.

455
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,570
Is that true?

456
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,610
We saw him while we were taking a walk.

457
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,750
Having a hair like that,

458
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,960
we were afraid that he would punch us if we say something to him.

459
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,530
I bet you don't have that kind of friend around you.

460
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,380
I'll go check on him.

461
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,780
What, wait. Harumi-sensei!

462
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,510
<i>I don't believe he would do such a thing.</i>

463
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,770
<i>But today</i>

464
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,040
<i>I couldn't stop him</i>

465
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,480
<i>when he was shutting me out.</i>

466
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,150
<i>I didn't know.</i>

467
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,350
I'm sorry, Masashi.

468
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,750
<i>Actually, I don't really care if he smoked or not.</i>

469
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,860
<i>If he is suffering now,</i>

470
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,430
<i>I'm more worried about that.</i>

471
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,880
<i>What's that? A monkey? A wild boar?</i>

472
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,860
<i>No, it's something bigger.</i>

473
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,210
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

474
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,310
Is it a bear?

475
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,180
Yuri-yuri?

476
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,550
They said you headed to the lodge and never came back.

477
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,320
Is your back hurt? Should I carry you on my back?

478
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,630
- Ouch! It hurts.
- Are you all right?

479
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,590
Where were you headed to?

480
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,600
Take me to the lodge.

481
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,780
There's something I want to confirm.

482
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,920
Is your back okay?

483
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,790
I was a little tired from practice.

484
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,080
Practice?

485
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,650
- Let's go.
- Okay.

486
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,070
<i>[Minami-Boso Community Lodge]</i>

487
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,550
Is that it?

488
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,340
I think so.

489
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,840
How meticulous of them.

490
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,460
The boys bought it.

491
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,570
I'm sorry for leaving without a word.

492
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,720
I went over to Yakumo's room.

493
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,050
After he brought me back, I had a talk with the manager.

494
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,250
So I think they know I was falsely accused.

495
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,920
I had something I wanted to ask him.

496
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,410
Like what?

497
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,870
If you want Masashi to help with your studies,

498
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:54,220
you should have said that in the first place.

499
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:01,070
Well, Masashi is much more knowledgeable about science than I am,

500
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,000
so let's ask him to help from now on.

501
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,760
<i>- You like her, don't you?
- What?</i>

502
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,130
<i>About Harumi.</i>

503
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,760
<i>My feelings for Junko are pretty obvious.</i>

504
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,560
<i>But not to Junko.</i>

505
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,280
<i>We've been close cousins for twenty years.</i>

506
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,050
<i>We're in the friend zone.</i>

507
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,260
<i>Aren't you happy about that?</i>

508
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,490
<i>You're the same age,</i>

509
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,120
<i>and you've been by her side for almost twenty years.</i>

510
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,900
<i>And you can confess your feelings to her with no issue.</i>

511
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,780
<i>I envy you like crazy.</i>

512
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,730
I'm sorry about what I said in the afternoon.

513
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,060
I'm sorry too.

514
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,710
I guess I was too impatient.

515
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,020
I ended up being too demanding with you.

516
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,650
You have every right to be impatient,

517
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,000
since I ranked 47th.

518
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,200
That wasn't the reason.

519
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,880
Because you caught up to the level of college prep students so fast,

520
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,520
so I felt a little anxious.

521
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:25,290
After all, you didn't even understand middle school level material half a year ago.

522
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,710
Brains...

523
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:34,490
are not structured to process negative statements.

524
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,990
What?

525
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,210
For example,

526
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,900
please don't picture yourself

527
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,780
failing the college exam.

528
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,530
You just imagined it, didn't you?

529
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,800
Even if you try to erase it,

530
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,340
only the negative images remain in your head.

531
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,540
Rather than saying

532
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,720
"Don't be late",

533
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,610
I should've been positive and said

534
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,480
"Please come five minutes early."

535
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,820
You will definitely get into the University of Tokyo.

536
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,660
Pass the exam and live a happy life.

537
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,910
I trust you for making that happen.

538
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:27,570
Well, that was the quote I heard from Masashi, though.

539
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,950
<i>You can borrow this.</i>

540
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,960
<i>Thanks. You know, Masashi...</i>

541
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,260
He studied brain science at the University of Tokyo.

542
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,460
Put this on. It's dry.

543
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,190
No, I can't have my student catching a cold.

544
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,290
Take this off.

545
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,990
Teacher.

546
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,990
Please give me

547
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,340
a reward too.

548
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,750
Do you want the candy? Sure...

549
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,560
Sorry, I don't have any.

550
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,110
I'll give you some when we get back to the hotel.

551
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,420
Harumi.

552
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:41,120
Remember the date, February 3rd next year.

553
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,500
I'll turn eighteen on that day.

554
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,660
<i>Is this when I should comfort him?</i>

555
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:55,530
<i>Like this?</i>

556
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,640
Let's return to the hotel. Everyone must be worried about us.

557
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,910
I'll borrow this.

558
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,120
<i>Hey, I didn't sleep a wink.</i>

559
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:32,410
<i>What did exactly happen yesterday?</i>

560
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:35,930
<i>I treated him like any other mom would, but </i>

561
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:39,360
<i>his gaze was utterly different from a son looking at his mom.</i>

562
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,770
<i>He had the eyes of a male clinging to his girlfriend...</i>

563
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,390
<i>Wait... a girlfriend?</i>

564
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,800
No way.

565
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,810
I'm sure he wants someone to fill the role of his mother.

566
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:56,000
I don't seek maternal instinct from you.

567
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,000
Can I borrow your hair wax?

568
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,210
Sure.

569
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,290
Did you sleep well?

570
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:22,010
Yes, I did. I was even snoring.

571
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,470
<i>He's keen when he doesn't need to be.</i>

572
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:31,600
I don't know what you've heard, but I'm not pitiful.

573
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,940
I may have some difficulties with my studies,

574
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,030
I'm not unhappy.

575
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,810
Pain and unhappiness are two different things.

576
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,360
I think the Bentham guy is wrong.

577
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,310
What a weird atmosphere.

578
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,110
What?

579
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:52,200
Something is amiss ever since you came back together yesterday.

580
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,340
Nothing happened.

581
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:01,280
You two! Don't be late for the morning walk... I take that back.

582
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,860
Please come five minutes early.

583
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,730
I would expect an adult to hide things better.

584
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,950
So what happened last night?

585
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,170
Nothing really. I just made a reservation.

586
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,750
Reservation for what?

587
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,020
Why are you here?

588
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,690
I'm here to make fun of you.

589
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,120
Actually, I would like to ask you the exact same question.

590
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,560
Why did you come here? Where is your cousin?

591
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,110
Hello, Cousin!

592
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:42,440
Why are you drinking so early in the morning?

593
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,050
Because it was raining!

594
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,120
So nosy. I'll invite her over.

595
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,170
- I'll ask her out once I finish drinking this.
- I've been thinking for a while now...

596
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,100
You've waited for almost twenty years

597
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,280
to confess your love.

598
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,710
What the heck have you been doing?

599
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,900
I've tried to tell her my feelings many times!

600
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,490
Just the other day, I told her I love her.

601
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,690
But...

602
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:12,870
she wasn't allowed to date in high school.

603
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:16,030
When she went to the university, she pulled down the iron shutter.

604
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,430
Oh, the shutter.

605
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,740
- But, if it were me-
- By the way...

606
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,250
Who's that woman?

607
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,840
How are you? <i>(in Chinese)</i>

608
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,870
I hit on her on the train and she ended up coming along.

609
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,050
I have no idea what she's saying.

610
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,430
You're really something.

611
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,010
Thank you very much.

612
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,150
Silence, please.

613
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:45,590
Maybe I was thinking too highly of myself.

614
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:55,790
Jun has never looked at other men.

615
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,020
But the pink guy is different.

616
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,130
Ever since Jun met him, she has changed a little

617
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,250
only for a bit, like "nano" level.

618
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,230
<i>She seems happier.</i>

619
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,390
I noticed this yesterday, too.

620
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,040
But were you always this short?

621
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,500
It's because I'm not wearing heels.

622
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,560
I see. You're cute.

623
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,810
What did you say just now?

624
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,650
Watch out for the cars.

625
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,880
<i>What the heck is going on here?</i>

626
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,350
Do you understand the basics of mathematical induction now?

627
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,720
Kind of.

628
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,800
Let me see.

629
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,160
You are dressed too light again.

630
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,240
<i>This is just like...</i>

631
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,110
You have something on your face.

632
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:06,140
<i>Is he the hero of otome games? What kind of "mode" is he in?</i>

633
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,800
<i>[Masashi: Do you want to go out for lunch?  There's a great restaurant nearby.]
[Junko: Sorry, I'm busy with class.]</i>

634
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,970
<i>[Masashi: Are you still working? How about we go out for a drink?]
[Junko: Sorry, I can't.]</i>

635
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,210
<i>[Masashi: I see... then maybe tomorrow.]
[Masashi: Would you like to join me in the open air bath?]</i>

636
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,670
<i>[Today we are having the bonfire, so...]</i>

637
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,740
You two haven't touched your lunch.

638
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,230
I don't have an appetite.

639
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,500
Same here.

640
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,020
Ta-da! It's too early to go to the beach,

641
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:49,090
but there's a pool. What do you think?

642
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,510
What do you think?

643
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,190
You look cold.

644
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,000
Warm me up.

645
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,720
Hey, I'm a high school girl. I'm young and pretty.

646
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,400
Is something wrong with you?

647
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,840
You're going to catch a cold.

648
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,490
Let's get you dressed. Women always should keep their bellies warm.

649
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,850
Am I weird?

650
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:20,050
As a boy, you're not so full of vitality.

651
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,260
I'm healthy.

652
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,580
If it was you, I would make a move on you in a heartbeat.

653
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,150
<i>Why is he acting like this?</i>

654
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,910
Alright. We are going to study again after lunch.

655
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,090
We'll study as much as possible before the placement test.

656
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,760
<i>[2nd Test to Overcome Your Weakness | 90 minutes 14:00~15:30]</i>

657
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,720
The 2nd test to overcome your weakness,

658
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,500
begin!

659
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,710
We've been studying the whole time

660
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,870
but it was fun being with you.

661
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:00,990
The result of the 2nd test to overcome your weakness

662
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,960
- will be announced after the bonfire.
- Let's go together.

663
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,440
Until then, let's have fun for the time being.

664
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:19,120
First of all, the entertainment show by the teachers.

665
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,000
What's that?

666
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:34,660
Hello. I'm a female teacher who dreams of the effective work style

667
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,680
and fulfilled personal life.

668
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,470
How well did you do on your test today?

669
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:43,280
If you think that was the last test, you're too naive!

670
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,510
We still have follow-up tests.

671
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:50,220
What? Chosokabe and Washizu.

672
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:54,420
Did you run of test time because your names have too many strokes?

673
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,850
Do you think it would have been easier if your name was Osamu Hayashi?

674
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:59,190
What a nag.

675
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:10,860
How many strokes does the charismatic teacher, Teshigawara have in his name?

676
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,930
35 strokes.

677
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:29,380
Humanity-1 at the University of Tokyo.

678
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,080
The manager was major in Science-1.

679
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,490
I didn't expect that from the manager.

680
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:49,220
Oh, this is what she meant by practice.

681
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:57,170
♪ <i>We are preparing for the exam all our lives</i> ♪

682
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:02,670
♪ <i>Come to Sanno at least once</i> ♪

683
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:03,860
Thank you for your hard work.

684
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:08,230
It's too bad that I lost my balance at the very last.

685
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:10,170
The students seemed to love it, so it was all good.

686
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,780
It was more like they were laughing at us.

687
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,120
Well, well, let's enjoy the barbecue.

688
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,430
I will have some.

689
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:19,890
I feel tired...

690
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,840
- Harumi-sensei.
- Yes?

691
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,760
- It's about Yuri.
- Yes.

692
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,130
They lied about him smoking, however

693
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:31,080
if he shows problematic behaviors, the university exam will be out of the picture.

694
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:35,700
Be aware that you have the responsibility to observe him as his teacher.

695
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,250
I'll keep that in mind.

696
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,160
Harumi-sensei!

697
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,070
Did you remove your makeup? I wanted to take a picture with you.

698
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,280
Right.

699
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,860
It's okay. Come with me.

700
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,020
You were so cool, Harumi-sensei.

701
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,660
- Really?
- Let's take pictures together!

702
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,830
You were great at it.

703
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:59,140
Hold on. Let's take a picture.

704
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,180
- Okay.
- Cheese.

705
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:07,460
Just the two of us. Cheese!

706
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:33,170
♫ <i>The day has passed before I knew it</i> ♫

707
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,900
♫ <i>Why do we age anyway?</i> ♫

708

709

710

713
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,830
Don't get carried away because you are in a different environment.

714
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,410
It's Jun who will get in trouble.

715
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:15,840
It's hard when I'm with the woman I love the whole time.

716
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:22,240
I happen to know a superman who has endured that for twenty years.

717
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,360
Is something

718
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,660
wrong with him?

719
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,070
<i>If you were an adult...</i>

720
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:36,010
<i>I would tell you to push her down on a bed.</i>

721
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:39,860
<i>You may be able to turn on her romantic mode, Yurihei.</i>

722
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,350
<i>I'm looking forward to it.</i>

723
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,290
- Miwa!
- Hey.

724
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,860
What? Is that you, Jun?

725
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,920
Now I know why Yuri-zo was acting weird.

726
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,140
How do you call this? A prank confession?

727
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,500
I don't know if you're playing a penalty game or what,

728
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,240
but we're busy so cut it out.

729
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,790
Here.

730
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:09,630
Hey, Harumi.

731
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,690
I'm glad you were just joking.

732
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:25,690
♫ <i>But I can't find a good excuse to hold you</i> ♫

733
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:31,830
♫ <i>Oh yeah, that’s right</i> ♫

734
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:36,830
I'm starting to feel under the weather.

735
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,700
Do I have a cold?

736
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:45,800
♫ <i>Happy Birthday! My unrequited love</i> ♫

737
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,320
<i>Harumi.</i>

738
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,080
Harumi?

739
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,440
What?

740
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:04,440
Please don't yell. I was calling your name several times but you wouldn't wake up.

741
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:08,490
I'm sorry.

742
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:12,080
It wasn't a joke.

743
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,780
But if I hurt your feelings,

744
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:18,360
I'm sorry.

745
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,180
Not at all.

746
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:29,340
I'm not hurt.

747
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,940
But you said earlier...

748
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,810
It's the opposite.

749
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,730
I'm relieved.

750
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,040
Hearing your video call with Miwa,

751
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,350
I immediately felt relieved.

752
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:55,290
If I have a romantic relationship with my student,

753
00:49:55,930 --> 00:50:00,670
I'll have to give up being your teacher.

754
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,320
I would be devastated

755
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:09,630
if I won't be able to teach you.

756
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:23,710
I absolutely want to be by your side when you pass the exam.

757
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,920
About the results of the test...

758
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,570
What were you two doing in the room together?

759
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,280
I had some questions regarding my studies.

760
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,470
That's obviously a lie. I'll get you fired.

761
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:55,020
Even if you knock down others, it won't help you pass.

762
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:59,500
I despise jerks like you.

763
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:03,500
When delinquents take the exam with little effort, people overly praise them.

764
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,800
I've been working hard ever since I was in kindergarten.

765
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,120
Why are guys who start halfway considered admirable?

766
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:17,450
They both are impressive.

767
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:23,440
You've started at different times and struggled differently.

768
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,570
There is no point in competing for that.

769
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:32,350
People who strive in their studies, in their sports,

770
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:37,530
those who can't find their passion,

771
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:40,670
those who shoulder their parents' expectations,

772
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:43,610
and those who have endured loneliness.

773
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,430
Students with various backgrounds take the same exam fair and square.

774
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:57,850
Their academic ability alone will determine whether they pass or fail.

775
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:03,770
There is no excuse for that.

776
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,270
Even if there are 35 strokes...

777
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:16,270
You both look pale.

778
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,780
I'm sorry for calling you out at this hour. She's over there.

779
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,430
Jun.

780
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:38,510
What?

781
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,630
What's gotten into you?

782
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,940
- What?
- Oh.

783
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,010
The influenza.

784
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:53,600
I'm terribly sorry. We absolutely cannot let the flu spread amongst our students.

785
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,210
Since you, a relative of Harumi's, are here...

786
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:57,470
I don't mind that, but...

787
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:58,980
Why are they staying in the same room together?

788
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,060
Oh, that...

789
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:06,180
We are in a busy season, so there is no room available. But, it's a large room.

790
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,970
Then, I'll stay with them, too.

791
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,590
I wonder why.

792

793
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:19,450
Oh yes, about the test results...

794
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:23,300
You went up 8 ranks and you were 39th.

795
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,830
Hooray! Really?

796
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,950
This is just the beginning.

797
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:34,970
I won't let you be a delinquent boy

798
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:38,620
who just tried to study a little.

799
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,140
I'll help you pass.

800
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:47,060
There's one year left.

801
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:50,610
I'll put my life on the line for you.

802
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:57,540
Damn it! If I can't get married because of this...

803
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:03,340
Even if I can't, please pass the exam!

804
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,590
Over my dead body,

805
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:12,690
you will obtain happiness.

806
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,440
Actually, right now...

807
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,540
