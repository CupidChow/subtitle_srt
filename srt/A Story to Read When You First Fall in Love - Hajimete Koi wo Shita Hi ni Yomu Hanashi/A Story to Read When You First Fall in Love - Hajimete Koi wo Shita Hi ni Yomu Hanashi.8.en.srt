- My bad.

175
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,810
I don't know many places women likes,

176
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,090
so I researched online, but...

177
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,870
Damn, what am I doing?

178
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,080
Riding a motorcycle, drinking canned coffee outside

179
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,680
is like skipping school with a delinquent, and I was exhilarated!

180
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,840
- Harumi...
- Back then,

181
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,270
if I got my nose out of those reference books,

182
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,140
and found you,

183
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,390
then my horizons would have expanded greatly.

184
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,950
It's delicious!

185
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,280
Can I kiss you?

186
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,380
- Hey!
- Okay.

187
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,420
What should we do now? Give me a second,

188
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,640
- I'll think about it.
<i>- If I... </i>

189
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,530
<i>fall in love with this person now, I'm sure my life would be bliss.</i>

190
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,820
<i>If I do that,</i>

191
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,960
<i>what would that kid...?</i>

192
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,020
What's on your mind?

193
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,460
Pardon?

194
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,080
It's Masashi!

195
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,730
I was wondering what Masashi and Makise are up to.

196
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,960
Why a farm?

197
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,700
Was it not to your liking? I thought it'd be nice and healing.

198
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,230
It's fine!

199
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,030
It's just that women have lots of prep to do in advance.

200
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,240
Look, the baby cow moved!

201
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,440
It's running, it's running!

202
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,540
This is sort of relaxing.

203
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,660
I'm glad you like it.

204
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,310
- Thank you.
- You've got a bite!

205
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,330
Raise your rod! Raise it!

206
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,630
I did it!

207
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,730
- I fished something!
- Amazing! Let's eat.

208
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,860
Let's dig in.

209
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,960
- Delicious!
- Tasty!

210
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,640
Want a bite? It's a little spicy, though.

211
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,080
Sure, let me have a bite.

212
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,610
- This one's good.
- So is yours!

213
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,840
I like yours better.

214
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,920
I guess anything would taste good

215
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,090
because our lunch was so late.

216
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,230
<i>You may begin your exam.</i>

217
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,870
Is Yuri taking his English test about now?

218
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,030
What are you doing?

219
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,500
I just got a little jealous.

220
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,330
Since I have back pain, holding this pose is a bit...

221
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,630
I'll escort you back by the time of his exam is over.

222
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,560
Don't worry.

223
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,830
Thanks for today. I had fun.

224
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,580
Did you come to like me, even a bit?

225
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,190
I want to fall in love with you.

226
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,040
That's...

227
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,930
what I've been thinking.

228
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,380
Please do so, as soon as you can.

229
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,550
- Alright.
- See you.

230
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,510
So she "wants to like me"...

231
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,470
<i>[Sanno Seminar]</i>

232
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,790
<i>[Yuka]</i>

233
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,310
<i>[We are currently getting ready for business]</i>

234
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,280
Makise, what do you think?

235
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,610
With his score, it's probably Grade E.

236
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,440
or D, at the most.

237
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,610
You're probably right.

238
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,710
However, it’s not rare to get Grade E around this time

239
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,930
for high schoolers who are aiming for the University of Tokyo.

240
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,410
Many of my students scored Grade E, but they still made it into the University of Tokyo.

241
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,400
That's right. We expected this outcome.

242
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,270
If you would get a passing score,

243
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,570
It wouldn't be by much. It'll be come-from-behind victory.

244
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,530
Come-from-behind victory?

245
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,150
What are my chances?

246
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,820
Less than fifty percent.

247
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,400
There's only one way left to go, and that's up.

248
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,260
You can do it.

249
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,320
When I asked your father

250
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,820
about you attending Hanaekai,

251
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,480
he said, "I'll do anything if it benefits my son."

252
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,480
He agreed without any hesitation.

253
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,020
He understands you're putting a lot of effort into this.

254
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,780
The other day,

255
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,470
he encouraged me for the first time.

256
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,970
Did he?

257
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,710
Have you ever been taught by your father?

258
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,350
Well... occasionally.

259
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,260
But his explanations are hard to understand.

260
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,450
But those lessons only lasted

261
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,170
until my mother died.

262
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,850
She got sick when I was in 8th grade...

263
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,210
There wasn't anything we could do about it, but

264
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,860
he prioritized his work over nursing my mom.

265
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,860
He wasn't even there when she passed away.

266
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,880
<i>I called him so many times.</i>

267
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,990
<i>I was alone in her hospital room.</i>

268
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,950
The flowers in her room

269
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,480
seemed oddly beautiful.

270
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,250
<i>He must have thought of that moment every day.</i>

271
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,610
He's an awful dad,

272
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,010
but without his help,

273
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,570
I wouldn't be able to go to cram school or even college.

274
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,170
I want to become an adult fast.

275
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,820
After you pass the exam,

276
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,940
let's confront your dad together.

277
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,190
While you're a kid

278
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,350
let's tell him everything flat out

279
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,390
you couldn't till now.

280
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,640
You can't do that,

281
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,940
since you're his son.

282
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,950
Harumi...

283
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,340
Come on, let's go back.

284
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,950
What were you doing with Yamashita?

285
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,550
- What?
- Where did you guys go on his motorcycle?

286
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,210
Did you see that?

287
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,290
I thought you were showing off.

288
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,530
He dropped you off right at the cram school.

289
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:53,530
Well, that's...

290
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:58,040
<i>Wait, why am I acting like his girlfriend who got caught on cheating?</i>

291
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,940
It was a date. We went on a date.

292
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,700
There isn't anything I can do for you on the exam day.

293
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,650
I do go on dates, you know. I'm in my 30's.

294
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,930
Bye.

295
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,600
Hey, Kyohei.

296
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,340
Are you drunk?

297
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,680
What's wrong with that?

298
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,350
You don't have to go to the University of Tokyo.

299
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,190
It's pointless to go, totally.

300
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,720
Just go easy on your study.

301
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,030
Average is the best way to go.

302
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,650
The nail that sticks out gets hammered down.

303
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,490
Why would you say that?

304
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,840
It's too late for that crap!

305
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,360
- Yanagihara?
- Here.

306
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,990
Yuri?

307
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,210
Did he tell you guys anything?

308
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,700
He hasn't replied to my texts.

309
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,920
- He must be studying at home.
- Right.

310
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,920
He can probably focus better there than here!

311
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,110
Right?

312
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,480
Here you go.

313
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,370
It's easy to catch a cold or get distracted here.

314
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,550
Not the best place to study.

315
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,750
It's better to study at home or the cram school.

316
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:53,060
Today I don't want to go home or to the cram school.

317
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,620
Did something happen with Jun?

318
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,990
Excuse me. It's a last call.

319
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,390
We'll be leaving.

320
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,140
Want to come to my place?

321
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,540
Here.

322
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,710
Sorry. Thanks for this.

323
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,160
You're welcome.

324
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,400
I'll be working in the other room. Let me know if you need anything.

325
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,710
I will.

326
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,670
<i>[Good Job on the Law of Sine]</i>

327
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,310
<i>[You did great! Everything before this is perfect!]</i>

328
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,680
<i>[You have the basics down. Have confidence!]</i>

329
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,480
<i>[Careful! This could also be 270. Clarify the range of the unknown angle!]</i>

330
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:21,970
<i>You've loved Harumi for so long.</i>

331
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,090
<i>Has that ever turned into hate?</i>

332
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,350
It must be nice for you.

333
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,220
You can love and hate Junko as you please.

334
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,170
Probably I'll...

335
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,510
always be her dependable cousin for the rest of my life.

336
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:50,200
As long as I'm her cousin, there's no love or hatred.

337
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,640
She'll...

338
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,920
never see me as a man.

339
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,990
What? He missed school?

340
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,440
Yeah. I was wondering if he was studying at cram school.

341
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,620
No, he didn't have any classes with me today.

342
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,600
He wasn't at the self-study room, either.

343
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,280
How did he do on the mock exam?

344
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,620
Probably it was Grade E.

345
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,180
<i>So maybe he's feeling down.</i>

346
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,120
<i>Or maybe he's taking a break?</i>

347
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,270
Yeah.

348
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,240
I hope he's okay.

349
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,510
- You should take a break, too.
- What?

350
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,650
How about a meal?

351
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,040
Sure.

352
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,010
Let me know what day works for you.

353
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,470
- I'll see you then.
<i>- Okay.</i>

354
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,140
Have a good night.

355
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,250
<i>Good night.</i>

356
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,600
Paw. Paw. Paw!

357
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,090
Masashi?

358
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,130
Why... How'd you get in here?

359
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,560
How?

360
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,350
I said "hi" to your parents and walked up the stairs.

361
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,020
R-Right. That's how people normally come in.

362
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,740
Not by climbing a fence.

363
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,110
Were you talking to Yamashita?

364
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,710
Yeah.

365
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,280
I see.

366
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,950
How did things go with Makise?

367
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,650
I just took Yuri back home.

368
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,340
What?

369
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,750
He was studying in a café.

370
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,820
I brought him to my place and he fell asleep while he was studying.

371
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,880
Why was he at a café?

372
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,330
He seems like he didn't want to talk about it, so I didn't ask.

373
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,140
Did something happen?

374
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,730
<i>What were you doing with Yamashita?</i>

375
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,710
He's probably asleep, right?

376
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,830
It's a crucial time for him to stay in a good headspace. Pay close attention.

377
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,530
But I'm sure you know better than anyone.

378
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,450
Yeah.

379
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,130
But I'm not sure how to act.

380
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,200
I'm afraid he'll end up like me, if I pressure him too much.

381
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,460
I'm so confused.

382
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,090
Okay.

383
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,410
Harumi-sensei.

384
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,040
Yuri won't be coming in today.

385
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,410
What? Did he say that?

386
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,580
I bet he was disappointed at the result of his mock exam.

387
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,070
These things happen around this time.

388
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,600
But would he skip school because of that?

With that said,

00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:30,080
to put it simply, political events change the history of the world.

401
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,860
The world you live in today will also become a part of world history.

402

<i>Deputy Chief Secretary Yoshikawa has been admitted to the hospital for a check-up this afternoon.</i>

412
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,650
Unbelievable!

413
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,930
In the case that the media inquires the school about Yuri...

414
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,830
Wait, the news says he's been hospitalized.

415
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,450
Politicians always use that as an excuse.

416
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,020
Hospitalized?

00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,710
- That's right.
- He is.

422
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,190
Will he be all right?

423
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,480
I think his father going to the University of Tokyo

424
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,040
may have been his motivation.

425
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,070
Excuse me. I have to go now.

426
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,680
Mr. Yuri.

427
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,580
Generale Director Yuri.

428
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,350
You're in there, aren't you?

429
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,590
We know you're home.

430
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,080
General Director?

431
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,870
You don't need to ring the bell over and over!

432
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,620
Who might you be?

433
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,480
What is your relationship with the General Director Yuri?

434
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,400
- What is the purpose of your visit?
- Excuse me. Please stop!

435
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,600
Can I ask you a few questions?

436
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,740
Keep your hands off her.

437
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,590
You're causing a huge disturbance, so get out of the way.

438
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,650
Yuri.

439
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,020
- What's with that hair color?
- Pink hair?

440
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,360
Please stop. He's unrelated to this case.

441
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,490
He's a minor. Please stop.

442
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,220
Tell your father to come out now!

443
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,590
<i>I know he's in the house.</i>

444
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,990
Please, excuse our intrusion.

445
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,480
I'm sorry for causing you to worry.

446
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,620
I've been told to keep quiet and forced to take days off.

447
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,420
Not that I can take a break with those reporters outside.

448
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,490
It must be hard for you.

449
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,750
I didn't want to get swept up in all this.

450
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:32,180
But in the end, the bureaucrats will force me out of office.

451
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,990
When I thought you were working,

452
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,370
you were helping with their corruption.

453
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,880
I didn't help them. I even don't know anything about the bribe.

454
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,340
Then why are you staying silent? You should tell the truth.

455
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,780
You don't understand the world of politics.

456
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,290
Then, will you just wait to get demoted?

457
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,290
Will you be fired?

458
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,350
Or arrested?

459
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,750
Who knows?

460
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:13,760
You abandoned Mom for work, and this is what you get for it?

461
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,560
You're a fool.

462
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,870
<i>Yuri, I'm coming in.</i>

463
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,870
Yuri-yuri.

464
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,980
I...

465
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,000
won't be taking the exam.

466
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,360
I quit.

467
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,220
Why?

468
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,670
I doubt that I will pass.

469
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:30,140
Your father's problem and your exam are two different matters.

470
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,760
You have to keep it together.

471
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,630
Weren't you going to prove something to your dad?

472
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,180
That's not all.

473
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,050
We don't know for sure, if you have Grade E yet.

474
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:48,120
As I said before, it's very common for high schoolers to score low.

475
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,830
- You don't have to be so depressed.
- I said that's not all!

476
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:00,050
Everything is all jumbled up in my head now.

477
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,460
I can't think of anything.

478
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,730
- Yuri-yuri.
- Yuri.

479
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,510
You're teachers.

480
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,270
Harumi-sensei.

481
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,900
I'm sorry.

482
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,740
I can't do this anymore.

483
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,960
The reporters are outside.

484
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,360
So please don't visit me again.

485
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,850
You're a bother.

486
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,070

487
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,320
<i>Mom.</i>

488
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,740
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

489
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:19,740
<i>I'm at my limit.</i>

490
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,390
I'm sorry.

491
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,850
Dad, Kazuma is here.

492
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,350
You have some nerve coming here.

493
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,240
I'm sorry to visit you when you're having a rough time.

494
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,910
I should have visited you sooner.

495
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:23,780
I told him not to come.

496
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:36,270
Visiting at a time like this... What do you want?

497
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,910
Dad, please be nice.

498
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,750
He's not a man who visits to express his sympathy.

499
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,860
I came to ask you

500
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,870
to announce the truth about the university scandal.

501
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,550
What's it to you?

502
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:03,730
Shojiro Yuri's son is my student.

503
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:07,750
I see. Your student, huh?

504
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,260
That has nothing to do with me.

505
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,200
I know this is a lot to ask.

506
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,910
Ask?

507
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:29,990
Then I have something to ask of you. It's only fair, right?

508
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,560
If you...

509
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,640
are ready to do

510
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,650
the thing I want most.

511
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,060
Which is?

512
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:56,670
Yuka, I want to lay down. Lower my bed.

513
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,530
I'm home.

514
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,550
Welcome home.

515
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,120
Junko?

516
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:11,040
We saw on the news today about Yuri of the Ministry of Education...

517
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,780
I don't know much about it, myself.

518
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,480
Here.

519
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,560
Thank you.

520
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,810
Mom, back then...

521
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:41,180
when I collapsed before the university exam,

522
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,590
you were suffering, too, right?

523
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,600
Junko...

524
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:54,000
I thought I wouldn't turn into you, but...

525
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,160
Junko.

526
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,390
I'm sorry.

527
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,510
- Yanagihara?
- Here.

528
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,460
Yuri?

529
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,980
Did you hear? Yuri's dad is in big trouble.

530
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,470
That's why he's not coming to school. Does he still want to...

531
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,700
- enter the University of Tokyo?
- No way, that's impossible!

532
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,220
I bet his dad bribed the school.

533
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,230
<i>Totally!</i>

534
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,290
Cut that crap!

535
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,750
Why? He's not going to make it anyway.

536
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,600
He will make it.

537
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,610
Hold on!

538
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,100
Cut it out!

539
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,140
Sit down.

540
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,670
Then why don't you try this problem?

541
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,240
Okay.

542
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:05,690
Kyo wouldn't give up on the exam, right?

543
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:09,330
I heard from Kabu that he hasn't been to school, either.

544
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,970
You shouldn't worry yourself with other people.

545
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:18,410
You franked modern Japaneses history in your mock exam, especially from the Meiji era.

546
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:22,590
But I like the guys with the samurai hairstyle.

547
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,600
So he wants to quit?

548
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,890
I pushed him too hard.

549
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:44,090
He burned out, just like I did.

550
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,980
That's not true.

551
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,800
He used rebelling against his father as motivation to work hard.

552
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,340
Maybe he lost his willpower.

553
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:59,270
Jun, no one works that hard to rebel against their parents.

554
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:02,440
What do you think I should do?

555
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,610
How's your dad?

556
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,500
The same as before.

557
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:20,850
To be honest, he's in pretty bad shape.

558
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,260
What?

559
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:28,680
Public thinks he's faking his illness, and he says that's actually a good thing.

560
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:33,100
His biggest fear is it affecting the next election.

561
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,220
When I thought about it,

562
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:42,790
this was the first time you've ever asked him for anything.

563
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,740
I was surprised.

564
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,560
Kazuma?

565
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,170
Sorry.

566
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,540
I always...

567
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:01,630
threatened you with divorce papers, whenever we have an issue.

568
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,210
I'm sorry for that.

569
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,860
It's okay.

570
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,450
We don't need to talk about that.

571
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:13,200
I guess I was testing you.

572
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,860
To see how far you'd forgive me.

573
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:26,560
Do you remember? When I asked you to marry me,

574
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:33,670
you said you wanted to fall in love with me.

575
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,720
I was happy, but

576
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,330
I never

577
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,580
had any confidence.

578
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,650
Yuka...

579
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,410
Did you fall in love with me?

580
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,340
While we were married? Even a little?

581
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,740
Of course I did.

582
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,430
Really?

583
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:12,490
So you did...

584
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,610
Thank you! Come again!

585
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:26,670
Okay. Two orders of eggplant with miso paste.

586
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:31,660
<i>General Director Shojiro Yuri of the Ministry of Education appeared as a witness for the opposition party.</i>

587
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:36,210
<i>- Deputy Chief Secretary Tsunehiko Yoshikawa was...
- General Director Shojiro Yuri of the Ministery of Education said,</i>

588
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,400
<i>he received the instructions, however...</i>

589
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,580
<i>Today, I don't want to go home or to cram school...</i>

590
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:48,840
<i>The opposition party is verifying if any money was exchanged.</i>

591
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,340
I think the oysters made me sick.

592
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,730
I can't go to the conference this afternoon like this.

593
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:03,660
Sorry, Nishioi. Could you take it over for me?

594
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,770
What?

595
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,280
- Wait, that was way too quick.
- Thank you.

596
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,050
- That was quick.
- Ouch.

597
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:15,280
He's horrible at lying.

598
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:22,410
<i>[Restaurant for Locals]</i>

599
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,640
Saki?

600
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,950
My choreography lesson just ended.

601
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,380
Cutting class at a place like this?

602
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,260
<i>[University of Tokyo Exam: Math]</i>

603
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,600
Come with me for a bit.

604
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,110
What?

605
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,570
I haven't been in here for a while!

606
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,100
This way.

607
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:03,480
There's a cafe around the corner there.

608
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,720
Napolitan there is amazeball.
<i>(T/N: spaghetti with ketchup)</i>

609
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,010
- Really good.
- I told you.

610
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,820
Why did you bring me here?

611
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:26,380
Why were you studying at the café?

612
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:32,490
Didn't you give up on the university exam?

613
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,780
Well...

614
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:38,940
You still want to study, right?

615
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:45,430
Rebelling against your father and studying for Junko's sake...

616
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:48,460
I know you're going through a lot,

617
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:54,120
but do you want to study for your sake now?

618
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,650
And you started to visualize

619
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:03,330
after you pass the exam and start attending university.

620
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,990
You want it badly.

621
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:10,930
So you must be scared and uneasy now.

622
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,440
Not only that,

623
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:20,560
if I fail to pass,

624
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,790
Harumi will probably be hurt more than me.

625
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,750
She'll blame herself.

626
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,580
- If that's the case...
- Don't run away.

627
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,820
You're just feeling the pressure.

628
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,570
Why are you helping me so much?

629
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:47,690
I'm just an eyesore to you, right?

630
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:53,900
Ultimately there are two factors that cause people to take action.

631
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:58,650
For your own happiness, or for the happiness of the person you love.

632
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:05,730
I don't want to sadden the person I love.

633
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,910
Your happiness is for the sake of your loved one,

634
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:15,090
that's not pressure, it's good fortune.

635
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:21,010
Accept the pressure like a real man.

636
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,790
This counts as fair, right?

637
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:31,620
You are really

638
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,600
a man of principle.

639
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,730
Good morning.

640
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,260
Which hand is it? The other hand?

641
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,070
Kyohei.

642
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,190
Hey! We were worried about you.

643
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:04,570
Have you been well?

644
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:07,830
Everyone, be seated.

645
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,620
- It's time for roll call.
- Where's Yama-pyon?

646
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,850
<i>Regarding the Tohto University corruption case...</i>

647
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:20,060
<i>my memory was a little hazy and I may have forgotten,</i>

648
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:25,320
<i>but I have looked into records and it shows that I've met with Mr. Morita</i>

649
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,590
<i>from Tohto University several times.</i>

650
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:34,350
<i>During the meeting, my secretary has accepted</i>

651
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:38,220
<i>ten million yen from Mr. Morita.</i>

652
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,450
<i>However I've returned the money thereafter.</i>

653
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,460
This means...

654
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,420
He has admitted his transgressions.

655
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:51,960
Yuri's father may also face punishment, but

656
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,850
he's avoided the worst-case outcome.

657
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,830
You're right.

658
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:59,940
Please accept my sincere apologize.

659
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,120
Hello?

660
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,160
Yuri-yuri, where are you now?

661
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:10,000
I'm at school.

662
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,030
Oh, good.

663
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,820
I saw the news just now.

664
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,650
I got a call from my old man.

665
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,580
I see.

666
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:27,130
- I'm so glad.
- It seems Yamashita persuaded Diet Member Yoshikawa.

667
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,670
Yamashita did?

668
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:33,710
<i>Yamashita is taking the day off, so I don't know the specifics.</i>

669
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,550
What?

670
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:43,320
<i>Yamashita's ex-wife is the daughter of Diet Member Yoshikawa.</i>

671
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,680
<i>He'll quit teaching and remarry his ex-wife.</i>

672
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,170
<i>Then he'll take over Yoshikawa's electoral base and become a politician.</i>

673
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:55,640
<i>Yamashita asked Hoshikawa to reveal the truth and retire.</i>

674
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,660
Hello?

675
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:05,060
<i>Hello? Sorry for calling you so many times.</i>

676
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,040
Where are you now?

677
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,580
Yamashita.

678
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:18,050
If you run like that, you'll injure your back again.

679
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,360
Are you getting married?

680
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:27,970
Sorry. If you start liking me now, I'll be in a pinch.

681
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:32,360
Is it for Yuri?

682
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,190
A delinquent teacher becoming a politician,

683
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,390
gets many votes because it shows I'm a hard worker.

684
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:44,230
Even a corrupt politician has a soft spot for his daughter, I guess.

685
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:47,850
When I said I'll be a politician, he agreed to hold the press conference.

686
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:51,510
His illness was getting worse, so it was a good timing.

687
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,950
If I ever get into parliament...

688
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:59,000
I'll boss around the bureaucrats from the University of Tokyo.

689
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,780
Is this really what you want?

690
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:09,310
I became a teacher under your influence in the first place.

691
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:13,180
Anyway, after this I don't think

692
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,900
I can do anything more for my students.

693
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,570
Yamashita.

694
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,120
When you said you wanted to fall for me,

695
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,530
I was happy.

696
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:32,280
I've decided to give up when I heard that.

697
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,510
What?

698
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:39,390
Because I understand how you feel.

699
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,100
So I thought about what I can do.

700
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,930
I didn't want to have any regrets,

701
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:55,200
so I did everything I could.

702
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:03,810
Well, if I'll become an unforgettable man to you,

703
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:06,830
that's not bad.

704
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:14,110
I want you to be happy.

705
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:21,910
Because you're the first person I've ever loved, Junko.

00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,900
Yamashita.

709
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,750
I'll never forget you.

710
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:56,540
♫ <i>The day has passed before I knew it</i> ♫

711
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,100
♫ <i>Why do we age anyway?</i> ♫

712
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:03,700
It's already cold.

713
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,710
♫ <i>I jumped when my phone rang</i> ♫

714
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,200
But it's still delicious.

715
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:15,070
♫ <i>So disappointing. I thought it was you</i> ♫

716
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:23,250
♫ <i>Due to some kind of mistake, I wish you would fall for me</i> ♫

717
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,850
Yamashita-sensei!

718
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:36,540
♫ <i>I can come up with all kinds of stupid stories</i> ♫

719
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:42,740
♫ <i>But I can't find a good excuse to hold you</i> ♫

720
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,940
Thank you very much.

721
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:55,680
♫ <i>Happy Birthday! My unrequited love</i> ♫

722
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,700
I did this for my own sake.

723
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:05,460
So you... should get into the University of Tokyo for yourself.

724
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,420
Make Junko smile, no matter what.

725
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:13,470
I will.

726
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:19,900
I'll beat you up if you lose to those elite piece of trash.

727
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,750
- What?
- You know what I mean.

728
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:28,110
But I'll be here until March. I won't go easy on you.

729
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:30,730
Can you really become a politician?

730
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:34,350
Why can't I?

731
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:39,640
That's right. Masashi, thank you.

732
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:45,110
I didn't do much.

733
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:48,900
Yamashita is impressive.

734
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:53,200
I see. So he went that far.

735
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,180
- Hey, Junko.
- Yes?

736
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:00,070
Yakumo, a moment please.

737
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,990
Okay.

738
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:09,240
- Sorry, I'll call you back.
<i>- Okay.</i>

739
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:18,000
<i>Yuri-yuri... you shouldn't live your life </i>

740
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,920
<i>by only looking at beautiful sceneries.</i>

741
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:26,470
<i>But if you strive to live, you'll find allies</i>

742
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,760
<i>who are willing to stay by your side.</i>

743
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:33,140
To Russia? For three years?

744
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:37,110
- <i>[Next Episde]
- I love you.
- How can you refrain yourself from jumping on the person you love?</i>

745
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:39,500
<i>I'm holding myself back. Just a while longer...</i>

746
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,710
<i>With this, my time as your teacher has ended.</i>

747
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:46,340
<i>I love you.  I don't want to hand you over to anyone.</i>
