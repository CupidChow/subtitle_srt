<i>[Hanaekai, A Cram School Specialized in the University of Tokyo]</i>

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,790
What is the meaning of this?

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,530
Hanaekai is a cram school specialized in the University of Tokyo

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,910
that boasts an eighty percent passing rate.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,070
They only accept students from prestigious schools.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,420
But they made an exception for you and allowed your enrollment.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,040
That's nonsense. Harumi, you're my-

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,930
Only three subjects in the science course.

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,280
You'll study the rest with me.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,070
I'm not capable enough to teach you mathematics.

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,130
We only have a month till the last mock exam in November.

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,400
You have to improve your academic level significantly by then.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,160
Otherwise, you won't get into the University of Tokyo.

15
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,370
I told you, didn't I?

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll make sure you'll get in by all means.

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,090
Don't you wish to get in right after high school?

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,220
<i>I can't wait two or three years.</i>

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Because I have something to tell you after I pass the exam.</i>

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,650
I've already discussed this with your father.

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,490
The question is, will you be able to handle attending two cram schools.

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,730
Why don't we go to a trial enrollment first?

23
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:24,980
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
</i>💖True Love Team💖<i>@Viki.com</i>

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,650
Fine.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,870
<i>Wow, it seems so far.</i>

26
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,440
Yokohama is surely different from Tokyo.

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,360
In what way?

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,430
Girls in Yokohama are cuter.

29
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,810
I think you're right.

30
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,310
I came along because I was free.

31
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,110
I envy you, Kyo. Are you attending a cram school here?

32
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,590
- I haven't decided yet.
- Really?

33
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,190
It's the building over there.

34
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,640
<i>Harumi-sensei!</i>

35
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,380
What a cutie.

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,880
Momota-sensei.

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,020
A teacher?

38
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,390
Nice to meet you all. I'm Momota of Hanaekai.

39
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,520
Which one of you is Yuri?

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,880
I'm Yuri.

41
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,660
Is that you?

42
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,260
He has pink hair, but he's a hard worker and motivated.

43
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,420
I know. You mentioned that before.

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,310
You're good-looking.

45
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,490
Guys, don't you think she's a true beauty?

46
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,110
And elegant.

47
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,060
She is the perfect description of a capable woman.

48
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,990
Teacher, how old are you?

49
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,240
I'm twenty-seven.

50
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,800
Twenty-seven? You're so young.

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,050
I assumed all teachers in cram schools for the University of Tokyo were old geezers.

52
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,140
Or, old ladies like Junko-sensei.

53
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,300
Watch it.

54
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,770
I'll be going now.

55
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,920
Would you like to visit our school?

56
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,680
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

57
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
Wow.

58
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,690
It's huge.

59
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,840
If this is the cram school specialized in the University of Tokyo,

60
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,260
did you graduate from the University of Tokyo as well?

61
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,370
I graduated from UCL.

62
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,510
UC...

63
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,190
It's University College London.

64
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,690
Many Nobel Prize laureates graduated from UCL.

65
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,770
It's one of the best university in the world.

66
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,250
Is that better than the University of Tokyo?

67
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,390
How impressive.

68
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,130
Where are we going now?

69
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,270
<i>Good education, fine career,</i>

70
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,460
<i>youth, and money...</i>

71
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,840
<i>She has everything I'm lacking of.</i>

72
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,140
Momota-sensei, why have you decided to become a teacher?

73
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,850
Let's not talk about me.

74
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,330
This is the self-study room.

75
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,170
Very spacious.

76
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,420
We have some complimentary drinks.

77
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,260
- Can I have some?
- Seriously?

78
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,100
Some students use an app for studying,

79
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,180
so we're lending out these tablets.

80
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,300
There is a nap room right next to here.

81
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,700
This place is totally different from your school, Junko-sensei.

82
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,760
I only need a teacher and a desk for studying.

83
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,480
Who needs the over-the-top facility?

84
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,760
- Yuri.
- I like that.

85
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,050
I appreciate your straight-forwardness.

86
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,920
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,120
Once you study with us, you will appreciate what we offer here.

88
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,980
Why not take a lesson here, Yuri?

89
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,270
I'll leave him in your care.

90
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,960
I can take it from here. Follow me.

91
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,950
Good luck.

92
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,230
How nice.

93
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,750
If I could study under her, I would come to the cram school.

94
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,820
I know, right?

95
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,140
Zunko-sensei?

96
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,300
I feel like a mama bird sending off her chick leaving the nest.

97
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,470
A mama bird?

98
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,550
- Let's go home.
- Okay.

99
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,850
How envious.

100
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,510
- Let's go.
- So envious.

101
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,890
What's wrong with her? She's scaring me.

102
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,910
She looks burnt out and turned into ashes...

103
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,550
Like a boxer.
<i>(T/N: Referring to a character from Tomorrow's Joe.)</i>

104
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,130
Oh, she moved.

105
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,030
Harumi-sensei?

106
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,980
Harumi-sensei!

107
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,460
- Yes?
- Don't forget to breathe, okay?

108
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,410
I heard Yuri is taking some classes at Hanaekai.

109
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,940
- That's right.
- Hanaekai?

110
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,950
Yes. He's studying three subject in sciences and math

111
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,560
under the most popular teacher named Momota.

112
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,040
Oh, that's why...

113
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,150
Is there a problem?

114
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,720
No, not at all.

115
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,330
This is rather fortunate.

116
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,670
If he passes the college exam by chance,

117
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,040
we can take credit for it.

118
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,190
Besides, I'm very pleased

119
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,210
that you've become a fine teacher who can make a rational decision

120
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,030
by setting your emotions aside.

121
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,040
- Manager...
- However,

122
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,240
if Yuri is a fine student who can make a rational decision,

123
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,470
he may say he'll switch to the other school to learn his humanities subjects.

124
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,510
<i>That's right. There is no time for me to slack off.</i>

125
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,100
<i>I ought to do whatever I can to improve myself.</i>

126
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,530
Okay. That's all for today's lesson.

127
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,810
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

128
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,170
I have nothing but questions.

129
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,070
- Excuse me, Momota-sensei...
- I have a question, too.

130
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,270
Okay. I'll take a question one by one.

131
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,140
Let's start with you.

132
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,430
Get in a line.

133
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,020
<i>Get in a line.</i>

134
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,240
What a conspicuous hair.

135
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,060
- Yeah.
- Are you fond of Momo-chan-sensei as well?

136
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,020
What?

137
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,380
She's a cutie, isn't she?

138
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,260
She's pretty and graduated from UCL.

139
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,800
Her classes are very easy to understand.

140
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,590
Which school do you go to?

141
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,960
Minami High.

142
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,810
Minami High?

143
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,570
Yuri.

144
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,400
You need a supplementary lesson. Wait for me at the self-study room.

145
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,040
Okay?

146
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,070
Sure.

147
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,110
Hey, what kind of school is this? It's crazy.

148
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,090
It's crazy all right because it's a specialized school for the University of Tokyo.

149
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,410
Not that. Students are flirting with the teacher.

150
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,450
<i>Well, she is a popular teacher.</i>

151
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,690
More than eighty percent of her students

152
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,470
passed the college exam in the past three years.

153
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,300
<i>I've never thought she would take you under her wings.</i>

154
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,360
I was shocked how young she is, but

155
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,750
she is the real deal when it comes to teaching sciences majors of the University of Tokyo.

156
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,020
I'm exhausted from studying with so many students in one class.

157
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,390
That's right.

158
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,190
Be thankful to study under an unpopular teacher like me.

159
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,220
I want you to teach me the science and math.

160
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,250
I told you.

161
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,390
I'm not good enough.

162
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,720
Yuri.

163
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,460
I told you to wait at the self-study room, didn't I?

164
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,080
Right.

165
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,710
"C" and "L" have three interceptions,

166
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,300
it means there are two interceptions other than the origin.

167
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,030
Since "X equal one minus M",

168
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,360
so "M" is greater than zero, but less than one.

169
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,270
That makes sense.

170
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,210
It's not embarrassing to ask what you don't know.

171
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,410
So ask me anything, okay?

172
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,000
Excuse me, could you help me with this?

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,600
- Sorry, Shimazaki. I'll help you later.
- What?

174
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,790
Now let's do some practice problems.

175
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,050
Were you talking to Harumi-sensei over the phone earlier?

176
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,570
Yeah.

177
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,840
You must trust her a lot.

178
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,270
Your hair really is amazing!

179
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,130
How often do you dye it?

180
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,030
Then how about you try solving this problem?

181
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,170
The hard part of the listening portion of the exam...

182
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,890
is its length, not its complexity.

183
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,200
To improve your concentration

184
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,950
so you can listen to a three to five minute long English paragraph,

185
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,050
you should listen to English for 30 minutes

186
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,920
every day until the mock exam.

187
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,520
Right now I'm making listening tracks for you to practice.

188
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,170
Okay.

189
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,580
How are things at Hanaekai?

190
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,380
Is everything okay? Can you keep up?

191
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,380
- If there's anything you don't understand-
- It's okay.

192
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,670
There's tons of homework,

193
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,380
the teacher gives me easier questions

194
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,960
but it's also challenging for me.

195
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,310
I see.

196
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,260
She is kind of annoying,

197
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,400
but she's just as good as you said.

198
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,530
I'm glad to hear that.

202

So we're a perfect match even in the Feudal Warlord Fortune-Teller.

203
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,370
Even though he's an unsuccessful dancer, he's got money!

204
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,990
We met when I was leaving your high school class reunion.

205
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,020
I told him I'm a divorced working mom. I had to change clothes today, too!

206
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,350
So that's your costume?

207
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,380
What do you mean by costume?

208
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,310
He'll figure it out soon if he's as observant as I am.

209
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,310
Halloween is coming up. You should host a costume party.

210
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,480
My bar tripled the profits on that day.

211
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,940
- Tripled?
- Yes.

212
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,530
Junko, were you even listening?

213
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,610
Sorry, I wasn't.

214
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,330
Isn't Yuri taking fewer classes with you? Can't you take a break?

215
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,370
It's the opposite! Now that he's going to a new cram school

216
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,800
to keep him from finding out my shortcoming,

217
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,520
- I have to work till my bones turn to dust and pee blood!
- What?

218
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,190
Be sure to pee normal, not blood, Junko.

219
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,190
I know I was the one who suggested it, but

220
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,020
I hate myself for not being able to teach him all subjects.

221
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,400
The teacher at Hanaekai is only twenty-seven,

222
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,870
and she's superior to me in every aspect.

223
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,750
- Twenty-seven, the Momo-chan-sensei?
- Yeah.

224
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,170
I can't tell if you're oblivious or over-thinking.

225
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,940
That is so-called jealous.

226
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,930
- As a teacher, and as a woman.
- What?

227
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,100
Jealous. You're afraid of losing Yurihei.

228
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,990
What are you talking about?

229
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,170
That's not it. I'm just telling you I'm working hard, too.

230
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,550
I don't have the leisure to relax here.

231
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,630
Sorry. I'm going home and work.

233
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,810
Yes, I am.

238
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,030
"I didn't want anybody to find that out, especially you, Masashi."

239
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,680
I want to know about that more in details.

Can we talk about that some other time?

243

I want to explain it to you properly.

244
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,870
Sure, yeah.

245
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,940
You're absolutely right.

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,240
It's heartwarming to see how clueless you are.

252
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,560
What do you mean?

253
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,590
Jealousy is the beginning of love.

00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,020
You might be in trouble.

255
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,300
In trouble?

256
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:31,960
Junko sent Yuri to attend a cram school in Yokohama that specialized in the University of Tokyo.

257
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,720
Apparently, his teacher is a 27-year-old woman called Momo-chan-sensei.

The appearance of a rival

259

A rival?

261
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,360
What do you mean?

262
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,020
That's right. You should use the sum-to-product formula here.

263
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,100
Nice work.

264
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,990
Then how about the next question here?

265
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,880
Excuse me for a second.

266
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,000
- Um...
- What's the matter?

267
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,170
I don't understand this logarithmic inequality.

268
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,200
Well, based on the antilog,

269
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,090
you know that "x" is greater than "a", right?

270
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:14,630
Then separate it into two parts. On the left side, "a" is greater than one, the right side is less than one.

271
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,040
Okay.

272
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,780
Did Harumi-sensei suggest you to use a sketchbook?

273
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,010
Harumi's cousin did. He went to the University of Tokyo.

274
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,970
Is her cousin a guy?

275
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,520
Yeah.

276
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,980
Harumi-sensei is still single, right?

277
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,900
She is. But do you ask?

278
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,610
No reason.

I heard you're going to two cram schools.

330
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,500
Harumi told me to go there for math and science.

337
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,910
I heard you forced Yuri into the Hanaekai.

338
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,390
I can't let my shortcoming ruins his effort.

339
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:48,880
I thought you'd be heartbroken since he's studying at another school.

340
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,140
I have no time for that. It's my responsibility to teach him humanity classes.

341
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,310
It's partially my responsibility as well.

342
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,510
That's right.

343
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,310
Early modern European history isn't his strong suit. I'm counting on you to do your part.

344
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,120
Okay. He seems vibrant lately.

345
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,380
Very energetic. Like I'm seeing him in a different light.

346
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,670
Yeah.

347
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:17,330
I envy him. Between love and studies, he's enjoying his high school life.

348
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,460
I didn't graduate high school, and you were a book nerd.

349
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
Exactly.

350
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,530
I wonder what kind of adult the pink boy would turn out to be?

352
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,600
Happier than I'll ever be.

353
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,750
You seem happy to me.

354
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,060
Really?

355
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,110

358
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,660
I had a good time.

359
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,000
I didn't think you would go.

360
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,500
You know... I really hated the school.

361
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,310
But maybe I became a teacher so I can remain in school.

362
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,930
Part of our job is sending off our students.

363
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,730
It makes feel emotional now that I think about it.

364
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,900
It's rewarding as well.

365
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,530
Our job is accomplished when they no longer need us.

366

You're a caring teacher who understands the needs of your students.

368
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:40,610

369
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,140

Momota-sensei, what brings you here?

372
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,740
I had a few questions about Yuri.

373
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:06,240
You only told us his good side to our school, right?

374
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,090
You're perceptive. I can't hide anything from you.

375
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,510
Because I was desperate... I'm sorry.

376
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:18,930
I understand that. However, I would like to know more about him, so I can approach him with a suitable method.

377
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:23,830
I appreciate your enthusiasm. Yuri said your classes are easy to understand.

378
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,000
I would like to know your teaching tactic as well.

379
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,940
I just really enjoy my job.

380
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,470
Aren't you the same, Harumi-sensei?

381
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:42,450
I've never thought of that way till I met Yuri.

382
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,610
You're admirable, although you're so young.

383
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:51,090
After turning thirty, my memories and physical strength are fading. Even my lower back hurts.

384
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,300
Yuri-yuri...

385
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:58,290
I mean... Yuri said I'm like an old woman.

386
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:03,170
But you seem like you're having fun now, right, Harumi?

387
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,750
Well, I should be going now.

388
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,470
Hey, who is that Ms. Fabulous?

389
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,200
She is Kyo's teacher? That's not good.

390
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,570
She's young and pretty, and she is the most popular teacher in the school.

391
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,540
Of course she is.

392
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,010
I bet high school boys are head over heels for the sexy teacher.

393
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:41,400
That's not what I meant. She is the most capable one.

394
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,960
She is capable, educated, and young.

395
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,960
She is superior to you in every aspect.

396
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,170
Indeed.

397
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:56,670
Hey, are you jealous of her teaching Kyo?

398
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,860
Why would I?

399
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,960
It's an honor to be taught by the most popular teacher.

400
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,140
Yes, I feel nothing but gratitude to her.

Where should I take her?

404
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,770
She wants to have a proper conversation, because she likes me.

405
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,250
I wonder... I beg to differ.

406
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,630
Then what did she mean by proper?

407
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,780
Whether her intention behind it,

408
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,370
I'm going to tell her how I feel about her.

I see. You're finally confessing to her.

420
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,290
By the way, since when have you liked Junko?

421
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,630
What's wrong? Spit it out.

422
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,400
I was very popular with girls.

423
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,390
Yeah, yeah... I know.

424
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:39,140
"When I look at girls in the eyes for seven seconds, they all fall for me." You seemed terrified.

425
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:44,260
Yeah, it was around that time. When we were 10th graders,

426
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,990
Jun...

427
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:51,460
- she was bullied for a while because of me.
- What?

428
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,650
Back then, she was

429
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,960
a perfect honors student.

430
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,920
<i>She was obedient to her mother.</i>

435
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,750
<i>When they busted, it shouldn't many and it even happened...</i>

436
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,400
<i>She's not even looking at the textbook.</i>

437
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,960
<i>- Harumi is so cool.
- That's crazy.</i>

438
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:47,410
<i>She studied out of desperation. Even when she was with others,</i>

439
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,960
<i>her eyes seemed so empty and lonely.</i>

440
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,760
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,200
<i>I can't find my bag.</i>

442

<i>Junko?</i>

So you were popular with obnoxious girls.

448
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,590
They came here back then, too.

The girls that were after Masashi.

450
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,750
I don't know what they were seeing in you!

451
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,550
- What is it?
- If you were that popular,

452
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,270
how did you end up like this?

453
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:03,230
Hey, why don't you stare at Junko for seven seconds?

454
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,510
I've already tried that.

455
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,090
I tried that, but...

00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,770
<i>It's not fair.</i>

<i>- Stop it.
- But they're bullying-</i>

468
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,760
<i>No one's bullying me.</i>

469
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,280
<i>Just because you guys hate me,</i>

470
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,290

<i>That's fine by me! I hate you guys, too.</i>

472
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,290
<i>But don't touch my study materials.</i>

473
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,850
<i>As long as you don't disturb my study, ostracize me, or hit me...</i>

474
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,930

<i>- against myself.

Seven.

But instead, you fell in love with her in seven seconds.

She doesn't care how people think of her,

00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,010
How's your dad?

528
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,890
His illness is getting worse.

529
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,350
That's one of the reason I moved back.

530
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,070
I'm his only daughter.

531
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,320
I haven't been able to visit him...

532
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,860
I'm sorry.

533
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:16,080
It's fine. He'll just get worked up if he sees you.

534
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,490
Hey...

535
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,380
could we start over again?

536
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,850
I'm sorry.

537
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,480
Have you fallen in love with someone else?

538
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,240
I see.

539
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,190
Of course.

540
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:56,520
I'm sorry for being lame. Bye.

00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,730
Hello?

543
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:19,650
<i>Sorry for calling so late. Can I see you now?</i>

544
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:23,510
<i>Right now? I can't...</i>

545
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:27,910
<i>Actually... I'm already here.</i>

546
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,360
What?

547
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,270
<i>Outside your window.</i>

548
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,290
Yamashita?

549
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:45,240
That persimmon tree's gotten a lot bigger. It's got great footholds.

550
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,780
What are you doing here?

551
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,130
The batteries for my remote control died, so I went to buy some.

552
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,960
Then... I felt an urge to talk to you.

553
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,430
About what?

554
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,520
I'm not sure.

555
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,390
I just really wanted to see you.

556
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,180
Back in high school,

557
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,540
every day

558
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,670
I waited for you.

559
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,730
You never noticed me, though.

560
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,280
I even waited by your house.

561
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,780
Really?

562
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,840
You really hurt my feelings.

563
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,180
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:34,350
Back then, I was so focused on university exams.

565
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,440
I could only see 30 centimeters ahead.

566
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,260
You were a model student.

567
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,120
Indeed.

568
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:49,420
But if people saw a punk like you waiting for me,

569
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,670
they would've thought I was bullied by a thug.

570
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,650
Quiet! My parents are really strict!

571
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,370
Sorry.

572
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,060
My ex-wife's dad was a handful, too.

573
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,030
How so?

574
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,460
He's a scary man.

575
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,350
Is he an advanced version of a thug?
<i>(T/N: Mafia)</i>

576
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,630
If anything, he's the opposite of that.

577
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,410
The opposite?

578
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,930
What is the opposite of a thug?

579
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,570
What is it?

580
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,000
Tell me.

581
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,150
Yuri!

582
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,520
Isn't it inappropriate for a teacher to personally call a student?

583
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,760
I can't? I don't see why not.

584
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,890
Here.

585
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:52,420
I didn't feel comfortable to give this to you at class.
<i>[English Listening Comprehension]</i>

586
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,010
I thought you could use more practice on listening English.

587
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,300
I visited Sanno Seminar and saw your progress so far.

588
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,930
No, I'll ask Harumi to teach me English.

589
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,830
Just take it. Here.

590
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,840
Why don't we walk around the area for a change?

591
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,320
- Oops.
- Hey.

592
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,220
Oh dear.

593
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:30,310
Thanks for helping me to buy items for Halloween.

594
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:33,700
No problem. Sorry for dragging you all the way to Yokohama.

595
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,530
There’s a café nearby where waiters dressed like a feudal lord in the Sengoku period.

596
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,450
Sengoku period?

597
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:43,270
The hostess in our bar dressed up to be a feudal lord every year in Halloween.

598
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,860
- I'll dressed up to be the...
- Oh?

599
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,440
That's Yuri.

600
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,480
Is he...

601
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,730
the rumored pink boy.

602
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,540
Hey,

603
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,980
what is the meaning of this?

604
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,060
What are you talking about?

605
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:35,190
I don't care what you do, but if you disturb my studies next time,

606
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,480
I won't let you off so easy.

607
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,620
What makes you so special?

608
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,520
Minami High ranks the lowest. How dare you compete against us.

609
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,130
Why do you even bother with me? Just focus on your own studies.

610
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,460
What's the matter?

611
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:58,850
- It's nothing. Can I ask you a question?
- Momo-chan-sensei.

612
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,690
- It's been a while.
- It's been a while.

613
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,920
You guys, did you come to see me?

614
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,520
Of course. We're a big fan of yours. We came to help.

615
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,340
Really? I'm so happy.

616
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,140
Thanks to you, we're all able to get into the University of Tokyo.

617
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,370
We came to repay your kindness.

618
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,100
Thank you.

619
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,950
I'll treat you to a meal later.

620
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,250
- That's awesome!
- Great!

621
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:22,160
Shimazaki, he's studying in the Science-3. If you have any questions, just ask him.

622
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,320
- I rather ask you-
- I don't mind it. Ask me anything.

623
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,850
I can help you, too.

624
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,670
Yuri, do you want to join us for a meal?

625
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,120
No, thanks.

626
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,170
How do your students pass the college exam, while you're flirting with them?

627
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,000
Motivation is the key to studies.

628
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,520
It's important to get in a habit of winning.

629
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:58,090
The thrill of solving problems shows them what is like to win.

630
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,330
Most students who are aiming for the University of Tokyo,

631
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:04,340
are top students throughout middle and high school.

632
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:10,120
They fear the environment where they compete against other top students.

633
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:16,830
That's why I encourage them and pamper them.

634
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:20,580
I'm taking care of their mental health to prepare them for failure.

635
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:25,170
So everything you do is well calculated.

636
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,070
What if someone is a loser from the start?

637
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,650
I believe you're the strongest person in here.

638
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,570
Teacher, have you ever failed on anything?

639
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,880
Never.

640
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:04,860
Yuri, why don't you quit Sanno Seminar and join our school instead.

641
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,630
None of her students made it to the University of Tokyo, right?

642
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,480
- I know I'm more capable-
- But...

643
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,930
Harumi is the strongest person I know.

644
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,570
Probably, because she has suffered from her failure.

645
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:29,520
She isn't calculative at all.

646
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,690
Even the things related to me.

647
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,270
<i>I should be the one to cheer you up today.</i>

00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,590
<i>She gets depressed more than I do.</i>

<i>Harumi suddenly scolded him.</i>

I...

00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:57,790
can't imagine taking a college exam without her.

653
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,950
I lost to her again.

654
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:19,750
Teacher, I asked the graduates, but I didn't quite understand.

655
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,600
Do you have a moment?

656
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,760
- Teacher?
- What now?

657
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,960
I'm sorry. Please ask me later.

No.

Oh, your cousin...

00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,300
how are things with your cousin lately?

667
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:23,390
On our next date, I'll confess my feelings to her.

668
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:26,140
I made a reservation for a restaurant at the Imperial Hotel.

669
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,870
Are you going to propose?

670
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:31,680
You're making me nervous.

671
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,820
A proposal, huh?  Must be nice.

672
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,550
Were you always this romantic?

673
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,530
I realized it just recently. When people find true love,

674
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:46,750
they become cowards. Within lies,

675
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,250
there is the truth.

but it was definitely the girl who followed you here before.

692

00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,650
Thank you for asking. It's going well.

704
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,590
That's not what I asked.

705
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,930
I need to speak with Junko real quick.

706
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,570
- With Junko?
- Yes.

707
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,720
- Jun.
- Oh?

708
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:34,810
What's up? Weren't we supposed to hang out tomorrow?

709
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:37,060
We have an important matter to discuss, and it has to be now.

710
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,590
- You see-
- Wait.

711
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,690
Let's talk in my room.

712
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,630
- Come in.
- Thank you for having me.

713
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:49,530
What's wrong all of a sudden?

714
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,410
If it's about Yamashita,

715
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:54,240
- I was planning on telling you-
- Yamashita?

716
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,330
Not that. More importantly,

717
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:02,490
has anyone done anything to you lately?

718
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:05,340
Like bullying at work.

719
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,930
- Bullying?
- I know

720
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:09,980
you would never confide it to anyone.

721
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,790
Are you okay?

722
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,060
Masashi.

723
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,220
I know you're mentally strong.

724
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,950
However,

725
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,760
I worry for you.

726
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,480
If there's anything I can do for you...

727
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,230
I'm not sure what is this about,

728
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,570
but I'm all right.

729
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,890
That's good to hear.

730
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,080
What's the matter?

731
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,510
Do you remember Tomona Makise?

732
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,770
She was our high school classmate.

733
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:53,050
- Makise?
- Yes.

734
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,440
- I don't remember her.
- You know,

735
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,500
the one who bullied you for a while.

736
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,050
Did someone bully me?

737
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,820
Are you serious?

738
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:08,420
You really paid attention to nothing but studies.

739
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,750
Does this picture refresh your memory?

740
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:15,210
<i>[Today, I attended the wedding ceremony of my friend from high school. Tomona, may you and your husband be happy!]</i>

741
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,510
What? This is Momota-sensei.

742
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,290
- And she said she's twenty-seven years old.
- No, she's not.

743
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:26,250
But this is definitely Tomona Makise.

744
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,420
A girl I met at the class reunion

745
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,630
uploaded Makise's wedding photo.

746
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,340
No way.

747
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,300
- But...
- She was always two-faced.

748
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,410
I was worried about her motives.

749
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:40,770
I'm looking into it now.

750
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,820
- Hello?
- It's Nishioi.

751
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:51,150
I looked into it, and it's spread all over the internet.

752
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:53,850
- I'll send you the URL, so please take a look.
- Okay.

753
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,130
A famous teacher of cram school specialized in the University of Tokyo.

754
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,700
Tomona Momota's false educational background.

755
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,930
<i>[Yikes... Is Momo-chan-sensei going to get fired?]</i>

756
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,450
This can't be.

757
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,010
<i>[Divorced twice at her age? It must be her personality issue.]</i>

758
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:12,590
<i>[Doesn't matter if she's good at teaching. She lied about her academic history. She's sure to be fired.]</i>

759
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,630
<i>[33? She's a grannie. And divorced twice?]</i>

760
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:15,890
<i>[This is a scam. If students sue the cram school, they would win.]</i>

761
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,920
<i>I just love this work.</i>

762
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,000
<i>But you look like you're enjoying yourself now,</i>

763
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,930
<i>Harumi.</i>

764
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,500
- Thank you, Masashi. I have to go.
- Okay.

765
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,530
What happened with Yamashita?

766
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,910
Momo-chan-sensei is screwed. Where's Toumei Women's Junior College?

767
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:51,100
Plus, she's thirty-three and divorced twice.

768
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,330
Shimazaki, you had a crush on Momo-chan-sensei, didn't you?

769
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,590
Isn't leaking this online a bit brutal?

770
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:59,310
- She'll get fired.
- It's her fault for lying.

771
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,720
Harumi.

772
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,750
Long time no see, Harumi.

773
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,520
Makise?

774
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:26,670
What a shocker.

775
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:30,150
As expected of the unfriendly honors student.

776
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:33,470
You don't remember me at all.

777
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:41,070
I thought I had finally surpassed you.

778
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,720
Even though you studied your butt off,

779
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,330
you're a pitiful local cram school teacher.

780
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:54,310
Everything about me on the Internet is true.

781
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:57,830
I failed marriage twice.

782
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:01,430
As I grew older, fewer people fawned over me.

783
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:05,230
I had no superior education or work experience.

784
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:09,560
I wasn't meant to become a person like this.

785
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,330
I worked part-time at a small cram school.

786
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,850
And my students passed their exams.

787
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,340
I studied desperately from then on.

788
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:28,980
When I started working here, I became popular.

789
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,000
They admire me as a teacher.

790
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,060
I was happy to be needed by everyone.

791
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,970
Just like I was in high school.

792
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,520
All I wanted

793
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,520
was to be needed by someone.

794
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:56,100
Hey,

795
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:01,440
would you let Yuri study under my care?

796
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,370
I have been fired from this place,

797
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:06,430
but I have more knowledge than you about the exam of the University of Tokyo.

798
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,770
I'll definitely help him to pass.

799
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,270
- I...
- Students will not need teachers' help eventually.

800
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,110
We're simply checkpoints to them.

801
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,680
It's our job to lead our students

802
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,690
to their desired goals,

803
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:26,110
then we let go their hands and send them off.

804
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,080
I don't mind if my students forget me someday.

805
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,370
Until then, Yuri is my student.

806
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:39,820
Only to satiate your loneliness,

807
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,240
I won't hand him over to you.

808
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,140
You're right.

809
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,860
But

810
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,750
in order to help him pass,

811
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,880
please lend us your hand.

812
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,770
Please continue teaching him science and mathematics​.

813
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,880
You guarantee a success, right?

814
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,270
Harumi, you haven't changed.

815
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:21,330
You've always been cool since high school.

816
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,980
I have changed.

817
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,860
I'm not cool.

818
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,110
Back then,

819
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,350
I wasn't scared

820
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:39,770
of being compared with others, winning, or losing.

821
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,490
But when

822
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:47,360
I failed my entrance exam

823
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,000
and have found what is precious to me now.

824
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,060
As much as I've became stronger,

825
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,010
I've become afraid

826
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:59,930
of failing

827
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:02,340
and losing.

828
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,020
More so than ever.

829
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:11,530
Then, now you are

830
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,780
even cooler than before.

Go after her. You'll regret it if you don't.

833
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:47,580
Everyone says that you were a super serious honors student.

834
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,840
How much of an honors student were you really?

835
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:54,000
I was an extreme honors student.

836
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,970
If we were the same age,

837
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:59,610
we wouldn't have even glanced at one another.

838
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,720
Even if we were the same age,

839
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,950
I definitely would've found you,

840
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,970
Harumi.

841
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,770
I wonder about that.

842
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:26,370
My eyes only looked at reference books.

843
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,570
Just now,

844
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,270
when you said you wouldn't hand me over,

845
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,630
