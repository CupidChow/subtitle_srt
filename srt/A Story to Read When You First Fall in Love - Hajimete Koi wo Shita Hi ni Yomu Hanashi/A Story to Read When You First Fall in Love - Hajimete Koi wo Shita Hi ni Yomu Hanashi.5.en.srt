Those are the only questions that will be on the exam.

144

In modern literature,

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,380
your opinions are irrelevant.

Expressing your feelings unilaterally,

158

Listen, there are three basics when reading an English sentence,

366
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,550
which are analysis, structure, and description.

367
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,330
First, analyze a sentence pattern.

368
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:44,750
Then figure out exactly which words are indirect or direct objects.

369
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,950
Next, think of the sentence structure in your head

370
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,570
that will lead you to the answer.

371
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,010
Then, you write an answer as you describe

372
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,710

00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,420
Thanks, guys.

532
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:32,250
- Thank you?
- That's sounds weird coming from you.

533
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:43,330
As I told you before, even if you didn't do so well this time,

534
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,980
don't be so disappointed.

535
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,850
Don't force yourself to smile.

536
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,320
Harumi,

537
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,940
I'm sorry.

538
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:04,130
After all, I...

539
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,920
<i>Why is he acting so serious?</i>

540
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,910
A different...

541
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,940
<i>Different?</i>

542
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,930
- A different-
- Do you want a different teacher?

543
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,120
Sorry about that.

544
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:24,110
That's crazy. I'm just glad that you're my teacher, and not someone else.

545
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:30,580
You're depressed more than I am.

546
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,880
There's no other teacher who would do that for a student.

547
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,800
With that said,

548
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,970
I'm sorry about the mock exam.

549
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:54,420
I remember you told me not to become an adult like you.

550
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:01,560
<i>I forbid you from being a boring adult like me.</i>

551
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,320
I did.

552
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,730
I'm going to study even harder,

553
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,860
and I want to enroll in the University of Tokyo that you couldn't go to.

554
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:20,000
Indeed. Pass the exam for the University of Tokyo

555
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,790
- and don't be an adult like me.
- No, I want to be.

556
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:33,130
Do you think I can become an adult like you, Teacher?

557
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,540
Yuri-yuri, do you want to be a cram school teacher?

558
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,040
What?

559
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,350
It's true that this job is very rewarding.

560
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:53,210
You have a long life ahead, so think of various possibilities.

561
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:59,180
We talked it, and it really perked me up. I'm glad.

562
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:06,650
I have a feeling that modern literature will be your strong suit.

563
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,840
Because you have the ability to sense other's emotions,

564
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,040
and you're kind-hearted with a good reading comprehension skill.

565
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,280
Thank you.

566
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:23,960
I should've been the one to cheer you up.

567
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:54,690
<i>[To Junko: Are you free now?]</i>

568
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,430
Oh, it's you, Yamashita.

569
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,610
Come with me now, Swot!

570
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,010
I have to work early in the morning.

571
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,620
Please.

572
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:44,590
What happened to you that you live in a life of downfall?

573
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:49,840
You were a top student who everyone admired, but now you're a single woman in your 30s and still live with your parents.

574
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,790
I'm a contract teacher at a cram school.

575
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:56,940
Shut up, you former delinquent who had the lowest scores.

576
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,630
But I worked hard to graduate from high school, and I even managed to get a teacher's license.

577
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:06,600
Whatever. Good for you. You used to hate studying, though.

578
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,420
On a contrary, you loved studying.

579
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,620
Ever since I was young, I've always studied. And now I'm teaching.

580
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,410
It's like a habit of mine.

581
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:22,420
I've thought I turned out to be a boring woman, but

582
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,530
I think differently now.

583
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,990
What?

584
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,260
Harumi, which subject do you teach?

585
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:38,490
Modern literature. But I teach Yuri-yuri all subjects.

586
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:42,040
Modern literature? I hated the subject the most.

587
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,550
- Why is that?
- Think about it.

588
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,210
It asks to describe the meaning of the sentence.

589
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:52,040
But the interpretations may be varied by individuals.

590
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,510
It's not asking your personal interpretation or subjective opinion.

591
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,720
- Why not?
- Because the opinion based on a personal view

592
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,520
can't be determined right or wrong.

593
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,490
All the answers are right. It can't be graded.

594
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:09,370
The grading factor is whether you can understand

595
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:12,960
the author's intentions and emotions behind it.

596
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:16,240
Makes sense.

597
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,760
I guess you're right.

598
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,320
That's why I failed.

599
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,920
I couldn't empathize with it at all.

600
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,980
With what?

601
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,650
My wife's feelings.

602
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,210
I'm a former delinquent and a doer.

603
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,150
But I'm also a divorcé.

604
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,720
Did you cheat on your wife or something?

605
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,280
I did not.

606
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,660
I didn't do anything to arouse suspicion, but why...?

607
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,700
She has never trusted me.

608
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,280
She has handed me a divorce paper countless times.

609
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,720
Whenever we argued, she was quick to get a divorce.

610
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,560
That must've been tough for you.

611
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:27,240
I don't know why, but I ended up signing it this time.

612
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,060
That's the question that can't be answered.

613
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:34,690
It's a puzzle to me that why she didn't oppose it at all.

614
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:39,250
She's run away from home before, but she's always come back.

615
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,380
I'm getting a divorce without knowing the reason.

616
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,990
Since you're a woman, do you understand her?

617
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:52,470
Well, that's a tough question for a single woman.

618
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:54,310
I thought so.

619
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:02,160
Don't force yourself to smile.

620
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,260
You, a former delinquent, a doer, and a divorcé.

621
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,790
Let's drink.

622
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,510
Okay.

623
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,390
Cheers.

624
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,700
Well done, you doer.

625
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,320
Don't force yourself to drink.

626
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,300
I need to drink it before you do.

627
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,280
Since I'm paying for it.

628
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,560
Should we get another bottle?

629
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,310
That pink boy...

630
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,060
I think he's serious about Junko.

631
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,150
Are you worried about the high schooler?

632
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,700
No, I'm worried about Junko.

633
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:00,900
I'd hate to find out how she reacts when she finds his feelings.

634
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,860
She's so absorbed in getting him into the University of Tokyo,

635
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,920
I bet it'd cause her a great distress.

636
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,100
I've tried to stop him in my own way, though.

637
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:19,450
By the way, how was his first mock exam?

638
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,210
He's your rival, yet you're worried about him.

639
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,800
You're too nice.

640
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,980
How does a nice guy like you work at a trading company?

641
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,910
I'm doing just fine. Believe it or not,

642
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:34,100
I'm known as a cold-blooded, hot-shot, negotiator among my customers.

643
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:38,070
Why can't you apply your negotiation skill to Junko?

644
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,740
Because we've known each other for a long time,

645
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:45,050
I can picture her reaction when she finds out about my feelings.

646
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:47,340
I don't want her to feel awkward.

647
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,550
I'm still debating how should I approach her.

648
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:55,550
- You're a smart guy, Yakumo.
- Yes, I am.

649
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,020
- Idiot.
- What?

650
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,190
You're such a coward.

651
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:05,010
When it comes to a relationship between a man and woman,

652
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:08,480
sometimes you must force yourself into it in order to become more intimate.

653
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,210
Really?

654
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:14,040
If you are too conscious about hurting her feelings,

655
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,900
- some brave soul might sweep her off her feet.
- Sweep her?

656
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,200
You have to be a little selfish to get the woman you love.

657
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,250
Love is all about desire.

658
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,970
Ms. Matsuoka.

659
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:35,730
Would you please elaborate on that so I can understand?

660
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,790
Okay. Can we get another bottle?

661
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,630
Okay. Fine.

662
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:44,520
Wake up. We've arrived at your house.

663
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,100
Oh, indeed.

664
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,060
Indeed.

665
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,900
Wake up already.

666
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,900
- Should I ring the doorbell?
- No!

667
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:59,160
I'm not in good terms with my parents lately. If I sneak in, they wouldn't know since they're sleeping.

668
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,400
Such a drunkard.

669
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:12,750
Alrighty.

670
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,580
Are you comfortable now?

671
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,590
You swot.

672
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:22,130
Thanks, you former delinquent, a divorcé...

673
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:24,490
A doer.

674
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,720
What are those?

675
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:40,110
Masashi gave me those.

676
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,530
<i>[Schedule for Getting into the University of Tokyo]</i>

677
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,700
- Hey.
- Yes?

678
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:07,340
Do you plan on living in your parent's house,

679
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:11,010
and tutor him till the end without getting married?

680
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:19,150
I personally think devoting yourself to one student is not a very good idea.

681
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:25,430
I'm not a good teacher.

682
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,450
But you know...

683
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:32,600
I'm happy teaching him.

684
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:04,950
Oops, I fell asleep without removing my makeup.

685
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:19,400
<i>W-What is going on here? What on earth?</i>

686
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,540
<i>If my parents see this, they'll lose a little trust they had in me.</i>

687
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:51,380
As for now, I have to get rid of this prompt.

688
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:55,110
Gosh, my head hurts.

689
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,440
<i>What the heck is she doing?</i>

690
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:16,580
Don't carry me like a dead body.

691
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,520
<i>As a result of yielding myself to desire,</i>

692
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:27,790
<i>the woman I love wrapped me up like she'll throw me into a river.</i>

693
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,910
Yamashita.

694
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:37,550
I don't remember a thing about last night.

695
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,390
- We didn't do it.
- Excuse me?

696
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:45,250
In other words, we couldn't do it because we were too drunk.

697
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,230
I fell asleep while I was touching your boobs.

698
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:50,760
B-Boobs? Why did you?

699
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,310
Because the boobs were there.

700
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,520
These are not mountains.
<i>(T/N: "Because it's there" is a quote of a mountaineer, George Mallory.)</i>

701
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,400
You haven't changed at all.

702
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:04,740
Well, my physique...

703
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:09,390
You're stubborn, yet vulnerable.

704
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:13,500
You were blinded by your study and didn't pay attention to boys.

705
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:21,240
You're still the same woman I loved when we were in high school.

706
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:42,130

707
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:49,960
Yuri-yuri, what are you doing here?

708
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:55,590
Hey, Yuri-yuri.

709
00:52:55,590 --> 00:53:00,850
Hey, wait. Wait up. Don't go.

710
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,820
What are you going to say when you catch up to him?

711
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,410
I'm going to clear up the misunderstanding, of course.

712
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:09,220
Did you see his contemptuous gaze, like he was looking at dirty adults?

713
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,350
I have a question for you.

714
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:14,080
A 12th grader is carrying around a picture of

715
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:18,390
his tutor who is thirty-three years old every day.

716
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:24,390
Describe in detail the feeling of the 12th grader,

717
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,680
modern literature teacher.

718
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,380
A relationship...

719
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,070
A teacher-student relationship

720
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:38,940
with a very strong mutual trust.

721
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:41,580
Is that your answer?

722
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:45,770
Generally speaking, it could be interpreted as love.

723
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:50,420
In this particular case, I would call it love between teacher and student.

724
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,850
I'm not asking your subjective opinion.

725
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:55,330
There is only one truth to the author's intention.

726
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:01,500
The reason he came here,

727
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:06,220
was because he passes by your house every morning.

728
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:10,620
I know that because I used to do the same in high school.

729
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:17,710
♫ <i>Repetition of our boring conversations</i> ♫

730
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,790
<i>- Which one is the be-verb?
- "Was"?</i>

731
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:22,070
<i>Correct.</i>

732
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:32,090
If I could only see your smile...

733
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:35,360
If I could hear your voice...

734
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:38,550
that alone made me really happy.

735
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,910
Because I loved you.

736
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:49,350
Harumi,

737
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:53,720
I'm starting to... about you...

738
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:02,350
If you're right about what you said...

739
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,990
<i>Hey, pull your chair in closer.</i>

740
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,100
<i>At that time...</i>

741
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,360
<i>You did a wonderful job.</i>

742
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,870
<i>And at that time, too.</i>

743
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,950
<i>Let's go out to eat for a change.</i>

744
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,760
<i>Also at that time...</i>

745
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,410
But it was like an old woman interacting with a high schooler.

746
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:32,130
I scored zero in all subjects.
<i>(T/N: I failed to notice.)</i>

747
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:35,160
Damn it!

748
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:46,330
<i>I suppose you're not interested in my answer.</i>

749
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:56,260
<i>How can you call yourself a modern literature teacher, you clueless swot?</i>

750
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,080
- <i>[Next Episode]
- Am I good enough for you?
- It has to be you, Harumi. I love you so much</i>

751
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,510
<i>to the point of hating her.</i>

752
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:04,830
<i>I really want him to pass.</i>

753
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:07,570
<i>Do you think a miracle will happen at the high school reunion?</i>

754
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,200
<i>I spent a night at Harumi's room.</i>

755
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,560
<i>I'm confident that you won't win her over.</i>

756
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,680
<i>Just back off.</i>

757
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,140
<i>She's mine.</i>
