Congratulations. You're the project leader.

You'll start in April.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,300
Yeah. He's studying non-stop.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,220
So I want you to give him an intensive session.

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,820

8

Ah, the place?

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,850
I see.

10

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,710
Please raise your head.

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,120
Instead of apologizing to me,

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,560
please talk honestly to Kyohei.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,230
He could be a child

15

only for a little longer.

16

18

- I'll be tutoring my students in my room.

19

- Excuse me. Sorry for the intrusion.

20

This is Ms. Makise. She is a very capable freelance tutor.

It must be too much excitement for the eighteen-year-old boy.

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,460
Kyo was born early in the year, so he's still seventeen.

35
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,120
How envious. At my age,

36
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,370
everyone wants to be the youngest in the group.

37
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,560
I hate it.

38
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,080
Okay. Eto Mika, sit over here.

39
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,780
Okay!

How can you still live with your parents?

41
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,870
You can't bring guys over.

42
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,680
I've never lived up to my parent's expectations,

43
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,170
so I figured I'd at least live here until marriage.

44
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,630
I used to think that way at some point.

45
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,820
I don't have much money.

46
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,780
On top of that, I have my precious here.

47
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,920
- Tororo!
- So furry and adorable.

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,010
We don't have time for this.

49

You have a lot to catch up on since you took a break, okay?

50
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,810
Catching up isn't enough. I have to turn things around.

51
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,150
I've made you a special curriculum leading up to the second exam.

Wrong!

55
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,390
When you're dividing by a variable, you have to consider if it's zero.

56
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,220
You'll never get girls if you can't pay attention to details.

57
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,520
It's the same with math and women. If you cut corners, you'll be in trouble.

58

Okay.

59

Her personality seems different.

60

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,960
The words here, "a complete illusion"...

182
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,390
<i>And while I'm praying...</i>

183
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,700
<i>[34 days until National Center Test for University Admissions]</i>

184
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,670
<i>Please guide this lost 30-year-old</i>

185
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,980
<i>on the right path, God.</i>

186
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,540
You may now kiss the bride.

187
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,250
- Mom, it's hot.
- Here.

188
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,730
- Thanks.
- I can't believe you two are still single.

189
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,420
What have you been doing?

190
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,770
Aren't you two dating anybody right now?

191
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,320
Honey.

192
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,550
Did you at least meet anyone at the reception today?

193
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,510
- There were loads of young people!
- I'm hungry.

194
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,390
<i>For a single woman in her 30s,</i>

195
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,700
<i>family gatherings are hell.</i>

196
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,990
Don't trouble yourself on our account, Shinobu.

197
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,820
I'm sorry. You must be so tired from the reception.

198
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,460
But Mom insisted on coming here.

199
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,950
Listen, my son...

200
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,690
has never brought a girl home.

201
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,870
Shinobu, don't you know anyone good for Masashi?

202
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,970
Mom!

203
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,450
What about you, Junko?

204
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,570
I'm really busy with work.

205
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,480
What do you do for work again?

206
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,280
- I'm a cram school teacher.
- What?

207
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,330
- Grandma, I'm a cram-
- A cram school teacher.

208
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,720
She's a teacher at the local cram school.

209
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,710
It's my fault she's not married and doesn't have a proper job.

210
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,430
But Junko's teaching a Minami High student to get into the University of Tokyo.

211
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,030
- With his grade, he might just pass the exam. Right?
- Right.

212
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,780
Honey, do you have

213
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,320
any good doctors for Junko at your hospital?

214
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,830
Doctors are a bunch of weirdos.

215
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,980
Just like you, Sis.

216
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,960
Why don't you two just get married to each other?

217
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,640
That's perfect!

218
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,020
Right?

219
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,420
I'm so tired!

220
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,280
<i>Jun, let me escape in here, too.</i>

221
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,610
Come in.

222
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,450
I don't want to attend family events for a while.

223
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,500
Me neither. It's more exhausting than I imagined.

224
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,340
Us getting married is crazy...

225
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,110
Right?

226
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,200
Right?

227
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,110
Sorry about the other day.

228
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,200
Actually...

229
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,580
I'm going to be transferred to Russia.

230
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,820
In April.

231
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,450
So I've been thinking a lot lately.

232
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,420
Then I thought...

233
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,420
I want you

234
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,240
to come with me, Junko.

235
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,050
- What?
- I can't do it without you.

236
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,280
I've been to Russia, South America,

237
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,570
and other long-term business trips abroad.

238
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,950
But you were always here when I got back.

239
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,070
I could always see you.

240
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,570
But so many things are changing with you...

241
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,350
and there are many people...

242
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,310
What am I saying?

243
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,780
Anyway,

244
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,410
when I think of you being with someone else,

245
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,980
I'm going to lose my mind.

246
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,280
I don't want to give you up to someone else.

247
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,560
I won't.

248
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,910
I love you.

249
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,160
I've loved you for a long time.

250
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,840
And I love you even now.

251
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,120
Marry me.

252
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,330
- I...
- Hold on a second.

253
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,220
You don't have to answer right away.

254
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,490
Think it over.

255
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,410
Masashi...

256
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,570
My teacher told me I was really talented.

257
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,770
That's amazing! You're so good.

258
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,250
Do you still have time to hang out, Saki?

259
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,410
Yes! I left my son with my parents today.

260
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,550
Wait, didn't you have a daughter?

261
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,150
Right! My daughter.

262
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,200
She acts like a boy.

263
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,510
One sec...

264
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,100
Excuse me.

265
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,770
<i>[Junko]</i>

266
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,610
Hello?

267
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,030
What?! He proposed?

268
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,480
That seven-seconds man?

269
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,930
Excuse me.

270
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,690
You have to tell me everything later.

271
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,010
Okay, bye.

272
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,530
Sorry about that.

273
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,280
My childhood friend

274
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,490
was just proposed to by her cousin.

275
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,310
I was so shocked.

276
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,310
Proposed?

277
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,070
Yes!

278
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,800
And the guy who proposed

279
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,460
was my classmate in middle school, so I was so surprised.

280
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,950
He is an elite who went to the University of Tokyo and works at a trading company now.

281
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,060
- A trading company?
- Yes.

282
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,740
But he's clueless when it comes to love.

283
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,470
He's had a crush on her for twenty years

284
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,970
and he finally proposed.

285
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,080
- To his cousin?
- Yes.

286
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,790
- Huh?
- Oh my.

287
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,740
I just thought he sounds very familiar.

288
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,890
- At my company-
- Huh?

289
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,190
A senior at my dance company.

290
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,810
- He's had a crush on his cousin for a while, too.
- What?

291
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,480
He's shockingly hopeless with love.

292
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,780
When he confessed his feelings, she didn't even notice it.

293
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,180
They're so similar! I guess it's kind of common!

294
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,400
- Shall we eat?
- Yes, let's eat.

295
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,080
Oh my!  I wrapped up the date early for you!

296
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,020
Tell me everything!

297
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,940
It happened here?

298
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,570
He kissed you here?

299
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,510
H-Hold on...

300
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,850
So tell me. How was it?

301
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,210
How was it? That's not important.

302
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,000
Of course, it is. When he kissed you-

303
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,510
Did you hate it? Did it make your heart flutter?

304
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:22,710
If you were a woman, you should know the answer based on your feelings.

305
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,840
I was too surprised.

306
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,700
I aged overnight!

307
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,750
- What are you talking about? Come on, now!
- Stop!

308
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,100
You're enjoying this too much.

309
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,320
Come on! He was so close to becoming

310
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,100
a spineless, good-for-nothing hermit,

311
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,580
and then he kisses you and proposes!

312
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Is he on his death bed?

313
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,910
I'm getting worried now.

314
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,260
He's transferring to Russia in April.

315
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,140
So that's why.

316
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,520
So?

317
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,580
I can't give him an answer that fast.

318
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,900
Masashi wants me to think it over well.

319
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,290
What do I do? How am I supposed to act around him now?

320
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,790
If my parents found out,

321
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,260
things would get awkward around relatives.

322
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,650
What a bummer.

323
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,000
What?

324
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,330
Stop acting like you're considering his feelings.

325
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,380
Just be honest with yourself.

326
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,850
Both Yakumo and Yamashita

327
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,850
put themselves out there for you.

328
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,970
Haven't you ever wanted

329
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,550
to answer their feelings?

330
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,130
Think about it carefully

331
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,540
and choose wisely.

332
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,070
Whichever you choose.

333
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,120
- Whichever?
- Right.

Gori, thanks for letting me use your place.

340
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,900
Okay...

341
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:32,480
I thought we'd add a last-minute review starting this week.

342
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,040
- What about English?
- We'll work on his time management

343
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,030
through the practice exam.

344
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,980
And his Japanese?

345
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,470
We'll focus on Chinese literature and classical literature during the New Year's holiday.

346
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,660
- What's going on with Yakumo?
- For world history...

347
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,520
You haven't done it yet?

348
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,610
What are you talking about?

349
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,770
He even went to your place.

350
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,720
Something must be going on.

351
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,210
Not really...

352
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,070
I just want to know.

353
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,080
If Yakumo is a free man,

354
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,670
there are lots of different ways I could come onto him.

355
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,520
We don't have time to waste now that we're over 30.

356
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,080
So? Can I go for Yakumo?

357
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,690
He asked me to marry him the other day.

358
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,020
What on earth?

359
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,830
Only if we had been reunited a little sooner...
