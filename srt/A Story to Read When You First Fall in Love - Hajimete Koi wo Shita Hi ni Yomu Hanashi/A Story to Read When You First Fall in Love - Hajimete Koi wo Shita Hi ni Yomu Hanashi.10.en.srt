Is that true, Masashi?

177
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,070
I'm sorry, all because of me...

178
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:09,090
It's fine. I didn't want to go to Russia in the first place.

179
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:14,940
Besides, I can bounce back in no time with my ability.

I'm sad, Yama-pyon.

192
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,880
Yama-pyon, are you crying?

193
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,990
This is my last day as a teacher.

195
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,660
and you guys were idiots.

196
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,050
I had my own struggles as a teacher. However, when you'll be as old as I am,

197
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,320
I hope you'll have a good paying job,

198
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,490
and have one thing that makes you happy.

199

00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,900
- I'm not crying!
- Yes, you are.

00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,700
Are you sad?

205
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,390
Stop it!

206
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,890
Yuri.

207
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,590
I visited Harumi at the hospital.

208
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,770
How was she?

209
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,820
She seemed to be doing well.

210
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,340
She said you did a good job.

211
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,760
<i>Listen, it makes a cool sound.</i>

212
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,520
I want to try it, too. Let me try it.

213
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,570
Kyo!

214
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,410
Since the exam results will be out tomorrow,

215
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,330
I thought I might feel a little awkward.

216
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,620
Eto, you'll pass.

217
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,550
I was able to push myself, thanks to you.

218
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,360
Kyo, I like you a lot.

219
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,160
I'm sorry.

220
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,430
I thought so. I knew you find me annoying.

221
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,380
Since Harumi-sensei is getting married, I thought I'd have a chance with you.

222
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,140
Kyo, what will you do about Harumi-sensei?

223
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,060
I'm no longer her student, so there's no issue.

224
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,890
I'll do it in the right way.

225
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,870
What do you mean by that?

226
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,490
Once I pass,

227
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,270
I'll tell her again...

228
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,030
that I love her.

229
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,080
What is your plan after confessing?

230
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,680
She is 34. Are you going to make her wait four more years?

231
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,810
More importantly, how will you provide for her?

232
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,840
I like both of you and Harumi-sensei.

233
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,760
I want the two of you to be happy.

234
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,690
I'm sorry.

235
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,750
See you!

236
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,140
I'll give you ride home.

237
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,320
Thanks.

238
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,670
- I heard you were getting discharged.
- Yes.

239
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,120
Thank you.

240
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,400
It must be hard walking with this.

241
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,080
I'm really sorry about... the job in Russia.

242
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,000
It's all in the past.

243
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,950
No matter the circumstances,

244
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,120
you've always been my ally, Masashi.

245
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,910
I made it this far because you were always there for me.

246
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:54,240
Before the exams, you were studying diligently, just like I was.

247
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,420
Masashi, you were the only one who understood me

248
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,450
when I had issues with my mother.

249
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,780
That was what saved me.

250
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,570
Even when I failed my exams,

251
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,210
failed to find a job,

252
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,850
I even failed to find a marriage partner.

253
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,210
You remained a constant, Masashi.

254
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,430
I was happy when you failed to find a husband, though.

255
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,750
You were always there for me without fail.

256
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,020
I just now realized how fortunate I am.

257
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,430
Is it because you've found someone you like?

258
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,730
I...

259
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,620
like you, Masashi.

260
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,220
But...

261
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,040
I don't think of you in a romantic way.

262
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,520
I'm sorry.

263
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,720
I'm really sorry.

264
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,900
I knew that already.

265
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,070
However...

266
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,130
I can't move on unless you reject me flat out.

267
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,940
I'm sorry for putting you on the spot.

268
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,580
But I'm glad

269
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,310
that you're the first person I fell in love with.

270
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,260
I was able to laugh and get depressed right by your side

271
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,170
for the past twenty years.

272
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:02,100
In other words, you made my heart flutter.

273
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,700
I was so happy that I was able to take advantage of being your cousin.

274
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,050
Aren't you envious?

275
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,890
Thank you, Masashi.

276
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,680
- I'm home.
- Are you all right? Can you take off your shoes?

277
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,800
Junko?

278
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,630
Back then...

279
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,790
<i>Sorry, I failed!</i>

280
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,800
<i>When you slapped me...</i>

281
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,400
<i>Ju-</i>

282
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:08,430
I thought you would be more sad than I was,

283
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,210
so I was desperate and tried to laugh it off.

284
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:19,400
I was so blinded and failed to see my mistakes.

285
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,420
<i>I was desperate, too.</i>

286
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:29,670
Everyone in the Harumi Family graduated from the University of Tokyo. So if I raise you right,

287
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,780
I selfishly thought I would be accepted...

288
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,440
Mom.

289
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,660
I am a failure as a mother.

290
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,790
Ever since then, every time I saw you suffering,

291
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:49,250
I dwelt on my mistakes and I vented my anger on you.

292
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,350
What a terrible mother I am.

293
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,560
You really are.

294
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,180
However,

295
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,320
you did raise me right.

296
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,210
After all,

297
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,360
I'm incredibly happy right now.

298
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,730
Junko...

299
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,950
You were the one who taught me that studying is fun.

300
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,270
Thanks to you, studying became my forte.

301
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,830
I wasn't able to become the adult I wanted to.

302
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:36,010
But I've become a tutor, helping students reach their dreams. I feel so fortunate.

303
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,020
Ever since I met Yuri, and started to teach him,

304
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,190
<i>I've come to like myself.</i>

305
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,520
<i>Even my experience of failing my exams,</i>

306
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,690
has become my advantage

307
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,890
as a tutor.

308
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,320
So let me say this.

309
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,470
Thank you.

310
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,380
I'm sorry...

311
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,590
Mom.

312
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,260
Welcome home.

313
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,550
If you find work so fun, then nothing makes me happier.

314
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,990
All that's left is... if you could find a nice husband,

315
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,890
I'd feel at ease.

316
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,800
Dad.

317
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,990
I wouldn't suggest marrying a Tokyo University graduate. I'm a prime example.

318
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,000
Dear,

319
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,920
thank you so much.

320
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,460
I hope the cherry blossom's bloom.

321
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,500
Excuse me?

322
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,190
I'm talking about Yuri (passing the exam).

323
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,600
I hope so too.

324
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,120

Yes. I should be able to walk normally by the end of March.

00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,710
I see.

Since you injured your leg, don't come to work during March.

However, today is...

343
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,670
That's right.

Too bad. Then let's aim for the next year.

Teshigawara-sensei, have you experienced it, too?

387

Of course! I like it because of the relationship between students and teachers.

00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:31,040
But I feel that

531
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,030
I've finally become a decent adult.

532
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,520
A decent adult, huh?

533
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,880
Sorry.

534
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,030
Hello?

535
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:54,580
Regarding that, if you lay the groundwork and then turn it down tomorrow, there should be no issues down the line.

536
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,420
I'll be back in about 30 minutes.

537
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,970
See? I'm surprisingly good at this. So don't worry about me.

538
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:09,590
Tell me when you run in the election. I'll definitely vote for you.

539
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,480
Thanks. I have to go.

540
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,050
Bye.

<i>[A Story to Read When You First Fall in Love]</i>

542
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:45,050
I studied this pretty hard though...

543
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,530
- Hello?
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

544
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,170
I'm cleaning up my room.

545
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,080
You know that's not what I asked.

547
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,780
I'm sorry.

<i>Sensei.</i>

549
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,230
I'm not a teacher anymore.

550
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:26,780
After I turned eighteen and passed the exam,

551
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,480
just when I thought I'm finally qualified to be with Harumi,

552
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,990
<i>but now I don't know what to do.</i>

553
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,480
I realized I'm actually far away from her.

554
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,050
She's not getting married.

What?

557
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm such a blabbermouth.

558
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,590
Maybe I'm not cut out for a parliamentarian.

559
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,700
You're an amazing teacher, after all.

560
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,290
Bye.

561
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,660
Sir, we've arrived.

562
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,190
Sir, this way, please.

563
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,570
Yuri-yuri.

564
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,250
Did you lie to me

565
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,960
because you hated me?

566
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,260
That's not why...

567
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,500
But...

568
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,730
I'm sorry for lying.

569
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,570
Answer me honestly.

570
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:07,410
Do you

571
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,040
love me?

572
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,860
Answer me, yes or no?

573
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,320
Don't dodge the question or lie.

574
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,100
Yes.

575
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,710
- Then...
- But,

576
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,510
I can't go out with you.

577
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:38,110
- Why not?
- Because...

578
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,360
when you become my age,

579
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,820
I'll be fifty years old.

580
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,970
- I know that already.
- No, you don't understand.

581
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:51,720
Your life will change now that you're learning at the University and meeting many people.

582
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,280
- You'll change eventually.
- I won't!

583
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,660
Then...

584
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,520
what kind of adult do you want to become in the future?

585
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,380
You don't remember?

586
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:06,660
What?

587
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,920
It's nothing.

588
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,420
Living with someone who hasn't figured out their life,

589
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:18,390
I'm too old for that.

590
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,220
Is loving a person

591
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,300
not good enough reason?

592
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,850
To be honest,

593
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:42,130
I'm too scared what if things go wrong.

594
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,890
I...

595
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:51,020
was a serious nerd.

596
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,160
And I barely have any experience in dating.

597
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,120
What if...

598
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,880
you dump me in five or ten years time,

599
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,470
I'll be more depressed than when I failed the college exam.

600
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,330
It'll be too painful.

601
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,850
I'm afraid to get hurt.

602
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:19,560
I'm sorry.

603
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,300
Just because I'm young

604
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,640
doesn't mean I won't get hurt.

605
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,170
Right now I've met the person I love most in my life.

606
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,780
It's you.

607
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:46,440
I've always loved you, Harumi.

608
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,720
I just want to be with you,

609
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:54,080
but are you telling me I can't?

610
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,720
From today onward,

611
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,110
I have to live with that for the rest of my life?

612
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,450
Farewell,

613
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,600
Harumi-sensei.

Don't worry about it. I'm treating today.

Really? Thank you.

00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,870
That's the wallet I bought.

Congrats, Boss!

636
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,120
I try not to mess it up this time.

637
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,830
Though, it's out of my character.

638
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:58,650
It's okay to make mistakes.

639
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,970
- Hey, Yakumo!
- Even if it doesn't turn out to be how you wished for,

640
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:06,680
you should be happy that you're in love. And we are responsible for both our successes and our failures.

641
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:10,270
We're adults and free to do whatever we want, right?

642
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,930
I wish you happiness.

643
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:15,180
Geez, stop it already.

644
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,840

- Oh my.

- She's crying.
- Hey, that's enough.

- Good evening.
- Hi!

647
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,820
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

648
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,300
- I’m sad at the same time.
- This is my fiancé.

649
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,920
Nice to meet you.

650
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,250

- No.
- Congratulations.

652
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,310
- How wonderful.
- Good evening!

- Darling?

664
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:19,740
Please introduce me to someone nice.

665
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:23,050
I can pretend to be someone dense like Harumi.

666
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:26,680
Makise, I like you better for who you really are.

667
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,220
If you added denseness to a schemer,

668
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,120
you'd be a mere old lady.

669
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,190
It's a joke.

670

671
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,940
Kisa, you have seaweed stuck in your teeth.

00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:46,530
Check for seaweed, everyone.

My ideal type is Kenshin Uesugi.
<i>(T/N: a feudal lord in Sengoku period)</i>

675
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:51,340
Kenshin Uesugi? I see. And?

676
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,290
And my lucky item is...

677
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,390
I'm seriously worried about you.

678
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:00,750
What's gotten into you?

679
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:05,570
- What?
- Why are you staring at a spoon like a dead person?

680
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,610
I told you it's my new hobby.

681
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,270
Yuri Geller!

682
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:13,980
Wasn't he a psychic who was famous for spoon-bending in the Showa era?

683
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,520
What? Don't you know him?

684
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,760
I do know him, Gorilla.

685
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,500
It's Gori.

686
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,990
You must picture it in your mind. It's the power of the mind.

687
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:24,450
Yuri... Geller...

688
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:29,590
That's right. Only Yuri can make you look so depressed.

689
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:33,130
What happened? Confess.

690
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:46,280
That's what I told Yuri-yuri.

691
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,740
As a genuine adult,

692
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:52,260
I was able to bid him sincere farewell.

693
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:55,450
I didn't lie to him.

694
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:56,940
Jun.

695
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:59,050
I think you made the right decision.

696
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,630
Considering our age and a subjective well-being for women.

697
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:06,700
That's right. Any woman should feel honored to be liked by a high schooler.

698
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:12,580
There's a better man close by. He's a good cook and older.

699
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:18,380
Kyo can find a girlfriend easily at university.

700
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,090
If you think about it logically as an adult, anyone would think that.

701
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:27,760
How ordinary. How extremely ordinary.

702
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,160
What?

703
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:33,990
I thought you were better than those boring adults.

704
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:37,730
Yuri told me once

705
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,040
that he wants to become a weird adult.

706
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,330
Yamashita.

707
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:46,400
You didn't mean to fall for him. You have fallen in love with him without realizing it.

708
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,600
Jun, such a miracle only happens once in every thirty years.

709
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,400
The next one, you'll be in your sixties.

710
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,030
Oh my god, your 60th birthday!

711
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,470
You're skipping adulthood, and going straight to becoming a granny.

712
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:05,590
<i>You're not an adult, you're a granny!</i>

713
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:09,440
<i>You're a weird adult.</i>

714
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,220
<i>Do you think I can become an adult like you?</i>

715
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,060
<i>What kind of adult do you want to become in the future?</i>

716
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,020
<i>You don't remember?</i>

717
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:23,260
<i>Farewell, Harumi-sensei.</i>

718
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:29,800
No way, it fell!

719
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:37,900
I got the wrong answer again! Zero point!

720
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,750
<i> I no longer have</i>

721
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:48,820
<i>the leisure in my life like you do. However,</i>

722
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,000
<i>whether picking my favorite color, laughing,</i>

723
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,850
<i>going down a wrong path, and crying, are all up to me to decide.</i>

724
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:58,480
<i>I'm at the age where I can take responsibility for my actions.</i>

725
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:03,580
Please submit your assignment at the next class.

726
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,480
What?

727
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,490
Yuri-yuri.

728
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,250
Harumi?

729
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,250
Excuse me...

730
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:27,030
I'm sorry for interrupting.

731
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,190
I'm sorry.

732
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,770
I made a mistake.

733
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,320
What?

734
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,370
I...

735
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:55,690
only sing songs of Komuro Family and songs in the Showa era in karaoke. Are you okay with that?

736
00:53:55,690 --> 00:54:00,500
My back hurts, and my wounds don't heal quickly.

737
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,780
- If I lack sleep, I look older. Is that all right?
- Yes.

738
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,670
When you graduate, I'll be close to forty.

739
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,160
- You don't know Yuri Geller, do you?
- Nope.

740
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:18,490
More importantly, if we're getting married, let's do it as soon as possible.

741
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,860
Okay.

742
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,170
Let me confirm something here.

743
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:30,920
Are you really...

744
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,340
really okay being with me?

745
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:46,480
I chose you. It has to be you, Harumi.

746
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:50,420
Don't make me repeat myself.

Idiot.
