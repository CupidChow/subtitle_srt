00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:10,928
CRAZY LOVE

2
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:32,908
CRAZY LOVE

00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:36,248
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,208
NOH * JIN

5
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:43,438
Where are you going?

6
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:45,188
Aren't you here to see me?

7
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:19,228
-Blood.
-Blood?

8
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:20,808
Where?

9
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:21,898
No…

10
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,078
EPISODE 4

11
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:42,378
Gosh, that really hurts.

12
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,788
Are you sure there isn't any brain damage?

13
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:48,088
It's just a small wound.

14
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,378
You don't have to worry.

15
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:50,718
Ma'am, how can I not worry?

16
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:52,298
My head is ringing--

17
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,308
Then, please book
an appointment for tomorrow

18
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:57,218
and get an MRI.

19
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,858
Consider yourself lucky, okay?

20
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:08,028
Other people would've sued you.

21
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,068
I came to the wrong room by accident.

22
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:14,368
How could you assault me with a tray
for making an innocent mistake?

23
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:16,448
This is so ridiculous, don't you think?

24
00:03:17,288 --> 00:03:19,828
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:22,578
-Reporter Lee Daeseok.
-Yes?

26
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:23,958
Reporter?

27
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,878
-It's mine.
-Reporter Lee Daeseok of Weekly Fact.

28
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:35,758
Why is my picture here?

29
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:52,488
So you didn't…

30
00:03:53,778 --> 00:03:54,908
come to the wrong room.

31
00:03:58,618 --> 00:03:59,448
Well…

32
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:05,328
Mr. Noh's devoted fans
are so worried about him.

33
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:07,958
I just wanted to show them
that you're all right,

34
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:09,708
so I came to the hospital
to take a picture.

35
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:12,588
Then why didn't you say so?

36
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:13,928
I would've let you.

37
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:28,898
Aren't you going to take it?

38
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:30,648
Thank you.

39
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:37,448
That's why if you're dumb,
your body suffers.

40
00:04:37,948 --> 00:04:39,328
You could've just told me.

41
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:42,408
But because you snuck in like a thief,
you got beaten like that.

42
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:46,038
You're terribly dumb.

43
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:49,378
Don't they describe people like you,
"dumb as a rock"?

44
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,758
What did you say? "Dumb as a rock"?

45
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:57,218
DELETE

46
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,848
Reporter Lee.

47
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:08,858
One more mishap like this,

48
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:10,938
you'll need to go to the police station.

49
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:12,938
I'm the victim here.

50
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:14,858
Then should we take it to court instead?

51
00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:25,578
Have a good day.

52
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:29,668
How did it go?

53
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:32,128
It shouldn't be a problem.

54
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,258
That's a relief.

55
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:38,008
I don't think it's a relief.

56
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,428
Sorry?

57
00:05:39,928 --> 00:05:42,718
Did the reporters find out
that he has amnesia?

58
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:46,388
No. If that were the case,
it would've been a disaster.

59
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,098
A disaster?

60
00:05:57,948 --> 00:06:00,238
-Where is he?
-Over here!

61
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,198
-He's over here!
-In here!

62
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,578
Get the camera ready!

63
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:06,698
He's over here. Record now!

64
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,628
Mr. Noh Gojin, the top instructor,
is suffering from amnesia.

65
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:11,958
Wow!

66
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:17,128
Who would entrust their child's education
to an instructor who has amnesia?

67
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:20,928
Gotop Education is ruined, everyone!

68
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,308
Why didn't I think of this?

69
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:29,018
Should I just tell the press?

70
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:30,098
No.

71
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,228
Then I wouldn't be satisfied.

72
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,068
I'm not even halfway through
tormenting him.

73
00:06:37,238 --> 00:06:39,898
-What are you thinking so hard about?
-What?

74
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:42,698
Are you worried that they'll find out
about Gojin's amnesia?

75
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:44,828
No, it's not that.

76
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:47,658
It's the opposite of that.

77
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:52,668
Please don't worry.
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

78
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:57,508
Okay, I definitely won't tell the press.

79
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:03,048
Also, Gojin's memories
will come back for sure,

80
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:04,928
so don't worry too much.

81
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:11,808
In any case,
he shouldn't stay here any longer.

82
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,598
We should get him out of here.

83
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:15,478
Get him discharged already?

84
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,568
The safest place for him right now
would be his home in Seoul.

85
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:22,738
Random people won't be able
to enter his home at least.

86
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:26,828
So please go ahead
and go to his home in Seoul.

87
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:42,758
Come on in…

88
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:45,718
Hey,

89
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:47,308
what are you doing here?

90
00:07:47,388 --> 00:07:48,888
How did you know I was coming home?

91
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,348
I was getting hungry.

92
00:07:51,228 --> 00:07:52,228
Good timing.

93
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,728
Gosh, it tastes so good.

94
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,688
Seriously, how did you know?

95
00:07:58,768 --> 00:08:01,818
What? Actually…

96
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:04,358
Gosh, the ramyeon smells so good.

97
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:06,068
Lee Sooho!

98
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:07,698
What are you doing here?

99
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,618
Sina!

100
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:11,078
What are you doing here?

101
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,538
I live here.

102
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:16,538
-I see.
-Why did you come here?

103
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:20,458
Well, the thing is…

104
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:21,798
Don't.

105
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,428
Are you guys…

106
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:35,598
-We're not dating!
-It's not like that!

107
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:38,978
Hey, Chu Okhee.

108
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:40,608
We're really not dating.

109
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:44,568
See? We're really not dating.

110
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:47,948
I have really high standards, okay?

111
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:50,528
I have no interest in this old lady.

112
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,868
-You punk.
-Stop right there.

113
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,208
You two.

114
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:58,248
Sit down.

115
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:09,798
I know…

116
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,968
you're acting right now.

117
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:17,138
Ohkee!

118
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:24,688
Did you help Sooho
with his audition again?

119
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,408
Don't let this punk chase rainbows.

120
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:31,278
He can't be an actor!

121
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:33,698
Hey, snap out of it!

122
00:09:33,788 --> 00:09:36,158
You're supposed to be studying
for the civic service exam.

123
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:37,158
My dream…

124
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:40,578
-is to become an actor.
-Dream, my foot.

125
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:43,378
You're Dad's only hope.
Quit chasing rainbows

126
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,918
and get your act together.

127
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:47,128
Why am I the only one? You're here too.

128
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:51,598
I'm already living on my own.

129
00:09:52,178 --> 00:09:53,098
Be quiet and go home.

130
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:54,598
No. I'll leave tomorrow.

131
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:55,978
You punk.

132
00:09:57,018 --> 00:09:58,808
I'm going to tell Dad that you stayed out…

133
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:00,348
Okay!

134
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:08,738
I'm going to tell him
that you stayed out overnight!

135
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,588
Honey, are you okay?

136
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:28,048
I hit you too hard, right? I'm sorry.

137
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:32,138
No, honey. I was worse.

138
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:33,388
I'm sorry.

139
00:10:36,518 --> 00:10:38,478
MY BABY HO
NO, HONEY. I WAS WORSE. I'M SORRY

140
00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:42,518
Gosh, he's such a big baby.
He really doesn't listen to me.

141
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,528
Hey, so what brings you home?
What about Mr. Noh Manners?

142
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:49,858
Did he find out?

143
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:51,488
No.

144
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,068
He'll be discharged, so I came back first.

145
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:55,698
Already? Why?

146
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:56,988
Because of a reporter.

147
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:59,078
He'll leave the hospital
and go to his house.

148
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:02,118
So,

149
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:06,088
about your go-to place…
The very skilled one.

150
00:11:06,168 --> 00:11:07,418
My go-to place?

151
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:10,008
You mean, the shaman?

152
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:12,258
-Can you get me a paper talisman?
-What kind?

153
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:13,968
For bad luck.

154
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:17,888
What? Not to block bad luck?

155
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,808
It has to bring in all the bad luck
in the entire world…

156
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:23,558
to Mr. Noh Manners' house.

157
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:33,698
YEONHONG MOVING SERVICE

158
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:16,868
Awesome!

159
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:28,088
It's super spacious.

160
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,748
Wait.

161
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:33,048
But why does this house feel so empty?

162
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,338
It's like someone fled
from loan sharks in a rush.

163
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,428
Maybe because his heart is empty.

164
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,768
Then I feel a bit sorry for him.

165
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:44,138
You feel sorry for him?

166
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,228
It's because he's a total jerk.
Why would you feel sorry for him?

167
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,278
Gosh, whatever. Who cares?
This isn't my house.

168
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:52,478
I don't care.

169
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:55,698
What do you mean, who cares?
This is your house.

170
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:56,818
What do you mean?

171
00:12:57,988 --> 00:13:00,328
Because it's your hubby's house.

172
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:02,408
Hey, Chu Okhee!

173
00:13:02,488 --> 00:13:04,288
Let's just transfer
the ownership to you too.

174
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,868
Gosh, stop speaking nonsense.

175
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,118
We have to get this done.

176
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:13,008
Is he on a diet?

177
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,928
He's the pickiest man in the world.

178
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:19,388
He hates everything.

179
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,968
I bet he never cooks
because the smells bother him.

180
00:13:28,478 --> 00:13:29,438
Oh, right.

181
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:32,978
Especially the smell of fish.
He really hates it.

182
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,988
OUR LOVE IS FOREVER

183
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:46,458
MY LOVE, PRINCE GOJIN
MY LOVE, PRINCESS SINA

184
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:55,258
Look how everything is lined up perfectly.

185
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:57,258
Is he a former Marine?

186
00:13:57,338 --> 00:13:59,638
No, he was exempt. He's a neat freak.

187
00:14:10,938 --> 00:14:12,938
He's got books to the ceiling.

188
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:17,068
This is dizzying.

189
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:20,108
When he's stressed,
he solves math problems all day long.

190
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:32,288
He thinks he's a celebrity.

191
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,258
Did you decide on a room?

192
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:46,518
Why would I?

193
00:14:46,598 --> 00:14:47,808
You're his fiancée.

194
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,098
He has such a huge house.

195
00:14:49,178 --> 00:14:52,188
You're his fiancée who comes here often.
You've got to have your own room.

196
00:14:53,898 --> 00:14:55,108
Perhaps you're right.

197
00:14:58,608 --> 00:14:59,738
This room is nice.

198
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:01,448
Sina, let's bring your things here.

199
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:16,298
What was that sound? Is he here already?

200
00:15:16,378 --> 00:15:19,798
You're such a scaredy-cat.
Someone just moved in downstairs.

201
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:22,758
We saw them moving in earlier.

202
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:24,258
Oh, right.

203
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:29,428
You can't still be like that.

204
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:32,018
That's why
a guilty conscience needs no accuser.

205
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:36,818
You wanted revenge.
You wanted to destroy him.

206
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:44,318
Hey, if you're going to act,
you have to be thick-skinned.

207
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:47,578
Keep telling yourself
that you're Noh Gojin's fiancée.

208
00:15:47,658 --> 00:15:49,578
Then you'll end up believing it.

209
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:50,828
Try it.

210
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,958
I am Noh Gojin's fiancée.

211
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:02,838
That's it. Close your eyes
and just repeat it 30 times.

212
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:04,928
Take a deep breath.

213
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,638
I am Noh Gojin's fiancée.

214
00:16:10,718 --> 00:16:12,678
I am Noh Gojin's fiancée.

215
00:16:12,768 --> 00:16:15,188
I am Noh Gojin's… Hey, wait!

216
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:18,358
-What?
-I forgot to do the most important thing.

217
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:19,688
What?

218
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:23,198
This?

219
00:16:26,868 --> 00:16:28,278
Currently, Gotop Education provides

220
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:30,698
educational programs
from early childhood to high school,

221
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:33,368
as well as the CSAT
and the civil service exams.

222
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,618
We also operate various sub businesses

223
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,708
including school uniforms and meals,
and publishing.

224
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,248
We're focusing on expanding globally too.

225
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:41,878
I'm…

226
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:45,718
the CEO of such a large company?

227
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,138
Yup.

228
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,888
The more I get to know myself,

229
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,718
I feel so burdened

230
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:55,058
by how great I am.

231
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:56,768
You're right.

232
00:16:57,348 --> 00:16:59,688
Noh Gojin is such a great person.

233
00:17:00,268 --> 00:17:02,858
You're the top instructor in Korea

234
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:05,648
who has show schedules lined up
until the end of next year.

235
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,318
People love your rags-to-riches story.

236
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:12,998
The miracle of a math genius
with an IQ of 190,

237
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:16,458
who was once a poor orphan
with only a high school diploma.

238
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:20,378
Not a miracle.

239
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:24,548
I think it would've been
an excruciatingly painful process.

240
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:33,518
I feel somewhat… afraid.

241
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,728
I don't think I'll do a good job.

242
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:41,228
Let's talk about it again later.

243
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,148
For now,
tomorrow's interview is more important.

244
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,238
Interview?

245
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:50,618
A rumor is spreading that
your accident wasn't a hit-and-run,

246
00:17:50,698 --> 00:17:53,038
but that someone did it on purpose.

247
00:17:53,828 --> 00:17:57,538
In a situation like this,
an interview can calm things down.

248
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,208
Don't worry.

249
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:05,088
It's a simple Q and A. You'll be fine.

250
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:07,928
Also, I'll be…

251
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:10,088
by your side.

252
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:26,418
How come you are here?

253
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:28,378
We're still setting up.

254
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,088
I like things like this.

255
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:34,338
It feels exciting
to see things come together.

256
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:38,968
More importantly…

257
00:19:39,808 --> 00:19:40,928
did you find out?

258
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:42,348
Mr. Noh Gojin…

259
00:19:43,688 --> 00:19:44,688
does have amnesia.

260
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:48,108
He really has amnesia?

261
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:51,238
Yes, due to side effects of anesthesia.

262
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:55,318
Mr. Noh has a unique constitution
and cannot be anesthetized.

263
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:00,118
No way.

264
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,328
How can this be?

265
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:07,838
He really…

266
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,008
forgot everything?

267
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:14,298
Yes. I heard that he couldn't
even remember his own name.

268
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:20,558
What do you plan to do with that house?

269
00:20:23,978 --> 00:20:25,228
It must be fate.

270
00:20:28,818 --> 00:20:31,028
The memories of our love disappeared,

271
00:20:31,108 --> 00:20:33,488
but the memories of our break-up
also disappeared.

272
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:38,078
Yes. It's meant to be.

273
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:40,828
We're meant to start over
and fall in love again.

274
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,118
I want to go back to that house right now.

275
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:51,628
Congratulations on being discharged!

276
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,138
You went through so much trouble, Mr. Oh.

277
00:20:58,218 --> 00:21:00,888
Not at all. It felt like
we were taking a trip together.

278
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,768
Gojin, this is your house. Ta-da.

279
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:08,268
This is my house?

280
00:21:08,858 --> 00:21:09,858
What do you think?

281
00:21:11,398 --> 00:21:13,108
It's so huge.

282
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:16,448
This is really my house?

283
00:21:16,528 --> 00:21:18,318
Yes. Do you like it?

284
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:22,038
Of course. It's so nice.

285
00:21:25,748 --> 00:21:26,868
What's that?

286
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,128
Oh!

287
00:21:32,298 --> 00:21:34,798
I prepared a special gift
just for you, honey.

288
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:39,258
Ta-da!

289
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,888
It's a talisman that blocks all bad luck.

290
00:21:48,148 --> 00:21:52,228
I was so distressed
since such bad things happened to you.

291
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:54,318
Nothing bad will ever happen again.

292
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:56,448
This talisman will block--

293
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:57,988
What's wrong?

294
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,988
My head hurts so much all of a sudden.

295
00:22:02,578 --> 00:22:05,158
Maybe you've exhausted yourself.
Get some rest now.

296
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,208
That talisman is so effective.

297
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:17,798
Let me take them.

298
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:21,798
How is your leg?

299
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:23,388
It's okay.

300
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,768
How about your arms?
Don't they hurt from using crutches?

301
00:22:27,768 --> 00:22:28,768
Are you hungry?

302
00:22:29,938 --> 00:22:30,768
I'm okay.

303
00:22:32,858 --> 00:22:35,898
Since you're taking such good care of him,
I have nothing to worry about.

304
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,568
I'm so relieved
that Gojin's with such a good person.

305
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,948
I'll get going now.

306
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:45,988
You're leaving already?

307
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:47,658
I have a lot of work to do.

308
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:51,288
Please support him well at work tomorrow,

309
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,208
so his amnesia isn't found out.

310
00:22:53,838 --> 00:22:54,668
Will do.

311
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,958
Gojin, rest well.

312
00:22:59,258 --> 00:23:01,428
I'll walk Mr. Oh out.

313
00:24:34,638 --> 00:24:36,148
Excuse me…

314
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:38,728
What…

315
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,568
are you doing?

316
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,208
Are you up, honey?

317
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:02,918
Isn't it fresh?

318
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:05,628
I heard mackerel is good for you.

319
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:07,508
High in Omega-3.

320
00:26:01,188 --> 00:26:02,068
What are you doing?

321
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,858
Nothing…

322
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,278
Honey, let's eat.

323
00:26:14,618 --> 00:26:15,618
Go ahead and eat.

324
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:18,158
You really love fish, you know?

325
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:32,678
What's wrong?

326
00:26:33,638 --> 00:26:34,718
What's wrong?

327
00:26:36,518 --> 00:26:38,058
What's wrong, honey?

328
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:46,278
Honey, are you all right?

329
00:26:47,068 --> 00:26:50,528
I wonder why you feel so sick.
You used to really love fish.

330
00:26:51,358 --> 00:26:53,318
Did you eat something rotten
without telling me?

331
00:26:59,248 --> 00:27:02,208
Even though he lost his memories,
he still hates fish so much.

332
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,248
His body can still remember things.

333
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:10,508
Honey, I'll go get some medicine.
Just wait a little, okay?

334
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,728
That feels great.

335
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,738
That was so funny.

336
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:38,908
Ms. Lee Sina.

337
00:27:42,998 --> 00:27:44,328
ENJOY T BEER

338
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:46,918
Ms. Lee Sina.

339
00:27:50,258 --> 00:27:52,178
You should prepare yourself.

340
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,338
You're at the final stage.

341
00:27:55,678 --> 00:27:56,678
Ms. Lee Sina.

342
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:01,938
You should prepare yourself.

343
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:03,688
You're at the final stage.

344
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:06,978
Ms. Lee Sina.

345
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:13,448
You should prepare yourself.

346
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:15,368
-You're at the final stage.
-Ms. Lee Sina.

347
00:28:15,448 --> 00:28:16,618
-Ms. Lee Sina.
-Ms. Lee Sina.

348
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:19,448
-You should prepare yourself.
-You should prepare yourself.

349
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:21,328
-You're at the final stage.
-You're at the final stage.

350
00:28:45,188 --> 00:28:47,478
Hey, are you all right?

351
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:55,858
I don't understand why
I'm acting crazy like this either.

352
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,288
But I can't just die like this.

353
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:06,208
I just feel so frustrated.

354
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:29,688
How is your stomach? Is it better now?

355
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:39,158
But you used to really love mackerel.
I wonder what happened.

356
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:41,828
Let's try eating them again later.

357
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:44,078
Grilled mackerel.

358
00:30:01,848 --> 00:30:04,848
NOH GOJIN
TOP INSTRUCTOR IN THE UNIVERSE

359
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:07,848
Mr. Noh, you're here.

360
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:10,098
Hello.

361
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,818
-Pardon?
-Good morning.

362
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,278
Yes…

363
00:30:16,028 --> 00:30:16,858
Let's go, sir.

364
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:19,658
Have a good day.

365
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:20,908
Okay.

366
00:30:32,628 --> 00:30:33,918
Thank you for your hard work.

367
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:41,638
M-Me?

368
00:30:43,098 --> 00:30:44,718
Have a great day.

369
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,058
After you.

370
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:57,238
Did I hear that wrong?

371
00:30:57,738 --> 00:30:59,528
Did Mr. Noh Manners just say hello to me?

372
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,698
What the heck is going on?

373
00:31:00,778 --> 00:31:02,068
Have a good day.

374
00:31:02,158 --> 00:31:03,278
-You too.
-Thank you.

375
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:07,788
MS. GONG
NEW MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

376
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:13,248
EUNHEE
NEW MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

377
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:16,878
SORA
NEW MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

378
00:31:17,128 --> 00:31:17,958
Pardon me.

379
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:19,628
I'll be right back.

380
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,088
NEW SCHOOL YEAR
GOTOP STUDY GUIDE

381
00:31:22,178 --> 00:31:24,798
MR. NOH MANNERS CAME TO WORK!

382
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:26,348
Mr. Noh Manners came to work.

383
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:49,118
Hello.

384
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:53,668
Hello.

385
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:55,538
What's with him?

386
00:31:56,628 --> 00:31:57,458
Did he just…

387
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,758
Hello.

388
00:32:15,938 --> 00:32:16,768
I can take them.

389
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:29,448
How is it?

390
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:31,948
Good.

391
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:37,378
Do you… remember anything?

392
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:39,548
No.

393
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:49,218
Good morning.

394
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:50,218
Hello.

395
00:32:52,058 --> 00:32:53,678
How does it feel to be back at work?

396
00:32:54,478 --> 00:32:55,898
Does it feel a bit familiar to you?

397
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,648
I'm not sure yet.

398
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:04,488
By the way,
why are you suddenly using honorifics?

399
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:05,698
Because we're at work.

400
00:33:05,778 --> 00:33:08,618
We should set aside
any personal relations, Mr. Noh.

401
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:13,118
You'll get used to this place soon enough.

402
00:33:13,198 --> 00:33:14,078
And…

403
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:17,748
here is your new phone.

404
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:19,918
Thank you.

405
00:33:20,838 --> 00:33:24,338
The interview will take place
an hour from now on the rooftop.

406
00:33:25,008 --> 00:33:28,588
I think the fully open space will
make you feel less nervous.

407
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:31,218
Are you nervous?

408
00:33:32,518 --> 00:33:33,348
No.

409
00:33:39,938 --> 00:33:43,568
Mr. Noh, I can't believe
what happened to you.

410
00:33:44,438 --> 00:33:47,608
When I heard the news, I really felt
like the world was coming to an end.

411
00:33:49,448 --> 00:33:50,828
Mr. Kim Chabae.

412
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:52,908
Born in 1976.

413
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,658
Graduated from Yeonseo University.
Taught at a science high school.

414
00:33:56,748 --> 00:33:58,418
Recruited in 2019.

415
00:33:58,998 --> 00:34:00,748
Wife, ten years younger,
and four daughters.

416
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,208
Two months ago…

417
00:34:05,968 --> 00:34:08,338
your widowed mother passed away
due to a chronic illness.

418
00:34:13,058 --> 00:34:14,598
I'm so moved.

419
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:18,638
I never knew that you cared

420
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:21,518
so much about me, Mr. Noh.

421
00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:26,278
I can memorize that
just by glancing at the profile.

422
00:34:27,948 --> 00:34:29,358
Mr. Kim, don't you need to go?

423
00:34:30,908 --> 00:34:34,328
But Mr. Noh came back.
Nothing else matters.

424
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:38,368
But Mr. Noh needs to prepare
for his interview. Let's all go.

425
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:39,918
Sir, please come with me.

426
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:41,128
Oh, wait!

427
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:42,038
Wait.

428
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:46,548
You couldn't recover data
from my previous phone?

429
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:50,258
No, it was impossible since it was
heavily damaged during the accident.

430
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:54,758
Why do you ask?

431
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:58,268
I wanted to look for my engagement photos.

432
00:34:59,138 --> 00:34:59,978
Engagement…

433
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,308
photos?

434
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:05,778
Pardon me.

435
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:08,318
Sir, did you get engaged?

436
00:35:09,898 --> 00:35:12,868
Yes. You should say hello.

437
00:35:16,578 --> 00:35:17,698
She's my fiancée.

438
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,378
Fiancée?

439
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,968
How is that possible?

440
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:35,638
Is it true?

441
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:39,558
Yes.

442
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,518
No wonder Ms. Lee
managed to stay on for a year.

443
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:45,358
All the other secretaries
left after three months.

444
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:48,988
That's because they liked each other.

445
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,108
Well…

446
00:35:52,028 --> 00:35:55,028
Can you not say anything?
It'll just cause unnecessary trouble.

447
00:35:55,118 --> 00:35:59,578
Of course.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.

448
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:01,538
You have nothing to worry about.

449
00:36:13,468 --> 00:36:15,468
Why, hello, sir.

450
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,718
You've been through so much.

451
00:36:20,268 --> 00:36:21,348
Nice to meet you.

452
00:36:22,268 --> 00:36:24,308
-We look forward to working with you.
-Likewise.

453
00:36:24,728 --> 00:36:27,058
Could you please
face the camera for a photo?

454
00:36:30,818 --> 00:36:32,358
Smile, please.

455
00:36:32,448 --> 00:36:33,858
Thank you.

456
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,118
That's good.

457
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:48,128
I'll do it for you.

458
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,718
-Please have some water.
-Thank you.

459
00:37:00,258 --> 00:37:02,598
-Thank you.
-Fresh fruit juice for me, please.

460
00:37:03,428 --> 00:37:05,978
Sorry, but we don't have fresh juice.

461
00:37:06,148 --> 00:37:08,978
Then please get it for me. Thank you.

462
00:37:10,568 --> 00:37:12,148
I guess he really likes fresh juice.

463
00:37:13,818 --> 00:37:14,698
Yes, sir.

464
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:18,868
You injured your leg.
Was it troublesome to come here?

465
00:37:18,948 --> 00:37:20,488
-Not at all.
-Were you all right?

466
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:49,058
My goodness. Look who's here.

467
00:37:50,188 --> 00:37:51,318
Hello.

468
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:57,148
It's harder to see you
than the President of this country.

469
00:37:58,988 --> 00:37:59,818
Excuse me.

470
00:38:01,658 --> 00:38:03,578
I heard that you're looking after Mr. Noh.

471
00:38:05,198 --> 00:38:09,168
Does that mean
you start work at his house?

472
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:12,838
-Yes.
-Gosh.

473
00:38:13,588 --> 00:38:16,128
You used to put together binders,

474
00:38:16,218 --> 00:38:18,628
but out of the blue,
you became the chosen one.

475
00:38:20,218 --> 00:38:21,098
Oh, no!

476
00:38:22,048 --> 00:38:23,308
Are you upset?

477
00:38:23,848 --> 00:38:26,888
I'm just envious.

478
00:38:29,688 --> 00:38:32,818
Now you even glare at me.

479
00:38:33,568 --> 00:38:36,398
You used to just smile
no matter what I said.

480
00:38:37,488 --> 00:38:41,068
Your attitude has changed
now that you've been chosen by Mr. Noh.

481
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:44,078
How can you change so easily?

482
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:50,208
Well then, I'll see you later.

483
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:53,788
-Let's go.
-Yes, ma'am.

484
00:38:57,798 --> 00:38:58,798
It's okay.

485
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,008
Stay calm, Lee Sina.

486
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:04,758
I just need revenge on Noh Gojin.

487
00:39:06,768 --> 00:39:07,598
Ms. Ma.

488
00:39:09,888 --> 00:39:10,768
What do you want?

489
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:13,898
Can we talk for a second?

490
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,148
-Go ahead first.
-Yes, ma'am.

491
00:39:18,778 --> 00:39:19,738
Let's go.

492
00:39:26,988 --> 00:39:28,248
Is she making me follow her?

493
00:39:34,128 --> 00:39:35,288
What do you want?

494
00:39:36,298 --> 00:39:38,878
You're the chosen one.

495
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:41,128
A lowly person like me--

496
00:39:42,718 --> 00:39:43,588
What was that for?

497
00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:45,548
I'm dying anyway. I can take you down too.

498
00:39:45,638 --> 00:39:46,638
Have you lost your mind?

499
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:50,268
If you humiliate me again,
I won't let you slide so easily.

500
00:39:50,848 --> 00:39:51,688
What?

501
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:54,358
When did I humiliate you?

502
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:57,728
You said I was the chosen one.
I recorded you saying that.

503
00:39:58,818 --> 00:40:00,608
Should I let Mr. Noh listen to it?

504
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,408
I know why you hate me, Ms. Ma.

505
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:10,038
It's because I refused to report

506
00:40:10,328 --> 00:40:12,368
Mr. Noh's daily whereabouts to you,
isn't it?

507
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,878
What are you talking about?

508
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,918
It's because you're terrible at your job.

509
00:40:18,998 --> 00:40:21,508
The number one rule as a secretary.

510
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,878
All matters regarding the CEO
must be kept confidential.

511
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:27,178
I'm going to continue
to abide by that rule.

512
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:29,888
And don't talk down to me.

513
00:40:31,018 --> 00:40:32,688
Or else, I'll do the same to you.

514
00:40:33,268 --> 00:40:34,768
You've really lost your mind.

515
00:40:35,228 --> 00:40:36,648
You're a mere temp.

516
00:40:36,978 --> 00:40:40,648
I'll make sure
that you never get to work here at Gotop.

517
00:40:40,728 --> 00:40:43,148
No, I'll kick you out of this industry.

518
00:40:43,238 --> 00:40:45,158
Sure, do as you wish.

519
00:40:48,618 --> 00:40:49,738
"Do as you wish"?

520
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:51,698
Hey!

521
00:40:52,288 --> 00:40:54,158
You just spoke down to me too!

522
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,498
I should've recorded her too.

523
00:41:01,338 --> 00:41:03,088
Well, how are you doing?

524
00:41:04,678 --> 00:41:07,428
My leg feels a bit uncomfortable,
but I'm all right otherwise.

525
00:41:07,928 --> 00:41:11,268
Many people were surprised
watching the news.

526
00:41:11,348 --> 00:41:14,098
Can you describe the situation
at the time of the accident?

527
00:41:15,438 --> 00:41:16,438
Well…

528
00:41:24,188 --> 00:41:28,158
A car suddenly rushed toward me
in front of my vacation house.

529
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:30,198
Then I became unconscious

530
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:32,748
and woke up in the hospital.

531
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,078
The culprit is still out there.

532
00:41:36,498 --> 00:41:37,958
How do you feel right now?

533
00:41:40,038 --> 00:41:41,958
I believe that he'll get caught soon

534
00:41:42,338 --> 00:41:44,338
since the police are
investigating the matter.

535
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,758
Do you remember anything
about the culprit?

536
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:51,968
I'm not so sure.

537
00:41:58,268 --> 00:41:59,308
What's the matter?

538
00:42:00,148 --> 00:42:02,318
-Mr. Noh Gojin. Wait.
-I can't… I can't breathe…

539
00:42:02,398 --> 00:42:04,028
-Mr. Noh…
-Sir.

540
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:05,398
-Sir!
-Please call an ambulance.

541
00:42:05,488 --> 00:42:06,698
Please request help now!

542
00:42:06,778 --> 00:42:07,698
Call an ambulance.

543
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,618
Are you all right, sir?

544
00:42:09,698 --> 00:42:11,698
Mr. Noh!

545
00:42:12,328 --> 00:42:13,198
Are you all right?

546
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,198
Mr. Noh!

547
00:42:38,938 --> 00:42:39,938
Are you okay?

548
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:49,608
Ms. Lee went to get some medicine for now.

549
00:42:50,608 --> 00:42:53,118
Are you sure
you don't need to go to the hospital?

550
00:42:54,078 --> 00:42:55,908
I think I'm okay.

551
00:42:59,748 --> 00:43:02,128
What happened to the interview?

552
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:04,088
The interview isn't what matters.

553
00:43:05,748 --> 00:43:08,668
I guess I ruined it.

554
00:43:10,008 --> 00:43:13,888
It's okay.
Reporter Park was totally understanding.

555
00:43:16,098 --> 00:43:17,348
Segi.

556
00:43:19,018 --> 00:43:20,268
I'm sorry.

557
00:43:21,648 --> 00:43:24,358
No. I'm the one who's sorry.

558
00:43:25,768 --> 00:43:29,028
You're still not well
and I rushed you into it.

559
00:43:35,328 --> 00:43:38,038
Mr. Noh! Oh my gosh!

560
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:41,458
I can't believe this. My goodness!

561
00:43:41,748 --> 00:43:42,878
Are you all right?

562
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:49,258
You don't know how shocked I was
when I heard that you collapsed.

563
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,718
Ms. Ma Eunjung. The top research assistant

564
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:53,468
of Noh Gojin's research team.
Born in 1983.

565
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,218
Majored in math. Hired three years ago.

566
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:57,808
Nickname,
"The Devil only wears luxury." To note.

567
00:43:59,058 --> 00:43:59,888
Divorced.

568
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:01,308
Devil?

569
00:44:02,438 --> 00:44:03,688
And 190.

570
00:44:03,768 --> 00:44:04,648
What's 190?

571
00:44:05,558 --> 00:44:08,858
Gosh, you spilled something on your dress.
That's terrible.

572
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,948
An unruly cat did it.

573
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,068
Don't worry.

574
00:44:16,658 --> 00:44:18,078
I plan to kick her out.

575
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,198
Pardon?

576
00:44:21,078 --> 00:44:23,418
Just really cute cats!

577
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:28,338
Mr. Noh, we have an entrance exam
information session in three days.

578
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:30,258
I'm so glad that you seem all right.

579
00:44:30,338 --> 00:44:31,918
Entrance exam…

580
00:44:32,758 --> 00:44:34,128
information session?

581
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:37,178
-You startled me.
-Insane! Did you hear?

582
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,138
-About what?
-Mr. Noh Manners collapsed.

583
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,978
I heard that he had a convulsion
and was shaking all over.

584
00:44:42,728 --> 00:44:45,058
Gosh, Mr. Noh Manners must be really ill.

585
00:44:45,148 --> 00:44:47,018
He shouldn't be going around
with a broken leg.

586
00:44:48,148 --> 00:44:50,478
What's wrong? Why are you so angry?

587
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:53,528
You like Mr. Noh Manners, don't you?

588
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:57,318
You're always trying
to curry favor with Mr. Noh Manners.

589
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,658
What are you talking about?

590
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:04,208
But really, why are you so angry?

591
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:06,038
The entrance exam information session.

592
00:45:06,118 --> 00:45:07,578
What about it?

593
00:45:07,668 --> 00:45:09,628
Because of Mr. Noh Manners' accident,

594
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,628
the presentation for the session
with Ms. Shin Jinyoung got postponed.

595
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:15,428
What would've happened
if Mr. Noh Manners wasn't discharged?

596
00:45:15,508 --> 00:45:18,388
He would've just winged it
without the presentation.

597
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:20,758
Right? I'm correct, aren't I?

598
00:45:20,848 --> 00:45:22,178
Forget it. Stop already.

599
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:24,888
Stop what? It's because
of the information session.

600
00:45:24,978 --> 00:45:26,478
Gosh, what's wrong with him?

601
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:31,068
-Mr. Noh Manners collapsed?
-Mr. Noh Manners collapsed?

602
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,778
Well… That's--

603
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:35,988
That's right.

604
00:45:36,488 --> 00:45:39,528
The entrance exam
information session for 2023.

605
00:45:39,618 --> 00:45:42,288
When we announced it two months ago,

606
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:45,078
the tickets were sold out in one day.

607
00:45:45,748 --> 00:45:48,038
The parents complained so much,

608
00:45:48,128 --> 00:45:52,048
so you decided
to do live streaming as well.

609
00:45:52,128 --> 00:45:53,378
Ms. Ma--

610
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:54,548
Honestly,

611
00:45:56,428 --> 00:45:58,758
when I heard about your accident,

612
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:05,598
I was very concerned
about your online classes and other shows.

613
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,398
But what worried me the most

614
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,768
was the entrance exam information session.

615
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:14,068
As you know,
the entrance exam information session

616
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:15,898
is the cream of the crop.

617
00:46:16,488 --> 00:46:20,238
My goodness. I'm sorry, sir.

618
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,448
I'll run the entrance exam
information session this time.

619
00:46:23,538 --> 00:46:25,908
Pardon? What do you mean?

620
00:46:26,498 --> 00:46:27,618
But…

621
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:32,168
parents all over the country
are coming here to see Mr. Noh.

622
00:46:32,418 --> 00:46:35,628
On top of it,
we're also doing live streaming this time.

623
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:38,758
No way.

624
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:42,678
Mr. Noh has to do it no matter what.

625
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,098
What you're saying is right,
but Mr. Noh's health is--

626
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:46,598
Then…

627
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:53,108
Mr. Noh…

628
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,358
just needs to do the closing.

629
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:02,028
The top instructors
for each subject present first

630
00:47:02,118 --> 00:47:04,828
and Mr. Noh just comes on the stage…

631
00:47:07,618 --> 00:47:08,578
at the very end.

632
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:13,838
My goodness. I feel so moved
just thinking about it.

633
00:47:15,048 --> 00:47:16,918
-But--
-I'll do it.

634
00:47:21,388 --> 00:47:22,638
I'll do it.

635
00:47:23,218 --> 00:47:24,218
Yes, sir.

636
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:28,178
I'll have everything ready

637
00:47:28,268 --> 00:47:32,848
so that you don't jeopardize your health.

638
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,448
Even though you're unwell,

639
00:47:44,408 --> 00:47:45,408
you still look great.

640
00:48:07,848 --> 00:48:10,018
The entrance exam information session
must be successful,

641
00:48:10,848 --> 00:48:13,768
so that I can captivate
Mr. Noh Manners' heart.

642
00:48:14,398 --> 00:48:15,398
After that,

643
00:48:16,938 --> 00:48:19,938
I'll kick out Lee Sina whatever it takes.

644
00:48:22,148 --> 00:48:23,658
How dare she challenge me?

645
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:26,448
Darn it!

646
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:29,538
Get to work.

647
00:48:30,578 --> 00:48:31,578
I said, get to work.

648
00:48:32,158 --> 00:48:33,038
Yes, ma'am.

649
00:48:38,378 --> 00:48:39,548
Lee Sina.

650
00:48:40,088 --> 00:48:43,968
I'll make sure
you never set foot in this industry.

651
00:48:54,638 --> 00:48:55,688
Lee Sina.

652
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:56,978
LEE SINA

653
00:48:57,058 --> 00:48:58,068
Lee Sina.

654
00:48:59,018 --> 00:49:00,028
Lee Sina.

655
00:49:01,028 --> 00:49:02,438
You're dead meat, Lee Sina.

656
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:20,208
Lock it.

657
00:49:23,008 --> 00:49:25,508
I heard Mr. Noh Manners collapsed.

658
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,008
I heard that he was
having a convulsion like this.

659
00:49:29,098 --> 00:49:32,138
Gosh, that's too bad.
I didn't get to see him hurt.

660
00:49:32,218 --> 00:49:34,808
I ran over here to see him suffer.

661
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,308
I know.

662
00:49:36,388 --> 00:49:41,018
By the way, is it true
that someone hit him on purpose?

663
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,858
Yes, it is. He had a convulsion
while talking about the culprit.

664
00:49:45,488 --> 00:49:46,488
Astounding.

665
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:50,618
But why haven't they caught the culprit?

666
00:49:50,698 --> 00:49:54,288
There are so many surveillance cameras
around his vacation house.

667
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:00,338
I destroyed them.

668
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:04,458
I destroyed all the surveillance cameras.

669
00:50:19,938 --> 00:50:22,318
That day, I went there
to take revenge on him.

670
00:50:22,688 --> 00:50:24,858
I failed the interview again.

671
00:50:29,278 --> 00:50:30,568
I couldn't hold back my anger.

672
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,578
I wanted to dunk
his vacation house in pig poop.

673
00:50:45,628 --> 00:50:48,928
So, did you see the culprit?

674
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,258
-No.
-Jeez.

675
00:50:55,638 --> 00:50:56,518
Will I get arrested?

676
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:59,188
Why would you get arrested?
You're not the hit-and-run driver.

677
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:01,348
I threw pig feces all over,

678
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:03,688
spray-painted the surveillance cameras,

679
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:05,188
and broke all the lights too.

680
00:51:05,568 --> 00:51:07,188
That's why
they couldn't catch the culprit.

681
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:11,778
Hey, no one can criticize us.

682
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:15,948
Think about all the insults
and humiliation we suffered under him.

683
00:51:16,038 --> 00:51:17,498
It's a miracle we didn't get cancer.

684
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:18,908
You're right.

685
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:23,668
I did see that woman.

686
00:51:24,338 --> 00:51:25,298
-Who?
-Who?

687
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,188
-Secretary Lee.
-Ms. Lee?

688
00:51:46,018 --> 00:51:47,438
That clumsy girl?

689
00:51:47,528 --> 00:51:48,488
Yes.

690
00:51:49,188 --> 00:51:53,028
Why did Ms. Lee go to his vacation house
in the middle of the night?

691
00:51:54,618 --> 00:51:55,528
I'm not sure.

692
00:51:57,078 --> 00:52:00,618
Maybe the reason
that she didn't get fired for a year

693
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:02,708
is because
there's something going on between them?

694
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:07,048
Right?

695
00:52:07,628 --> 00:52:10,668
What? Nonsense. No way.

696
00:52:10,758 --> 00:52:13,338
Mr. Noh Manners isn't blind.

697
00:52:13,428 --> 00:52:18,178
I'll eat my hat
if there's something between them.

698
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:19,518
-You're right.
-Jeez.

699
00:52:20,098 --> 00:52:21,768
-Of course not.
-Right.

700
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:17,278
GOTOP EDUCATION
ENTRANCE EXAM INFORMATION SESSION VEHICLE

701
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,238
-Seoul Station, please.
-Yes, sir.

702
00:53:23,828 --> 00:53:26,788
Is something going on here today?
Why is it so crowded?

703
00:53:26,878 --> 00:53:29,748
Who's that famous instructor
who comes on TV shows…

704
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:30,838
Right, Noh Gojin.

705
00:53:30,918 --> 00:53:33,548
It's so popular when he holds
an entrance exam information session.

706
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:35,088
Oh, I see.

707

ENTRANCE EXAM INFORMATION SESSION

708
00:54:04,788 --> 00:54:07,498
I'm English instructor Michelle Lee.

709
00:54:22,758 --> 00:54:26,178
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

710
00:54:34,528 --> 00:54:37,028
Let me fix your tie, sir.

711
00:54:43,278 --> 00:54:44,488
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

712
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:48,328
You're okay, right?

713
00:54:51,918 --> 00:54:53,878
Would you like some coffee?

714
00:55:01,848 --> 00:55:02,848
Here you go.

715
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:11,898
This coffee is lukewarm.

716
00:55:12,558 --> 00:55:14,108
I cooled it down on purpose.

717
00:55:14,188 --> 00:55:16,478
You really like lukewarm coffee, honey.

718
00:55:19,528 --> 00:55:22,738
I didn't know I liked lukewarm coffee.

719
00:55:22,818 --> 00:55:26,118
Of course. It's your favorite.

720
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:27,498
I see.

721
00:55:29,498 --> 00:55:30,538
That's the case.

ILPUM EDU CEO PARK YANGTAE

723

ILPUM EDU CEO PARK YANGTAE

724
00:55:59,278 --> 00:56:03,108
DON'T WORRY ABOUT MY BOWEL MOVEMENTS
AND MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!

725
00:56:03,198 --> 00:56:05,198
BEWARE OF DOGS AND CARS!

726
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,908
My goodness, Mr. Noh.

727
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:10,908
I was so shocked
after hearing what happened to you.

728
00:56:10,998 --> 00:56:14,828
It's human nature to be sympathetic.
I couldn't just ignore it, you know?

729
00:56:14,918 --> 00:56:19,918
My upright character wouldn't allow that
unlike Mr. Noh Manners.

730
00:56:20,008 --> 00:56:23,888
Also, as you're aware,
I'm the chairman of PEDG.

731
00:56:23,968 --> 00:56:27,638
A member of the Private Education
Development Group was in a bad accident.

732
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,218
I had to come visit. Isn't that right?

733
00:56:29,888 --> 00:56:33,438
Wow, it feels like yesterday
that you were a janitor at my company,

734
00:56:33,518 --> 00:56:36,148
but now you're a member of PEDG.
Isn't that amazing?

735
00:56:36,228 --> 00:56:38,608
Wow, seriously. If it wasn't for me,

736
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:41,608
you'd still be a thug cleaning trash cans.

737
00:56:41,688 --> 00:56:44,318
I'm the one
who made you who you are today.

738
00:56:44,408 --> 00:56:46,318
I saved your life!

739
00:56:49,868 --> 00:56:50,698
Where did he go?

740
00:56:51,498 --> 00:56:53,248
I would like some fresh juice.

741
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,288
The chairman of PEDG!

742
00:56:58,378 --> 00:56:59,628
You're still here.

743
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:01,418
Would you like some juice too?

744
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:12,098
Then, just one glass, please.

745
00:57:13,228 --> 00:57:14,058
Okay.

746
00:57:27,818 --> 00:57:30,828
SANGAN KARAOKE

747
00:57:32,748 --> 00:57:36,368
-Gosh, I don't have anything left.
-Jeez, how much did I lose?

748
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:38,288
Come over here.

749
00:57:38,378 --> 00:57:39,498
-Over here.
-Hello.

750
00:57:40,168 --> 00:57:42,258
-Whose is it?
-I won again!

751
00:57:42,338 --> 00:57:45,378
-Gosh!
-I'm lucky today.

752
00:57:45,468 --> 00:57:47,388
-Lucky day.
-Here we go.

753
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,468
-Gosh, what's going on today?
-Give me a cigarette.

754
00:57:57,018 --> 00:57:58,648
-Sir, please come again.
-Okay.

755
00:57:59,188 --> 00:58:00,478
-Goodbye.
-All right!

756
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,318
-This is so fun.
-Jeez.

757
00:58:02,898 --> 00:58:05,148
Try this one.

758
00:58:05,528 --> 00:58:07,778
-Here we go.
-Keep going.

759
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:11,198
I keep getting bad cards.
Let me do better this time.

760
00:58:15,788 --> 00:58:16,708
Go ahead.

761
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:23,298
-All-in.
-All-in.

762
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,428
I'm sorry in advance.

763
00:58:29,928 --> 00:58:31,758
-All-in call.
-All-in call.

764
00:58:33,008 --> 00:58:34,308
-Forfeit.
-Fold.

765
00:58:34,768 --> 00:58:35,598
Please show your cards.

766
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:42,858
-Gosh, I apologize.
-King-ten flush.

767
00:58:47,278 --> 00:58:48,818
Flush by ace.

768
00:58:50,488 --> 00:58:51,488
All right.

769
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:55,828
You scumbags!

770
00:58:55,908 --> 00:58:58,248
You cheated! I know it!

771
00:58:58,328 --> 00:59:00,418
-Darn you!
-What's going on?

772
00:59:00,498 --> 00:59:02,038
-Get him out of here!
-Wait!

773
00:59:02,128 --> 00:59:03,168
SANGAN KARAOKE

774
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,748
Get lost!

775
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:10,178
Sir, it's not like that. Sir!

776
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,018
You scumbags!

777
00:59:20,138 --> 00:59:22,518
You throw me out
after taking all my money?

778
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:27,358
I'm going to report you
to the police, you scumbags!

779
00:59:28,778 --> 00:59:30,108
Those scumbags.

780
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:28,708
You scumbag!

781
01:00:50,568 --> 01:00:53,858
NO CALLER ID

782
01:00:53,948 --> 01:01:00,948
I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE

783
01:01:01,038 --> 01:01:06,538
RUN AWAY QUICKLY
NOH GOJIN HAS AMNESIA

784
01:01:06,628 --> 01:01:08,038
Amnesia?

785
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:48,668
Ms. Sina?

786
01:01:53,298 --> 01:01:54,128
Hello.

787
01:02:45,598 --> 01:02:48,978
I wanted to thank you again,
but I had to come back to Seoul suddenly.

788
01:02:49,058 --> 01:02:50,148
I felt so sad.

789
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:53,228
I thought about you too
when I got my dress back.

790
01:02:54,478 --> 01:02:58,738
This must be fate
for us to meet again like this.

791
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:00,408
I was so surprised.

792
01:03:00,488 --> 01:03:02,488
I can't believe I ran into you here.

793
01:03:03,118 --> 01:03:03,948
Me too.

794
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:07,538
But what brings you here?

795
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:10,038
My company is holding
an entrance exam information session.

796
01:03:10,498 --> 01:03:12,748
I see. By any chance,

797
01:03:13,378 --> 01:03:15,338
do you work at Gotop Education?

798
01:03:15,628 --> 01:03:17,168
-Yes, I do.
-My goodness.

799
01:03:17,968 --> 01:03:19,048
Are you an instructor?

800
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:22,348
No. Not yet.

801
01:03:22,428 --> 01:03:24,638
Then you'll become an instructor someday.

802
01:03:26,808 --> 01:03:27,808
Yes, someday.

803
01:03:29,808 --> 01:03:33,308
I also came to attend
that entrance exam information session.

804
01:03:33,728 --> 01:03:35,318
I heard that Mr. Noh Gojin's

805
01:03:35,898 --> 01:03:39,568
entrance exam information session
is the most famous.

806
01:03:40,068 --> 01:03:43,618
I heard that it's a must
if you want to send your kids to college.

807
01:03:44,578 --> 01:03:47,868
You look too young to have kids
that are in high school.

808
01:03:50,158 --> 01:03:51,328
Thank you.

809
01:03:51,788 --> 01:03:55,878
But I think I'll have more kids now.

810
01:03:56,548 --> 01:03:57,378
Pardon?

811
01:04:11,728 --> 01:04:12,768
Who are you?

812
01:04:16,568 --> 01:04:18,528
Does he really have amnesia?

813
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:21,278
Do you know me?

814
01:04:25,318 --> 01:04:26,328
No.

815
01:04:27,368 --> 01:04:28,198
I don't.

816
01:04:28,788 --> 01:04:33,708
I think I got the wrong room. I'm sorry.

817
01:04:33,788 --> 01:04:34,788
Wait.

818
01:04:44,218 --> 01:04:46,388
You look very familiar.

819
01:04:47,348 --> 01:04:50,058
Do we know each other by any chance?

820
01:04:51,478 --> 01:04:52,308
No.

821
01:04:56,228 --> 01:04:58,318
KANG MIN
FROM INCHEON TO BUENOS AIRES

822
01:04:58,398 --> 01:05:00,358
Buenos Aires.

823
01:05:01,068 --> 01:05:02,698
Are you going on a trip?

824
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:05,818
Or…

825
01:05:06,408 --> 01:05:08,118
are you running away?

826
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:12,828
I mean…

827
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:16,208
you're trembling so much.

828
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:19,748
As if… you've done something wrong.

829
01:05:29,388 --> 01:05:31,718
It seems like you're going through a lot.

830
01:05:33,978 --> 01:05:35,688
Can I tell you something funny?

831
01:05:43,818 --> 01:05:44,948
The thing is…

832
01:05:46,658 --> 01:05:47,988
that people think

833
01:05:48,818 --> 01:05:52,328
anyone can have amnesia
like catching a cold.

834
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:56,248
They watch too many soaps.

835
01:05:57,748 --> 01:06:00,088
Amnesia is so common in those shows.

836
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:04,968
Do you think so too, sir?

837
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:14,178
You punk.

838
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:18,478
You've watched too many soaps.

839
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:24,738
Kang Min, you gambling addict.

840
01:06:26,278 --> 01:06:27,658
Does it still look like…

841
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:30,828
I have amnesia to you?

842
01:07:24,088 --> 01:07:25,918
