1
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,970
CRAZY LOVE

2
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,950
CRAZY LOVE

3
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,290
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,420
Excuse me…

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,340
Please put me down.

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,170
EPISODE 10

7
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,350
Will it leave a scar?

8
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,730
No, I treated it well, so don't worry.

9
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,480
-Can you hold yourself to that?
-Sorry?

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,820
She also got burned from coffee
yesterday. How about this?

11
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,030
I see. It looks all right.

12
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,040
You just need to apply ointment
for a few days.

13
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,610
Do you want to hold my hand and walk

14
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,230
or be carried like earlier?

15
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,090
You may leave early today.

16
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,300
It's because I'm not fine with it.

17
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,550
You know how messy
my bedroom is right now, right?

18
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,970
Please leave early and clean it all up.

19
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,810
If you don't like it,
pay off your debt soon.

20
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,770
Until then, you have no way out.

21
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,150
-And…
-What else?

22
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,400
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,240
It was hasty of me to say

24
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,240
you stole something.

25
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,920
-Hello.
-Hello.

26
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,530
-Ms. Gong!
-Ms. Gong, it's been so long!

27
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,450
My goodness. So is Mr. Noh Manners hurt?

28
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,330
No way! Ms. Lee was the one who got hurt.

29
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,660
My gosh. I heard
she practically threw herself

30
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,830
to save Mr. Noh.

31
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,090
If you guys harm Mr. Noh
in any way from now on,

32
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,260
I won't let it slide. Got that?

33
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,700
How is your injury?

34
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,490
It's all right.

35
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,170
I'll go in first.

36
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,930
Hello? Noh Gojin speaking.

37
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,390
-It's not easy to raise a child.
-Really.

38
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,270
-Of course not.
-Gosh.

39
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,640
Hello.

40
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,600
-Hello.
-Hello.

41
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,020
-Hello.
-Oh my, ma'am. It's been so long.

42
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,150
We should have a company dinner soon.

43
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,450
Our missus sang so well that night, right?

44
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,990
-Let's have a company dinner.
-Yes, let's.

45
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,660
-I'm so lonely
-I'm so lonely

46
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,250
-Tears roll down my cheeks
-Tears roll down my cheeks

47
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,330
She was amazing.

48
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,670
Let's sing a duet together.

49
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,080
-Gosh, it's okay.
-I'll do it.

50
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,590
I'm so lonely

51
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,590
A different version.

52
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,300
Tears roll down my cheeks

53
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,210
Hello, sir.

54
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,720
Seriously.

55
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,470
-Don't laugh.
-Pardon?

56
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,020
This is nice.

57
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,520
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

58
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,530
Good morning, sir.

59
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,660
We don't see you often lately.

60
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,660
You must be busy dating.

61
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,040
Mr. Kim Chabae,
I wonder what's keeping you so busy

62
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,170
that your subscriber count
has been stagnant.

63
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,920
Let me tell you this
since you like going to company dinners.

64
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,800
Other companies don't allow second
and third tiers to join the top, right?

65
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,140
Just as the runner-up
can't take the winner's seat,

66
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,220
if you're no longer the best,
you'll have to step down.

67
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,180
If you think you can be the top tomorrow
just because you're the top today,

68
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,020
that's a big mistake.

69
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,730
Also, teaching assistants,

70
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,400
are you getting to work just now?

71
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,080
Don't you know that you need to be here
an hour earlier and leave an hour later

72
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,870
than the instructors?

73
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,620
What good is such a lazy mindset?

74
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,120
And you call yourselves
Noh Gojin's teaching assistants?

75
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,670
Do you?

76
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,750
If I were you, I'd quit immediately
out of embarrassment.

77
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,980
The more I think about it,
Mr. Noh Manners makes me angry.

78
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,020
But you love Mr. Noh Manners so much.
What do you mean?

79
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,190
Did he say something?

80
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,450
Fine. Let's just eat.
We need to eat to survive.

81
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,120
Wait.

82
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,540
Hello?

83
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes.

84
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,010
Well, I can make myself available
for about 30 minutes today.

85
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,670
But let's meet here at Gotop.

86
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,180
How are you going to recruit me
if you're so chicken?

87
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,680
I don't care. Come if you want. Okay. Bye.

88
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,940
Why are you speaking
so rudely on the phone?

89
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,650
I don't have to be polite to them.

90
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,940
Who were you talking to?

91
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,270
Baek Edu.

92
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,940
There's no reason for me to be nice
to a new company like that.

93
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,410
You asked a Baek Edu scout
to come to Gotop?

94
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,870
Why would they come?
If they do, they're out of their mind.

95
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,750
But why aren't you meeting with Baek Edu?

96
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,750
You said they called you.

97
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,210
Oh, right.

98
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,550
I rejected them right off the bat.

99
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,050
I see. You rejected them. Huh.

100
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,390
What do you mean by "huh"?

101
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,720
I didn't mean anything by it.

102
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,390
I'm going to go get some coffee.
Iced Americano.

103
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,030
Did they call you too?

104
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,110
You mean, Baek Edu?

105
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,570
I rejected them right off the bat too.

106
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,030
That means…

107
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,700
only I didn't get a call?

108
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,340
Producer Kim isn't
answering his phone again.

109
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,590
Fine. You only want Noh Gojin, don't you?

110
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,430
You darn--

111
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,060
Hello.

112
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,070
I'm Baek Sooyeong, the CEO of Baek Edu.

113
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,370
I'm quite impressed
that you came all the way here to see me.

114
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,790
But I guess you couldn't figure out
my intention of saying what I said.

115
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,330
I didn't really mean for you to come here.

116
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,330
I was showing my devotion to Gotop.

117
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,340
Well, I'm trying to persuade you.

118
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,890
But I don't see a compelling reason why

119
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,310
I should go to a new company like Baek Edu

120
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,310
abandoning Gotop, the top company.

121
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,110
I'll give you what you want the most.

122
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,530
What? Money? Jeez.

123
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,190
I already have a lot of money.

124
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,780
Besides, any company will pay me a lot.

125
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,200
What Gotop can't give you,
we, Baek Edu, can.

126
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,120
What Gotop can't give me?

127
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,670
I doubt something like that even exists.

128
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,330
Your own

129
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,130
TV lectures on the QBC channel.

130
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,590
How does that sound?

131
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,970
Don't you want to become
the top instructor

132
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,510
recognized by not just your students,
but the entire country?

133
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,940
I'll wait for you in the lobby.

134
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,820
Hello.

135
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,580
What business do you have here, Ms. Baek?

136
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,330
I came to recruit some instructors.

137
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,710
You came to Gotop
to steal away my instructors?

138
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,880
Right under my nose?

139
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,670
Do you really think that's why I came?

140
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,010
Since you're here,

141
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,260
I came up with
whatever excuse I could to come.

142
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,560
But I don't think I can do this anymore.

143
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,270
I come to you, cling on, wait,

144
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,030
and beg for you to please remember me.

145
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,950
Even I think I've lost my mind.

146
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,780
So I…

147
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,080
plan to tell Ms. Sina

148
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,200
that you're my first love

149
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,710
and ask her to return you to me.

150
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,960
Look, Ms. Baek Sooyeong.

151
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,710
Are you worried
that your fiancée will be heartbroken?

152
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:14,010
Then, eat dinner with me just ten times.

153
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,180
It's Ms. Sina.

154
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,420
Hello, Ms. Sooyeong?

155
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,510
I called since I felt bad
after only saying hello earlier.

156
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,220
Yes, I did too.

157
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,520
Let's get a meal together next time.

158
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,230
Okay, sounds good.

159
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,200
Let's get going.

160
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,530
Yes, ma'am.

161
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,710
I wonder how Mr. Noh
and Ms. Sooyeong know each other.

162
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,460
It doesn't seem like they were classmates.

163
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,690
What… are you doing?

164
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,110
May I ask?

165
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,700
Are you his secretary?

166
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,950
She's the one.

167
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,660
She pisses me off.

168
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,120
Hey, she's uglier in person.

169
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,830
Hey, stay away.

170
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,170
Stay away from what?

171
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,920
From Mr. Noh. Stay away from him!

172
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,380
Who is--

173
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,970
-Noh Gojin?
-We don't approve of your engagement.

174
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,430
That's right. Never.

175
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,140
Totally. You're so awful.

176
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,770
I think there's a misunderstanding. I--

177
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,690
Mr. Noh is mine!

178
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,820
I'll never approve of it!

179
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,550
-Mr. Noh!
-It's him!

180
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,510
-Oh my gosh!
-Mr. Noh!

181
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,090
-Oh, no.
-Let's respect each other's privacy.

182
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,680
I don't do this to your boyfriends.

183
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,970
-I don't have a boyfriend!
-What's a boyfriend?

184
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,220
-I've never dated anyone.
-Me neither.

185
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,350
I'll look up your social media accounts.

186
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,390
-I'm telling the truth.
-I only like you.

187
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,900
-That's right.
-That's right.

188
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,690
If you really like someone,
you need to protect them.

189
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,780
-That's awesome.
-So romantic.

190
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,700
-He's so cool.
-My gosh.

191
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,780
And you.

192
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,330
If you want me to be yours,

193
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,790
you'd better graduate from school first.

194
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,000
Put that down now.

195
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,000
Okay. I put it down.

196
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,670
-He's so amazing.
-What do I do?

197
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,840
Then will you wait for me
until I graduate?

198
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,590
Me too. I'll come as soon as I graduate.

199
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,630
Please wait for me.

200
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,390
Hey, he said it to me.

201
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,640
Right?

202
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,760
I'll think about it.

203
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,970
Now, go inside and study.

204
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,770
We'll totally study hard, okay?

205
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,600
-I love you!
-I don't want to go!

206
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,310
-I love you!
-I don't want to go!

207
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,650
Mr. Noh.

208
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,270
-I love you too!
-No!

209
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,360
I love you!

210
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,200
Well, how cute.

211
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,630
What are you doing? Aren't you coming?

212
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,840
Yes, coming now.

213
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,710
Well… Sir.

214
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,050
Eunjung.

215
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,350
Did you decide to take
that punk Mr. Noh Manners' side now?

216
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,810
What do you mean, Mr. Noh Manners' side?

217
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,100
No.

218
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,900
Traitor!

219
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,740
The danger past and God forgotten.

220
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,910
How could you change like this?

221
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,950
How could you change like this?

222
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,960
Everyone changes.

223
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,010
I want to leave behind
the times we worked together, sir.

224
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:49,550
No! You even made a firm vow like this.

225
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,730
Now,

226
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,940
that's become a meaningless promise.

227
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,690
Please don't call me anymore.

228
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,070
You two are ridiculous!

229
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,200
This one's a bit old.

230
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,450
Me? Who are you, old lady?

231
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,080
"Old lady"? Hey!

232
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,210
No, honey!

233
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,960
-"Honey"?
-That's right, floozy!

234
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,750
How does it feel being caught
red-handed cheating?

235
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,300
-You bit me again.
-That's not it.

236
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,270
You bit me again because of that floozy?

237
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,930
Please, honey.

238
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,520
You're dead meat today.

239
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,710
Do you want to make the news?

240
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,090
Gimme that.

241
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,170
Oh my.

242
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,840
Hey!

243
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,640
-My goodness.
-Darn you!

244
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,310
Let's go.

245
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,890
-Me?
-Yes.

246
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,600
-My goodness. Hey!
-Ma Eunjung!

247
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,020
Be quiet. Hey, what are you?

248
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,070
Did you go somewhere?

249
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,580
Sorry?

250
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,920
I went to a quick external meeting.

251
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,960
It's nothing serious.
I need to give you a heads-up.

252
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,010
There will be an event
for the research team in two days.

253
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,970
An event?

254
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,600
It's to cleanly wrap up
the study guide incident.

255
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,520
I trust that you'll handle it well.

256
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,310
How did he show up right at that moment?

257
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,480
Who showed up?

258
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,030
Hey, you're home.
It must've been a hard day.

259
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,110
Aren't you hungry?
I cooked braised kimchi--

260
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,990
Hey! Those are…

261
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,670
I wore them to my audition
for the role of a rich college student.

262
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,130
Do they look good on me?

263
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,260
Chu Okhee, you can't
just take them without telling me!

264
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,350
Hey, it's not like I sold them off.

265
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,390
I only wore them once.
You're being so mean.

266
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,480
If you do this to me,

267
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,520
Okhee's sad.

268
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Gosh, because of these, I…

269
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,440
Jeez, I threw a fuss at him
for calling me a thief.

270
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,610
Now I have to go tell him
that I'm the one who really took them?

271
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,160
How am I going to say that?
Gosh, seriously.

272
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,000
MR. NOH GOJIN

273
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,090
You don't need to come to my house today.
Please go straight to work.

274
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,810
He isn't even at work
and his phone is off too.

275
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,070
He's never done this before.

276
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,410
Oh, right.
It's his grandmother's death anniversary.

277
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,270
Well,

278
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,440
it reminded me of my mom

279
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,070
and I wanted to apologize
about the earrings too.

280
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,630
How did you know…
it was my grandmother's death anniversary?

281
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,670
Because I was your secretary
a year ago too.

282
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,680
What was your grandmother like?

283
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,150
She peeled onions.

284
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,610
After getting back
from selling fish at the market,

285
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:08,540
she peeled a huge pile of onions
every day deep into the night

286
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,080
sitting in a tiny room.

287
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,880
Whenever she peeled onions,
she would always cry.

288
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,880
She said the onions made her eyes water,

289
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,640
but I thought she cried
because she was sad.

290
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,890
So I hate onions.

291
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,060
Because it reminds me
of my crying grandmother.

292
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,940
But

293
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,320
now when I look at onions,

294
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,330
I think it'll remind me of someone else.

295
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,560
What's going on?

296
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,560
We'll start the investigation
on Mr. Noh's study guides being leaked.

297
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,230
Everyone, please stop
what you're doing and stand up.

298
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,320
-What?
-My goodness!

299
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,230
-So suddenly?
-What?

300
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,900
What the heck is going on?

301
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,780
-What do you think you're doing?
-Wait.

302
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,360
Oh no. My file.

303
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,280
I was working on that.

304
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,580
Please put that down! Don't!

305
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,620
-You can't do that.
-Please let go.

306
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,000
Eat this at least.

307
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,960
We have to eat to fight.

308
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,250
Fight?

309
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,470
We can't be framed as thieves like this.
Don't you think?

310
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,840
I can let other things slide.

311
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,720
But I really can't just let it slide
the way we were treated like this

312
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,020
in front of the other research teams.

313
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,520
It's so insulting.

314
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,110
-Ms. Ma.
-Ms. Ma.

315
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,150
Why?

316
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,070
Why do we have to be mistreated like this?

317
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,490
Gotop isn't the only place to work.

318
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,450
We have stellar educational backgrounds,
work experience, and achievements.

319
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,750
We have master's and doctorate degrees.
We shouldn't be treated like this

320
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,630
by Noh Gojin who only has
a high school diploma. Don't you agree?

321
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,000
-Yes.
-You're right.

322
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,050
You're right, Ms. Ma.

323
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,260
We have no reason to be treated like this.

324
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,800
Let's show him that we aren't pushovers.

325
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,180
How?

326
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,060
Strike.

327
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,580
WE DID NOT DO ANYTHING WRONG

328
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,420
The special lecture is only an hour away.
What do you think you're doing?

329
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,880
We can't work
when we're insulted like this.

330
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,050
The audit team searched our desks,

331
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,430
and we were even questioned.

332
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,270
Even though there is no evidence
that we leaked the study guides,

333
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,640
they treated us like criminals.

334
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,560
Yes, that's right!

335
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,030
We won't return to work

336
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,740
until appropriate measures are taken!

337
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,410
-We won't!
-We won't!

338
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,510
Mr. Noh, what are you doing--

339
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,140
You sent the audit team?

340
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,730
If there is a doubt, I must investigate.

341
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,190
You said you'll take care of it.

342
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,020
Do you think it's taken care of?

343
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,530
Since we found no evidence,
I suppose it is.

344
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,150
The teaching assistants wouldn't agree.

345
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,780
They might be very upset at the moment,

346
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,120
but they'll return to work
after some time.

347
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,870
Or while we're at it,
why don't we hire new staff?

348
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,790
You don't remember them anyway,
so it shouldn't matter to you.

349
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,750
I think it's going to matter.

350
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,750
The lecture is in less than an hour.

351
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,210
Just cancel it.
It's not like it's a big deal.

352
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,300
Gojin, don't be out of character
and get soft-hearted.

353
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,850
You're acting out of character too.

354
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,600
You used to be
the kindest person in the world.

355
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,820
I promised them my lecture.

356
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,030
I must keep my promise.

357
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,510
-Did you call for me?
-I'm going to the special lecture.

358
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,430
Sorry? Did they all return to work?

359
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,100
I'm going on my own.

360
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,310
Why are you standing there for?
Get ready quickly.

361
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,700
NOH GOJIN'S CSAT MATH SPECIAL LECTURE

362
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,950
It's Kim Heeyeon.

363
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,950
Kim Heeyeon.

364
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,660
Here you go.

365
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,790
It's Cho Sungsik.

366
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,250
Cho Sungsik.

367
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,460
Enjoy the lecture.

368
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,260
NOH GOJIN'S CSAT MATH SPECIAL LECTURE

369
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,150
If you focus and listen
to my lecture carefully today,

370
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,230
you'll be able to master calculus.

371
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,610
Who am I?

372
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,320
-Noh Gojin!
-Great.

373
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,870
Okay, shall we solve
a practice problem then?

374
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,540
Understood?

375
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,620
-Yes!
-Yes!

376
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,960
Great. If you understood
the average rate of change…

377
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,000
the derivatives become easier.

378
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,310
So the limit as delta x

379
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,520
approaches zero. What next?

380
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,320
The answer is three.

381
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,650
Who got it correct?

382
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,740
NOH GOJIN'S CSAT MATH SPECIAL LECTURE

383
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,530
Great.

384
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,010
You were quite helpful today.

385
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,760
You were a good teaching assistant.

386
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,430
Thank you.

387
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,900
Shouldn't you go get the car now?

388
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,320
At this rate, when will you
pay off all your debt?

389
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,450
I saw your apology video.

390
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,920
The study guide issue
should be resolved now.

391
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,880
What is it that you really want from me?

392
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,760
I'll tell you when it's time.

393
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,800
How long will you pressure me like this?

394
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,600
Let me say this ahead
so that you don't get the wrong idea.

395
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,270
No matter how much I want Think Academy,

396
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,900
I won't go along with absurd requests.

397
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,560
Don't worry.
It's nothing to be concerned about.

398
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:18,740
But this task needs to be safeguarded,
so I'll tell you about it later.

399
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,820
Please don't misunderstand.

400
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:29,250
But will Mr. Noh Manners
really let the study guide incident slide?

401
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,290
No worries about that.

402
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,000
Mr. Noh won't care at all.

403
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,330
Why not?

404
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,300
Mr. Noh has amnesia.

405
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,430
-What did you say?
-He lost his memories

406
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,890
from the car accident in Gangneung.

407
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:49,020
Now he's pretending to be fine.

408
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,020
Am… Amnesia?

409
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,400
It's top secret.

410
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,650
I need to get going for my next meeting.

411
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,370
Don't get cute with me!

412
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,620
He told me at the KPEDA event
that he planted erroneous questions

413
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,540
knowing I was going
to steal his study guides!

414
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,830
What do you mean?

415
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,920
Mr. Noh Manners told me that himself.

416
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,150
Ms. Lee Sina.

417
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,360
Yes?

418
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,490
Tonight's dinner…

419
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,710
Gojin, let's have dinner together tonight.

420
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,970
I have dinner plans for tonight.

421
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,430
You may go home now.

422
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,310
I see. Okay.

423
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,080
You brought me here on purpose

424
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,580
to piss me off, right?

425
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,300
I can speak quite coarsely.

426
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,890
After launching a company,
I keep speaking more coarsely.

427
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,930
If I want something,
I need to become tough.

428
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,190
Although you've aged,

429
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,160
you're still childish in some ways.

430
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,620
Wait. I guess you're fine with it now.

431
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,040
You used to hate it
when I called you childish.

432
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,040
You don't remember that either, do you?

433
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,630
For our first date,

434
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,630
you took me to a fancy restaurant
using your whole paycheck--

435
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,800
I'm done eating. May I go now?

436
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:15,930
Please respect…

437
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,350
my love for you.

438
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,100
Just because you don't remember our past,

439
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,190
it doesn't mean
that I don't remember it either.

440
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:32,490
I still cherish all the moments
of us together in my heart.

441
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,080
The dress you bought me,

442
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,450
our first date,

443
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,160
and how we used to lie down together
and look at the stars.

444
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:46,250
The memories of how we loved each other
remain vivid like pictures in my head.

445
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,460
Then why did we break up?

446
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:51,970
That's because…

447
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,140
of an unavoidable circumstance.

448
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,220
What was that unavoidable circumstance?

449
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,060
Did I cheat on you?

450
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,850
Or…

451
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,190
did you abandon me?

452
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,120
Ms. Baek Sooyeong.

453
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,250
Today's going to be the last time
we have dinner together.

454
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,670
If you want to tell Ms. Lee Sina,
go ahead.

455
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,920
I don't have a desire to respect
your one-sided love for me.

456
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,880
Gojin.

457
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,750
Did you just get home?

458
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,140
What brings you here so late at night?

459
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,430
I wanted to have a drink with you.
It's been a while.

460
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,600
After your accident, we haven't had time
for just the two of us.

461
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,940
I felt really nostalgic today.

462
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,030
Okay. I'm glad you came.

463
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,070
The special lecture must've been tough.
I should've thought it through.

464
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,740
I'll persuade the teaching assistants,
so don't worry too much.

465
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,370
By the way, I heard a weird rumor

466
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:52,300
that you knew Mr. Park
was going to steal the study guides

467
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,050
and planted the erroneous questions
on purpose to set a trap.

468
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,180
Of course, it's total nonsense.

469
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,180
It's true.

470
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,230
I think I planted the erroneous questions.

471
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,690
I'm not sure if it was a trap,

472
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,240
but I found
the study guide materials on my desk.

473
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,950
On the very last page,
it said "special event."

474
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,540
It was to find
the 15 hidden erroneous questions.

475
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,410
Is that so?

476
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,120
What's wrong?

477
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,460
Is there a problem?

478
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,920
No. Not at all.

479
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,510
Thanks.

480
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,850
Oh, right.

481
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,610
My friend made it with great care
and gave it to me as a gift.

482
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,110
It looks delicious, so I brought it.

483
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,160
No peaches in it, right?

484
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:11,330
Who else but me would know
that you're allergic to peaches?

485
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,790
Of course not. Don't worry and eat.

486
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,440
You're right.

487
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,270
It looks delicious.

488
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,790
It's delicious indeed.

489
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,030
What's wrong? Are you all right?

490
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,990
Gojin.

491
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,370
Gojin!

492
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,040
One second, honey.

493
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,120
Okay.

494
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,590
Honey, your skin is nice.
Why do you need to do this?

495
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,550
Because I'm older than you.

496
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,630
Don't say that. Jeez.

497
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,140
It's Sina. Hide quickly. Hurry!

498
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,640
I won't hide anymore.

499
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,060
If you don't, you're dead meat.

500
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,150
Hurry!

501
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,360
Quickly.

502
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,820
Okhee.

503
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,910
Guess what I brought home.

504
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,750
Sushi!

505
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,670
Ta-da.

506
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,800
It's from a new popular restaurant
near my office. It's so good.

507
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,970
I know you like sushi.
Come on, eat up. Here.

508
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,090
You're usually so miserly.
What's gotten into you?

509
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,390
-Isn't it good?
-Yes.

510
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,650
I feel so happy today.

511
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,980
Why?

512
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,990
Hello?

513
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
Thank you for coming.

514
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:05,420
Mr. Noh ate a peach?

515
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,970
Why? He's allergic to peaches.
Why did he eat it?

516
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,640
I didn't realize
he was allergic to peaches.

517
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,600
I guess he didn't remember it either.

518
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,690
Please don't worry too much.

519
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,810
He was in shock, but he should be okay.

520
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,690
Okay. What a relief.

521
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,910
I feel like it's all my fault.

522
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,200
It was an accident.
Please don't blame yourself.

523
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,130
Hello?

524
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,670
I see. I'm on my way.

525
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,670
Okay.

526
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,840
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up,
so I need to go.

527
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,340
Sure, please go ahead.

528
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,430
Okay.

529
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:57,350
Gojin, I'm sorry.

530
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,030
He ate a peach?

531
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,200
Why does he have to go this far
to pretend to have amnesia?

532
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,290
I guess his memories haven't returned.

533
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:37,990
INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS

534
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,310
Mom!

535
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,270
-Oh, no.
-Mom!

536
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:09,190
Mom!

537
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:23,660
You've always been alone.

538
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,020
In the end,

539
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,610
you're going to leave me too.

540
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,680
Then why did we break up?

541
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,680
Did you abandon me?

542
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,980
It's just like 12 years ago.

543
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,070
The way he looked at me
in front of the police station.

544
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,570
No,

545
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:36,400
I won't let you go.

546
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,040
Ms. Baek.

547
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,250
Let's talk about work tomorrow.

548
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,290
I have a headache.

549
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,370
I'm going home early today.

550
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,040
Yes, ma'am. I'll have the car ready.

551
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,880
Are you all right?

552
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,760
The deputy CEO of Gotop?

553
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,510
I'm sorry.

554
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,430
You really don't have to
go to the hospital?

555
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,520
It's okay. Please don't worry
about the car either.

556
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,610
Gosh, thank you.

557
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,730
I wanted to meet you.

558
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,700
I heard that you
and Mr. Noh are best friends.

559
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:06,870
Yes. Gojin and I are like real brothers.

560
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,540
I heard so much about you before
from Gojin.

561
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,330
Gojin mentioned me?

562
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,380
Yes.

563
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,130
What did he say?

564
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,010
Forget it.

565
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,560
He must've said
I was his first love of the past.

566
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:34,060
-But Gojin--
-I know already.

567
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,480
He has amnesia.

568
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:39,650
But please don't worry.
I know it's a secret.

569
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:41,530
Okay.

570
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:48,410
I guess you watched it all beside him

571
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:53,160
when Mr. Noh was dating and got engaged.

572
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,370
No. After Gojin got into the car accident,

573
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,790
I found out for the first time
that Ms. Lee Sina was his fiancée.

574
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:01,960
-Pardon?
-She said the two of them got engaged.

575
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,800
But it's just based on
Ms. Lee Sina's words.

576
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,510
What do you mean--

577
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,140
Of course, I don't doubt her.

578
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,020
But sometimes

579
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,480
I wonder if Ms. Lee Sina is

580
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,070
really Gojin's fiancée, you know?

581
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,660
GOTOP EDUCATION CEO NOH GOJIN

582
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,610
Do you have time today?

583
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,690
-Pardon?
-Let's have dinner together.

584
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,990
Did Ms. Baek invite us again?

585
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:12,200
No. I want to have dinner
with just the two of us.

586
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:17,500
At 7 p.m. I'll message you the location.

587
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:19,880
Okay.

588
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,450
Do you like it?

589
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,200
Yes, it's delicious.

590
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,620
-Please eat.
-Okay.

591
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,550
Ms. Lee Sina.

592
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,100
Yes?

593
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,900
GOTOP EDUCATION

594
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,520
What is it?

595
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:25,730
Tear it up.

596
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,400
-Pardon?
-Please tear it up.

597
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,050
It's over now.

598
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,510
What's over?

599
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:52,180
From this moment on,
our contract is terminated.

600
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,730
SIGNED BY NOH GOJIN, LEE SINA

601
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:00,850
And…

602
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,070
-you're fired.
-Sorry?

603
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:10,110
Starting tomorrow, please don't come
to Gotop Education or my house.

604
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,530
I'm done talking, so I'll excuse myself.

605
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,060
Jeez, am I dreaming right now?

606
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:22,890
The contract is terminated
and I don't have to pay him back.

607
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,190
I was going to submit
my resignation letter anyway.

608
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:28,190
I no longer have to be his secretary,
housekeeper, or driver.

609
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,070
Wow, Lee Sina, aren't you excited?

610
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,490
Smile. You practically won the lottery!

611
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,780
You're fired.

612
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:46,500
Starting tomorrow, please don't come
to Gotop Education or my house.

613
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,130
Why do I…

614
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,380
feel like I got dumped?

615
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,550
I see. He's back to himself again.

616
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,240
Please get me coffee--

617
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:25,780
Hey, potato.

618
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,780
I keep seeing things.

619
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:33,040
What do I do?

625
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,020
Don't you have manners--

626
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:05,900
Is Ms. Lee Sina here?

627
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,440
Sina? She hasn't come home yet.

628
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:10,150
She wasn't with you?

629
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,900
Okay, here we go.

630
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,500
-Where is she right now?
-Who?

631
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:24,580
Lee Sina!

632
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,040
How would I know? She isn't my secretary.

633
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,090
Whoa.

634
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:33,220
Fine. I'll track her location.

You told me to leave.

Why do you keep stopping me?

642
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,820
