EPISODE 15

5
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:50,468
Hello.

6
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:53,058
Hello.

7
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,098
Ms. Na Sooyeon?

8
00:00:58,688 --> 00:01:00,358
It's been so long.

9
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,818
I really wondered how you were doing.

10
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:06,488
I know. I was wondering about you too.

11
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:10,158
But, what brings you here?

12
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:11,658
How do you know where I live?

13
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,198
I asked the teaching assistants.

14
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:16,118
I have a favor I must ask you.

15
00:01:16,748 --> 00:01:18,208
Sure. What is it?

16
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:20,128
Is Mr. Noh--

17
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:24,258
Who…

18
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:25,628
It's someone I know.

19
00:01:32,348 --> 00:01:34,058
I drove here.

20
00:01:34,138 --> 00:01:35,848
Can we talk briefly in my car?

21
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:37,638
There is a coffee shop nearby.

22
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:42,068
But I feel uncomfortable
talking about it in the open.

23
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,358
Okay. Let's talk in your car then.

24
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:50,948
Please get in.

25
00:01:55,578 --> 00:01:56,908
I'll bring the documents.

26
00:01:56,998 --> 00:01:58,918
Oh… Okay.

27
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,068
RESTRICTED NUMBER

28
00:02:29,238 --> 00:02:30,488
Who are you?

29
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:32,778
What are you doing to Lee Sina?

30
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:54,548
Mr. Noh.

31
00:02:54,638 --> 00:02:56,308
Where is Sina?

32
00:02:56,388 --> 00:02:59,388
Sina? She went with a woman
who came by earlier.

33
00:03:09,988 --> 00:03:11,148
RESTRICTED NUMBER

34
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:12,818
582-84, AHYEON-DONG

35
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:14,698
What's the matter?

36
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:17,328
Did something happen to Sina?

37
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:19,078
Please call the police.

38
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,168
To 582-84, Ahyeon-dong.
Call the emergency hotline too!

39
00:03:23,248 --> 00:03:24,128
The police?

40
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:26,668
Oh, no.

41
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:01,118
Lee Sina!

42
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:43,498
It's been a long time, Mr. Noh Gojin.

43
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:52,878
Ms. Na Sooyeon?

44
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,378
Yes, it's me,

45
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,888
Na Sooyeon, who used to be

46
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:01,428
an English instructor at Gotop Education.

47
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,188
Where is Sina?

48
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:10,978
Please don't worry. She's in a safe place.

49
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,888
Ms. Na Sooyeon!

50
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:43,178
Is anyone there?

51
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:59,738
JUST DISAPPEAR
PRISON… WHO IS HE MEETING?

52
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:05,328
What on earth are you doing?

53
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,538
Did you enjoy my gifts?

54
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:10,668
The dead rat,

55
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:12,708
the knife in the flower basket,

56
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:14,588
and the sleeping pills in the champagne.

57
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,128
I also broke the stage light.

58
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:24,428
Then,

59
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:27,848
are you also who sent me
the death threat email?

60
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,188
You're smart indeed, Mr. Noh.

61
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:38,988
Why am I doing this?

62
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:45,368
Back then,

63
00:06:47,078 --> 00:06:48,828
why didn't you believe me?

64
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:52,248
Ma'am.

65
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:58,298
Just because they attend my lecture,
their grades don't suddenly improve.

66
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:01,838
The student has to be interested
in English and make an effort.

67
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:04,758
So are you saying it's my child's fault?

68
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:08,388
I trusted you, so I sent
my child here paying high fees.

69
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:10,348
But this is ridiculous.

70
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:12,848
Please refund the tuition.

71
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:18,528
Ma'am, but your child attended
all the classes. I can't refund you now.

72
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,698
Sorry, but that will be difficult.

73
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:23,408
You can't?

74
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:26,028
No. I did my best.

75
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:30,538
I'll make sure

76
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,168
you never get to teach again.

77
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,208
Watch me.

78
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,268
What does she take me for?

79
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:07,578
GOTOP EDUCATION MS. NA'S
IMPROPER RELATIONSHIP…

80
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,588
GOTOP EDUCATION MS. NA'S
IMPROPER RELATIONSHIP WITH A STUDENT!

81
00:08:20,838 --> 00:08:23,128
Are they shooting romance flicks
at Gotop now?

82
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:24,838
How can an instructor
do so with a student?

83
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:27,598
It must've been tough for
a filthy instructor to pretend to be pure.

84
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:29,218
Such an instructor still exists?

85
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,138
Sir.

86
00:08:32,268 --> 00:08:33,428
I didn't do that.

87
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,478
I had no inappropriate relationships
with students.

88
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,068
I swear, I didn't do anything shameful.

89
00:08:39,148 --> 00:08:41,028
Please believe me. I'm innocent.

90
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:44,398
I don't care about
your private life, Ms. Na.

91
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:47,818
But Gotop's reputation
can't be ruined because of you.

92
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:49,078
It's a lie.

93
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:51,948
Someone is framing me, Mr. Noh!

94
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:52,948
That's…

95
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:56,668
not my problem.

96
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:58,748
Please leave Gotop.

97
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,748
To teach

98
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:05,048
students at Gotop as an English instructor

99
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:08,088
was my life.

100
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:11,508
I really did my best.

101
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,138
I gave it all I had.

102
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:17,978
But why…

103
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:20,518
didn't you believe me?

104
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:23,688
Your life was in ruins like me before.

105
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,448
You knew how I felt
better than anyone else.

106
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:30,568
I resented you, Mr. Noh.

107
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,538
I resented you more than

108
00:09:34,618 --> 00:09:36,708
those who wrote that post
and the malicious comments.

109
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:41,088
I…

110
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,878
just needed your kind words

111
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:49,338
saying that you believed me.

112
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,558
Just those words.

113
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:17,618
She's out of her mind.

114
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,248
How could she call herself a teacher?

115
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,538
How could she do that with a student?

116
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:25,708
How could she go around so shamelessly?

117
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,548
Wow, she's a lewd wench.

118
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:32,088
She is crazy.
She should totally get fired.

119
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:35,428
If I were her,
I would've committed suicide by now.

120
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:38,268
What a filthy woman.

121
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:41,478
How dare she. She's so filthy.

122
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:23,478
EMERGENCY

123
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,038
At first,

124
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:52,798
I wanted to make you feel
the exact same pain that I felt.

125
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:55,258
I wanted to kill you.

126
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:59,348
But even if you were to die,

127
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:02,558
nothing would change for me.

128
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,478
So I changed my mind.

129
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,998
I decided to kill myself

130
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,998
in front of you.

131
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,378
Please calm down.

132
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,558
Calm down.

133
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:43,848
It's really over now.

134
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:54,188
No!

135
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:17,008
Sir!

136
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:26,978
Are you okay? Are you hurt at all?

137
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:28,558
How can you be worrying about me?

138
00:13:28,648 --> 00:13:31,518
If Okhee didn't call the police,
I don't even know what could've happened.

139
00:13:31,608 --> 00:13:34,898
If the rescuers hadn't put down the mat,
what do you think would've happened?

140
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:36,948
What about you? What the heck happened?

141
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:39,368
Nothing bad happened, right?

142
00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:42,488
I was at Ms. Na Sooyeon's place.

143
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,368
I was locked up briefly,
but the police came soon after.

144
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,038
Do you even know how scared I was?

145
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:54,248
I thought something happened to you
because of me.

146
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:58,298
Do you know how worried I was too?

147
00:14:02,548 --> 00:14:03,558
I'm sorry.

148
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:05,768
I'm sorry for getting mad.

149
00:14:07,018 --> 00:14:08,018
It's…

150
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:09,848
It's all my fault.

151
00:14:10,478 --> 00:14:13,148
No, it's my fault.

152
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,528
I didn't realize

153
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,448
how agonized you were.

154
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:22,028
You must've felt so hurt and lonely.

155
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,908
I'm so sorry that I didn't understand you.

156
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,878
NA SOOYEON

157
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:03,258
You and I

158
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,718
shouldn't have dated from the start.

159
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:08,968
We can never be together.

160
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:44,048
I really did my best.

161
00:16:44,678 --> 00:16:46,298
I gave it all I had.

162
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,008
I really worked hard.

163
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:51,808
We really worked hard.

164
00:16:52,268 --> 00:16:55,058
I really gave it all I got to please you.

165
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:23,508
So the only place
you could run to was your home?

166
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:31,258
This is why I can see right through you.

167
00:17:31,848 --> 00:17:33,098
You're too easy to figure out.

168
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:49,028
I realized

169
00:17:50,908 --> 00:17:52,908
that I lived so terribly.

170
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:57,538
No, you didn't.

171
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:01,668
It's just that your heart was broken

172
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:05,048
so painfully.

173
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:07,758
I…

174
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,888
want to do the right thing.

175
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:18,518
If you help me,

176
00:18:20,188 --> 00:18:21,938
I think I can do well.

177
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:46,298
By the way, did you find out
about Mr. Oh Segi's younger sister?

178
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,758
Yes. She committed suicide
by jumping seven years ago.

179
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:52,678
Suicide?

180
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:57,268
Yes. But I don't think
it was mere suicide.

181
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:59,138
What was it then?

182
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,978
Ms. Oh Sehee was
an instructor at Master Education.

183
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:06,318
She was harassed by malicious comments
and committed suicide in the end.

184
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:09,738
There's a rumor that Mr. Noh Gojin
who was her colleague at that time

185
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:11,778
was the driving force
behind those comments.

186
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:26,378
But he isn't someone
who would do such a thing.

187
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:40,978
Is there something on my face?

188
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:43,398
No.

189
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:45,608
Please have a seat.

190
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,228
Okay.

191
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:54,908
I'm thinking about launching
a season pass event for all subjects.

192
00:19:54,988 --> 00:19:55,988
Please take a look.

193
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:02,408
Well, it looks great.

194
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,788
Even if we'd suffer a loss,

195
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:07,998
do everything possible
that could give a blow to Gotop.

196
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:09,168
Yes, ma'am.

197
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:13,878
And please tell Mr. Jo
if you have any trouble.

198
00:20:13,968 --> 00:20:18,468
He was very concerned about you
as the initial adjustment can be hard.

199
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,808
That's very thoughtful of Mr. Jo.

200
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,858
My goodness, Mr. Jo!

201
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,568
Mr. Jo, you worked
at Master Education, didn't you?

202
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:38,908
I'm right. Aren't I? You were, right?

203
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,238
I knew I've seen you somewhere.
That's where it was.

204
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:44,658
I worked there briefly
as a teaching assistant.

205
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:49,418
But you changed so much.
Your change is remarkable.

206
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,298
You wore very thick glasses then, right?

207
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:53,588
Yes.

208
00:20:55,678 --> 00:20:56,718
By the way,

209
00:20:57,428 --> 00:21:02,348
did you really get fired then
for plagiarizing the study guide?

210
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:05,188
Was the study guide really Mr. Noh's?

211
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,398
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

212
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:14,818
What hurry?
He's just pretending to be cool.

213
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,078
What's this?

214
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,918
GOTOP EDUCATION CEO NOH GOJIN

215
00:22:12,338 --> 00:22:15,418
Ta-da! It's a special wish coupon
from Lee Sina.

216
00:22:17,008 --> 00:22:19,548
This is a really rare coupon
to get a hold of, you know?

217
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:23,048
I'm being very generous today,
so you can tell me just one wish.

218
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:28,348
I'll try hard to grant you any wish,

219
00:22:28,438 --> 00:22:29,438
so just tell me.

220
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:40,658
Can you give me a hug?

221
00:22:41,738 --> 00:22:42,738
That's too easy.

222
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:55,918
Will I be able to do a good job?

223
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,048
Will people

224
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,838
accept my sincerity?

225
00:23:03,088 --> 00:23:04,008
I'm a bit afraid.

226
00:23:11,518 --> 00:23:13,268
Of course, you'll do a good job.

227
00:23:14,938 --> 00:23:16,268
Please don't worry.

228
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:19,818
They'll come to understand
your sincere heart.

229
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:43,048
I wonder
if Hyesun arrived safely at Jeju Island.

230
00:23:43,428 --> 00:23:46,428
She didn't get to take care of her child
trying to earn money all this time.

231
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,098
She must be feeling so terrible.

232
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:51,598
Since she went to her mom's house,
I hope she can forget everything

233
00:23:51,688 --> 00:23:54,308
and just get to spend
quality time with her son.

234
00:23:57,318 --> 00:24:01,318
Mr. Noh Manners
will probably sue us, right?

235
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,608
Even if he did, we can't blame him.

236
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,488
Welco--

237
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:09,158
Hello.

238
00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:10,288
Ms. Lee.

239
00:24:12,998 --> 00:24:13,998
One moment, please.

240
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:22,168
What do we do?

241
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:28,598
Mr. Noh has something
he wants to say to you.

242
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:40,228
I would like to apologize

243
00:24:41,108 --> 00:24:42,278
for hurting you.

244
00:24:45,858 --> 00:24:46,698
I'm sorry.

245
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:30,658
No!

246
00:25:47,218 --> 00:25:49,888
Do you feel okay now?

247
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:55,268
Why did you save me?

248
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,098
You'll regret it.

249
00:26:02,818 --> 00:26:06,608
When I lost everything 12 years ago

250
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:10,488
and survived after giving up on life,

251
00:26:12,618 --> 00:26:14,788
I couldn't forgive

252
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:18,618
anyone or anything.

253
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:23,958
I felt like I was living in hell.

254
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:27,378
I couldn't understand how others felt

255
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:30,678
and didn't care to do so either.

256
00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:35,848
Maybe I ignored you
because you reminded me

257
00:26:37,478 --> 00:26:39,188
of how I was back then.

258
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,858
I was afraid to confront

259
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:44,398
such pain again.

260
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:51,318
I'm sorry…

261
00:26:53,068 --> 00:26:54,618
that I didn't believe you…

262
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:58,748
back then.

263
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:34,448
Go inside now.

264
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,368
Why are you looking at me like that?

265
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:42,868
Because you're so adorable.

266
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:44,538
What?

267
00:27:45,668 --> 00:27:47,628
You were so great today.

268
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:51,928
What you did for Ms. Na Sooyeon
and the former secretaries.

269
00:27:52,508 --> 00:27:53,888
You were so great.

270
00:27:57,058 --> 00:27:59,718
There's no way
I could've done it without you.

271
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:03,478
What do I do without you anymore?

272
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:04,398
You can't live then.

273
00:28:06,108 --> 00:28:07,228
I'll go in now.

274
00:28:43,308 --> 00:28:47,398
Please, just 100 people.
I hope just 100 people have watched it.

275
00:28:56,488 --> 00:28:58,118

Thirty thousand…

281
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:18,048
Thirty thousand! All right!

282
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:20,638
Gosh. What's going on?

283
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:24,058
Hey, I've got thirty thousand!

284
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,388
Thirty thousand?

285
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:29,558
He loves you 3,000 times?

286
00:29:30,608 --> 00:29:32,148
He loves you 30,000 times?

287
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,568
Gosh!

288
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:36,398
Hey, you're not the only one who is loved.

289
00:29:36,948 --> 00:29:37,778
Right?

290
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,038
-I love you.
-Okay.

291
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:53,628
Me too.

292
00:29:56,668 --> 00:29:59,178
Honey, your lips are so full and bouncy.

293
00:30:07,688 --> 00:30:08,808
Gosh, Sooho.

294
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,938
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe I got 30,000 views.

295
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:25,118
-Make yourself comfortable.
-Thank you.

296
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,078
Would you like a glass of wine?

297
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:28,668
Sure. Sounds good.

298
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:45,178
That's my sister.

299
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:47,978
Oh, you have a sister.

300
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:49,598
I didn't know.

301
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:52,108
She died.

302
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:54,438
I'm sorry to hear that.

303
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:56,228
Noh Gojin killed her

304
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:58,858
through unspeakable

305
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,698
malicious comments.

306
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:08,118
-Is that why--
-I'm going to destroy

307
00:31:08,198 --> 00:31:10,578
Gotop and Noh Gojin in the very same way.

308
00:31:12,578 --> 00:31:14,748
I'm going to make him suffer

309
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:17,838
just as my sister did.

310
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:23,678
Please help me, Mr. Jo.

311
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,308
Yes, of course.

312
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,398
A FEW MONTHS AGO

313
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:41,278
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

314
00:31:41,778 --> 00:31:43,238
So please--

315
00:31:45,908 --> 00:31:46,908
It's all my fault.

316
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:51,288
Please forgive…
I beg for your forgiveness just this once.

318

MS. OH SEHEE DID NOT COMMIT SUICIDE
NOH GOJIN KILLED HER. HERE IS THE EVIDENCE

319
00:32:43,258 --> 00:32:44,468
SHE'S LOST HER MIND

320
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:45,838
SHE'S A TOTAL THIEF

321
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:57,608
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

322
00:32:58,188 --> 00:33:01,068
Please forgive…
I beg for your forgiveness just this once.

323
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,948
No. I can't forgive.

324
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,528
This industry will no longer be an option.

325
00:33:09,118 --> 00:33:12,368
I doubt you can even
bump him gently with your car.

326
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,498
What if I do hit him with my car?

327
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:17,248
Even if you just
bump Noh Gojin gently with your car,

328
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:19,788
I'll pay you a large one. Sounds good?

If I hadn't failed then…

332
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:56,018
Please proceed.

333
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,528
Mr. Kim Chabae?

334
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:16,948
We're the police.

335
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,578
Your name was
on the customer list of Choi Mingu,

336
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:25,088
a broker who illegally leaked
and sold high school mock exams.

337
00:35:25,418 --> 00:35:26,248
Come with us.

338
00:35:29,298 --> 00:35:30,378
My goodness.

339
00:35:35,678 --> 00:35:37,468
There must be a misunderstanding.

340
00:35:37,558 --> 00:35:39,388
-I know nothing.
-Tell us at the station.

341
00:35:39,478 --> 00:35:43,308
Who is that man? Why would I do that?
Where are you taking me?

342
00:35:43,398 --> 00:35:45,898
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

343
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,728
-What was that about?
-What happened?

344
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:50,568
-What's going on?
-That must be it!

345
00:35:51,238 --> 00:35:54,238
-Why was he taken?
-What did Mr. Chabae do?

346
00:35:58,288 --> 00:36:04,128
RESTRICTED NUMBER: MICHELLE LEE,
AREN'T FORGED ACADEMIC RECORDS A PAIN?

347
00:36:10,258 --> 00:36:12,968
-What's going on?
-Is our academy jinxed?

348
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:14,008
INSTRUCTOR INVOLVED WITH TEST LEAKS

349
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:18,598
Wow, what a scumbag.
He's such a shameless jerk.

350
00:36:20,018 --> 00:36:22,598
My goodness, Producer Park.

351
00:36:23,188 --> 00:36:24,228
So what's next?

352
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:29,068
The show is postponed?
But why all of a sudden?

353
00:36:30,228 --> 00:36:31,238
Mr. Gong.

354
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:34,158
We got a call about your drunk driving.

355
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:35,908
What?

356
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,698
Ta-da!

357
00:36:38,778 --> 00:36:41,158
Hello. I'm the Masked Korean Teacher.

358
00:36:41,248 --> 00:36:43,828
From today, let's have fun
and enjoy studying Korean together

359
00:36:43,908 --> 00:36:46,918
starting with the basics
step-by-step, okay?

360
00:36:47,668 --> 00:36:51,878
I know that you find the Korean grammar
from the Middle Ages most difficult.

361
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,378
I'll simplify it for you.

362
00:36:55,008 --> 00:36:56,928
What goes in this blank?

363
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,778
What are you looking at?

364
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:16,698
Don't you have something to say to me?

365
00:37:17,488 --> 00:37:20,278
What? Say what to you?

366
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:26,328
Forget it. I can wait.

367
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:32,418
Sir, we're in trouble!

368
00:37:32,508 --> 00:37:35,508
Mr. Kim Chabae was taken by the police
for buying high school mock exams

369
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,048
from a broker!

370
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:42,718
Sir, we're in trouble!

371
00:37:42,808 --> 00:37:46,098
Ms. Michelle Lee needs to give
a live lecture, but she disappeared.

372
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,648
Disappeared?

373
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:52,608
Noh Gojin, you come out now!

374
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,358
Noh Gojin, it was you, wasn't it?

375
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,278
You reported me, didn't you?

376
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,318
What do you mean all of a sudden?

377
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,528
What do I mean?

378
00:38:00,618 --> 00:38:02,788
You called in about my drunk driving!

379
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:08,328
Hey! I drove less than ten meters
and hit a utility pole.

380
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:10,248
Besides, that was ten long years ago!

381
00:38:12,128 --> 00:38:14,418
Does it look like I have time for that?

382
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:16,378
It wasn't you?

383
00:38:17,048 --> 00:38:20,638
Then who… Was it you? No?

384
00:38:21,798 --> 00:38:24,768
Kim Chabae. Darn it.

385
00:38:24,848 --> 00:38:26,138
Chabae!

386
00:38:31,648 --> 00:38:32,478
Sir.

387
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,398
The bank…

388
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:38,568
suddenly moved up
the loan repayment due date.

389
00:38:39,198 --> 00:38:40,448
What did you say?

390
00:38:47,788 --> 00:38:50,208
Branch manager, what on earth--

391
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:53,708
That's what I want to ask you.
What's going on?

392
00:38:53,788 --> 00:38:56,588
Why is Gunil Group trying
to block your access to funding?

393
00:39:05,848 --> 00:39:09,638
ILPUM EDU

394
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:14,518
Gunil Group is pressuring our bank
to make Gotop Education repay the loan.

395
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,438
I'm sure they're
pressuring other investors too.

396
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:20,698
That's what conglomerates typically do
to attack other businesses.

397
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:25,908
ILPUM EDU
CEO PARK YANGTAE

398
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:29,248
Yes?

399
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,578
Mr. Noh Gojin is here.

400
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:39,168
What took you so long?

401
00:39:59,238 --> 00:40:00,528
Not even offering me tea?

402
00:40:02,238 --> 00:40:04,198
Your hospitality is awful.

403
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:06,778
Hey!

404
00:40:07,328 --> 00:40:10,958
You're still the CEO of Gotop
all thanks to me.

405
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:14,498
If I hadn't voted against the resolution,
you would've been finished.

406
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:19,048
I saved you from drowning.
How ungrateful you are.

407
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:23,258
Why did you do that?

408
00:40:33,438 --> 00:40:35,148
NOH GOJIN
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

409
00:40:35,228 --> 00:40:38,518
Protect me… this time.

410
00:40:40,028 --> 00:40:43,028
I didn't do it because I was sorry.

411
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:46,448
I just couldn't ruin you twice myself.

412
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:57,588
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

413
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:03,418
Help me.

414
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,348
What… What did you say?

415
00:41:08,928 --> 00:41:12,888
Gunil Group is restricting
Gotop's access to funding.

416
00:41:17,438 --> 00:41:20,898
I know very well what you think of me.

417
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:25,028
But now, for my people at Gotop…

418
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:29,238
If it's for them,
I'll even kneel down before you.

419
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:32,748
So please help me.

420
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:47,678
Do you think I did that
because I wanted to?

421
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:50,298
I had to because I was afraid.

422
00:41:51,138 --> 00:41:53,768
I wanted to make you the best instructor.

423
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:57,138
I was really going to send you to Oxford.

424
00:41:57,478 --> 00:42:00,688
But Gunil Group
threatened me to make it look

425
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,478
as if you forged your academic records.

426
00:42:03,068 --> 00:42:05,438
Or else, they'd crush Ilpum Edu
by mobilizing investigations

427
00:42:05,938 --> 00:42:08,068
from the tax authority and prosecutors.

428
00:42:08,698 --> 00:42:09,618
I had no choice.

429
00:42:09,698 --> 00:42:11,368
Wait.

430
00:42:13,328 --> 00:42:15,618
But why would Gunil Group threaten you?

431
00:42:15,698 --> 00:42:17,288
You should've known your place.

432
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,458
Why did you date
the daughter of a conglomerate owner?

433
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:22,498
If you hadn't dated Baek Sooyeong,
your life wouldn't have been ruined.

434
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,628
What do you mean by that?

435
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,508
Chairman Baek, Baek Sooyeong's father,

436
00:42:32,138 --> 00:42:35,308
flipped out saying his daughter was dating
some rootless orphan

437
00:42:35,388 --> 00:42:36,888
and was ready to kill you.

438
00:42:38,228 --> 00:42:42,228
It's very fortunate it didn't go beyond
the academic record forgery charge.

439
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,318
What did I do so wrong?

440
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,148
I've only loved you.

441
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,528
You come and go as you please.

442
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,738
That's what love is to you?

443
00:42:58,408 --> 00:43:00,498
I can explain everything.

444
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:02,578
It was beyond my control.

445
00:43:16,008 --> 00:43:18,018
The recipient is not picking up…

446
00:43:23,938 --> 00:43:25,018
She's not answering, is she?

447
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:26,978
Well… No.

448
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,818
She was acting so odd lately.

449
00:43:30,738 --> 00:43:32,948
She looked anxious
as if she was being chased

450
00:43:33,568 --> 00:43:36,368
and also seemed like
she wasn't fully there.

451
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,118
She should be okay, right?

452
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,078
I'm sure she's okay.

453
00:43:40,658 --> 00:43:44,288
Ms. Michelle Lee told her mother
she was taking a trip,

454
00:43:44,378 --> 00:43:45,588
so let's wait for her.

455
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:51,628
I think she needs
some time to think about something.

456
00:43:52,218 --> 00:43:54,138
Oh, right. What about Mr. Kim Chabae?

457
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:56,098
He is home now after the questioning.

458
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:58,558
What's happening
to the instructors suddenly?

459
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:04,228
There are so many malicious comments on
Gotop instructors in the student forums.

460
00:44:04,898 --> 00:44:05,898
Really?

461
00:44:11,238 --> 00:44:13,738
I have something to take care of,
so I'm leaving work first.

462
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:15,238
I'll call you.

463
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:23,328
What brings you here?

464
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:27,338
I'm surprised
that you came to see me, Mr. Noh.

465
00:44:31,918 --> 00:44:33,048
I'm sorry.

466
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:37,468
Because of money?

467
00:44:40,348 --> 00:44:44,138
Wow, money is powerful indeed.

468
00:44:45,148 --> 00:44:47,358
It made you
come apologize to me right away.

469
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,858
My father was right.

470
00:44:56,658 --> 00:44:57,868
He said,

471
00:44:59,028 --> 00:45:01,948
I have to win at all costs to do business.

472
00:45:03,998 --> 00:45:06,078
I'm sorry, but it's too late.

473
00:45:07,248 --> 00:45:08,418
Please leave now.

474
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:12,338
Sooyeong.

475
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,468
Why didn't you just tell me then?

476
00:45:23,598 --> 00:45:25,478
Twelve years ago…

477
00:45:25,558 --> 00:45:26,688
If you had told me

478
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,358
back then,

479
00:45:31,608 --> 00:45:33,568
we wouldn't have been so heartbroken.

480
00:45:36,278 --> 00:45:37,868
Why did you take that on all by yourself?

481
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:45,288
I finally realized it.

482
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:47,538
The reason that you left me like that

483
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:49,628
was for me.

484
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,588
All the harsh things
you said to me that day…

485
00:45:54,008 --> 00:45:55,628
were all a lie.

486
00:45:59,678 --> 00:46:00,968
It took me so long to realize it.

487
00:46:04,058 --> 00:46:05,018
I'm sorry.

488
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,998
Oh, my. I made you wait a while.

489
00:47:14,088 --> 00:47:15,418
Not at all. Let's take my car.

490
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:29,018
The meeting location is quite far.

491
00:47:29,348 --> 00:47:30,598
Let's eat after.

492
00:47:30,888 --> 00:47:32,398
I'll bring you to a good restaurant.

493
00:47:32,478 --> 00:47:33,558
Sure. Sounds good.

494
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:36,438
May I charge my cell phone?

495
00:47:36,528 --> 00:47:37,818
Sure.

496
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:45,198
-It's inside the glove compartment.
-Okay.

497
00:47:45,278 --> 00:47:46,368
I have to make a quick call.

498
00:48:15,558 --> 00:48:16,478
Understood.

499
00:48:33,538 --> 00:48:35,748
I'm sorry. Shall we get going now?

500
00:48:35,828 --> 00:48:36,838
Sure.

501
00:48:53,478 --> 00:48:56,978
Because of you, my little sister died.

502
00:49:07,818 --> 00:49:09,278

507
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,248
Jo Jongoh.

508
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:59,748
How will you keep teaching at this rate?

509
00:50:00,378 --> 00:50:02,918
How is it
that you're always in last place?

510
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:08,508
You need to be useful as a person.
Otherwise, you turn into garbage.

511
00:50:09,758 --> 00:50:11,048
Garbage!

512
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:14,848
-He'll sit next to me.
-How burdensome.

513
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,518
-Hello.
-Hello.

514
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:17,888
Is something going on?

515
00:50:17,978 --> 00:50:20,308
The math genius Noh Gojin
joined our company.

516
00:50:20,938 --> 00:50:22,108
Noh Gojin?

517
00:50:22,268 --> 00:50:23,608
I heard he's incredible.

518
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,028
-He'll make us look bad.
-I know.

519
00:50:25,988 --> 00:50:27,988
-I heard he got last place again.
-He can hear you.

520
00:50:28,238 --> 00:50:30,988
-He might get fired.
-It must be tough.

521
00:50:31,068 --> 00:50:33,198
-He's always in last place.
-I feel bad for him.

522
00:50:33,288 --> 00:50:36,658
-I should worry about myself.
-We should do a good job ourselves.

523
00:50:36,788 --> 00:50:38,168
-Right.
-Here comes Noh Gojin.

524
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:05,898
Mr. Noh Gojin is quite amazing
when you observe him.

525
00:51:06,478 --> 00:51:09,608
He put together exams
and study guides within a few days.

526
00:51:10,408 --> 00:51:11,528
I think he's a real genius.

527
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:14,408
Sehee, I have a favor to ask.

528
00:51:25,128 --> 00:51:27,258
No. I really shouldn't be doing this.

529
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:31,968
Sehee, no one will suspect you
since you're not a math instructor.

530
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:35,178
If I can get a hold of that study guide,
I can be successful at another company.

531
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,308
Sehee, please help me just this once.

532
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,498
CSAT MATH PREP SUMMARY
BY NOH GOJIN

533
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,318
PLEASE WAIT

534
00:52:32,398 --> 00:52:33,408
I sent it all.

535
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:39,118
Jongoh, but this is
really the last time. Okay?

536
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,688
I'll record the conversation
for both of us.

537
00:53:05,268 --> 00:53:07,608
Okay. Please go ahead.

538
00:53:11,648 --> 00:53:12,648
I'm…

539
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:15,818
really sorry.

540
00:53:15,908 --> 00:53:18,618
Who did you send it to?

541
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,448
You're not a math instructor.

542
00:53:22,288 --> 00:53:23,958
You don't need a math study guide.

543
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:28,288
To my boyfriend.

544
00:53:28,378 --> 00:53:30,128
Does he work with us at Master Education?

545
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,088
No.

546
00:53:32,798 --> 00:53:34,468
He works at a different company.

547
00:53:36,928 --> 00:53:38,138
Ms. Oh Sehee.

548
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:41,388
I don't have
anything against you personally.

549
00:53:41,808 --> 00:53:43,638
I just want to correct the wrongful act.

550
00:53:44,018 --> 00:53:48,478
So bring me the person
who stole my study guide.

551
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,778
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

552
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:55,738
So please… forgive him.

553
00:53:55,898 --> 00:53:57,698
I beg for your forgiveness just this once.

554
00:53:57,778 --> 00:54:00,078
No, I can't forgive.

555
00:54:00,908 --> 00:54:04,698
A person who steals from someone else
shouldn't teach students.

556
00:54:06,998 --> 00:54:08,248
I'll give you a week.

557
00:54:09,248 --> 00:54:12,498
If your boyfriend doesn't speak up
for his wrongdoing himself,

558
00:54:13,588 --> 00:54:16,928
I'll make sure that for him,
this industry will no longer be an option.

559
00:54:17,508 --> 00:54:20,428
He'll never become an instructor.

560
00:54:27,268 --> 00:54:29,348
Let's go and apologize
to Mr. Noh together tomorrow.

561
00:54:30,108 --> 00:54:32,688
He'll forgive us for sure.
He said he'll give us a week.

562
00:54:33,318 --> 00:54:34,318
No.

563
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:36,188
Come on, Jongoh.

564
00:54:36,278 --> 00:54:38,148
D Academy already asked me
to work for them.

565
00:54:38,238 --> 00:54:41,068
I showed them Noh Gojin's study guide
and they wanted to sign immediately.

566
00:54:45,578 --> 00:54:46,618
Sehee.

567
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:49,078
I'm only going to succeed from now on.

568
00:54:49,668 --> 00:54:51,328
We can get married soon

569
00:54:52,128 --> 00:54:53,458
and become happy.

570
00:54:57,718 --> 00:55:00,588
No. We can't do this, Jongoh.

571
00:55:01,258 --> 00:55:03,968
I'll call Mr. Noh right now,
so let's apologize first.

572
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:06,678
This is why I hate you!

573
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,598
I'm so sick of you!

574
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:13,358
You're…

575
00:55:15,068 --> 00:55:16,608
sick of me?

576
00:55:17,238 --> 00:55:18,238
Yes.

577
00:55:20,238 --> 00:55:22,278
I'm really sick of you!

578
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:24,578
Look at our reality.

579
00:55:26,238 --> 00:55:28,908
All I have are credit card debts
and a small rented studio.

580
00:55:28,998 --> 00:55:31,118
And all you have are
a father with Alzheimer's

581
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:35,128
and a cowardly older brother who ran off
and dumped all the burden on you!

582
00:55:38,298 --> 00:55:40,678
So let's…

583
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:44,218
stop seeing each other.

584
00:55:47,348 --> 00:55:49,678
-What?
-If third-rate people stick together,

585
00:55:51,228 --> 00:55:52,938
they'll only live a third-rate life.

586
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,528
And as for the Noh Gojin issue,

587
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:00,818
you resolve it.

588
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,028
You're the one who stole his study guide.

589
00:56:04,988 --> 00:56:06,778
I only asked for a favor.

590
00:56:08,408 --> 00:56:09,698
You're the one…

591
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:11,998
who stole it.

592
00:57:36,668 --> 00:57:39,588
-It was her fault, but still.
-It's so terrible.

593
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:41,708
-She did steal it.
-Right.

594
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,178
Ms. Oh Sehee

595
00:57:54,018 --> 00:57:56,268
committed suicide by jumping yesterday.

596
00:58:47,198 --> 00:58:48,198
What are you getting at?

597
00:58:52,078 --> 00:58:53,328
What is this?

598
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,208
Who did you send it to?

599
00:58:59,868 --> 00:59:03,168
You're not a math instructor.
You don't need a math study guide.

600
00:59:04,548 --> 00:59:06,508
To my boyfriend.

601
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:11,048
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

602
00:59:11,588 --> 00:59:12,718
So please…

603
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:13,968
What is this conversation?

604
00:59:14,058 --> 00:59:15,348
…forgive him.

605
00:59:15,428 --> 00:59:18,058
Why is this different
from the recording I played for you?

606
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:21,148
No, I can't forgive.

607
00:59:21,228 --> 00:59:24,148
What the heck are you and Mr. Jo scheming?

608
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:33,738
I finally realized it.

609
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:36,408
The reason that you left me like that

610
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:39,078
was for me.

611
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:42,498
It took me so long to realize it.

612
00:59:45,628 --> 00:59:46,628
I'm sorry.

613
01:00:08,478 --> 01:00:09,988
What brings you here out of the blue?

614
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,108
Ms. Baek,

615
01:00:13,198 --> 01:00:16,578
why don't you stop now?

616
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:21,408
-Pardon?
-You're putting funding pressure on Gotop.

617
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,538
It's not right to ruin someone twice.

618
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:30,338
What do you mean by that?

619
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:35,138
Noh Gojin tried to commit suicide,
but survived.

620
01:00:35,888 --> 01:00:37,138
He's very resilient.

621
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:39,308
He wouldn't try
to kill himself with sleeping pills

622
01:00:39,808 --> 01:00:41,558
just because he got fired for forgery.

623
01:00:43,518 --> 01:00:44,898
I'm sure it was because of you.

624
01:00:46,608 --> 01:00:49,278
If this is Chairman Baek's doing again,

625
01:00:50,148 --> 01:00:51,608
please relay this message to him.

626
01:00:52,568 --> 01:00:54,028
This time, I, Park Yangtae,

627
01:00:55,488 --> 01:00:56,868
am taking Noh Gojin's side.

628
01:01:07,248 --> 01:01:08,248
He tried to…

629
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,008
kill himself because of me?

630
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:15,338
That means…

631
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:20,058
I wasn't protecting you.

632
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,958
May I charge my cell phone?

633
01:01:44,038 --> 01:01:45,918
-It's inside the glove compartment.
-Okay.

634
01:01:45,998 --> 01:01:47,078
I have to make a quick call.

635
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,758
You weren't curious last time?

636
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:01,508
-About what?
-When I left work first.

637
01:02:03,308 --> 01:02:05,978
Sometimes you have to leave first
if you need to do something.

638
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:10,938
One second.

639
01:02:20,068 --> 01:02:21,738
Is something wrong?

640
01:02:23,288 --> 01:02:27,618
No. Everything will be fine,
so don't worry.

641
01:02:29,038 --> 01:02:30,328
I'll get going now.

642
01:02:49,728 --> 01:02:52,018
"Everything will be fine"?

643
01:02:53,568 --> 01:02:54,818
What did he mean by that?

644
01:03:46,868 --> 01:03:47,948
Jo Jongoh.

645
01:04:26,278 --> 01:04:28,288
