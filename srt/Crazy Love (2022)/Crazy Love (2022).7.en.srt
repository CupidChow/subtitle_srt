1
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,980
CRAZY LOVE

THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

3
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,970
Come here, my little puppy.
Let's have a snack.

4
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
Okay.

5
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,570
It's hot. Blow on it first, okay?

6
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,740
Dip it in sugar too.

7
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,960
Is it yummy?

8
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,710
Yes.

9
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,900
You can do it

10
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,440
-All right!
-Great!

11
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,450
He's so much better than you.

12
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,990
That was great.

13
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,330
Here you go.

14
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,450
Your stomach will hurt.

15
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,620
Come on. Eat up.
They're all heavy drinkers.

16
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,250
Come on. Eat it now.

17
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,300
-Go ahead and eat.
-This is great.

18
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,510
What's wrong with you? Are you drunk?

19
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,220
You'll end up crawling home.

20
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,520
Hey, don't give him any more drinks.

21
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,310
-Hey.
-Isn't it tasty?

22
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,350
Lie down and rest.

23
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,940
-Give me more booze!
-Yes.

24
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,360
Here you go.

25
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,320
Son-in-law?

26
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,490
-Have another.
-Pour me some more!

27
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,490
Look at this guy.

28
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,130
Even if you were to offer 1,000 boxes
of potatoes, you can't buy this car.

29
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,840
Let's toss these potatoes.

30
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,470
I'm not throwing away the potatoes.
I'm throwing away this worthless car.

31
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,220
Even if you were to offer me
1,000 truckloads of these darn cars,

32
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,970
I wouldn't exchange them for my potatoes.

33
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,560
So go back on your own.

34
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,650
Was I too mean?

35
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,160
No, I wasn't mean.

36
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,490
It wasn't mean at all.

37
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,850
EPISODE 7

38
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,320
MS. LEE SINA

39
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,620
MS. LEE SINA

40
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,620
Why should I?

41
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,210
Why should I apologize?

42
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,290
I'm not crazy.

43
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,250
She was an eyesore anyway. This is great.

44
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,590
Because of that darn amnesia,
it was like living in hell.

45
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,970
I love it!

46
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,680
This is heaven!

47
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,230
I'm free!

48
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,270
I'm free.

49
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm free.

50
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,760
I could also die…

51
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,260
tomorrow…

52
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,180
while crossing the street, right?

53
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Yes.

54
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,610
But…

55
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,110
what am I doing right now?

56
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,240
Live for yourself.

57
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,950
For myself?

58
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,460
For yourself,

59
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,420
look up at the sky,

60
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,800
look at the flowers,

61
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,800
sing songs,

62
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,430
and dance too.

63
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,810
Just for yourself.

64
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,400
That's how you should die, Sina.

65
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,040
What am I doing here?

66
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,040
What was I thinking?

67
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,790
Why did I come here?

68
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,760
You brat, it's so late!

69
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,850
I don't want to go home today.

70
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,020
Hey, why are you so wasted?

71
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,730
I'm going to marry you.

72
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,850
-What?
-Sir.

73
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,650
-It's not like that.
-You punk!

74
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,900
You darn punk!

75
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,320
-Please.
-Out of my way, I'm going to kill you!

76
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,530
That's nonsense, you punk.

77
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,320
Okay, understood.

78
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,240
You punk.

79
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,630
He's human after all.

80
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,180
Even Mr. Noh Manners

81
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,600
is a human like me.

82
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,640
He licks the lid
of the yogurt cup like me,

83
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,020
wears a T-shirt
with a stretched-out collar like me,

84
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,900
and laughs… like me too.

85
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,300
Yes.

86
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,060
It wasn't your fault…

87
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,810
that I'm dying.

88
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,990
It wasn't anyone's fault.

89
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,000
Now…

90
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,620
I'll forgive you.

91
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,980
What's wrong?

92
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,560
Why isn't she coming back?

93
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,770
Please find my mom for me.

94
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,150
Your mom called.

95
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,400
When is she coming?

96
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,660
What am I looking there for?

97
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,070
She's never coming back
because she doesn't want to see you.

98
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,490
Liar!

99
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,250
Hey, potato!

100
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
Why isn't

101
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,220
Lee Sina coming?

102
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,990
Why should I wait for her?

103
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,490
I'm not waiting for her.

104
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,380
So you didn't come home after all.

105
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,910
Oh, you're up.

106
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,160
What took you so long?

107
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,000
Were you waiting for me?

108
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,130
Why would I wait for you?

109
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,130
It was just a question.

110
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,010
I got back so late, so I couldn't come.

111
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,470
Sorry to make you wait.

112
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,180
-I said, I wasn't waiting for you.
-Okay, then.

113
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,560
I'm serious. I really wasn't waiting.

114
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,860
Okay, I heard you. Sit down and eat.

115
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,420
Here you go. Enjoy.

116
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,550
What is she doing all of a sudden?
Did she poison it?

117
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,230
What's wrong?

118
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,230
It should taste good.

119
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,900
Aren't you going to eat?

120
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,340
By the way,

121
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,470
why do you hate onions?

122
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,140
Actually, you used to really hate onions.

123
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,230
About you liking onions…

124
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,400
I lied to try to fix your eating habit.

125
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,320
I always wondered

126
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,110
why you hate onions so much.
They're sweet and delicious.

127
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,200
Oh, right. You don't remember.

128
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,580
I guess I won't get an answer.

129
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,790
Please go ahead and eat.

130
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,190
Let's eat, my little puppy.

131
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,740
It's onions every day.

132
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,290
I hate onions.

133
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,950
I want ham.

134
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,290
I want ham!

135
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,380
I'm not eating.

136
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,310
-Hey, it's onion boy!
-Onion boy!

137
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,350
Hey, did you eat onions again today?

138
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,730
-Did you?
-Right?

139
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,810
-Gosh, he stinks.
-He stinks.

140
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,860
-He stinks!
-Stinky!

141
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,510
Life is…

142
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,970
shorter than you think.

143
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,810
Say sorry when you're sorry,

144
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,060
say thank you when you're thankful,

145
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,270
and try things you used to hate too.
Try that, okay?

146
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,820
If you try eating onions
without any memories of them,

147
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,610
perhaps you'll learn to like them.

148
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,580
Please eat slowly and come later.

149
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,000
I'll take the subway to work.

150
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,710
I need to buy snacks
for the research team.

151
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,950
Hello, sir.

152
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,170
He's finally back to himself again.

153
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,190
GOTOP EDUCATION

154
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,910
My goodness. I'm sorry.

155
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,000
Say sorry when you're sorry,

156
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,620
say thank you when you're thankful…

157
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
I'm so sorry--

158
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,800
I'm… also sorry.

159
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,690
"Sorry"? Did he just--

160
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,740
MIRACLE ENGLISH
MICHELLE LEE

161
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,040
Hyesun, what's wrong?

162
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,420
Maybe he lost his mind.

163
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,880
Did that darn Mr. Noh Manners
curse at you?

164
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,590
No.

165
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,840
Then what?

166
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,010
He said… sorry.

167
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,930
He said sorry!

168
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,180
-What?
-What?

169
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,120
There must be a hidden meaning
when someone suddenly acts strange.

170
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,500
After throwing a fuss and leaving
because of the potatoes,

171
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,620
she suddenly serves me fancy meat dishes
with an angelic face?

172
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,340
What's the hidden meaning behind that?

173
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,850
It's me. Let's meet now.

174
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,780
Hello.

175
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,820
I'll have a seat.

176
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,290
Where did you… How…

177
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,790
I'm the top private detective.

178
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,180
Mr. Joo Junpal.

179
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,690
How do you know my name?

180
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,560
Crosschecking is a must.

181
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,320
I have my sources too.

182
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,690
You can call me John.

183
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,450
John.

184
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,410
I'm quite impressed with your work so far.

185
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,540
Let's sign an official contract.

186
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,500
That's an excellent decision.

187
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,960
I don't sign contracts
with anyone just for money.

188
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,500
You're a lucky one.

189
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,420
Let's see.

190
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,640
The top private investigator always has

191
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,770
everything ready perfectly.

192
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,350
CLIENT: NOH GOJIN
AGENT: JOHN (JOO JUNPAL)

193
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,450
Let's proceed to the next step.

194
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,540
Okay, then.

195
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,830
Wait!

196
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,290
Is this the latest fashion trend?

197
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,090
What are you doing?

198
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,210
Wait. Please hold still for a second.

199
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,840
Let's see. What's the exact width?
About this much.

200
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,640
About this much.
There are holes every 5.5cm apart.

201
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,860
-Oh--
-Hello, sir.

202
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,320
It isn't time for cleaning yet, is it?

203
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,950
I… asked him to do it.

204
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,910
Because I spilled coffee earlier.

205
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,500
Is that so?

206
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,210
All done, sir.

207
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,770
What's going on?

208
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,150
I think it'll be difficult
to request bail for Mr. Kang Min.

209
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,730
Is that right?

210
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,940
I feel bad.

211
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,660
I feel bad too.

212
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,240
But you've done everything you could
by writing a petition.

213
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,950
What Mr. Kang Min really needs

214
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,040
isn't to be released on bail,
but your forgiveness.

215
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,790
You've already forgiven him.

216
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,040
So don't worry about him anymore.

217
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,880
Hello!

218
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,720
-Hello.
-Hello…

219
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,640
Please have this when you get hungry.

220
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,230
And juice too.

221
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,980
Yes, thank you.

222
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,020
Okay.

223
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:00,170
DEPUTY CEO, OH SEGI

224
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,190
Hello, sir? It's me.

225
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,940
Please don't file…

226
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,320
Mr. Kang Min's petition.

227
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,580
And please watch him carefully
to see if he requests bail.

228
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,160
From now on, please report all matters
regarding Mr. Kang Min to me.

229
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,250
Yes. Please make sure
not to report to Mr. Noh.

230
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,920
What's most important right now
is for Mr. Noh to regain his health.

231
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,390
I don't wish to involve
Mr. Noh with this anymore.

232
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,930
Yes, please. Thank you. Bye.

233
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,830
-Would you like a sandwich?
-Thank you.

234
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,330
-And a juice.
-Thank you.

235
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,790
-Please have a sandwich.
-Thank you.

236
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,920
No, it's okay. I'll hand them out, ma'am.

237
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,050
I meant, Ms. Lee.

238
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,220
Thank you!

239
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,390
Thank you.

240
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,060
-Here is some juice too.
-Thank you.

241
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,860
Thank you.

242
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,530
Here is some juice too. Please enjoy.

243
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,280
Okay.

244
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,410
Ms. Sina.

245
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,580
Yes?

246
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,630
I'm so sorry about that day.

247
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,710
Something very urgent came up.

248
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,170
It's okay. Please don't worry about it.

249
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,840
My goodness.

250
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,720
Thank you so much for your understanding.

251
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,310
As a token of my apology,
I'll treat you to a meal.

252
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,680
How's lunch today?

253
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:17,850
I appreciate the gesture,

254
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,480
but I don't have time
as I have a lot to take care of.

255
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,190
I see. You have a lot to take care of.

256
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,740
I guess you're very busy.

257
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
What was that?

258
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,700
She thinks she's all that now?

259
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,700
She hasn't even married him yet,

260
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,750
but she thinks she's the head of Gotop?

261
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,620
Gosh.

262
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,840
She's annoying.

263
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,340
Oh my god!

264
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,510
You aren't jealous

265
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,760
of someone else getting married
just because you're divorced, right?

266
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,390
-What did you say?
-I mean,

267
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:03,440
it just seems like
you're very jealous of Ms. Lee, you know?

268
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,240
By the way, are those knockoffs?

269
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,570
I have the same pair,

270
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,950
but they look a bit different from mine.

271
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,500
I'm sure they aren't knockoffs.

272
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,040
You even own a building, Ms. Ma.
You just work for fun.

273
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,170
There's no way those are knockoffs, right?

274
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,720
Of course not.

275
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,050
I'm so jealous.

276
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,940
GOTOP EDUCATION INSTRUCTOR MICHELLE LEE

277
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,070
She used to crawl before me
and didn't dare make eye contact.

278
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,610
She's forgotten about her early days.

279
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,120
How dare she.

280
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:43,910
DIRECTOR MA EUNJUNG

281
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,540
Hello?

282
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,630
Yes.

283
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,510
Understood.

284
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,930
I said, I understand.

285
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,430
I'll wire the money tomorrow!

286
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,660
She wouldn't have done that
to my other clothes, right?

287
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,090
What… What in the world?

288
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,060
5.5cm.

289
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,190
Mr. Noh loves everything to be 5.5cm.

290
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,070
Pop, pop.

291
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,990
Lee Sina…

292
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,180
What the heck?

293
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,510
What the heck is this?

294
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,510
I'll give you a nice haircut.

295
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,100
You'll look pretty.

296
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,060
Why?

297
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,730
Why?

298
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,980
Why do they look like cucumbers?

299
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,490
Lee Sina.

300
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,080
Lee Sina!

301
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,180
I thought I'd feel better.

302
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,850
Why do I feel so down?

303
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,030
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

304
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,450
Ms. Lee.

305
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,330
I mean, I was a little surprised
that you wanted to see me, ma'am.

306
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,210
I called you because
it's a little hard to talk at the office.

307
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,630
Sorry. I know you're busy.

308
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,340
Not at all. Please call me anytime.

309
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,430
I wanted to see you because…

310
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,480
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

311
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,900
A resignation--

312
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,200
I thought it'd be better
to give it to you than Mr. Noh.

313
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,200
Why…

314
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,210
It must be tough looking after Gojin
while working as a secretary too.

315
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,710
I'm sorry I didn't realize that sooner.

316
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,170
No, not at all.
I'm the one that should apologize.

317
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,840
You shouldn't apologize to me.

318
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,510
I'm sorry for not being thoughtful

319
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,640
while you've been taking
good care of Gojin.

320
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,850
You'll do a handover, right?

321
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,970
Since you know Gojin very well,

322
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,230
please give lots of guidance
to his new secretary.

323
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,110
Will do.

324
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,780
Job poaching?

325
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,570
Are you suggesting we poach an instructor
from another company when we just opened?

326
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,870
They'll hate us.

327
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,750
It's to bring good talents to Baek Edu.

328
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:38,790
Other companies will
poach our instructors too.

329
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,630
You're right. Baek Edu isn't a charity.

330
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,840
We should try harder
since we're a newcomer.

331
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:49,800
Please run with it.

332
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,720
What's next?

333
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,770
You have an advertisement meeting.

334
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,520
But you need to go to the hospital first.

335
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,480
Hospital? What hosp--

336
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,320
Is he in the hospital again?

337
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,700
A hospital isn't a hotel.

338
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,990
It's a place for the ill.

339
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,410
That depends on the user.

340
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,920
To me, it's a hotel
where my kids come to greet me.

341
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,630
Since I have, I'll get going now.

342
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,130
I heard you're traveling far.
Have a safe trip.

343
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,680
When will you take over Gotop
or whatever it's called?

344
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,270
I just launched Baek Edu.

345
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,940
Are you asking me to run
when I haven't even learned to walk yet?

346
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:47,110
Besides, we're in the education business.

347
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,280
We're here to coexist
with other companies,

348
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,490
not to take them over.

349
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,830
How idiotic. To run a business,
you need to take over others.

350
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,830
Rest well.

351
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,340
If you want something,
go get it no matter what it takes,

352
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,760
and if you can't have it,
destroy it so that no one else can!

353
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,350
That's how it works
in the real business realm and real life!

354
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,560
That's the way you do things, Father.

355
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,730
You establish schools
saying you'll educate people

356
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,100
to invest in real estate
and erect buildings.

357
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,020
You use your kids' marriages to get rich.

358
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,400
And you take over weak companies
to be called a darn chairman.

359
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,990
I don't do business like that.

360
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,490
I'll never live my life like that either.

361
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:35,530
Let's wait and see if you do or not.

362
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,700
You're just like me.

363
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,500
That's why you got married
even though you loved someone else.

364
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,210
No.

365
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,130
I'm not like you, Father.

366
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,340
Just like you protected your company
using my marriage,

367
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,970
I protected my love…

368
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,470
with that marriage too.

369
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,600
That was the only way
I was able to protect it!

370
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,310
Love?

371
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,860
Ma'am, are you all right?

372
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,990
I'm fine.

373
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,950
We'll be late for the meeting. Let's go.

374
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,170
Actually, I'm not okay.

375
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,260
I need my medicine.

376
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,840
I'll get you some water.

377
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,930
No.

378
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,300
A different kind.

379
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,040
MR. NOH MANNERS IS AN IDIOT
THIS CAR IS A PIECE OF CRAP

380
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,460
Just five minutes, please.

381
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,130
What do you want?

382
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,300
My handkerchief.

383
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,930
Give me back my handkerchief.

384
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,970
Oh, that? I threw it away.

385
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,770
You threw it away?

386
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,060
How much was it? I'll pay for it.

387
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,400
You need to respect other people's stuff.

388
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,780
If you lost it, you should apologize.

389
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:02,410
Fine! I'll buy you one, okay?

390
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,410
Wait.

391
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,790
Hold it right there.

392
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,130
Just five minutes.

393
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,550
I won't ask you
to pay for the handkerchief,

394
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,350
so please let me hide like this
just for five minutes.

395
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,310
I did a terrible job teaching today.

396
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,190
The students asked me questions,

397
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,610
but I couldn't answer any of them.

398
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,030
I feel so embarrassed.

399
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,370
My forehead feels hot too.

400
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,290
I'm so embarrassed.

401
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,340
My forehead feels so hot.

402
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,600
I did this once,

403
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,980
and I felt completely better.

404
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:31,160
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING KBCS NEWS

405
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,580
How annoying!

406
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,630
Noh Gojin, that punk.

407
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,340
-Sir.
-What do you want?

408
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,090
I told you, no one was allowed in!

409
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,430
I thought you should really see this.

410
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:48,930
What is it?

411
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,560
They're from the department store.

412
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,140
Department store?

413
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,490
My precious--

414
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,740
Do this to all of them,

415
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,370
and send them
to the CEO's office at Ilpum Edu.

416
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:19,540
Noh Gojin, that punk. He really sent them!

417
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,710
Noh Gojin! You're dead meat!

418
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,910
Oh my, honey.

419
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,670
Jeez, how could anyone live
without someone to hug?

420
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,790
Gosh, Lee Sina, you're crazy.
I'm going to lose my mind.

421
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,460
Why would you lose your mind?

422
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,210
You startled me!

423
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,840
What are you doing?

424
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,800
Prepping for my audition.

425
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,390
What happened to the female ghost role?
Why a grandma?

426
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,930
I didn't get that role.

427
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,220
No need to console me.

428
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:59,520
To actors, it's just a part
of everyday living.

429
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,400
By the way, Okhee. By any chance…

430
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:15,580
when you're playing a role,
do you start liking your counterpart?

431
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,580
Of course. Some couples even get married.

432
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,960
But that's only 1% of the cases.

433
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,210
The rest are just delusional
from playing their roles.

434
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,500
-That's how it is, right?
-Yes.

435
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:30,720
Right. My heart is just beating faster
because I'm going to die soon.

436
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,010
Why do you ask? Do you like
your hubby Mr. Noh Manners?

437
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,100
No!

438
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,850
Why would I like Mr. Noh Manners?
That's nonsense!

439
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:47,730
Fine. If you don't like him, that's that.
Why do you have to get so upset? Jeez.

440
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,120
Your last show was so fun to watch.

441
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,410
I even watched the rerun.

442
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,080
So, I heard

443
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:08,630
that Mr. Noh won't be
on the show for a while.

444
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,800
Then who's going to fill that role?

445
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,180
Gosh! It hasn't been decided yet?

446
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:18,770
Then let's go for a round of golf soon.

447
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:21,930
I looked into
a really amazing golf course,

448
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,310
so we just need to set a date, okay?

449
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,110
I look forward to your call then.

450
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,610
You startled me.

451
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,650
Who were you talking to

452
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,870
that you're so startled
as if you got caught red-handed?

453
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,330
Why were you eavesdropping, Chabae?

454
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,750
No, I wasn't. This meeting room
isn't your personal space.

455
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,170
Who is calling me?

456
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:48,170
Hello?

457
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,130
Who?

458
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,420
Baek Edu, I see.

459
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:58,220
I'll try to find some time soon. Okay.

460
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,270
Baek Edu? Why are they calling you?

461
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,190
New companies are all the same.

462
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,610
They're poaching. It's nothing new to us.

463
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:11,780
What's wrong? They didn't call you?

464
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,110
Of course, they called.
They called me too.

465
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,410
They called you? I see.

466
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,160
So they did. All right.
Well, that's that then.

467
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,040
That arrogant punk.

468
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,960
What goes up must come down, you punk!

469
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:34,170
You'll wither away soon too.

470
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,970
Baek… Baek Edu.

471
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,560
Baek…

472
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,030
Who are you?

473
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,240
Hello. I've been newly assigned
as your secretary--

474
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,200
Wait!

475
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,580
You've been newly assigned
as my secretary?

476
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,870
Yes, sir.

477
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,290
How did you get newly assigned here?

478
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,150
ENGINEERING
NATURAL SCIENCES

479
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,230
What's with you lately?
You always had to work late.

480
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,900
But you came early
for Mom's death anniversary

481
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:39,450
and came here today too.

482
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,740
How do you have so much free--

483
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,000
Did you get fired?

484
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,500
Hey.

485
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,670
Here.

486
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,960
-What's that?
-An allowance.

487
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:58,090
Allowance?

488
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:04,890
Why is it so much?

489
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,100
I'm sorry for everything.

490
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:12,190
Keep doing acting that you love so much.

491
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:20,150
He's big, but he's still a baby.

492
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,630
Why are you home so late?

493
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:39,760
How come you're here again?
Is something wrong?

494
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,880
Jeez, why is everyone
asking the same thing?

495
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,010
Why did you give us so many potatoes?

496
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,720
You worked so hard.
You shouldn't just give them away.

497
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,440
He's my new son. That was nothing.

498
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,770
I'd gladly give him even more.

499
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:55,650
How is my son-in-law?

500
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:59,650
Well… Aren't you hungry? Let's eat.

501
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,200
Wow.

502
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,040
You cooked so much.

503
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,130
I put a lot in the refrigerator.
Heat them up and eat, okay?

504
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:16,340
Don't eat just kimchi
because you can't be bothered.

505
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,460
Don't worry about me. I can feed myself.

506
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:23,380
Dad.

507
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:24,680
Yes?

508
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:29,810
Don't you have any
good lady friends at all?

509
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,520
What do you mean?

510
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,560
You should get remarried, Dad.

511
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,770
Jeez, Dad.

512
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,780
Have some water.

513
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,660
It's lonely eating alone.

514
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:47,280
Sooho will go his own way
once he graduates too.

515
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:49,160
You'll really be left alone.

516
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,660
I won't be alone.

517
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,580
I'll have my potatoes and cabbages too.

518
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,210
It'd be nice if you had a companion too.

519
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:58,000
Don't talk nonsense.

520
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:01,510
Don't worry about me,
and marry my future son-in-law soon, okay?

521
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,340
What now?

522
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,760
Nothing.

523
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,270
Is something… troubling you?

524
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,860
Even when things are hard,
don't blame others and endure it, okay?

525
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,400
You must endure to receive blessings.

526
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,450
You may think that
I'm just a nagging old man now,

527
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,160
but if you endure it all,

528
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:32,290
you'll realize one day that I was right.

529
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,330
You're right.

530
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,170
Everything you're saying is right, Dad.

531
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,720
It was no one's fault.

532
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,850
So,

533
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,140
don't blame anyone either, Dad.

534
00:48:58,690 --> 00:48:59,610
Blame what?

535
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:01,610
Well,

536
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,150
just in case something happens later.

537
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:08,820
When I die.

538
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,410
I don't blame anyone.

539
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,290
How am I going to die…

540
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,000
leaving you behind alone?

541
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,300
Dad.

542
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,720
I'm sorry for dying before you.

543
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,080
Is…

544
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,500
Mr. Joo Junpal here?

545
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:58,970
John?

546
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:30,130
I drove here.

547
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:32,220
It's non-alcoholic.

548
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,060
It's quite tasty.

549
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,780
This is Mr. Lee Yonggu, Lee Sina's father.

550
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:52,820
This is her brother Lee Sooho.

551
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,450
Borrowings from relatives to note.

552
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,200
None.

553
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,290
What? They don't have
any financial issues?

554
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,160
No, not at all.

555
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,380
And what Mr. Kang Min said was true.

556
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,590
There's no connection
between Ms. Lee Sina and Mr. Kang Min.

557
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,920
I'm sure that they're not accomplices.

558
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,010
And please take a look at this.

559
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,520
This is the path Ms. Lee Sina took
and her current location.

560
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,060
I put a tracker on her then.

561
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,530
GPS TRACKER
INSTALLING…

562
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:42,950
At 1200, she met her brother
Sooho at Baekga University.

563
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,370
At 1300, she met her father.

564
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,960
Currently, she's back in Seoul.

565
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,130
And please take a look at this too.

566
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,960
I took these pictures myself this morning.

567
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,470
I didn't find anything strange at all.

568
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:57,220
Wait.

569
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:05,850
You're wrong. There is something strange.

570
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,070
It's as I had expected.

571
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:19,570
The hidden meaning behind
the strange behavior was that she'll soon…

572
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,700
run away.

573
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,970
Seoul is so beautiful.

574
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,300
Is this your first time in Seoul?

575
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,140
No.

576
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:48,060
I've lived here for five years,
but never realized it.

577
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:52,900
I've always thought it was so cold here,

578
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,780
but it's actually quite warm.

579
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,360
That's why people live like fools.

580
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:04,160
What's so important that we live
without even noticing our surroundings?

581
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:06,950
You're right.

582
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,580
I lived like such a fool.

583
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,460
Now that I'm leaving soon,
I finally realized it.

584
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,550
You must be moving away?

585
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:22,890
Yes.

586
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:28,770
I think I'll be leaving soon.

587
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:42,410
Ms. Lee Sina never called back after that?

588
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,370
No, sir.

589
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:46,700
She can't just stay in denial.

590
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:49,750
Maybe she's getting treated
at another hospital?

591
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:51,500
I think so too.

592
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,540
She wouldn't be
able to live everyday life.

593
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:55,960
You can't endure that level of pain
just on painkillers.

594
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,340
That's true.

595
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,510
-Sir, you can't do that!
-Let go. I need to see the doctor!

596
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,300
-You can't go in now!
-Where is the doctor?

597
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,550
-Get out of my way!
-May I help you?

598
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,970
-Oh my.
-Hey.

599
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,930
-You said my daughter was fine.
-Sir, please.

600
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,560
You said nothing was wrong with her.

601
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,850
Then how can she have cancer?
Why does she have final-stage cancer?

602
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,270
Sir, please calm down and explain.

603
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,150
How can I calm down, you quack?

604
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:27,660
A scan from another hospital shows
that she has cancer. Do you see that?

605
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,200
Let me take a look first, okay?

606
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,170

00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:42,800

MEDICAL RECORD

LEE SINA, LEE SINAE

610
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,060
Sir, what do we do?

611
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,690
The MRI images of Ms. Lee Sina
and Ms. Lee Sinae

612
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:01,070
were taken on the same day,

613
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,280
and got switched.

614
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,780
How could you make such a mistake?

615
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:06,990
I'm so sorry!

616
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:10,740
They had similar names
and even the same birthday, so…

617
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,750
Now. Please call her now!

618
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:14,830
Yes, sir.

JOONGYANG STUDIO

620
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,090
Welcome.

621
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:25,590
I came…

622
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:28,510
to take a picture.

623
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:30,600
What kind of a picture?

624
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,980
My last picture.

625
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,320
Okay, I'll take it now.

626
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:44,570
Okay.

627
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,160
One, two…

628
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,080
I'm sorry.

629
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:03,170
Hello?

630
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,340
Ms. Lee Sina?

631
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,840
Yes, speaking.

632
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,800
I'm calling from Gwangae Hospital.

633
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:18,310
-Ms. Lee Sina.
-What do you mean?

634
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,770
Please, have a seat first.

635
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,230
What do you mean?

636
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:27,030
I'm… I'm sorry.

637
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,370
It turns out that
you don't have glioblastoma.

638
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,330
This is… the scan of your brain.

639
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,710
The person handling the scans

640
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
accidentally switched yours
with a glioblastoma patient's scan.

641
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:47,970
Does that mean…

642
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,390
I won't die?

643
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,810
That's correct.

644
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,350
It was a misdiagnosis.

645
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:59,810
I'm so sorry.

646
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:25,750
Thank God.

647
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,130
Thank you so much!

648
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,390
Thank you. Thank you so much!

649
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:34,430
I'm not going to die!

650
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,890
I can grow old like you too.

651
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:38,140
I'll have gray hair someday!

652
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,890
I'm not going to die!

653
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:43,440
I'm not going to die.

Lee Sina!

657
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,480
You're dead meat now.

658
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:13,840
Where are you going, honey?

659
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,260
Where are you going? It's very late.

660
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,760
Are you going somewhere far?

661
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:06,180
No…

662
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:09,390
I'm just… going home briefly.

663
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,690
I see. Okay.

664
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,110
All right. See you later.

665
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,360
Okay, then.

666
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,660
Wait.

667
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,500
I need to tell you something.

668
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:32,210
Okay. What is it?

669
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,540
It's something very important.

670
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:48,140
By the way,

671
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,850
I actually don't have…

672
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:06,530
…amnesia.

673
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,370
