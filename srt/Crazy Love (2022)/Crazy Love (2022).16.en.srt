00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:10,928
CRAZY LOVE

2
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:32,908
CRAZY LOVE

3
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:36,248
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:48,298
Jo Jongoh.

5
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:52,848
FINAL EPISODE

6
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:56,388
You sent an anonymous letter
filled with lies to Oh Segi

7
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:58,478
and instigated Kang Min

8
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:01,188
to kill me.

9
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:07,528
Why'd you do it?

10
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:09,738
Because

11
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:12,198
you ruined my life.

12
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:13,948
What?

13
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,248
Who ruined whose life?

14
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,998
Ms. Oh Sehee died because of you.

15
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:21,498
Sehee would've died anyway

16
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:24,548
regardless of me.

17
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:28,378
Having a father with Alzheimer's
was more than burdensome,

18
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:32,468
yet her older brother ran off
using his studies abroad as an excuse.

19
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:37,058
Her life was pathetic,
filled with nothing but burden.

20
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:40,148
Rather than living a painful life

21
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:42,358
with no hope whatsoever,

22
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,278
perhaps it's good that she died.

23
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,078
How can you say that as a human?

24
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:57,828
Right, talented people like you
wouldn't understand

25
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:00,668
what my life was like

26
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:03,668
being treated like garbage.

27
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:07,088
If you hadn't acted so holier-than-thou

28
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:09,378
and had just let it slide then,

29
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:12,678
Sehee wouldn't have died

30
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,768
and my life wouldn't have been
so ruined like this.

31
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:19,638
You're the one who ruined your own life.

32
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:20,938
Nonsense!

33
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:24,568
Noh Gojin.

34
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:28,398
If you disappear,

35
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:31,108
my life will get better again.

36
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,368
You killed my sister?

37
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,998
You scumbag!

38
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:33,378
What the heck are you and Mr. Jo scheming?

39
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:35,598
I want to know

40
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:38,218
why Jo Jongoh did this too.

41
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:41,558
Let's hear it together.

42
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:44,398
Directly from Jo Jongoh himself.

43
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:49,688
I need more part-timers to write comments.

44
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,398
And please contact a few reporters

45
00:03:52,488 --> 00:03:54,738
to spread fake news about Gotop.

46
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:57,238
Hello?

47
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,078
Hello--

48
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,018
One second.

49
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:56,438
SEGI

50
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:59,908
Mr. Jo is waiting in your parking lot.

51
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,248
Mr. Jo Jongoh.

52
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:18,508
You're under arrest for online libel
and instigating bodily harm.

53
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:28,848
Take him.

54
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:08,138
I told you not to get worked up, didn't I?

55
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,318
I'm sorry, Gojin.

56
00:07:24,238 --> 00:07:25,198
I'm sorry too.

57
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:27,488
You have no reason to apologize.

58
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,328
I'm the one who did awful things to you.

59
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:33,328
As Jo Jongoh said,

60
00:07:34,828 --> 00:07:37,298
if I had just let it slide back then,

61
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,008
perhaps Ms. Sehee…

62
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:48,928
My heart aches when I think about that.

63
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:53,438
No… You didn't do anything wrong.

64
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,148
I'm… I'm the terrible jerk.

65
00:07:58,148 --> 00:07:59,478
I'm the one…

66
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:02,448
I'm the one…

67
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:07,738
who abandoned Sehee.

68
00:08:36,228 --> 00:08:37,518
No.

69
00:08:38,228 --> 00:08:40,938
Everything will be fine, so don't worry.

70
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:48,318
Sir.

71
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:00,208
You didn't tell me you were coming.

72
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:02,838
Is something wrong?

73
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:06,878
No. But is everything okay with you?

74
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,938
I can't believe it.

75
00:09:27,148 --> 00:09:29,698
Why didn't you tell me?

76
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,028
I'm sorry.

77
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:33,328
I was going to tell you
when things settled down.

78
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,408
Then,

79
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,288
the two of you
can be friends again, right?

80
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:44,878
If that's the case,
I'll let it go just this once.

81
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,258
Thank you for understanding.

82
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:54,348
Don't go to work today
and take good care of Mr. Oh.

83
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,848
He must be having a hard time
after going through that.

84
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,608
I'll head out now.

85
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:09,858
Are you leaving because of me?
I was about to leave.

86
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:12,118
No, I need to go to work.

87
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:13,488
Bye.

88
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,828
Thank you for driving me to work.

89
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:01,958
You aren't upset, are you?

90
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:06,668
No. I got to come to work
with such a great person.

91
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,338
I'm relieved.

92
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:13,468
-Sorry?
-I'm relieved that I get to see you

93
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:15,428
smiling like this again.

94
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:20,938
Mr. Noh was really sad
about what happened.

95
00:11:23,018 --> 00:11:25,478
You didn't know
I was a fan of yours, did you?

96
00:11:26,648 --> 00:11:30,108
You encouraged me greatly not to give up
on my dream of becoming an instructor.

97
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,908
It really meant a lot to me.

98
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:37,538
I'm rooting for you a lot too,

99
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:39,288
so please overcome it.

100
00:12:17,658 --> 00:12:18,738
Why did you do it?

101
00:12:22,328 --> 00:12:23,828
Why did you try to kill yourself?

102
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:39,428
Do you even know why I left you back then?

103
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:43,308
I wanted to protect you.

104
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:47,688
I was so afraid and terrified
that you might get hurt

105
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,688
because of my father,

106
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:53,528
so I left to protect you at all costs.

107
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:56,408
But how could you do such a foolish thing?

108
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:57,988
Why would you kill yourself?

109
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,868
Baek Sooyeong was…

110
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:02,908
the world to Noh Gojin then.

111
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,088
But I'm still alive

112
00:13:11,128 --> 00:13:12,088
and doing well.

113
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:19,298
What do I do now?

114
00:13:21,308 --> 00:13:23,678
I can't even resent you anymore.

115
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:26,638
How am I supposed to get revenge?

116
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:30,478
What on earth do I do now?

117
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:34,568
You can.

118
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:43,078
You can resent me
until you have peace in your heart.

119
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,408
You deserve it.

120
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:52,998
You protected me.

121
00:14:00,678 --> 00:14:01,888
So, Sooyeong.

122
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:05,808
Don't be hurt anymore.

123
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:09,728
And…

124
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:12,608
I'm sorry.

125
00:14:16,568 --> 00:14:18,738
I can't be the Noh Gojin…

126
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:21,738
who used to love you anymore.

127
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,618
Why are you outside?

128
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:05,738
So I can see you sooner.

129
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:08,118
Did you wait a long time?

130
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:10,458
Yes, very.

131
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,338
Did you manage it well

132
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:22,758
so that both you and Ms. Sooyeong
won't be hurt anymore?

133
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:43,448
NOH GOJIN
TOP INSTRUCTOR IN THE UNIVERSE

134
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:50,998
Hey, kid. You can't enter!

135
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,418
I'm sorry.

136
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,918
You little brat, you're so quick.

137
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,208
Come here.

138
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:01,508
Who is he?

139
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:04,678
I don't really know,
but he just ran away abruptly.

140
00:16:04,758 --> 00:16:07,258
But you yelled at me in a scary voice.

141
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:09,638
You brat, it's because
you came in without permission.

142
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,308
Come here. This isn't a playground.

143
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:13,728
One second, sir.

144
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:17,728
Hey, kid.

145
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:19,148
What's your name?

146
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,318
Kim Doyoon.

147
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,398
Doyoon, what are you doing here?

148
00:16:23,988 --> 00:16:25,408
I came to see my mom.

149
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:27,028
What's your mom's name?

150
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:29,118
Ma Eunjeong.

151
00:16:33,498 --> 00:16:38,498
COLLEGE ENTRANCE ACADEMY
SONGRO ACADEMY

152
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:42,798
Other places
probably won't accept you either.

153
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:45,378
You spoke untruthfully
at a press conference.

154
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:47,138
Who would hire you?

155
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:50,178
He's right.

156
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:53,388
I did such a terrible thing.

157
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:09,778
HIRING WAITRESSES

158
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:16,668
MOM

159
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,588
Hello? Mom?

160
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,128
What did you say?

161
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:27,628
What do you mean, Doyoon disappeared?

162
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:29,048
Did you look for him?

163
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,098
Call the police-- No.

164
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,978
I'm coming. I'm coming right away.

165
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:39,478
Hello?

166
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,398
Is it yummy?

167
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:46,898
Pizza is my favorite.

168
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,238
Doyoon, I also have a gift for you.

169
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:53,198
Ta-da!

170
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:57,248
My mom told me
not to accept things from strangers.

171
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:59,248
It's okay to take it. It's yours.

172
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,418
Your mom had bought it.

173
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:09,968
Doyoon!

174
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,178
Mom!

175
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,098
Doyoon, what are you doing?

176
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:20,808
Didn't I tell you
to listen to Grandma and stay with her?

177
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:22,648
But you didn't come to see me.

178
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,648
You always say you're busy making money.

179
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:27,318
You like money more than me.

180
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:30,358
That's not true.

181
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,488
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

182
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:46,878
I'm sorry.

183
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:48,588
Please come back.

184
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,728
I heard about your situation from Mr. Oh.

185
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:08,028
I did such a terrible thing to you.

186
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,108
I can't do that.

187
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,738
I became a terrible person
because of money.

188
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,408
I don't want to be
a shameful mother any longer.

189
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,038
I'm sorry.

190
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:26,298
If you're really sorry,

191
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:28,668
please come back and help me.

192
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,178
Ms. Ma,

193
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:34,508
you're the best teaching assistant.

194
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:37,508
I need you.

195
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:44,858
You know that I only want the best, right?

196
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:01,118
Can you believe it?

197
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:05,628
No. I can't believe it
even after seeing it with my own eyes.

198
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,338
How could Mr. Noh Manners…

199
00:20:08,418 --> 00:20:11,668
I mean, Mr. Noh…

200
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:14,088
say that to us?

201
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,718
My goodness. Hey!

202
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,848
Did you guys hear?

203
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:25,018
Ms. Ma got divorced and was piled on
with debt from the loan sharks.

204
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,558
She couldn't even live with her kid,

205
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:30,278
and the kid came here looking for her…

206
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:34,778
Gosh, what's the matter?

207
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,068
Did something happen?

208
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,658
-Mr. Noh…
-What?

209
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:41,868
He said sorry.

210
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:45,578
And he asked us to come back to Gotop.

211
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,588
Is… Is that true?

212
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:53,048
My goodness. Noh Gojin really

213
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:55,718
must be out of his mind indeed.

214
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,048
Why is he asking you guys to come back
when you've only caused him trouble?

215
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:00,598
-Ms. Gong!
-Ms. Gong!

216
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,268
Gosh, let go of my hand, you brats.

217
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:05,808
My goodness.

218
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:13,318
-Is it 75 degrees Celsius?
-Yes, it is.

219
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,908
What? Ms. Lee!

220
00:21:32,998 --> 00:21:34,298
Please terminate…

221
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:36,838
my contract.

222
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:38,388
Why?

223
00:21:49,098 --> 00:21:52,518
Because I forged my academic records,
it's going to cause trouble soon.

224
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,278
When I first started working,

225
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,988
my company told me it'll be easier
to get students if I said

226
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:02,658
I went to a state university,
not just any college.

227
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,698
I knew it wasn't the right thing to do,

228
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,118
but I wrote it that way on my bio.

229
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,208
I should've revised it sooner,

230
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:15,548
but I was blinded by greed.

231
00:22:19,928 --> 00:22:20,928
So,

232
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:24,138
you're going quit being an instructor?

233
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,518
Who will be able to trust me now?

234
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,148
All my students will leave me too.

235
00:22:32,398 --> 00:22:36,188
I trust your ability
and that you're being sincere.

236
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:39,818
Even if you were untruthful in your bio,

237
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,448
if you weren't actually capable,
I doubt you'd be sitting here today.

238
00:22:49,658 --> 00:22:51,498
Let's tell your students the truth

239
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:54,378
and apologize sincerely.

240
00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:57,958
If they still want you to quit,

241
00:22:58,298 --> 00:22:59,838
you can quit then.

242
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:03,178
So until then,

243
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:06,098
let's do our best together.

244
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:18,148
Chabae, are you really going to retire?

245
00:23:20,648 --> 00:23:21,698
Yes.

246
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:25,908
But the exam the broker gave you
turned out to be fake anyway.

247
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,868
Then, to put it bluntly,
you were deceived too.

248
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,788
Is it really necessary that you quit?

249
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,748
That doesn't make what I've done go away.

250
00:23:41,258 --> 00:23:44,178
And I'm sick of fighting
to be the best now.

251
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:47,598
Do I have to live
always competing, feeling anxious,

252
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:51,888
and even doing such shameful things?

253
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:55,518
I don't think this is right.

254
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,688
You'll continue with your show?

255
00:23:58,778 --> 00:23:59,938
Well…

256
00:24:00,028 --> 00:24:03,028
It's just a show.
Don't be discouraged and just do it.

257
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:05,568
I know. Why are you discouraged?

258
00:24:05,658 --> 00:24:06,988
I'm not discouraged-- Wait.

259
00:24:09,868 --> 00:24:12,078
What are you doing here?

260
00:24:12,158 --> 00:24:13,668
Are you discouraged about the show?

261
00:24:13,748 --> 00:24:15,208
What? Discouraged--

262
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,788
I'm Gong Heechul!

263
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,378
That's right.

264
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:24,548
That's how Gotop's top social studies
instructor Gong Heechul should be.

265
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:30,138
By any chance, are you asking me
to come back to Gotop?

266
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,308
But I can't return
the penalty fine to you.

267
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,018
You did quit.

268
00:24:34,638 --> 00:24:36,228
Wow, he's really something.

269
00:24:39,568 --> 00:24:42,938
Do you really plan to retire?

270
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:44,858
Yes.

271
00:24:44,948 --> 00:24:46,738
What will you do after you retire?

272
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:49,528
I'll need to find something

273
00:24:50,408 --> 00:24:53,868
that will make me
be at peace and feel happy.

274
00:24:56,498 --> 00:24:59,168
-As for the penalty--
-Fine, I'll pay.

275
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,918
What? What else?

276
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,258
That's quite admirable.

277
00:25:05,758 --> 00:25:06,588
"Admirable"?

278
00:25:06,678 --> 00:25:07,968
Is it?

279
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:14,178
I'll pay for the drinks today

280
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:15,768
with the penalty money.

281
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:19,108
-Penalty…
-May I order a drink?

282
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:20,518
What would you like, sir?

283
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:23,568
Give us the expensive one. It's my money.

284
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:25,948
Okay. Yes, that one!

285
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:36,078
WE'D LIKE TO HIRE YOU,
MASKED KOREAN TEACHER

286
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:40,538
ILPUM EDU, EDU IDEA, GOTOP EDU,
HANBIT JUNIOR EDU, HARAM CENTER, YMJ EDU…

287
00:25:40,628 --> 00:25:41,798
No way.

288
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:44,878
All these e-mails are for me?

289
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:52,638
Hello, Masked Korean Teacher.
I work for Ilpum Edu.

290
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,428
I'd be very grateful

291
00:25:54,518 --> 00:25:57,188
if you could please,
please give us a call.

292
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:00,648
No way.

293
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:06,278
MY DEAR MR. NOH

294
00:26:26,968 --> 00:26:28,798
Why did you take a taxi here?

295
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:32,798
I had a drink with the instructors.

296
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:35,348
Good for you.

297
00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:41,438
I didn't realize until now

298
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:46,858
how precious the people around me are.

299
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:49,398
So,

300
00:26:51,198 --> 00:26:53,368
I never embraced them.

301
00:26:54,618 --> 00:26:56,158
But now you know.

302
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,288
You don't think it's too late?

303
00:27:02,668 --> 00:27:04,458
It's not late at all.

304
00:27:05,338 --> 00:27:09,088
Besides, you're doing a very good job.
You're so great.

305
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,178
Gojin!

306
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:23,768
Can you embrace them too somehow?

307
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:27,818
Sooho.

308
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:30,858
Yes, Gojin?

309
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,028
What do you think about
going back to college?

310
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:39,698
College?

311
00:27:40,288 --> 00:27:43,038
It's nice to learn it firsthand
at a theater company,

312
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:47,378
but don't you think it'll be great help
for your acting career to learn

313
00:27:47,878 --> 00:27:49,878
step-by-step
starting with theory at school?

314
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:52,258
Okay.

315
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:54,138
I'll go back.

316
00:27:56,298 --> 00:27:58,468
You will?

317
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:00,348
What happened?

318
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:02,638
What did you do to him?

319
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,398
I'm… Noh Gojin.

320
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:11,948
I'm an expert
at sending students to college.

321
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:15,158
Awesome.

322
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:24,828
Now that I took care of Sooho,

323
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:28,998
there's only one person left.

324
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,708
One person?

325
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:32,548
Who?

326
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:41,518
Our contract is finally finished.

327
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:44,348
This is my parting gift.

328
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,438
What's this?

329
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:48,898
Three calls were made

330
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,148
to the emergency hotline
for the vacation house accident.

331
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,318
Ms. Lee Sina wasn't
the only one who reported it.

332
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,698
Oh Segi and Kang Min reported it too.

333
00:28:56,408 --> 00:28:58,988
Not everyone hates you,

334
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,908
so don't feel so hurt.

335
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:02,248
Cheer up.

336
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:05,788
Don't get emotional.

337
00:29:06,248 --> 00:29:07,078
I'll get going now.

338
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:11,668
The PR team--

339
00:29:11,748 --> 00:29:14,588
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you had a visitor.

340
00:29:17,218 --> 00:29:19,718
Haven't we met before?

341
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,348
You don't recognize me?

342
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,268
No, not really.

343
00:29:25,018 --> 00:29:26,598
I think we've met before.

344
00:29:26,688 --> 00:29:27,978
No, we haven't.

345
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,568
We don't know each other.

346
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,998
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere.

347
00:29:53,048 --> 00:29:56,758
When am I going to tell Mr. Noh
that the Masked Korean Teacher is me?

348
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:58,468
I need to tell him soon.

349
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:02,558
…I know that you find the Korean grammar
from the Middle Ages most difficult.

350
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:03,968
I'll simplify it for you.

351
00:30:04,058 --> 00:30:06,058
What goes in this blank…

352
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:10,018
I need to recruit
the Masked Korean Teacher quickly.

353
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,318
If Gotop takes her,

354
00:30:15,318 --> 00:30:17,858
how will I stand to watch that?
I'll be too jealous!

355
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:19,778
The Masked Korean Teacher--

356
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:22,488
You startled me!

357
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:23,908
We got it!

358
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:24,988
Got what?

359
00:30:25,078 --> 00:30:29,248
We got a call
from the Masked Korean Teacher!

360
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,918
-Did we really?
-Yes.

361
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,248
Really?

362
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:43,258
What's taking her so long?

363
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:47,558
Darn it. Did I get tricked?

364
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,478
Gosh, seriously.

365
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:02,948
Are you Mr. Park Yangtae of Ilpum Edu?

366
00:31:03,948 --> 00:31:05,028
Don't turn around!

367
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:10,788
Masked Korean Teacher?

368
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,548
Yes. You'd like to sign
a contract with me?

369
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:17,878
Yes. That's the case.

370
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:21,468
May I ask for your reason?

371
00:31:23,888 --> 00:31:27,768
Ever since finding Noh Gojin 14 years ago,

372
00:31:27,848 --> 00:31:30,268
this is the first time
I saw someone so ingenious.

373
00:31:30,978 --> 00:31:35,018
I'd say your lecture is highly original.

374
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,948
By any chance, did you meet
with Gotop Education as well?

375
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:43,778
No.

376
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:47,238
I have no desire to go to Gotop Education.

377
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:53,748
I'll accept any condition you ask for.

378
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:55,748
Please sign a contract with me.

379
00:32:12,228 --> 00:32:15,518
Yes, I'll sign the contract
with Ilpum Edu.

380
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:19,278
I'll prepare the contract quickly
and send it to you.

381
00:32:28,328 --> 00:32:30,998
Lee Sina, you're
the Masked Korean Teacher?

382
00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:48,928
Look who's here. Mr. Noh!

383
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:52,018
You must be misunderstanding
something since that day.

384
00:32:52,308 --> 00:32:55,138
We're not that close
that you can tell me to come and go.

385
00:32:57,358 --> 00:32:58,978
You rude punk.

386
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,028
Just have a seat.

387
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:04,608
To be honest,
you didn't really help, you know?

388
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,778
The funding restrictions were
released right away.

389
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:08,868
You don't know how to be grateful.

390
00:33:08,948 --> 00:33:10,238
To get you funding,

391
00:33:10,328 --> 00:33:13,408
I even offered
two of our subsidiaries as collateral.

392
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:15,868
Fine, I give you credit for that.

393
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:19,378
But I didn't need it in the end,

394
00:33:19,668 --> 00:33:21,088
so stop acting like we're friends.

395
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:29,138
The Masked Korean Teacher

396
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:33,768
signed a contract with Ilpum Edu.

397
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:35,888
What did you say?

398
00:33:35,978 --> 00:33:38,598
I said, Ms. Lee Sina
signed a contract with us.

399
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,238
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
EMPLOYER ILPUM EDU, EMPLOYEE LEE SINA

400
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:55,958
Oh, sir. I have something to tell--

401
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:57,368
Masked Korean Teacher.

402
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,248
How… How did you know?

403
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:06,508
Well, I was going to tell you sooner…

404
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:09,008
Did you really sign
a contract with Ilpum Edu?

405
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:15,888
You really did?

406
00:34:16,478 --> 00:34:18,308
How can you do this to me?

407
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:22,018
How can you betray Gotop and me like this?

408
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:28,108
I didn't realize you were the type
to stab people in the back.

409
00:34:28,198 --> 00:34:31,698
No, I'm not. I didn't mean to do that.

410
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:33,988
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

411
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:38,748
Things have been very hard for you
with various troubles,

412
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:42,078
and many people will complain
if I teach at Gotop.

413
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:46,338
Besides, I wanted to achieve it myself

414
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,718
without causing you trouble.

415
00:34:48,298 --> 00:34:49,258
Forget it.

416
00:34:49,758 --> 00:34:50,678
But…

417
00:34:57,388 --> 00:34:58,808
Sir.

418
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,898
Please don't be mad, okay?

419
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:03,478
I'm sorry.

420
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:10,818
Please? Sir.

421
00:35:11,198 --> 00:35:13,818
Please say something at least, okay?

422
00:35:14,118 --> 00:35:16,118
I said, I'm sorry.

423
00:35:17,288 --> 00:35:19,288
Sir, I'm sorry--

424
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:22,288
Gosh. Come on, sir.

425
00:35:24,128 --> 00:35:25,498
I said, I'm sorry.

426
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:28,668
Are you going to follow me
into the bathroom too,

427
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,588
Masked Korean Teacher?

428
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,718
I don't think
we're that close to each other.

429
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:36,848
We stab each other in the back, you know?

430
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,808
Darling.

431
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:47,648
Honey.

432
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,328
I think you're forgetting something else.

433
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,788
I love you.

434
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:14,678
Aren't you going to say it back to me?

435
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,138
This is so unfair.

436
00:36:24,598 --> 00:36:25,768
How can you say that now?

437
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,028
I love you.

438
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:52,298
How long have you known
that I was the Masked Korean Teacher?

439
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:55,218
From the start.

440
00:36:56,838 --> 00:36:58,298
Was it that obvious?

441
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,468
How would I not know?

442
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:05,228
When you're not nervous,
you're much better.

443
00:37:08,558 --> 00:37:11,568
I'm really sorry about Ilpum Edu.

444
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:14,778
No, it's okay.

445
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:18,068
I also think you made a wise decision.

446
00:37:19,328 --> 00:37:20,828
If you teach at Gotop,

447
00:37:21,118 --> 00:37:23,908
you'll certainly hear people say
you became an instructor because of me.

448
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,128
It's a little annoying that
that man, Mr. Park Yangtae, is teasing me,

449
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,248
but it's okay.

450
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:34,838
You'll do well wherever you go, Lee Sina.

451
00:37:36,468 --> 00:37:38,298
I'll always be rooting for you.

452
00:37:40,298 --> 00:37:41,468
Thank you.

453
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,738
You must hate me.

454
00:38:44,868 --> 00:38:45,698
Yes.

455
00:38:48,248 --> 00:38:51,078
"It's not my fault
that I met Mr. Noh after her,

456
00:38:51,378 --> 00:38:52,458
so why is she mad at me?"

457
00:38:53,038 --> 00:38:54,208
I got upset thinking that.

458
00:38:55,748 --> 00:38:58,088
"I can't believe
his first love is so beautiful."

459
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:00,338
I got jealous thinking that.

460
00:39:01,928 --> 00:39:04,218
"I wonder what Mr. Noh was like
when he was 21.

461
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:08,058
I'll never know what he was like,

462
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:10,688
but Ms. Sooyeong has seen it all."

463
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:13,108
I got envious thinking that.

464
00:39:15,518 --> 00:39:17,858
That's why I hate you.

465
00:39:22,658 --> 00:39:23,908
You're finally a little likable.

466
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:28,198
I really didn't like how nice you were.

467
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:33,038
But

468
00:39:34,588 --> 00:39:35,998
I can't forget.

469
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,378
The day we first met in Gangneung,

470
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:44,928
you kindly picked out an outfit for me
like a real older sister.

471
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,978
Except for my mom who already passed away,

472
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:53,398
no one had ever
picked out my clothes for me.

473
00:39:55,688 --> 00:39:58,108
You consoled me so much that day.

474
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,528
I was really lonely and scared.

475
00:40:09,748 --> 00:40:13,828
I'm very grateful to you, Ms. Sooyeong.

476
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:03,048
Hello?

477
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,048
Ms. Baek?

478
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:08,008
Yes. I'm Baek Sooyeong,
the CEO of Baek Edu.

479
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:24,238
THE LATE OH SEHEE

480
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:28,818
I'm leaving Korea next week.

481
00:41:30,158 --> 00:41:32,448
Segi, do you really have to go?

482
00:41:33,078 --> 00:41:34,708
We should stay by Dad's side--

483
00:41:34,788 --> 00:41:37,418
I won't have another opportunity
to get a full scholarship.

484
00:41:37,918 --> 00:41:41,998
I can't give up
this opportunity because of Father.

485
00:41:42,088 --> 00:41:45,718
But I still wish that you'd stay with us.

486
00:41:46,468 --> 00:41:47,678
All on my own…

487
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:49,218
Don't be so weak.

488
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:53,178
We have to think rationally
what will really help us.

489
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:56,598
So don't worry too much about Father

490
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:58,018
and focus on what you're doing.

491
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:03,228
I'll work part-time to contribute
as much as I can to the nursing home fee.

492
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:06,148
Oh Sehee.

493
00:42:07,148 --> 00:42:09,618
Clench your teeth and toughen up.

494
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,158
Being too sympathetic
and tender-hearted is your problem.

495
00:42:16,498 --> 00:42:17,618
Don't come to the airport.

496
00:42:26,968 --> 00:42:30,088
THE LATE OH SEHEE

497
00:42:32,178 --> 00:42:35,018
I shouldn't have left
leaving you alone behind like that.

498
00:42:42,108 --> 00:42:43,818
It's my fault.

499
00:42:54,578 --> 00:42:55,578
I'm sorry.

500
00:43:00,538 --> 00:43:02,578
I'm so sorry.

501
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:52,338
So…

502
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:55,598
when are you coming back?

503
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,678
What?

504
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:02,848
Were you not going to come back?

505
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:06,858
How could I go back to Gotop

506
00:44:08,068 --> 00:44:09,228
after what I've done?

507
00:44:11,278 --> 00:44:12,858
That's why you should come back.

508
00:44:13,608 --> 00:44:15,738
You need to work
your fingers to the bone at Gotop.

509
00:44:16,868 --> 00:44:20,408
At this rate,
we won't get first place next year.

510
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:23,418
I'm telling you, we'll lose to Ilpum Edu.

511
00:44:26,628 --> 00:44:27,538
Gojin.

512
00:44:28,548 --> 00:44:31,798
I'm such a terrible son.

513
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:39,098
Since middle school, I haven't had
a proper conversation with my father.

514
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:42,428
Because I hated him so much.

515
00:44:44,898 --> 00:44:47,938
I hated my father's muddy work clothes

516
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:53,698
and really despised
his daily drunken rampages too.

517
00:44:56,108 --> 00:44:58,488
I wanted to run away from him.

518
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:02,538
With studying abroad as an excuse,

519
00:45:03,038 --> 00:45:05,618
I dumped Father on Sehee

520
00:45:06,828 --> 00:45:07,748
and ran away by myself.

521
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:13,338
I want to pay back

522
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,508
the debt I owe Sehee now.

523
00:45:21,058 --> 00:45:24,228
Then go have some quality time
with your father for three months.

524
00:45:25,228 --> 00:45:26,188
And then come back.

525
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,978
I don't think Ms. Sehee would

526
00:45:32,228 --> 00:45:34,028
want you to stop living your life.

527
00:45:35,528 --> 00:45:36,448
And,

528
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:38,988
without you,

529
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:40,988
neither Gotop

530
00:45:41,988 --> 00:45:42,998
nor I can function.

531
00:46:14,818 --> 00:46:16,028
Hello.

532
00:46:16,698 --> 00:46:18,318
Sir, I'll go now.

533
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:34,758
Father, I'm here.

534
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:41,008
I'm not your father, sir.

535
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:52,858
Sehee is here too.

536
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:11,248
I'll take good care of you.

537
00:47:12,918 --> 00:47:13,958
On behalf of Sehee too.

538
00:47:16,378 --> 00:47:17,878
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

539
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:24,218
You're not slapping me this time.

540
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:30,138
That's because
I thought I was going to die then.

541
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:33,898
So I brought this too.

542
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,398
What's this?

543
00:47:40,648 --> 00:47:41,658
Open it.

544
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:58,378
If you smile or even look
at another woman,

545
00:47:58,878 --> 00:48:00,258
I'm going to hit you with this.

546
00:48:05,798 --> 00:48:07,308
You're even scarier than last time.

547
00:48:30,618 --> 00:48:32,118
You'll do well.

548
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,538
I'll be rooting for you right behind you.

549
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:37,958
Instructor Lee Sina.

550
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:05,158
NOH GOJIN
TOP INSTRUCTOR IN THE UNIVERSE

551
00:49:06,408 --> 00:49:08,118
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

552
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:09,158
Hello.

553
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:14,368
Ms. Michelle, you scribbled
on my things, didn't you?

554
00:49:16,918 --> 00:49:19,378
What's all this commotion again
so early in the morning?

555
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:20,798
Hi, sir.

556
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:22,128
Hello, sir.

557
00:49:26,888 --> 00:49:28,638
-Hello.
-Is everything coming along smoothly?

558
00:49:28,718 --> 00:49:29,758
Yes, we're working hard.

559
00:49:32,218 --> 00:49:33,058
Good morning!

560
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:35,018
-Good morning.
-Hello.

561
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:36,598
-Hello, sir.
-Good morning, sir.

562
00:49:37,098 --> 00:49:38,108
Good morning, sir.

563
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:58,578
Why do you keep calling me?
Do you have nothing to do?

564
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:01,798
Sir, are you doing well?

565
00:50:02,918 --> 00:50:05,628
My goodness. I'm sure
everything is always fine at Gotop.

566
00:50:05,718 --> 00:50:07,758
This time, I planted some onions.

567
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,468
The onions are growing so well.
Would you like me to send you some?

568
00:50:11,048 --> 00:50:13,058
Oh, wait. You don't like onions.

569
00:50:15,058 --> 00:50:18,018
Who said I don't like onions?

570
00:50:18,848 --> 00:50:21,518
Send them all my way. I'll eat them all.

571
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:24,528
I'll plant chili peppers next
and send them to you.

572
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:28,858
Okay. Then I'll be waiting.

573
00:50:32,328 --> 00:50:35,328
GOTOP EDUCATION CEO NOH GOJIN

574
00:50:41,328 --> 00:50:43,128
Sir, I need your signature, please.

575
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:57,178
You have a meeting in ten minutes.

576
00:50:57,268 --> 00:50:58,268
Okay.

577
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:10,278
Lee Sina,

578
00:51:10,858 --> 00:51:13,328
you will do fine. You can do it.

579
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:28,628
What?

580
00:51:30,008 --> 00:51:31,638
You're busy. What are you doing here?

581
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:34,388
Instructor Lee Sina.

582
00:51:35,098 --> 00:51:38,268
You'll be giving your first lecture today.
How do you feel?

583
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,268
I feel so nervous.

584
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:44,688
That's why I brought this.

585
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:47,148
Ta-da.

586
00:51:49,608 --> 00:51:50,858
Thank you.

587
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:55,488
This isn't okay.

588
00:51:56,328 --> 00:51:57,368
-Sorry?
-I'll let it slide

589
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:59,248
since it's your first lecture today.

590
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:01,788
Don't dress up
for in-person lectures next time.

591
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,208
Don't be silly.

592
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:08,048
If you look so pretty, students
won't be able to focus on their studies.

593
00:52:14,008 --> 00:52:17,178
As you give your lecture, just think
that I'm right beside you the whole time.

594
00:52:54,218 --> 00:52:56,428
Hello. Nice to meet you.

595
00:52:56,718 --> 00:52:58,808
I'm Lee Sina,
the instructor who will handle

596
00:52:59,558 --> 00:53:01,058
all your Korean studies going forward.

597
00:53:10,568 --> 00:53:11,858
Good job, Lee Sina.

598
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,948
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

599
00:53:16,028 --> 00:53:19,278
ILPUM EDU SEOCHO ACADEMY

600
00:53:32,628 --> 00:53:34,088
You didn't have to come.

601
00:53:34,168 --> 00:53:35,968
Of course, I should.

602
00:53:36,048 --> 00:53:38,468
It's the day
my girlfriend gave her first lecture.

603
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:39,758
Thank you.

604
00:53:41,178 --> 00:53:42,138
You weren't nervous?

605
00:53:42,808 --> 00:53:44,928
Oddly, I wasn't nervous at all

606
00:53:45,018 --> 00:53:46,308
thanks to my boyfriend.

607
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:50,438
Then,

608
00:53:51,108 --> 00:53:52,938
I'll try to do well
without getting nervous too.

609
00:53:59,658 --> 00:54:00,948
Close your eyes.

610
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:02,658
Close my eyes?

611
00:54:06,828 --> 00:54:07,828
What is it?

612
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:14,958
You can open them now.

613
00:54:18,758 --> 00:54:20,048
What's this?

614
00:54:41,238 --> 00:54:42,988
When the two are put together,

615
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:47,118
the love is complete.

616
00:54:58,678 --> 00:54:59,758
Sina.

617
00:55:01,928 --> 00:55:04,098
I hope that each day going forward…

618
00:55:06,308 --> 00:55:08,098
will always be with you.

619
00:55:10,188 --> 00:55:11,648
I want to wake up next to you,

620
00:55:13,108 --> 00:55:14,568
eat with you,

621
00:55:15,978 --> 00:55:17,068
listen to music,

622
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:21,778
and fall asleep beside you.

623
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,788
Will you marry me?

624
00:56:03,528 --> 00:56:04,448
I love you.

625
00:56:05,578 --> 00:56:06,778
I love you too.

626
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:30,848
Let's go.

627
00:56:40,488 --> 00:56:41,818
Should we go look at some beds?

628
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:43,358
Sure.

629
00:56:43,988 --> 00:56:46,698
BED STORE

630
00:56:56,668 --> 00:56:57,748
This one is nice.

631
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:02,918
You have to try lying down on it
when you shop for beds.

632
00:57:07,388 --> 00:57:08,468
It's so comfortable.

633
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:09,468
I know.

634
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,268
Isn't it so cushiony?

635
00:57:15,898 --> 00:57:17,268
I just want to go home like this.

636
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:44,918
-It's good.
-Is it?

637
00:57:46,718 --> 00:57:47,798
Should I add tofu now?

638
00:58:01,568 --> 00:58:03,438
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

639
00:58:07,698 --> 00:58:08,658
How is it?

640
00:58:08,738 --> 00:58:09,948
It's delicious.

641
00:58:13,408 --> 00:58:14,498
Let's try this one.

642
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:23,338
You have to eat that one too.

643
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:24,628
Onions?

644
00:58:25,378 --> 00:58:28,338
Of course. I really love onions now.

645
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,108
Oh, I'm sorry.

646
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,078
I have this one, you know?

647
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:55,788
Gosh, I'm sorry. I surrender.

648
00:59:00,418 --> 00:59:01,418
Come here!

649
00:59:24,858 --> 00:59:26,858
HOW TO BE A GOOD INSTRUCTOR

650
01:00:36,548 --> 01:00:37,758
Seriously, what on earth--

651
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:42,188
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

652
01:00:42,808 --> 01:00:44,058
Scumbag.

653
01:00:44,648 --> 01:00:45,938
It's me.

654
01:00:47,318 --> 01:00:48,778
Your fiancée.

655
01:00:53,988 --> 01:00:56,778
Now that I'm outside, it feels very nice.

656
01:01:07,418 --> 01:01:08,538
Mr. Noh!

657
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,668
It's Noh Gojin!

658
01:01:10,758 --> 01:01:12,218
Sir, I'm sorry!

659
01:01:12,298 --> 01:01:14,928
I think I really lost my mind.
Just this once. Please.

660
01:01:16,678 --> 01:01:17,928
I had no one

661
01:01:19,428 --> 01:01:21,518
and I had always been all alone,

01:01:22,058 --> 01:01:23,138
but she never left my side.

663
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:34,608
Let's…

664
01:01:35,198 --> 01:01:36,408
date.

665
01:01:53,008 --> 01:01:54,878
Do you know how tormented I was?

666
01:01:54,968 --> 01:01:56,928
I thought I made you ill…

I love you.
