1
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:10,928
CRAZY LOVE

2
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:32,908
CRAZY LOVE

3
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:36,248
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:00:43,758 --> 00:00:47,178
Today's agenda is
to vote on a special resolution to hold

5
00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:50,598
CEO Noh Gojin responsible for his actions
of tax evasion and employee bullying

6
00:00:50,678 --> 00:00:52,518
that caused
Gotop Education's management crisis.

7
00:00:52,808 --> 00:00:54,848
We'll start the voting process now.

8
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:25,298
EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING

9
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:51,488
GOTOP EDUCATION
EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING

10
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,828
Now I will announce
the result of the voting

11
00:01:57,908 --> 00:01:59,748
on CEO Noh Gojin
taking the consecutive term.

12
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:06,418
Out of the total votes, 64.1% opposed…

13
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:07,798
What? 64.1%?

14
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:08,928
…his consecutive term.

15
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,048
Therefore, since it did not satisfy
the required two-thirds quorum,

16
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:14,468
it has been rejected.

17
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,468
What happened?

18
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:20,188
-What happened?
-What?

19
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:23,978
I guess your solidarity

20
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:26,988
wasn't as strong as you thought.

21
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:30,318
Well, I'll get going now.

22
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:34,158
Regardless of the result,
you aren't qualified to be the CEO.

23
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,078
That's right.

24
00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:41,078
Deputy CEO Oh Segi will inform you
of a very important fact.

25
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,208
Please go ahead.

26
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:51,718
I thought very hard
before deciding to stand before you today.

27
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:55,968
In the end, I concluded that
this is the only way to protect Gotop.

28
00:02:57,888 --> 00:02:59,268
Currently, CEO Noh isn't

29
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:03,228
capable of managing Gotop.

30
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,398
-What?
-What does he mean?

31
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:06,148
CEO Noh Gojin is currently suffering

32
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:08,528
from amnesia.

33
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,568
-What?
-Amnesia?

34
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:13,068
How could that be?

35
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:17,158
I'll submit as evidence
the diagnosis that CEO Noh Gojin

36
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:21,458
has amnesia due to a car accident.

37
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:23,078
-Evidence?
-Diagnosis?

38
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:25,378
-Seriously?
-How can this be?

39
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:29,128
Do you mean I'm unqualified
to manage Gotop Education

40
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:34,298
because I have amnesia?

41
00:03:38,388 --> 00:03:41,558
Please ask me anything.
I'll answer you all.

42
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,858
Mr. Noh, please stop acting.

43
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:49,358
You're making a mockery
of the shareholders.

44
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,688
The one who is making
a mockery of the shareholders…

45
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:54,738
is you,

46
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:57,328
Deputy CEO Oh Segi.

47
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:08,538
Please come in.

48
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:15,428
-What?
-Who is that?

49
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:16,548
-Hello.
-What's going on?

50
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:31,478
MOS COMPANY FUND INFLOW DETAILS

51
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:33,068
-What is that?
-There are so many.

52
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:36,068
-The amounts are significant.
-That's too much!

53
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:37,778
In the name of investing abroad,

54
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:41,448
he siphoned off
billions of won to a paper company.

55
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,928
Oh Segi.

56
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,138
Please stop.

57
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,308
It's over now.

58
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:12,358
I'm sick of pretending to have amnesia.

59
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,318
Pretending?

60
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:17,028
Yes.

61
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,028
I pretended to have amnesia

62
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,988
to deceive you.

63
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,288
-Gosh.
-What do we do now?

64
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:34,458
-What's going to happen now?
-I can't believe this.

65
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:36,338
-How could he do that?
-Seriously.

66
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:38,428
-Gosh.
-Unbelievable.

67
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:39,928
-This is terrible.
-My goodness.

68
00:05:51,938 --> 00:05:53,768
Don't fool yourself thinking that you won.

69
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,188
It's not over yet.

70
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:58,448
What's the reason?

71
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,318
Why are you going this far?

72
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:06,198
What do you think?

73
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:08,708
Pretending to have amnesia?

74
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,288
Wow, what a nice, fun surprise.

75
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:13,208
You're a genius indeed.

76
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,418
You came up with such a clever idea
even when you were injured.

77
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:20,298
Don't change the topic
and just answer my question.

78
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:23,888
Why did you do it?

79
00:06:26,558 --> 00:06:28,098
I trusted you so much.

80
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:30,728
You're no different.
You didn't trust me either.

81
00:06:32,148 --> 00:06:35,228
You shamelessly pretended to have amnesia

82
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:38,818
and spied on my every action
behind my back.

83
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:41,738
Stop playing the victim here.

84
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,368
You make me sick.

85
00:06:45,028 --> 00:06:46,698
-Oh Segi!
-You find out yourself!

86
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:54,338
Why I am doing this.

87
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:57,258
What you've done wrong!

88
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:05,508
Find out with that great brain of yours.

89
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,678
But I'm sure I'll destroy you before that.

90
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:20,948
Mr. Oh Segi.

91
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,408
You've been reported for breach of trust
related to Mos Company.

92
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:28,658
Please come with us.

93
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:54,148
I'm hungry.

94
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:28,888
What brings you here, Ms. Baek?

95
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:32,018
I want to recruit you, Mr. Oh Segi.

96
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:35,598
I'm sure you heard of my news.

97
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:37,768
Yes, I did.

98
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:40,148
But you still want to recruit me?

99
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,568
I felt bad for you.

100
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:45,448
If I had known about your plan,

101
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,948
I would've told you

102
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:51,328
that Mr. Noh was faking his amnesia.

103
00:08:55,248 --> 00:08:57,708
Please become the deputy CEO of Baek Edu.

104
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:02,248
Don't be suspicious.

105
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,338
We're friends, you know?

106
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:07,258
As the CEO of Baek Edu,

107
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,678
I don't want to miss the opportunity
to hire a great talent like you.

108
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:12,808
Besides,

109
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,558
we have the same goal, right?

110
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:35,658
Mr. Noh.

111
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,228
You can't take your eyes off me.

112
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,268
Because I'm so handsome.

113
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:12,948
You're not calling me a narcissist today.

114
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:17,908
What will happen to Mr. Oh--

115
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:19,708
He'll have to pay for his wrongdoing.

116
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:27,718
Let's

117
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,338
go to Ganghwa Island sometime.

118
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:31,838
Ganghwa Island?

119
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:35,218
I want to show you

120
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,928
to my grandmother.

121
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:46,818
Do you want to sleep here tonight?

122
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,358
Sorry?

123
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:53,408
What are you imagining?

124
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,038
I meant, literally,
just sleep here tonight.

125
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,288
You even have your own room here.

126
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:04,588
Oh… You're right.

127
00:11:14,598 --> 00:11:16,098
If I didn't have you,

128
00:11:17,098 --> 00:11:18,468
I don't think I would've been okay.

129
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,138
Thank you.

130
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:43,458
It turns out that the bullying
and tax evasion accusations

131
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:46,038
made against Gotop Education
CEO Noh Gojin were not true.

132
00:11:46,128 --> 00:11:50,048
As this incident was
a malicious attack against Mr. Noh Gojin,

133
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:52,338
consumer boycotting
against Gotop Education

134
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:54,838
and membership cancellations
have also stopped.

135
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:59,388
Mr. Noh Gojin donated to
our Children's New Life fundraising event.

136
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:04,438
So it was a really great help
to the children's heart surgery costs.

137
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:07,108
Although our CEO seems
cold-hearted on the outside,

138
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:09,858
he is such a warm-hearted person.

139
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,608
He did not bully his employees.

140
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:15,818
NOH GOJIN
TOP INSTRUCTOR IN THE UNIVERSE

141
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:17,408
Mr. Noh

142
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:20,328
even paid for my son's surgery cost

143
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:23,658
and the accumulated hospital charges too.

144
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:29,038
He's so kind to his employees.

145
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:31,838
Mr. Noh donated to single-parent families

146
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,218
through our community service center

147
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:37,758
and provided rice and daily necessities
to the elderly who live alone.

148
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:41,808
There are so many donations I made

149
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:44,768
that I was not aware of.

150
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:49,568
To be prepared for an incident like this,

151
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:52,898
I spent your money very carelessly,
as much as I want, as I wish,

152
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:54,528
very well. Don't you think?

153
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:02,578
Mr. Noh!

154
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:04,828
I'm sorry.

155
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:07,958
I just did as I was told to do by Mr. Oh.

156
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:11,338
I had no idea that
the second ledger set was forged.

157
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:14,918
Mr. Oh said it was for Gotop,

158
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:18,338
so I just did as I was told.

159
00:13:30,938 --> 00:13:35,028
I knew all along
that you were the one who leaked

160
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:37,238
my study guides to Ilpum Edu.

161
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,548
That's why I planted
erroneous questions in the study guides.

162
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:57,508
Fortunately for me,

163
00:13:58,548 --> 00:13:59,838
you took the bait.

164
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:02,388
Mr. Noh.

165
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:05,348
Please forgive me.

166
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,388
To be honest,

167
00:14:09,478 --> 00:14:11,108
life was getting too difficult.

168
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,818
So to survive…

169
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,568
I was just trying to survive.

170
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,818
If you try to kill others
so that you can live,

171
00:14:20,908 --> 00:14:24,578
others will also try to kill you
so that they can live, Ms. Ma.

172
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,458
I'm telling you up front.

173
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,338
Don't even dream
of going to another company.

174
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:36,378
I'm going to do
everything in my power to stop you.

175
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,468
Because someone like you

176
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:42,588
should never be allowed back
in the education industry.

177
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:48,558
I'm also going to sue you for defamation.

178
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,988
GOTOP EDUCATION

179
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,458
DIRECTOR MA EUNJEONG
GOTOP EDUCATION

180
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,298
Ms. Ma.

181
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:00,338
Ms. Ma!

182
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,928
Gosh, she left already.

183
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:04,468
What's wrong?

184
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:07,758
She left her son's toys.

185
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:10,178
I'll take them.

186
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:11,388
Okay. Thank you.

187
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,848
You have to cover up my dark circles well.

188
00:16:55,938 --> 00:16:57,478
-Here you go.
-Okay.

189
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,478
-You're all set.
-Thank you. Good work.

190
00:17:01,648 --> 00:17:04,278
Wow, you're really doing a show after all.

191
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,608
My goodness. You're here.

192
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:12,998
So what now? I said Ms. Ma would
get herself into big trouble one day.

193
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:14,828
-When?
-I did a long time ago.

194
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,538
I said it all. And Mr. Oh too.

195
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:19,918
Didn't I say he seemed two-faced?

196
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,338
When? What you said was
Mr. Oh makes Mr. Noh behave.

197
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:28,718
In any case,
men and melons are hard to know.

198
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,598
Gotop is a big mess without me.

199
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,978
By the way, where is Michelle?

200
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:39,728
She should be here making a "fuss" by now.

201
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:42,568
-I haven't seen her much recently.
-Why not?

202
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:45,358
She collapsed. She hasn't come
to the research team meetings either.

203
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:48,198
She must be really ill.
She wouldn't even answer her phone.

204
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:51,238
She isn't ill.
That's because she is on a diet.

205
00:17:51,698 --> 00:17:54,538
But who knows?
Maybe it's because of Mr. Oh.

206
00:17:55,748 --> 00:17:56,578
Mr. Oh?

207
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:00,498
Michelle was interested
in Mr. Oh, you know?

208
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:03,418
She must've been in utter shock
because of what happened.

209
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:05,548
Oh, I see. Is that why?

210
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:11,048
Chabae, you look really good though.

211
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:12,758
Something exciting going on?

212
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:15,098
Everything is always exciting for me.

213
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:19,728
I'll get going now.

214
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:21,978
I have an in-person lecture too.

215
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:24,608
You aren't drinking this, right?
I'll take it.

216
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,438
I was going to. What are you doing?

217
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:30,028
What was that?
Why is he so confident all of a sudden?

218
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:42,208
GOTOP EDUCATION INSTRUCTOR KIM CHABAE

219
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:53,258
2022 MAY FIRST SEMESTER MIDTERM EXAM
KOREAN

220
00:18:53,968 --> 00:18:54,968
His own show?

221
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:57,888
I'm not envious at all.

222
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:26,548
Thank you.

223
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:36,718
What's wrong?
Do you want to tell me something?

224
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:39,638
Well…

225
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:42,138
About Ms. Ma--

226
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:43,938
I don't want to hear anything about her.

227
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,358
If you did something wrong,
you must pay the price.

228
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,358
Otherwise, people wouldn't reflect.

229
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:53,988
But still, a lawsuit--

230
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:57,488
I don't think you have the luxury
to worry about others.

231
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,828
The second round of the audition
application process starts today.

232
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,368
Aren't you going to apply?

233
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,168
Oh, that. No.

234
00:20:08,418 --> 00:20:10,418
-Have you given up?
-No.

235
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,338
Then why do you act as if you don't care?

236
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,848
Well, I thought about it,
and it feels a little unfair.

237
00:20:17,428 --> 00:20:19,598
Whether I pass the audition or not,

238
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,178
people are going to say
that you've got my back.

239
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:24,938
So I'm not going to audition.

240
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:28,318
Why not?

241
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,398
To go to Baek Edu?

242
00:20:31,318 --> 00:20:33,738
I won't audition elsewhere either.

243
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,028
Then, how will you become an instructor?

244
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:39,578
I'm not going to answer that.

245
00:20:40,868 --> 00:20:42,038
Ta-da!

246
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:44,498
Hello. I'm the Masked Korean Teacher.

247
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,128
From today, let's have fun
and enjoy studying Korean together

248
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,298
starting with the basics
step by step, okay?

249
00:20:50,378 --> 00:20:54,048
I know that you find the Korean grammar
from the Middle Ages most difficult.

250
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,548
I'll simplify it for you.

251
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,718
What goes in this blank?

252
00:20:58,468 --> 00:20:59,808
Based on the way it sounds.

253
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,968
In general, they spelled things
phonetically based on the way it sounds.

254
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:05,938
A long time ago, they used to spell
everything based on the way it sounds.

255
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,228
Okay, they put a side dot on the left side
of the character to indicate a tone.

256
00:21:10,318 --> 00:21:13,318
Like this. This is a side dot.
Make a note, okay?

257
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:32,998
CHANNEL CONTENT

258
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:08,418
Honey.

259
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,628
If Sina sees us, we'll get in trouble.

260
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:16,548
Ta-da!

261
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:19,628
I got it delivered just for you.

262
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,348
It's sushi, which I like so much.

263
00:22:25,018 --> 00:22:26,098
Look.

264
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,348
It looks so delicious.

265
00:22:28,978 --> 00:22:30,598
-What about Sina?
-She is sleeping.

266
00:22:30,688 --> 00:22:31,768
Let's wake her up to eat.

267
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:34,228
No. I want you to eat a lot, honey.

268
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,188
Gojin buys her many nice things anyway.

269
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:38,568
That's true.

270
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,858
Yes.

271
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,538
It's so good.

272
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:54,628
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

273
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,958
Even if you get it delivered,
it still tastes as good.

274
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,088
I want some too.

275
00:22:58,758 --> 00:23:01,008
Okay. Here you go, honey.

276
00:23:05,138 --> 00:23:06,178
-Isn't it good?
-Yes.

277
00:23:17,318 --> 00:23:18,318
You're here.

278
00:23:20,648 --> 00:23:22,278
What's with your expression?

279
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,988
Were you waiting for someone?

280
00:23:24,658 --> 00:23:28,158
No. I thought you were Ms. Gong.

281
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:31,288
I'm curious about
what's happening at Gotop.

282
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:35,038
I was wondering if something happened
to Mr. Noh Manners again.

283
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:39,258
I feel a little nervous lately too.
What if something happens at Gotop again?

284
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:45,138
I feel bad that
Mr. Noh Manners is surrounded by people

285
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:46,638
who despise him so much.

286
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,718
You're right.
It's like it's okay for me to hurt him,

287
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:52,348
but it makes me upset
when someone else hurts him.

288
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:55,648
Oddly, I was upset when I saw
the video of an egg getting thrown at him.

289
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:58,018
Right? I was upset too.

290
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:01,278
People's minds can be
quite silly, you know?

291
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,948
Now that we stopped
taking revenge on Mr. Noh Manners,

292
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,658
we're feeling sorry for him.

293
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:07,828
You're right.

294
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,658
I'm really glad
that we stopped what we were doing.

295
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,908
If we were getting revenge
in the midst of all this,

296
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,618
we would've felt so terrible.

297
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:17,708
It's stressful to despise someone too.

298
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:18,958
You're right.

299
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:21,918
I'm not sure why I despised him so much.

300
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:23,588
I know.

301
00:24:24,378 --> 00:24:25,388
I agree.

302
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:34,848
Are you all right, sir?

303
00:24:36,148 --> 00:24:39,068
-What do you mean?
-Mr. Noh didn't get dismissed

304
00:24:39,148 --> 00:24:40,728
at Gotop's extraordinary general meeting.

305
00:24:41,228 --> 00:24:42,238
So what?

306
00:24:44,528 --> 00:24:46,108
What if he retaliates?

307
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,698
Retaliate?

308
00:24:48,828 --> 00:24:51,998
It still wouldn't be enough even if
Mr. Noh Manners bows down to thank me.

309
00:24:52,078 --> 00:24:53,248
He survived thanks to--

310
00:24:56,368 --> 00:24:57,668
Wow.

311
00:24:57,878 --> 00:25:00,668
Look who is here. It's Lee Mikyung.

312
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:05,008
I trained you
and made you the top instructor,

313
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,088
but you betrayed me and went to Gotop.

314
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:08,848
You traitor!

315
00:25:21,608 --> 00:25:22,568
It was you, wasn't it?

316
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:23,938
What are you talking about?

317
00:25:24,028 --> 00:25:25,948
Don't pretend as if you don't know.

318
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:27,988
You're taking revenge on me, aren't you?

319
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,408
What are you talking about?

320
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:31,658
Having a bad day?
Why are you talking it out on me?

321
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:35,658
You did the same thing to Mr. Noh before.

322
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,038
That's why you're doing this to me too!

323
00:25:40,168 --> 00:25:41,538
Can you explain?

324
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:42,498
The text…

325
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,668
You sent me that text.

326
00:25:46,508 --> 00:25:47,508
What text?

327
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:54,268
It wasn't you?

328
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:58,598
Why are you putting on a one-man show?
What's wrong with you?

329
00:25:59,188 --> 00:26:01,108
Gosh, then who was it?

330
00:26:03,108 --> 00:26:04,778
Hey, Lee Mikyung! You…

331
00:26:05,568 --> 00:26:07,948
What's with her?

332
00:26:08,198 --> 00:26:12,488
Gosh, why is everyone
from Gotop annoying me?

333
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,098
This is the CEO of Baek Edu.

334
00:26:40,268 --> 00:26:41,858
We're here to meet with Mr. Noh.

335
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:43,518
Yes, sir.

336
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,608
Please go ahead, ma'am.

337
00:26:56,038 --> 00:26:57,538
I'm here to meet with Mr. Noh.

338
00:27:05,378 --> 00:27:07,588
What brings you here?

339
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,588
We recruited Mr. Oh Segi

340
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:13,758
as Baek Edu's deputy CEO.

341
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:18,848
Baek Edu will handle
all his legal issues going forward,

342
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,388
so please send
all related matters to our legal team.

343
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:27,938
I thought I should
tell you that in person.

344
00:27:31,028 --> 00:27:35,238
That's all I had to say.
I'll get going now.

345
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:42,418
I'm so relieved.

346
00:27:47,748 --> 00:27:49,338
I was very worried

347
00:27:50,508 --> 00:27:53,258
that Noh Gojin would get destroyed
because of a mere tax evasion charge.

348
00:27:57,388 --> 00:27:59,808
It won't be any fun
if you get destroyed too easily.

349
00:28:00,348 --> 00:28:02,098
I haven't even gotten started yet.

350
00:28:02,938 --> 00:28:04,688
Why are you going this far?

351
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:05,858
I told you already

352
00:28:07,148 --> 00:28:08,858
that I'll never forgive you.

353
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:13,108
Mr. Oh Segi seems as upset as me too.

354
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:15,488
That's why I really like him.

355
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:19,238
Watch me

356
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:23,288
and see how I destroy

357
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:25,828
both Gotop and Noh Gojin.

358
00:28:42,978 --> 00:28:44,268
Watch me with eyes wide open.

359
00:28:45,478 --> 00:28:47,728
Everything that will happen from now on

360
00:28:47,808 --> 00:28:49,818
is all because of you.

361
00:29:00,828 --> 00:29:02,368
How do you like the deputy CEO's office?

362
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:05,458
Thank you for being so attentive.

363
00:29:05,538 --> 00:29:06,878
I like it very much.

364
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,838
I'm glad to hear that.

365
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,088
I just

366
00:29:12,088 --> 00:29:13,378
met with Mr. Noh.

367
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:16,758
The only thing that's left
is to destroy Gotop.

368
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:19,508
What's your plan?

369
00:29:19,598 --> 00:29:20,928
There are many ways, of course.

370
00:29:21,258 --> 00:29:23,018
I'll take away their talent

371
00:29:23,098 --> 00:29:24,888
and restrict capital to their affiliates.

372
00:29:24,978 --> 00:29:26,188
What about the public opinion?

373
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,768
Many companies use
the viral marketing strategy.

374
00:29:29,858 --> 00:29:31,358
Viral marketing?

375
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,528
There is no other effective way

376
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,698
than turning the truth into a lie

377
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:38,988
and turning a lie into the truth.

378
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,698
I don't care about malicious comments.

379
00:29:41,778 --> 00:29:45,658
Noh Gojin wouldn't budge at all
even if we attack the Gotop instructors

380
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,538
using malicious comments.

381
00:29:49,168 --> 00:29:50,878
Besides,

382
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,668
since he suffered from it himself
12 years ago,

383
00:29:54,588 --> 00:29:56,008
he'd be completely immune to it.

384
00:29:57,928 --> 00:30:00,348
You got a point there. Understood.

385
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:05,058
What's the reason?

386
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:09,348
What's the real reason that you betrayed
Noh Gojin who you considered a brother?

387
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:16,438
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

388
00:30:16,688 --> 00:30:20,778
It's sufficient for me to know
that we have the same end goal.

389
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:24,908
He killed my little sister.

390
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:31,878
Noh Gojin is a murderer.

391
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,228
Please look into

392
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:54,648
Mr. Oh Segi's family details

393
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,728
and find out why his sister died.

394
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:01,908
Yes, ma'am.

395
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:10,218
DEATH THREAT
ACCIDENT IN FRONT OF VACATION HOUSE

396
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,438
You find out yourself!

397
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,398
Why I am doing this.

398
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,938
What you've done wrong!

399
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,098
How many times do I have to repeat?

400
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:34,558
You've been doing this for years!

401
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,018
Gosh, I really can't get any work done.

402
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,438
We had to come back because of this?

403
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:43,278
You have no common sense, man.

404
00:33:43,778 --> 00:33:46,818
You can't install a camera on a tree.
It's facing the wrong direction too.

405
00:33:46,898 --> 00:33:48,108
Are you in your right mind?

406
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:51,778
People work so carelessly.
Finish up quickly!

407
00:33:51,868 --> 00:33:52,988
Pardon me.

408
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,708
What are you doing?

409
00:33:56,288 --> 00:33:57,168
Who are you?

410
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,498
I'm the owner of this place.

411
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,548
Oh, that's a forest fire
surveillance camera,

412
00:34:02,628 --> 00:34:04,008
but we installed it incorrectly.

413
00:34:04,088 --> 00:34:05,588
I'm sorry. We'll finish it quickly.

414
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,968
Hey, hurry up.

415
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:08,048
How long

416
00:34:09,678 --> 00:34:11,178
has that been installed?

417
00:36:01,788 --> 00:36:03,418
I'm telling you again.

418
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:07,128
But I don't know who Ms. Lee Sina is.

419
00:36:17,428 --> 00:36:18,718
Do you know who that is?

420
00:36:26,308 --> 00:36:27,478
Who is it?

421
00:36:40,828 --> 00:36:42,038
"Garbage."

422
00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:45,578
He called me "garbage."

423
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:48,708
Noh Gojin, you scumbag.

424
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:52,468
I swear I'm going to kill you.

425
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:03,808
Why are you so upset?

426
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:06,098
Noh Gojin, that punk,

427
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,688
terminated my contract.

428
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:13,528
Do you know what I've done for him?

429
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:17,568
I'm the one who built up Gotop.

430
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:21,158
I'm the one! Kang Min!

431
00:37:22,238 --> 00:37:25,158
Wow, he's a real scumbag.

432
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:28,168
He threw you out
just because you made a mistake?

433
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:30,378
I'm going to…

434
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,088
kill…

435
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:35,798
that scumbag.

436
00:37:39,888 --> 00:37:42,388
-Did you just laugh?
-That's a little unrealistic.

437
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,058
You can't kill anyone.

438
00:37:45,178 --> 00:37:47,978
I doubt you can even
bump him gently with your car.

439
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,608
What if I do hit him with my car?

440
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,188
Hey, our friendship is very special.

441
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:57,568
We built our friendship
in the gambling scene.

442
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:00,118
We know each other quite well.

443
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,788
I guarantee you. You can't do it.
You know why?

444
00:38:04,788 --> 00:38:05,998
Because you're chicken-hearted.

445
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:07,418
You punk.

446
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,788
What if I do?

447
00:38:11,168 --> 00:38:12,288
I said, you can't.

448
00:38:12,378 --> 00:38:14,338
What if I do?

449
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,298
I'll eat my hat if that happens.

450
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:20,258
No, even if you just
bump Noh Gojin gently with your car,

451
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:22,218
I'll pay you a big bill. Sounds good?

452
00:38:25,098 --> 00:38:26,478
That was a joke. I take it back.

453
00:38:26,558 --> 00:38:27,848
Hey.

454
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:30,728
You can't just take it back.

455
00:38:32,398 --> 00:38:33,898
Watch me.

456
00:38:35,278 --> 00:38:36,778
I'll show you what I can do.

457
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:18,778
DR. CHO

458
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:28,578
Darn it, why isn't he picking up?

459
00:39:36,088 --> 00:39:37,548
I made a bet with someone.

460
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,798
You hit me…

461
00:39:41,968 --> 00:39:43,428
because of a bet?

462
00:39:44,928 --> 00:39:46,058
I'm sorry.

463
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,518
Forget it.

464
00:39:55,438 --> 00:39:57,148
So who is this punk?

465
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:00,608
He goes by Dr. Cho.

466
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:03,318
I don't really know his real name either.

467
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,948
Some say he is a hidden son
of a conglomerate owner

468
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,658
or a businessman from the States.

469
00:40:10,328 --> 00:40:13,418
In any case, he's known for being loaded
with cash in the gambling world.

470
00:40:14,418 --> 00:40:16,498
Everyone has borrowed money from him.

471
00:40:17,878 --> 00:40:19,338
That's how I got to know him too.

472
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:20,838
And?

473
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,088
And…

474
00:40:26,348 --> 00:40:27,508
That's all.

475
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,718
He's never visited you?

476
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:32,428
That's how things are
between people who met while gambling.

477
00:40:36,688 --> 00:40:37,768
Oh Segi

478
00:40:39,108 --> 00:40:40,068
visited you, right?

479
00:40:42,528 --> 00:40:43,488
Why?

480
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:47,488
What did he want to know from you?

481
00:40:49,828 --> 00:40:52,868
He asked me if I'm the one who sent it.

482
00:40:55,368 --> 00:40:56,458
Sent what?

483
00:40:58,248 --> 00:40:59,458
How are you holding up?

484
00:41:03,258 --> 00:41:05,218
I'm all right.

485
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:08,678
It was you, right?

486
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:12,928
You're that punk

487
00:41:13,928 --> 00:41:15,558
who sent me that anonymous letter.

488
00:41:16,148 --> 00:41:17,058
Anonymous letter?

489
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,268
What is it?

490
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:21,608
Anonymous letter?

491
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,528
I'm not sure what it is either.

492
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:25,698
He just left after that.

493
00:41:26,738 --> 00:41:27,738
That's all.

494
00:41:39,078 --> 00:41:40,088
Sir.

495
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:44,168
I'm sorry.

496
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,448
Your passcode is still the same.

497
00:42:15,538 --> 00:42:17,368
Trespassing someone's home
is a crime, you know?

498
00:42:19,378 --> 00:42:20,578
I heard you're at Baek Edu now.

499
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:22,088
You're so capable.

500
00:42:22,588 --> 00:42:24,048
Thanks to you.

501
00:42:25,088 --> 00:42:26,168
Ms. Baek…

502
00:42:28,428 --> 00:42:30,888
is very upset with you.

503
00:42:31,638 --> 00:42:33,508
What about
the anonymous letter you received?

504
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,098
You asked Kang Min about it.

505
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:39,138
Kang Min is your source?

506
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:42,108
Aren't you supposed to be a genius?

507
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,858
You believe
what that gambling addict rambled on?

508
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:47,698
No. But my belief is based on evidence.

509
00:42:50,858 --> 00:42:51,738
What you did

510
00:42:52,828 --> 00:42:54,238
that night.

511
00:43:01,168 --> 00:43:02,128
You're a murderer.

512
00:43:05,128 --> 00:43:07,048
-What?
-How does it make sense

513
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:09,718
that a scum like you is instructing kids?

514
00:43:10,378 --> 00:43:13,388
-What are you talking about?
-You killed her.

515
00:43:14,638 --> 00:43:15,558
Oh Sehee.

516
00:43:17,518 --> 00:43:18,808
Did you say, Oh Sehee?

517
00:43:28,278 --> 00:43:29,318
SPECIAL LECTURE

518
00:43:31,238 --> 00:43:34,778
LAST PLACE NO MORE

519
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,978
What? You don't remember that either?

520
00:44:10,438 --> 00:44:12,198
Because of you,

521
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:16,328
my little sister died.

522
00:44:30,628 --> 00:44:31,798
Oh Sehee…

523
00:44:35,178 --> 00:44:36,638
was your sister?

524
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:51,398
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

525
00:44:52,568 --> 00:44:55,908
Please forgive me.
Forgive me just this once.

526
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,868
No. I'll never forgive you.

527
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:01,998
You'll never get to work in this industry.

528
00:45:07,078 --> 00:45:10,548
You killed my sister through
those horrible, malicious comments.

529
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,508
My sister didn't commit suicide.

530
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:16,298
You killed her, you murderer.

531
00:45:19,848 --> 00:45:22,098
I'm going to make you feel the same pain…

532
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:25,938
that my sister had to experience.

533
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,698
Here you go. Show this to your mom, okay?

534
00:45:41,788 --> 00:45:43,368
-Here you go.
-Bye.

535
00:45:43,448 --> 00:45:45,248
-Bye.
-Bye.

536
00:45:45,578 --> 00:45:49,208
I wonder if my son ate his meal.

537
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:51,378
Oh, right. I forgot my phone today.

538
00:45:51,878 --> 00:45:53,168
Can I borrow your phone?

539
00:45:53,258 --> 00:45:54,258
Sure.

540
00:45:56,218 --> 00:45:57,508
Here you go.

541
00:46:05,018 --> 00:46:07,228
Hello, son? It's Mom.

542
00:46:07,638 --> 00:46:08,648
Where are you?

543
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:11,978
You already got back?
You finished early today.

544
00:46:12,188 --> 00:46:13,068
Did you eat?

545
00:46:13,568 --> 00:46:16,648
Okay. I cooked curry for you.
Heat it up and eat it, okay?

546
00:46:18,238 --> 00:46:21,618
And before you go to the academy,
can you bring my phone to me?

547
00:46:23,288 --> 00:46:25,448
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

548
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,498
What a nice son.

549
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,838
My daughter gets annoyed
when I ask her to do something.

550
00:46:31,918 --> 00:46:35,128
He's a good boy. He and I are very close.

551
00:46:57,438 --> 00:46:58,528
Hello.

552
00:46:58,608 --> 00:46:59,608
Hello.

553
00:47:05,538 --> 00:47:06,538
Have a good day.

554
00:47:07,368 --> 00:47:08,708
Thank you.

555
00:47:25,638 --> 00:47:28,178
-What are you doing?
-I'm organizing the delivery packages.

556
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,138
-I'll do it.
-I'm almost done.

557
00:47:40,948 --> 00:47:42,028
Are you all right?

558
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:43,158
Yes.

559
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:56,918
What you just testified
is all true, right?

560
00:47:56,998 --> 00:47:58,918
Yes. Am I finished now?

561
00:47:59,008 --> 00:48:00,628
-Yes. Next, please.
-Mr. Kim.

562
00:48:00,968 --> 00:48:02,758
-Thank you.
-No problem.

563
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,968
-Please have a seat.
-Okay.

564
00:48:05,888 --> 00:48:08,808
We want to ask a few questions.

565
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:11,978
-When the explosive set off yesterday,
-Yes.

566
00:48:12,058 --> 00:48:14,728
where were you and what were you doing?

567
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:15,898
As for me,

568
00:48:15,978 --> 00:48:19,608
I had a show that day,
so I was at the studio with my team.

569
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:24,868
Any odd happenings recently?

570
00:48:24,948 --> 00:48:26,488
Odd happenings?

571
00:48:26,578 --> 00:48:28,908
Yes. For example, death threats.

572
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:34,078
No, nothing like that.

573
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,708
I see. Oh, right.

574
00:48:39,168 --> 00:48:40,168
Please take a look.

575
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:43,798
What's this?

576
00:48:44,128 --> 00:48:47,798
Three months ago, all the employees
of Gotop received this e-mail.

577
00:48:47,888 --> 00:48:49,138
All the employees?

578
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:51,888
It's a method
often used by hackers these days.

579
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,308
Once a person checks the e-mail
and a certain time passes,

580
00:48:55,938 --> 00:48:57,898
it gets deleted automatically.

581
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:02,148
An employee from the PR department
found it odd and took a picture of it.

582
00:49:04,198 --> 00:49:05,198
Isn't this…

583
00:49:06,908 --> 00:49:09,658
practically a threat to kill me?

584
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,498
Well, that's what it says,

585
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:15,368
but no one reported it to the police

586
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:16,748
thinking that it was just a joke.

587
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,458
No one?

588
00:49:23,258 --> 00:49:28,098
Fortunately, we believe
it's unrelated to this bomb incident.

589
00:49:29,678 --> 00:49:31,178
Pardon me for a moment.

590
00:49:33,228 --> 00:49:34,228
What?

591
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:36,098
Oh, really?

592
00:49:37,228 --> 00:49:39,268
Anyway, okay. I'm hanging up now. Bye.

593
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:41,938
The culprit has been caught just now.

594
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,408
Please come this way.

595
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:58,538
Hello.

596
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:02,958
He's the one who sent the explosive.

597
00:50:06,718 --> 00:50:09,218
This kid did it?

598
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:10,758
Yes.

599
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,678
Hey, you. Why did you do that?

600
00:50:15,518 --> 00:50:17,728
He said he won't say anything
until his mom comes.

601
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,558
He's been keeping silent.

602
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,148
Whatever his reason may be,

603
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:23,938
please punish him.

604
00:50:24,028 --> 00:50:26,898
Sir, but he's just a kid.

605
00:50:29,108 --> 00:50:31,278
It wasn't my son. I did it.

606
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:32,408
Mom.

607
00:50:35,448 --> 00:50:36,328
Are you all right?

608
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,498
Why did you do that? What was the reason?

609
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,168
You made my mom suffer.

610
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:43,878
I saw everything on her phone.

611
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,258
Hey, son. Just have a seat, okay?

612
00:50:47,168 --> 00:50:48,088
Come on now.

613
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:56,348
You don't remember me, do you?

614
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,188
I was your secretary.

615
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:04,228
You were… my secretary?

616
00:51:05,778 --> 00:51:06,778
Yes.

617
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:09,778
Although I quit in less than three months.

618
00:51:12,618 --> 00:51:15,328
You didn't even treat me
like a human being.

619
00:51:15,988 --> 00:51:18,208
You never even bothered to look my way.

620
00:51:19,918 --> 00:51:20,998
So,

621
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,088
I sent it to take revenge on you.

622
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:27,418
I'm the one who sent the cut-up teddy bear

623
00:51:27,628 --> 00:51:29,508
and a headless mannequin too.

624
00:51:30,548 --> 00:51:34,428
So my son didn't do anything wrong!

625
00:51:40,558 --> 00:51:42,478
Why is it so slow today?

626
00:51:43,188 --> 00:51:44,768
Why isn't Hyesun here yet?

627
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:46,228
That's odd.

628
00:51:48,938 --> 00:51:49,778
Hey, you guys!

629
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:51,658
Ms. Gong. Is something wrong?

630
00:51:51,738 --> 00:51:54,278
-Oh, gosh! Something terrible happened!
-Terrible?

631
00:51:54,368 --> 00:51:55,948
Is Gotop under search and seizure?

632
00:51:56,028 --> 00:51:59,698
No, not that.
Hyesun's son is in big trouble!

633
00:51:59,788 --> 00:52:00,618
-What?
-What?

634
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:08,088
What? What brings you here, ma'am?

635
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:11,378
We're like you, Ms. Lee.

636
00:52:12,258 --> 00:52:13,258
Sorry?

637
00:52:13,468 --> 00:52:16,508
Don't you remember
that I did a handover to you?

638
00:52:24,688 --> 00:52:28,068
Hello. My name is Lee Sina.
I was newly assigned to this position.

639
00:52:34,278 --> 00:52:35,908
Oh, you're that secretary?

640
00:52:35,988 --> 00:52:37,618
Yes, it was me.

641
00:52:38,028 --> 00:52:39,288
Hyesun, Eunhee, and I are

642
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:42,458
former secretaries who couldn't endure it
and quit in less than three months.

643
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:45,958
You know how much we suffered,

644
00:52:46,418 --> 00:52:49,208
felt wronged, were tormented and angry

645
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,008
because of Mr. Noh, right?

646
00:52:51,508 --> 00:52:52,628
That's why

647
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,678
we took revenge on him.

648
00:52:56,548 --> 00:53:00,598
We're truly sorry for shocking you,

649
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,228
but please forgive Hyesun's son.

650
00:53:04,308 --> 00:53:05,808
Please forgive Hyesun's son.

651
00:53:09,108 --> 00:53:11,068
Oh, I see.

652
00:53:11,778 --> 00:53:13,698
It's so unoriginal.

653
00:53:13,778 --> 00:53:15,488
When you read the e-mail,

654
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:17,488
it gets deleted automatically.

655
00:53:17,908 --> 00:53:20,038
That's why it's hard to trace it.

656
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,288
Hey, over here.

657
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:26,418
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

658
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:29,458
No way. Are you in shock or something?

659
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:31,878
The fact that all my employees

660
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,418
didn't tell me about
an e-mail threatening to kill me

661
00:53:36,178 --> 00:53:39,258
must mean that they wished me dead, right?

662
00:53:39,348 --> 00:53:43,268
Wow, so it is true. You are in shock.

663
00:53:43,558 --> 00:53:45,688
Don't be so dramatic.

664
00:53:45,768 --> 00:53:48,478
I think they just thought it was a joke.

665
00:53:49,228 --> 00:53:50,858
No one told me about it.

666
00:53:52,148 --> 00:53:53,398
Not even one person.

667
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:57,028
All my employees

668
00:53:59,568 --> 00:54:01,278
took the culprit's side.

669
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,248
You're here.

670
00:54:09,668 --> 00:54:12,668
Sir, you have guests
waiting in your office.

671
00:54:27,388 --> 00:54:28,478
Who are you?

672
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:33,318
I'm sure you don't remember us, but we're…

673
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:35,648
your former secretaries.

674
00:54:38,198 --> 00:54:39,278
Please forgive us.

675
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:42,578
Hyesun didn't do it alone.
We were all in it together.

676
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:44,158
Well, as for me…

677
00:54:45,948 --> 00:54:47,748
I even did worse things.

678
00:54:51,628 --> 00:54:53,498
The day you got into the car accident,

679
00:54:54,248 --> 00:54:56,708
I damaged the surveillance cameras
at your vacation house

680
00:54:57,548 --> 00:54:58,508
in Gangneung.

681
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:02,348
I did that because I was so angry.

682
00:55:02,428 --> 00:55:04,098
I really worked hard.

683
00:55:04,758 --> 00:55:07,388
I really gave it all I got to please you.

684
00:55:07,478 --> 00:55:12,188
She's right. We really worked hard.

685
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,518
If you're really sorry,

686
00:55:15,898 --> 00:55:17,238
pay the price.

687
00:55:17,438 --> 00:55:19,698
I'm not going to forgive you.

688
00:55:20,948 --> 00:55:24,328
Hire a lawyer immediately
and get ready for a lawsuit.

689
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:28,578
That'll be much more beneficial to you
than what you're asking of me right now.

690
00:56:08,828 --> 00:56:09,828
Can't you

691
00:56:11,748 --> 00:56:14,828
forgive them?

692
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:17,958
The former secretaries.

693
00:56:20,508 --> 00:56:22,678
No, I won't forgive them.

694
00:56:24,428 --> 00:56:27,558
Then, can you forgive the kid at least?

695
00:56:28,808 --> 00:56:31,728
He's still young
and he did it for his mom--

696
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:34,808
That's their problem, not mine.

697
00:56:37,068 --> 00:56:39,188
Please let it slide just this once.

698
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,568
Why should I do that?

699
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:44,318
Then everything will get better.

700
00:56:45,198 --> 00:56:48,278
No, I won't do that.

701
00:56:50,788 --> 00:56:54,038
But can't you let it slide just once?

702
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:57,128
We endured
working with you every single day!

703
00:56:59,128 --> 00:56:59,958
"We"?

704
00:57:01,298 --> 00:57:03,008
Whose side are you taking right now?

705
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:06,888
I'm not taking sides…

706
00:57:07,178 --> 00:57:09,258
But you almost got hurt!

707
00:57:10,638 --> 00:57:13,348
I was just a little startled.

708
00:57:13,428 --> 00:57:17,018
Can't you consider
the secretaries' feelings just once?

709
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:18,978
They aren't ill-willed.

710
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:23,818
They've been scarred because of
your insensitive actions and words.

711
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:24,778
Scarred?

712
00:57:25,278 --> 00:57:27,568
So it's okay to send
a homemade bomb if you've been scarred?

713
00:57:29,578 --> 00:57:30,448
Then what about me?

714
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,288
What about me?

715
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:39,128
Why… Why is everyone doing this to me?

716
00:57:41,048 --> 00:57:44,668
How can you take their sides, not mine?

717
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,718
How can you not take my side?

718
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:53,928
Fine.

719
00:57:55,518 --> 00:57:57,518
I suppose you aren't
any different from them.

720
00:58:26,168 --> 00:58:27,428
What's wrong?

721
00:58:27,508 --> 00:58:29,178
What happened? Tell me.

722
00:58:29,888 --> 00:58:30,798
Mr. Noh Manners--

723
00:58:31,798 --> 00:58:33,968
I mean, did you
get in an argument with Mr. Noh?

724
00:59:36,988 --> 00:59:41,868
YOU SHOULD DIE, D-0

725
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:47,628
Just tell me. What did you argue about?

726
00:59:50,508 --> 00:59:51,468
I think Mr. Noh is here.

727
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:57,558
Don't play hard to get
and accept his apology, okay?

728
00:59:58,518 --> 01:00:00,178
What are you waiting for? Go get the door.

729
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,338
Hello.

730
01:00:33,628 --> 01:00:34,548
Hello.

731
01:00:36,388 --> 01:00:37,808
Ms. Na Sooyeon?

732
01:01:06,748 --> 01:01:09,168
RESTRICTED NUMBER

733
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:15,088
It was a long wait, wasn't it?

734
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:20,428
I have something that's precious to you.

735
01:01:22,808 --> 01:01:23,888
Who are you?

736
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:27,058
What are you doing to Lee Sina?

737
01:01:43,198 --> 01:01:47,628
The person you are calling is
not available. Transferring to voicemail.

738
01:02:23,038 --> 01:02:24,038
Sina.

739
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:28,288
Lee Sina!

740
01:04:03,008 --> 01:04:05,008
