1
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:10,928
CRAZY LOVE

2
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:32,908
CRAZY LOVE

3
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:36,248
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:19,208
Then…

5
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:24,918
we're dating starting today, right?

6
00:01:28,378 --> 00:01:29,218
No.

7
00:01:34,518 --> 00:01:35,518
Starting tomorrow.

8
00:02:12,468 --> 00:02:13,638
We're here.

9
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:15,638
Yes.

10
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,438
-It's going to be so delicious.
-It's going to be so delicious.

11
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:22,358
-It's going to be so delicious.
-It's going to be so delicious.

12
00:02:22,438 --> 00:02:24,148
It's Sina!

13
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:28,148
Who is that guy?

14
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:31,028
It's my brother-in-law.

15
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,738
Gojin!

16
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:39,828
EPISODE 12

17
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:43,288
Wow, you're holding hands out in the open?

18
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:45,168
Is everything well?

19
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,088
Yes, Gojin.

20
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,878
We waited in line for over an hour
to get some tripe.

21
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:52,008
Do you want to eat with us?

22
00:02:52,388 --> 00:02:53,428
It's really delicious.

23
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:55,888
Sounds good.

24
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,348
But you don't eat tripe.

25
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,268
That's why I should try it.

26
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,728
You don't have to eat something you hate.
Besides, it's late--

27
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,478
I want to have a glass of beer with Gojin.

28
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:11,858
Let's go inside now. Come on!

29
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,618
Hurry inside. Don't drag your feet.

30
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,788
You were talking about yourself
when you mentioned your colleague.

31
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:23,328
Hey, Mr. Noh Manners has amnesia.
What are you going to do?

32
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:24,668
-The thing is--
-Gosh.

33
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:26,708
I don't know what to tell you anymore.

34
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:30,128
This was bound to happen
when you spend so much time together.

35
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:35,008
The tripe is going to be delicious.

36
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:37,758
WHEN THE INITIAL CONSONANT OF
THE SECOND WORD DOES NOT GET TENSED

37
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:03,868
HOW TO BE A GOOD INSTRUCTOR

38
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,218
What are you doing?

39
00:04:17,138 --> 00:04:18,888
The reality isn't as beautiful as a dream.

40
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,348
-Sorry?
-To students, an instructor

41
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:25,768
is a technician rather than a teacher.

42
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:30,898
Someone who can teach them
techniques to do well on exams.

43
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:37,068
Even at this moment, the students are
looking for better technicians.

44
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:45,368
That's why you can't do this, Lee Sina.

45
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:49,458
You're going to get hurt.

46
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:52,168
You get hurt too.

47
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:53,588
But you still teach them.

48
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,628
I don't care.

49
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,758
You're a person too. How can you not?

50
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:04,058
Holden Caulfield says this.

51
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:08,768
When all the little kids playing freely
in this big field of rye

52
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:11,318
start to go over the cliff,

53
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:15,568
I'd like to stand there to catch the kids.

54
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:19,118
I'd just be the catcher in the rye.

55
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:25,288
I don't care if I'm a technician
or a teacher to them.

56
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:29,078
I just want to be
that kind of adult to them.

57
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,458
Because I didn't have anyone like that.

58
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:41,098
I want to become like you too.

59
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:43,428
Okay.

60
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,018
Wait.

61
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:50,438
That's not what I meant.

62
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:53,518
You really encouraged me just now.

63
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:56,398
No. That's not what I meant.

64
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:57,988
I'll work really hard.

65
00:05:58,778 --> 00:06:00,658
I meant you shouldn't do it.

66
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:03,778
It's late. Please go home for now.

67
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:04,988
I have to study.

68
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:07,868
But I meant,
you shouldn't become an instructor!

69
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:08,958
Wait.

70
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:09,388
Did you sleep well?

71
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:11,388
Yes.

72
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,068
Let's go.

73
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:27,738
Get in.

74
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,158
It's okay.

75
00:08:09,578 --> 00:08:10,408
Hello.

76
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,788
Hello, sir.

77
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:26,678
My goodness! What's going on?

78
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:29,428
Is Mr. Noh carrying Ms. Lee's bag for her?

79
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:32,268
I never knew he could be like that.

80
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:35,768
My goodness.

81
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:41,528
People are looking at us.

82
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:43,108
Let them.

83
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:45,778
Why? Are you ashamed of me?

84
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,238
It's not that, but we're at work.

85
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:50,278
You shouldn't
hold my hand openly like this.

86
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:52,368
Is that so?

87
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,658
Gosh. How annoying.

88
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:56,288
Okay. Is that better?

89
00:08:57,918 --> 00:09:01,498
What? What are you doing?
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

90
00:09:09,638 --> 00:09:10,638
Jeez, that really stings!

91
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:12,888
What do you think?

92
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:15,728
Mr. Noh Manners will be shocked
when he opens this, right?

93
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:19,938
Wow, it's like a real bomb.

94
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:20,978
Isn't it?

95
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:24,398
It's for self-defense,
but isn't it like a real bomb?

96
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:27,658
I searched so hard online to find this.

97
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:30,028
Let's use this
for the next round of revenge.

98
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:33,988
Okay. It's going to make
Mr. Noh Manners shed some tears.

99
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:37,578
If you have another one,
can you give it to me?

100
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:39,328
My son likes things like this.

101
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:40,458
Sure.

102
00:09:41,418 --> 00:09:43,548
But what's taking Eunhee so long?

103
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:45,918
-She's going to love--
-Hey!

104
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:47,298
Did you guys hear?

105
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,258
Hear what?

106
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:52,178
Mr. Noh told Ms. Lee
not to go get sandwiches.

107
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,388
Why not? What's wrong
with Eunhee's sandwiches?

108
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,228
He told the teaching assistants

109
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:58,138
to get their own snacks from now on

110
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:01,398
because it hurts his woman's arms.

111
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:06,608
Mr. Noh Manners really said that?

112
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:08,398
Has he lost his mind?

113
00:10:08,948 --> 00:10:10,318
-My goodness.
-He must have.

114
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:13,578
He hasn't lost his mind. He's in love.

115
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:16,038
My goodness. What did I tell you?

116
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:20,118
Mr. Noh completely changed.

117
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,668
My goodness. He's so nice now.

118
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,708
-What?
-Why?

119
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:27,628
He must've gotten scared
after getting threatened by you guys.

120
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:33,508
Anyway, what is that?

121
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:36,178
-Oh, it's a gift.
-Yes.

122
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:40,188
-What is it?
-What would you like to eat, Ms. Gong?

123

GOTOP EDUCATION DEPUTY CEO OH SEGI

124

GOTOP EDUCATION LIST OF SHAREHOLDERS

125
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,948
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
PARK YIJI

126
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,098
Hello?

127
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,058
This is Sebom Nursing Home.

128
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,688
Yes. How may I help you?

129
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:36,578
Okay, understood. I'll come by soon.

130
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:38,788
Yes.

131
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:48,918
Let's go home.

132
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:49,878
Sorry?

133
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:52,758
Already?

134
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,298
You need to start working less.

135
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:02,098
Let's go.

136
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:03,848
But…

137
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:43,678
It looks good.

138
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:07,668
I'm good at cooking Korean cuisine,
so western cuisine isn't my forte.

139
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:09,588
Korean cuisine?

140
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:29,478
This is it.

141
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:31,108
It's good.

142
00:13:51,588 --> 00:13:53,168
Why are you removing the paper talisman?

143
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:56,008
You said it blocks all the bad luck.

144
00:13:56,588 --> 00:14:00,388
I heard that paper talismans
have an expiration date.

145
00:14:00,468 --> 00:14:02,258
You shouldn't hang it up for too long.

146
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:10,688
I'll wash the dishes.

147
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,018
No.

148
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:16,148
Why not? The person who didn't cook
is supposed to do the dishes.

149
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:19,028
You can't overwork.

150
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,868
Overwork? This isn't much work.

151
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,028
Go sit down.

152
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:38,048
Come here.

153
00:14:38,468 --> 00:14:39,798
Come get me if you can.

154
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:41,178
I said, come here.

155
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:42,758
-How are you so angry?
-Come here.

156
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,848
I was just washing the dishes.

157
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:49,478
Come here while I'm still nice.

158
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:51,228
I don't want to.

159
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,308
You'll cry if I catch you.

160
00:14:53,398 --> 00:14:54,978
Then catch me if you can.

161
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,998
-That tickles.
-Come here.

162
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:22,218
Rest like this for a little while.

163
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,148
Don't worry about anything.

164
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,608
I'll never let you go.

165
00:16:10,848 --> 00:16:12,348
Are you really going to Baek Edu?

166
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:15,268
You said you'd never
work for a new company.

167
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:18,518
I'm recording a TV show next week.

168
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,068
Recording a TV show?

169
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:22,068
Make sure you all stay tuned.

170
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:26,118
Oh, my.

171
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:46,638
I want to ask you all a favor.

172
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:50,968
Did you say a "favor"?

173
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:53,178
You have a favor to ask us?

174
00:16:53,268 --> 00:16:54,268
Did I hear it wrong?

175
00:16:54,728 --> 00:16:56,688
As experienced instructors,

176
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:58,808
please give a word of advice to a junior.

177
00:16:59,438 --> 00:17:01,068
Consider it donating your talent.

178
00:17:01,148 --> 00:17:05,948
It might be
the last precious lesson for someone.

179
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:07,488
A junior?

180
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:10,988
For Ms. Lee Sina.

181
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:18,498
What?
You're such a fool for love, Mr. Noh.

182
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:22,668
Are you asking us
to give private lessons to your fiancée?

183
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:25,668
My goodness. I don't know what to say!

184
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:30,008
Please.

185
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:32,138
Unbelievable!

186
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,148
Hello.

187
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:40,768
Gosh, it was so long ago.

188
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:42,438
In my day,

189
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,688
after deciding to become an instructor,

190
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:48,358
all I did was practice my pronunciation
under a blanket every day.

191
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:53,118
Of course, the content
of the lesson is important.

192
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,788
But what's more important is

193
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:58,368
to deliver the lesson

194
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,288
with perfect tone and pronunciation.

195
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:01,668
Do-re-mi-fa-sol

196
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:04,878
This "sol" tone.

197
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:09,088
Okay.

198
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:10,338
You can do it.

199
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,928
THE BEST IN CSAT KOREAN

200
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:23,018
-Put yourself in someone else's shoes.
-Pardon?

201
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:27,988
A good instructor should make
even difficult problems easy to digest.

202
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:31,948
You have to think
from their perspective, not yours,

203
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,908
what you can do to make it easy

204
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,038
for them to understand.

205
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,338
Actually, a lecture is all acting.

206
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:52,138
You have to follow
a perfectly written scenario.

207
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:53,218
You must be thick-skinned.

208
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,178
Pardon? What do you mean?

209
00:18:56,268 --> 00:19:00,228
To be honest, I felt shy at the beginning,
so I hid my face like this to practice.

210
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,518
What's a lecture?

211
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:03,938
Acting.

212
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,698
What's wrong?

213
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,288
Sorry?

214
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:20,658
-Does your head hurt?
-No, it doesn't.

215
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:23,038
Let's go to the hospital now.

216
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,538
No, that's not necessary.

217
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:27,958
Now,

218
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:32,128
you can be honest with me.

219
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,068
What should I do next?

220
00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:51,528
I'm considering stopping everything.

221
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:55,118
I plan to hire
a management specialist to run Gotop

222
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:56,828
and retire.

223
00:19:57,658 --> 00:20:00,748
Retire? Then what about Oh Segi?
You want to give up everything?

224
00:20:03,788 --> 00:20:04,958
Ms. Lee Sina…

225
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,168
has end-stage glioblastoma.

226
00:20:15,178 --> 00:20:17,388
Let him kill me if that's what he wants.

227
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:20,098
I don't have time to waste
on people like that.

228
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,558
To me…

229
00:20:24,938 --> 00:20:27,478
nothing else is more important
than Lee Sina right now.

230
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,108
That's what I've decided.

231
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:37,068
I see. Yes, okay.

232
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:53,418
Eating bread?

233
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:54,508
Yup.

234
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:02,058
It's the weekend. No date today?

235
00:21:04,518 --> 00:21:05,688
He's busy.

236
00:21:07,728 --> 00:21:12,358
Honey, no matter how busy you are,
you can always make time to date.

237
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:18,368
Hey, what if he got his memories back?

238
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:22,118
He sent you a message.

239
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:33,838
How did you know where I live?

240
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,218
I did a background check on you.

241
00:21:38,968 --> 00:21:40,008
That was a joke.

242
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:46,058
Oh, right. Did you think about
my offer to recruit you?

243
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:52,358
Thank you for the offer,
but I believe I have more studying to do.

244
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,448
If you become an instructor at Gotop,

245
00:21:57,028 --> 00:21:59,568
people are going to say that
you became one because of your fiancé.

246
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:03,658
Then it'll affect Mr. Noh's reputation.
Don't you think?

247
00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:07,078
If you really want
to become an instructor,

248
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,118
you have to leave Gotop.

249
00:22:09,418 --> 00:22:10,378
That's…

250
00:22:11,878 --> 00:22:14,128
the best decision for the two of you.

251
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,218
MY DEAR MR. NOH

252
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:22,928
You may answer it.

253
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,888
No, I can answer it later.

254
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:29,978
Please don't refuse my offer.

255
00:22:30,898 --> 00:22:33,398
Okay. I'll think about it.

256
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:46,328
Why isn't she picking up?

257
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:04,848
Ms. Baek Sooyeong.

258
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,518
What are you doing?

259
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:13,558
What do you mean?

260
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:15,188
What brings you all the way here?

261
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,608
I came to see Ms. Sina.

262
00:23:19,438 --> 00:23:22,698
Ms. Baek Sooyeong.
How long will you keep doing this?

263
00:23:23,698 --> 00:23:27,368
I don't care or want to know
about our relationship in the past.

264
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:30,578
So please stop now.

265
00:23:32,618 --> 00:23:34,418
Do you trust your fiancée?

266
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:40,378
You don't even remember her.

267
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:42,378
How do you know
if she's really your fiancée?

268
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:43,638
So,

269
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:47,218
are you going to steal
your friend's fiancé?

270
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:49,468
What if she's the one who stole my man?

271
00:23:50,928 --> 00:23:54,648
You don't remember either me or Lee Sina.

272
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:57,188
But how come you don't doubt her?

273
00:23:57,268 --> 00:24:00,318
How can you trust her to be your fiancée
when Mr. Oh didn't even know about her?

274
00:24:03,028 --> 00:24:04,108
What if Lee Sina

275
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,658
is pretending to be your fiancée?

276
00:24:09,618 --> 00:24:12,328
She might be deceiving you.

277
00:24:14,998 --> 00:24:16,128
It doesn't matter.

278
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:20,668
Because I like her.

279
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,228
Please don't refuse my offer.

280
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,188
-Hello?
-Where are you, sis?

281
00:24:43,738 --> 00:24:44,898
I'm almost home. Why?

282
00:24:44,988 --> 00:24:47,198
Come quickly. It's insane.

283
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:48,658
What?

284
00:24:56,168 --> 00:24:57,168
Sina.

285
00:24:57,578 --> 00:25:00,248
What? What's all this?

286
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:01,458
A bed was delivered too.

287
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:03,298
A bed?

288
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,378
What's this?

289
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:09,718
A good night's sleep is
most important to your health.

290
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:11,258
-Please try lying down.
-Sorry?

291
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:13,218
-Let's try it. Come on.
-But…

292
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:14,598
Come over here now.

293
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,978
Is something else here?

294
00:25:21,778 --> 00:25:23,188
Hello.

295
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:24,648
One moment, please.

296
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:29,738
Who are you?

297
00:25:29,818 --> 00:25:33,158
If you vacate for three hours,
we'll clean and disinfect everything.

298
00:25:48,928 --> 00:25:50,348
The air feels different.

299
00:26:02,318 --> 00:26:03,148
Gojin.

300
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,228
Hi.

301
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,118
What's with all this?

302
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,908
Wow, this place is so clean now.

303
00:26:16,578 --> 00:26:18,248
I should come and live here too.

304
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:22,668
No way. You can't live in a small place
like this. There's no place to sleep.

305
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:26,008
Why not? Sooho can sleep in your room

306
00:26:26,088 --> 00:26:28,338
and I can sleep
in Ms. Sina's room with her.

307
00:26:29,008 --> 00:26:30,298
Why would Sooho do that?

308
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:34,098
But you two are…

309
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,018
dating.

310
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:52,118
As expected, Sina didn't know.

311
00:26:53,318 --> 00:26:54,868
You guys are siblings indeed.

312
00:26:55,868 --> 00:26:58,958
Sooho didn't realize
that I was the real Noh Gojin,

313
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:02,458
and Ms. Sina didn't realize
her friend was dating her brother

314
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,128
even though she's living with her.

315
00:27:09,718 --> 00:27:10,838
Are you…

316
00:27:12,178 --> 00:27:13,008
Really?

317
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:16,258
Sina, the thing is…

318
00:27:17,768 --> 00:27:19,308
I'll protect my woman!

319
00:27:26,518 --> 00:27:29,278
Lee Sina, if you need
someone to blame, blame--

320
00:27:37,408 --> 00:27:38,408
She hit me.

321
00:27:38,498 --> 00:27:40,538
Oh no, my dear Sooho.

322
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:44,998
You're the one
who sent all these, right? Why?

323
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,878
I feel too anxious.

324
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:52,128
I feel anxious when I can't reach you

325
00:27:53,008 --> 00:27:54,798
and when you're meeting other people.

326
00:27:55,468 --> 00:27:57,178
Why do you feel anxious?

327
00:27:59,348 --> 00:28:00,178
Because…

328
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:03,938
you're ill.

329
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:15,868
What…

330
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,288
Did you… read this?

331
00:28:19,368 --> 00:28:21,498
Your health is
what's most important right now.

332
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:25,708
-What it says here isn't true.
-You don't have to lie.

333
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,588
-I said, it's not true!
-We have to go through it together now.

334
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:30,168
Please don't go through it alone.

335
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:33,678
But what I wrote in my will really
isn't true anymore! It's all wrong--

336
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:37,798
Please don't say anything anymore
and listen to me.

337
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,318
I'm not ill.

338
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:50,898
Hello, sir.

339
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:56,738
Sir, it's not true.

340
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:01,868
It's really not true. Please believe me!

341
00:29:02,448 --> 00:29:03,448
Okay.

342
00:29:08,128 --> 00:29:09,838
I'll think that way.

343
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,168
But…

344
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,968
I'm really not ill.

345
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,678
-When is your hospital appointment?
-I'm not going to the hospital.

346
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:22,428
Don't even think about going alone.

347
00:29:22,518 --> 00:29:23,518
But…

348
00:29:23,768 --> 00:29:24,768
Sir,

349
00:29:25,228 --> 00:29:27,808
I believe this problem is erroneous.

350
00:29:37,198 --> 00:29:39,698
This supplement promotes
blood flow to the brain,

351
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:42,538
and this tea is good for headaches.
And this one is--

352
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:45,828
It's not true. I don't have cancer!

353
00:29:48,498 --> 00:29:50,458
I understand why you want to hide it,

354
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,378
but I'm ready to embrace it.

355
00:29:54,508 --> 00:29:55,968
So let's go through it together.

356
00:29:58,008 --> 00:29:59,928
Fine. Let's go to the hospital.

357
00:30:00,638 --> 00:30:04,428
That's it! It's great
to see you depend on me like this.

358
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:06,478
Let's go now.

359
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,938
DR. HAN JIHO

360
00:30:20,868 --> 00:30:24,038
Please tell me everything
without hiding a thing.

361
00:30:25,368 --> 00:30:26,748
I'm Ms. Lee Sina's guardian.

362
00:30:34,548 --> 00:30:35,458
Well…

363
00:30:38,298 --> 00:30:39,838
-Ms. Lee Sina--
-Wait!

364
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,028
Okay.

365
00:31:04,618 --> 00:31:06,118
The thing is…

366
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:09,328
Ms. Lee Sina…

367
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,248
isn't at the final stage…

368
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:21,928
of glioblastoma.
It was a misdiagnosis. I'm so sorry.

369
00:31:26,598 --> 00:31:27,638
What?

370
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:29,728
A misdiagnosis.

371
00:31:35,058 --> 00:31:37,858
Misdiagnosis…

372
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,568
I told you I wasn't ill.

373
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:51,458
Why…

374
00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:54,538
Why didn't you tell me?

375
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:57,208
Why didn't you tell me
that it was a misdiagnosis?

376
00:31:57,918 --> 00:32:00,088
I kept telling you that I wasn't ill.

377
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:03,428
But you didn't tell me clearly
that it was a misdiagnosis.

378
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:05,598
If you had just said
that it was a misdiagnosis, I…

379
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,928
I wouldn't have been like this.

380
00:32:10,018 --> 00:32:11,728
You wouldn't have been like this?

381
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:13,598
What do you mean by that?

382
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,908
He doesn't love me.

383
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:28,948
He just pitied me.

384
00:32:31,328 --> 00:32:33,408
Is that why he asked me to date?

385
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,228
Do you know how tormented I was?

386
00:32:58,058 --> 00:32:59,768
I thought I made you ill…

387
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,688
and were going to die.

388
00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:06,028
I thought you had cancer because of me.

389
00:33:06,408 --> 00:33:08,118
I was going to quit work and everything

390
00:33:09,158 --> 00:33:11,828
and go anywhere
if it were to save your life.

391
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:15,118
I thought you…

392
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:19,038
like my parents,

393
00:33:20,418 --> 00:33:21,748
like my grandmother,

394
00:33:23,298 --> 00:33:24,798
would also leave me behind…

395
00:33:27,218 --> 00:33:28,848
I was afraid to death.

396
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,028
Hello.

397
00:35:17,998 --> 00:35:21,208
Sir, look who is here.

398
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,628
He even brought bananas
that you love so much.

399
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:34,848
Father.

400
00:35:39,098 --> 00:35:41,018
Who are you, sir?

401
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:44,608
It's me. Segi.

402
00:35:45,688 --> 00:35:46,688
Your son.

403
00:35:49,028 --> 00:35:51,778
I'm not your father, sir.

404
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:53,908
I don't have a son.

405
00:35:54,908 --> 00:35:56,368
Please look carefully.

406
00:35:56,658 --> 00:35:58,448
It's your son.

407
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:05,998
You darn wench!

408
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:09,458
I asked for my daughter.
But you brought your husband?

409
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:12,088
You mean wench. Darn you!

410
00:36:12,718 --> 00:36:13,628
Darn you.

411
00:36:25,688 --> 00:36:26,688
Aren't you coming?

412
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:32,698
Sir.

413
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:36,318
Can you bring my daughter Sehee?

414
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,618
My daughter Sehee. Can you?

415
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:08,358
Hello? This is Oh Segi
from Gotop Education calling.

416
00:37:08,558 --> 00:37:09,648
How are you?

417
00:37:11,568 --> 00:37:13,988
I need to talk to you
about something important.

418
00:37:56,648 --> 00:37:57,658
It hurts.

419
00:37:58,778 --> 00:37:59,778
It hurts!

420
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:54,248
You look pretty.

421
00:38:59,878 --> 00:39:01,178
Have you been here before?

422
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:02,888
No, it's my first time here.

423
00:39:16,108 --> 00:39:17,738
The one that I sniffed?

424
00:39:18,988 --> 00:39:20,358
Yes, all the time.

425
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:27,868
Why do you keep looking at me?

426
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:42,588
Here you go.

427
00:39:51,728 --> 00:39:53,308
Let's go in here.

428
00:39:53,398 --> 00:39:54,398
Let's go.

429
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:55,648
Where?

430
00:39:57,018 --> 00:39:58,148
I'm good at taking pho--

431
00:40:22,168 --> 00:40:23,508
Oh, it's nice.

432
00:40:29,308 --> 00:40:33,018
My goodness, that girl.
She threw a fuss when it's right here?

433
00:40:43,648 --> 00:40:45,408
"I can do it!"

434
00:40:49,828 --> 00:40:52,908
"I have… cancer"?

435
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:07,338
How did you like our first date?

436
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,558
It was so great.

437
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:12,848
Let's go on dates often.

438
00:41:13,058 --> 00:41:14,178
Of course, we should.

439
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:22,938
Hey, Lee Sina!

440
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:28,068
This is why you wanted
to get your revenge?

441
00:41:28,658 --> 00:41:31,368
Is this why you told me to pursue acting

442
00:41:32,538 --> 00:41:33,998
giving me allowance that one time?

443
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:36,668
No, it's not.

444
00:41:37,118 --> 00:41:40,958
When you said you aren't going to be here,
you meant you're going to die?

445
00:41:41,048 --> 00:41:42,918
I said, no!

446
00:41:43,008 --> 00:41:44,338
Is this all because of you?

447
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:47,338
Mr. Noh Manners, you jerk.
I'm going to kill you!

448
00:41:47,428 --> 00:41:50,258
Hey, it's not like that.

449
00:41:50,348 --> 00:41:53,268
I don't have cancer. I'm not going to die.
It was a misdiagnosis.

450
00:41:53,348 --> 00:41:54,808
-What?
-What?

451
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:56,688
Oh, I just remembered.

452
00:41:57,558 --> 00:42:00,608
The woman who was having an affair
with me in that forged picture.

453
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:02,608
He cheated on me.

454
00:42:02,818 --> 00:42:03,938
It was you, right, Ms. Okhee?

455
00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:07,448
I don't think so.

456
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:09,528
It was you.

457
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,908
Then you're an accomplice
in the fake fiancée case.

458
00:42:15,328 --> 00:42:17,578
An accomplice in the fake fiancée case?

459
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:20,748
Did his memories come back?

460
00:42:22,538 --> 00:42:23,628
Something like that.

461
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:29,218
The jerk Mr. Noh Manners isn't crazy.

462
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:34,888
I'm not friends with Lee Sina.

463
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:36,598
I don't even know who that is.

464
00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:38,598
Well, then.

465
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,558
Bye!

466
00:42:42,148 --> 00:42:43,978
Let's go now.

467
00:42:49,698 --> 00:42:50,738
COLLEGE!

468
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,328
"Your leader Gong Heechul. Believe in me."

469
00:42:56,828 --> 00:42:58,288
You're really leaving.

470
00:43:00,248 --> 00:43:03,668
Even though we didn't get along,
I feel sad now that you're leaving.

471
00:43:04,878 --> 00:43:06,168
My goodness!

472
00:43:06,798 --> 00:43:08,008
Mr. Gong.

473
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:11,468
I heard that you're leaving Gotop.

474
00:43:11,888 --> 00:43:14,348
I was wondering
when you were going to leave.

475
00:43:14,848 --> 00:43:16,808
You're finally leaving.

476
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:21,478
There were so many rumors
going around that you were leaving.

477
00:43:23,438 --> 00:43:24,978
I heard you're going to Baek Edu.

478
00:43:28,438 --> 00:43:29,568
Thanks for sharing the rumor.

479
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,108
-No problem.
-Hey, you punk. How could you…

480
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:33,318
-Chabae! Why--
-Hey!

481
00:43:33,408 --> 00:43:36,538
What is with this picture?

482
00:43:37,038 --> 00:43:41,708
Don't be so sad that I'm leaving.
Of course, it might be hard for Gotop.

483
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:44,538
Having Noh Gojin is enough for Gotop.

484
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:50,628
So, I heard that you're going to Baek Edu.

485
00:43:51,758 --> 00:43:53,508
Yes. As for the penalty--

486
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:55,598
Baek Edu will pay for it.

487
00:43:58,968 --> 00:44:02,978
Mr. Gong, the car is waiting for you.
You should go now.

488
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:04,858
I'll take care of the rest.

489
00:44:04,938 --> 00:44:07,318
My goodness.
You even have a car waiting for me?

490
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:09,148
Well then.

491
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:16,278
I'd like to speak with Mr. Noh.

492
00:44:17,028 --> 00:44:19,158
Oh, okay.

493
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,718
Do you want to criticize Baek Edu?

494
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:37,718
It's Mr. Gong Heechul's own choice.

495
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:43,638
Then you'd be okay
if I recruited Ms. Lee Sina?

496
00:44:44,688 --> 00:44:46,978
Please don't use
other people's dreams as bait.

497
00:44:47,058 --> 00:44:48,068
I'm not using her dream.

498
00:44:48,858 --> 00:44:52,688
I want to train Ms. Sina at Baek Edu
to become a good instructor.

499
00:44:56,408 --> 00:44:57,448
Enough already.

500
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,738
Nothing is enough when running a business.

501
00:45:01,788 --> 00:45:05,538
And as you said, it's Ms. Sina's choice.

502
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:22,978
Have you decided?

503
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:27,098
Yes. I really appreciate it,

504
00:45:27,518 --> 00:45:29,058
but I want to achieve it on my own.

505
00:45:31,018 --> 00:45:32,228
Achieve it on your own?

506
00:45:33,438 --> 00:45:34,898
Do you think that's possible?

507
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,568
Tell me.

508
00:45:39,408 --> 00:45:42,328
I can give you
the most optimal terms you want.

509
00:46:03,308 --> 00:46:06,228
Why didn't you tell me you got an offer
to become an instructor?

510
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:10,728
I wasn't going to accept it anyway,
so I didn't feel the need to tell you.

511
00:46:10,808 --> 00:46:12,978
You're really not going?

512
00:46:13,568 --> 00:46:16,108
That's right.
I'm going to achieve it on my own.

513
00:46:20,368 --> 00:46:21,658
Is that why you're upset?

514
00:46:22,948 --> 00:46:24,158
Who is upset?

515
00:46:24,238 --> 00:46:26,368
You were so worried
that I might leave, weren't you?

516
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:29,078
Jeez, I'm dumbfounded.

517
00:46:30,498 --> 00:46:32,588
-I wasn't worried.
-Yes, you were.

518
00:46:32,668 --> 00:46:33,958
-No, I wasn't.
-Yes, you were.

519
00:46:34,048 --> 00:46:35,418
-I said, I wasn't.
-Yes, you were.

520
00:46:35,508 --> 00:46:36,418
No, I wasn't!

521
00:46:36,508 --> 00:46:39,298
You'll know when you connect
the front and back sentences.

522
00:46:39,428 --> 00:46:42,548
What is the key to non-literature?
Analysis! That's right.

523
00:46:42,638 --> 00:46:46,178
The point is to analyze the text
quickly and accurately.

524
00:46:46,268 --> 00:46:47,308
Then what should you do?

525
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,558
You have to break the sentence into parts.

526
00:46:50,648 --> 00:46:52,478
What are the keywords?
What's the key sentence?

527
00:46:52,558 --> 00:46:55,728
You have to find comparisons,
examples, causes, and effects quickly.

528
00:46:55,818 --> 00:46:57,778
Practicing is the only way.

529
00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:02,158
The text you see on the CSAT is
something you've never seen before.

530
00:47:02,238 --> 00:47:04,578
So you have to learn to get a feel for it.

531
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:08,368
Solve basic problems
for just ten minutes every day. Okay?

532
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:10,618
That's it for today's lecture.

533
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,458
Great work!

534
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:14,998
Thank you for your hard work!

535
00:47:15,088 --> 00:47:17,708
You did so great today. That was the best.

536
00:47:17,798 --> 00:47:20,048
Hey, the advertisement shoot
is next week, right?

537
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,718
It'll be tiring
if it overlaps with the in-person lecture,

538
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,348
so please adjust my schedule ahead.

539
00:47:24,428 --> 00:47:25,718
The thing is…

540
00:47:26,848 --> 00:47:28,678
Your schedule should be okay.

541
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:31,688
What do you mean?

542
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,018
Come in.

543
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:39,948
Mr. Kim Chabae, may I help you?

544
00:47:40,028 --> 00:47:41,738
Why am I excluded from the advertisement?

545
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,448
I'm sorry.

546
00:47:48,038 --> 00:47:50,958
The next Gotop advertisement for Korean

547
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:53,958
will be done by Ms. Shin Jinyoung.

548
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,588
Ms. Shin?

549
00:47:56,458 --> 00:48:00,258
Why would she be in the advertisement?
I'm the top instructor at Gotop!

550
00:48:00,338 --> 00:48:01,628
It's Mr. Noh's decision.

551
00:48:02,258 --> 00:48:03,218
What?

552
00:48:03,718 --> 00:48:05,098
I feel terrible too.

553
00:48:05,388 --> 00:48:09,178
But you know
how cold-hearted Mr. Noh can be.

554
00:48:09,808 --> 00:48:11,888
This is what he said.

555
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:15,358
Ms. Shin Jinyoung is like the rising sun,

556
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:19,688
and you're like the setting sun.

557
00:48:21,528 --> 00:48:23,608
"The setting sun"?

558
00:48:24,608 --> 00:48:25,568
Gosh.

559
00:48:39,628 --> 00:48:41,628
After begging me for my advice,

560
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:43,298
he turns around and treats me like dirt?

561
00:48:43,798 --> 00:48:45,718
I'll show him what I'm capable of.

562
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,758
I'm Kim Chabae.

563
00:49:02,278 --> 00:49:04,648
Hello? It's me.
Can you get something for me?

564
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:07,658
One each from science, foreign language,
and public high schools.

565
00:49:26,178 --> 00:49:27,388
What's this?

566
00:49:27,468 --> 00:49:28,888
It's a second ledger set.

567
00:49:31,888 --> 00:49:34,388
Are you saying that Mr. Noh evaded taxes?

568
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,518
Even though Mr. Noh has a bad temper,
he isn't the type to evade taxes.

569
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:41,068
I heard someone internal will
report it to the authorities soon.

570
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:42,898
-Who?
-I don't know.

571
00:49:43,488 --> 00:49:45,818
So my hands are tied too.

572
00:49:46,568 --> 00:49:48,448
If the media finds out about this,

573
00:49:49,068 --> 00:49:52,288
Gotop will face a crisis.

574
00:49:52,368 --> 00:49:54,908
But it'll be difficult to replace Mr. Noh.

575
00:50:00,168 --> 00:50:04,548
What if he can't run Gotop?

576
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:08,508
What do you mean, he can't run Gotop?

577
00:50:10,548 --> 00:50:13,598
Actually, Mr. Noh has amnesia

578
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:15,598
due to the car accident in Gangneung.

579
00:50:17,268 --> 00:50:18,228
Are you serious?

580
00:50:22,858 --> 00:50:25,318
I want to protect both Gotop and Gojin.

581
00:50:25,528 --> 00:50:30,488
To do so, it'd be best to make Gojin
step down from the CEO position.

582
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,908
Please persuade the shareholders.

583
00:50:36,248 --> 00:50:37,288
What did you say?

584
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,578
Gong Heechul went to Baek Edu?

585
00:50:40,668 --> 00:50:43,998
Yes, it's the hottest topic
in the transfer discussion forum.

586
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:46,048
I can't believe she messed with Gotop.

587
00:50:46,128 --> 00:50:48,508
I thought Ms. Baek was just a pretty face,

588
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:51,138
but it turns out she has guts.

589
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:53,468
ILPUM EDU
CEO PARK YANGTAE

590
00:50:55,768 --> 00:50:56,598
Wait.

591
00:50:57,928 --> 00:51:02,478
What if Baek Edu
also steals our instructors away too?

592
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,358
Do you like Baek Edu so far?

593
00:51:07,438 --> 00:51:10,068
Yes, the black and white decor.
It feels modern.

594
00:51:10,158 --> 00:51:12,238
A new building is nice indeed.

595
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:15,408
Your exclusive team
will be ready by tomorrow.

596
00:51:15,488 --> 00:51:18,618
Please just let me know
if you need anything for the recording.

597
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:19,748
Will do.

598
00:51:29,508 --> 00:51:31,508
Ms. Baek, Mr. Park of Ilpum Edu is here.

599
00:51:32,468 --> 00:51:33,508
Mr. Park?

600
00:51:33,598 --> 00:51:37,678
Perhaps he came
because he heard about me. My goodness.

601
00:51:37,768 --> 00:51:39,768
-Have a nice chat.
-Thank you.

602
00:51:40,478 --> 00:51:41,648
Let's see.

603
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:50,528
I'll get going then.

604
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:58,908
You really brought Gong Heechul here.

605
00:51:59,868 --> 00:52:02,208
Yes, I did. Please have a seat.

606
00:52:16,178 --> 00:52:19,598
What brings you here out of the blue?

607
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:25,608
You know I'm the one
who let you join the KPEDA, right?

608
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:30,988
We're friends.
Let's not cross each other's territory.

609
00:52:33,408 --> 00:52:38,618
Of course not. Baek Edu isn't a hawk.
Please don't misunderstand.

610
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:45,418
Is there anything else going on?

611
00:52:46,498 --> 00:52:47,338
Pardon?

612
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,588
You dated Noh Gojin, didn't you?

613
00:52:55,928 --> 00:52:57,008
I know all about it.

614
00:52:57,098 --> 00:53:00,968
Chairman Baek told me
to kick out Noh Gojin.

615
00:53:02,428 --> 00:53:06,058
So what is it that you want to say?

616
00:53:06,148 --> 00:53:11,398
I want to help you attack Gotop.

617
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:15,738
With that, do you want me
to tell you a top secret?

618
00:53:27,248 --> 00:53:30,958
Noh Gojin has amnesia.

619
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,008
Unbelievable, isn't it?

620
00:53:34,548 --> 00:53:37,218
Do you know what's even more unbelievable?

621
00:53:37,928 --> 00:53:39,298
He said he memorized everything.

622
00:53:39,388 --> 00:53:40,888
Memorize what?

623
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:44,888
I ran into him
at Think Academy Mr. Jang's funeral.

624
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:47,808
When I told him
that I know about his amnesia,

625
00:53:47,898 --> 00:53:50,068
he talked about all our encounters

626
00:53:50,148 --> 00:53:53,148
from the day we met
without budging at all.

627
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:55,318
He said he memorized everything.

628
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,778
He's really crazy.
How did he memorize all that?

629
00:54:00,618 --> 00:54:04,448
Things that only he and I know about
starting 14 years ago.

630
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,618
Did he write it down in his journal?

631
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,328
I'm getting goosebumps.

632
00:54:09,128 --> 00:54:13,298
He really is a monster.

633
00:54:16,168 --> 00:54:17,588
He memorized everything?

634
00:54:33,068 --> 00:54:34,648
He looks familiar.

635
00:54:35,148 --> 00:54:36,568
Where have I seen him?

636
00:54:37,448 --> 00:54:39,528
Hey, have you seen him before?

637
00:54:40,158 --> 00:54:41,908
-Who?
-That guy…

638
00:54:48,748 --> 00:54:51,128
GOTOP EDUCATION DEPUTY CEO OH SEGI

639
00:54:55,628 --> 00:54:56,878
Did you get your revenge?

640
00:54:57,378 --> 00:55:00,048
Mr. Noh Manners, that punk.

641
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:02,468
His face turned pale.

642
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:06,018
Besides, he really lost his mind.

643
00:55:07,058 --> 00:55:08,558
He lost all his memories.

644
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:14,188
But why did you tell me
such a crucial secret?

645
00:55:14,268 --> 00:55:15,778
What if I reveal it?

646
00:55:15,858 --> 00:55:18,818
You'll become a laughingstock
and your reputation will be ruined.

647
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:23,408
-What?
-Because Mr. Noh's acting will be perfect.

648
00:55:25,988 --> 00:55:27,828
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

649
00:55:28,198 --> 00:55:31,078
What are you talking about?
Absolutely not!

650
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:32,288
Absolutely not.

651
00:55:33,168 --> 00:55:34,168
I'm relieved.

652
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:39,508
Then let me tell you now
what you need to do for me.

653
00:55:39,588 --> 00:55:40,678
What is it?

654
00:55:45,598 --> 00:55:46,508
Hello,

655
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:48,478
shareholder.

656
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,768
What do you mean shareholder?

657
00:55:52,848 --> 00:55:57,278
I already know
that you own 3% of Gotop shares.

658
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:00,068
What are you talking about?
I don't have any.

659
00:56:00,448 --> 00:56:02,158
I don't buy shares of competitors.

660
00:56:02,238 --> 00:56:06,238
I see. Is that why you bought them
under someone else's name share by share?

661
00:56:06,618 --> 00:56:09,038
Park Yiji. You bought them
under your daughter's name.

662
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:14,828
Gotop Education will hold
an extraordinary general meeting soon.

663
00:56:14,918 --> 00:56:18,708
Other shareholders also agreed
to be on my side.

664
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:21,378
If you also agree,

665
00:56:21,468 --> 00:56:25,888
Noh Gojin's fall
from 12 years ago will replay.

666
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,598
Because the majority will be
agreeing to dismiss the CEO.

667
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:34,228
Isn't that what you want too, Mr. Park?

668
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:35,808
Dismiss him?

669
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:44,448
The head of Gotop will change.

670
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,168
He's really crazy.
How did he memorize all that?

671
00:57:02,008 --> 00:57:06,178
Things that only he and I know about
starting 14 years ago.

672
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:08,468
Did he write it down in his journal?

673
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,858
Should I keep your dinner meeting?

674
00:57:21,568 --> 00:57:24,358
What should I do
when I'm suspicious of something?

675
00:57:24,448 --> 00:57:25,568
Pardon?

676
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:29,868
In such situations,

677
00:57:31,328 --> 00:57:32,538
you generally throw bait.

678
00:57:35,158 --> 00:57:36,168
Bait?

679
00:57:39,878 --> 00:57:41,208
Please cancel my meeting.

680
00:57:55,808 --> 00:57:57,018
I'll get this one.

681
00:57:58,518 --> 00:58:00,358
I said, buy the best one.

682
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,438
-I'll pay for it.
-No!

683
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:06,148
One moment. Please use this one.
I'll pay over six months.

684
00:58:07,158 --> 00:58:09,568
-Why?
-I said I want to do it on my own.

685
00:58:11,618 --> 00:58:13,158
-Please come this way.
-Okay.

686
00:58:14,038 --> 00:58:15,038
But…

687
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,418
Darling, I want this one.

688
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:21,588
-This one?
-Yes.

689
00:58:21,668 --> 00:58:23,458
It totally suits you.

690
00:58:23,548 --> 00:58:25,548
Thank you, honey. Can you buy it for me?

691
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:27,628
It's perfect for you, honey.
I'll have to buy it.

692
00:58:27,718 --> 00:58:31,098
Thank you so much, darling.
My goodness. It's so pretty.

693
00:58:32,808 --> 00:58:36,518
Don't be too disappointed
that you didn't get to audition.

694
00:58:37,228 --> 00:58:38,848
The second round is coming up soon.

695
00:58:39,398 --> 00:58:40,398
Okay, Mr. Noh.

696
00:58:43,068 --> 00:58:44,148
By the way,

697
00:58:45,228 --> 00:58:48,028
are you going to
keep calling me "Mr. Noh"?

698
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:51,368
But that's your name.
What else should I call you?

699
00:58:52,118 --> 00:58:56,198
Well, there are other good options.
For example…

700
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:58,998
"darling."

701
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:01,418
Gosh, that's so cheesy.

702
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:07,838
Then, how about "honey"?

703
00:59:07,918 --> 00:59:09,928
Jeez, that's nonsense.

704
00:59:10,508 --> 00:59:12,048
Why would that be nonsense?

705
00:59:20,058 --> 00:59:21,898
Drive home safely.

706
00:59:40,248 --> 00:59:41,828
She makes me speechless.

707
00:59:51,718 --> 00:59:52,718
Hello?

708
00:59:57,848 --> 00:59:59,018
Where?

709
01:00:17,578 --> 01:00:18,828
It's Noh Gojin.

710
01:00:27,588 --> 01:00:29,958
Oh. It's raining.

711
01:00:38,058 --> 01:00:40,218
It rained like this that day too.

712
01:00:43,138 --> 01:00:44,518
The day we broke up.

713
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:53,738
You remember it, don't you?

714
01:00:58,948 --> 01:01:01,908
You've taken up acting, Ms. Baek?

715
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:04,918
I'm not as good as you.

716
01:01:06,918 --> 01:01:10,628
You've been deceiving me
quite well all this time.

717
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:16,048
I already know, Noh Gojin.

718
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,508
You don't have amnesia.

719
01:02:04,308 --> 01:02:06,308
