1
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,970
CRAZY LOVE

2
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,950
CRAZY LOVE

3
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,290
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,290
EPISODE 9

5
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
Was it your first time?

6
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,080
Kissing someone.

7
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,790
No. I've done it before.

8
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,120
That's my point.

9
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,920
My point is that it was just a show
to play our own roles.

10
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,470
Simply put, show time.

11
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,970
Since I made you put on a show,
I should pay you for it.

12
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,100
I'm not without common sense.

13
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,270
I'll write off your debt.

14
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,980
How does 100 million won sound?

15
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,860
The most expensive three seconds
in the whole world.

16
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,280
-But--
-Of course, you would want my apology too.

17
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,410
According to the contract,

18
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,910
you agreed to faithfully play
the role of my fiancée,

19
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,580
and it happened to be a moment
I needed to show that you were my fiancée.

20
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,920
I had no intention of violating
your rights or insulting you in any way.

21
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,880
In the event you felt insulted
regardless of my intention,

22
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,390
I deeply apologize.

23
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,590
That's not how you apologize to someone.

24
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,560
This is how you do it.

25
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,680
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,310
It was my mistake.

27
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,820
Please say hello.

28
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,580
This is my fiancée Lee Sina.

29
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,350
You knew?

30
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,850
Why didn't you tell me…
about Mr. Noh's engagement?

31
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,650
I'm sorry. I was going to tell you
after you attend the KPEDA event.

32
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,820
Did you also know
that his fiancée was his secretary?

33
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,400
That I really had no idea.

34
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,370
Okay. You may go now.

35
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,700
I'll drive you home.

36
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,290
I want to stay here a little longer.

37
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,750
Okay, ma'am.

38
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Hello?

39
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,650
The police station?

40
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,860
Sir.

41
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,120
This is the chairman's message.

42
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,910
From my father?

43
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,580
Next time, it won't end
with just forgery charges.

44
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,210
He'll kill that punk.

45
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,960
He also wanted me to tell you
that your wedding date has been set.

46
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,550
Your fiancé will arrive in Korea tomorrow.

47
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,800
POLICE WHO UNDERSTAND CITIZENS

48
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,860
I didn't do it.

49
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,120
I never deceived anyone.

50
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,460
I never forged my academic records.

51
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,630
I know you didn't do it.

52
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,670
I believe you. But…

53
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,800
we can't be together anymore.

54
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,310
What do you mean?

55
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,770
I'm getting married.

56
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,850
I have a fiancé.

57
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,110
-What?
-It's time…

58
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,940
for us to wake up from this dream.

59
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,280
We shouldn't have dated from the start.

60
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,410
We can never be together.

61
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,490
If I stay with you,

62
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,120
your bad reputation will follow me
for the rest of my life too.

63
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,750
Noh Gojin, a fraud instructor
who forged his academic records.

64
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,630
I'm not a fraud!

65
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,880
Today is the last day…

66
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,510
I'll be standing in the rain with you.

67
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,230
No. I won't let you go.

68
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,860
Please don't do this, Sooyeong.

69
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,490
Let me go.

70
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,700
No, I can't.

71
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,530
I…

72
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,540
can't live without you.

73
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,870
That's not true.

74
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,540
You'll be fine without me.

75
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,010
You've always been alone.

76
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,220
Let's break up on a high note.

77
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,350
I went through so much to protect you.

78
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
It's okay.

79
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,270
You'll remember me in the end,

80
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,570
and we'll fall in love again.

81
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,460
That's right.

82
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,920
It was just a show.

83
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,970
It was all an act.

84
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,340
What else would it be?

85
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,190
But why did he have to bring up money
in that moment?

86
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,570
Why bring up the debt write-off?

87
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,990
What? The most expensive three seconds
in the whole world?

88
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,660
What does he take me for?

89
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,840
It's fine since I got to pay off
some of my debt.

90
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,220
He wrote off 100 million won for me.

91
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,100
But still. He needed to apologize first--

92
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,720
He did apologize.

93
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,560
He apologized very properly.

94
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,730
Then why am I so upset?

95
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,980
I'm sorry.

96
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,570
It was my mistake.

97
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,320
Mistake.

98
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,870
It was a mistake indeed.

99
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,550
I wonder if she's very upset.

100
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,390
Why did I have to mention
writing off her debt?

101
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,770
What's going on?

102
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,860
What's wrong with me?

103
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,210
What are you doing so early?

104
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,380
Gosh! Did you go
on a shopping spree again?

105
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,960
I need to return these.

106
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,460
What for?

107
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,670
I'm going to be late. I'll wash up first.

108
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,140
Return them?

109
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,220
That's nonsense.

110
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,390
I know you're going to donate them again.

111
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,610
I won't let that happen this time.

112
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,200
It's so pretty.

113
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,780
I'm going to wear them
for my audition tomorrow.

114
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,710
-Hello.
-Hello.

115
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,340
Why is he getting out of the car
by himself today?

116
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,570
Aren't you going in?

117
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,290
What… What are you doing there?

118
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,580
Sorry?

119
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,340
And why are you so late?

120
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,970
As a secretary, you have to come to work

121
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,380
right on time. Don't you know that?

122
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,010
At this rate,
when will you pay off all your debt?

123
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,810
If you had sent me a text letting me know
you were going ahead of me,

124
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,140
I wouldn't have gone
all the way to your house.

125
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,900
Then I would've gotten to work earlier.

126
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,980
Besides, I still have
20 more minutes until work begins.

127
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,900
There's no official work start time
for a secretary.

128
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,660
Why did I have to mention
her debt again? Why?

129
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,100
-What's that?
-It's the dress, shoes, and accessories

130
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,970
I wore to the KPEDA event.

131
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,140
What about them?

132
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,850
I'm returning them to you.

133
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,400
When did I say you need to return--

134
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,280
So are you asking me
to carry them home myself?

135
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,950
My goodness. I've never seen
a debtor putting a creditor to work.

136
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,210
I'll take them to your house.

137
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,830
Wait.

138
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,040
Take these too.

139
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,760
I'll read them at home.

140
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,560
What?

141
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,140
Do you have a complaint--

142
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,840
There was a strand of hair…

143
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,460
on your jacket.

144
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,840
Why did you close your eyes?

145
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,970
I just…

146
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,140
got something in my eye.

147
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,140
Okay, then.

148
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,730
How embarrassing.

149
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,410
Gojin.

150
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,370
I TRUSTED THE TOP INSTRUCTOR…
ILPUM EDU, ERRORS FOUND

151
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,630
ILPUM EDU MATH STUDY GUIDE CONTROVERSY,
ILPUM EDU STUDY GUIDE WITH ERRORS

152
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,760
Right, I heard something about…

153
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,470
a spy.

154
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,010
-Spy?
-Spy?

155
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,890
I heard that
Mr. Park planted a spy at Gotop.

156
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,720
And that spy stole Mr. Noh's study guides.

157
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,520
No way. I doubt that.

158
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,230
Right, that's too absurd.

159
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,020
We'll see if it's really absurd or not.

160
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,980
It'll soon be found out
once they investigate it.

161
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,150
Mr. Noh isn't the type
to just take it lying down.

162
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,610
He'll discipline his research team first.

163
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,240
Oh, no. Are you not feeling well?

164
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,500
You look pale as a ghost.

165
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,710
No, I'm fine.

166
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,500
Someone might misunderstand
if they see you like that.

167
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,340
Don't you agree?

168
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,590
What nonsense are you talking about?

169
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,970
What… misunderstanding?

170
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,640
How could you do this to me?

171
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,980
Ms. Ma!

172
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,980
Misunderstanding, my foot.

173
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,730
I meant someone might
misunderstand her to be sick.

174
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,690
Why did she get so upset?

175
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,030
Gosh, watch what you say.

176
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,160
It's not nice to tell someone
they look sick when they look pale.

177
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,250
You crossed the line, Ms. Michelle.

178
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,670
What? Gosh.

179
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,710
Oh, right.

180
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,840
Ms. Michelle, you graduated
from Virginia State University, right?

181
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,260
Well… Yes…

182
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,710
Why do you ask?

183
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,800
My nephew is applying there.

184
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,180
Oh, I see. Is he?

185
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,470
If I have any questions,
I'll just ask you directly.

186
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,350
I have relatives living in Virginia.
Just ask me.

187
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,980
Why don't you take care of
your skin problem? It looks terrible.

188
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,860
You even have age spots.

189
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,000
I saw you.

190
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,920
What?

191
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,580
I thought hundreds,
no, thousands of times over again

192
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,300
to confirm who I saw was really you, Segi.

193
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,800
I'd rather have real amnesia

194
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,180
because this is such a horrible nightmare.

195
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,220
Why'd you do it?

196
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,520
Seriously, why?

197
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,610
You saw me?

198
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,240
I saw you on your way to work.

199
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,830
Let's have some tea.

200
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,870
What's going on?

201
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Well.

202
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,250
You saw the articles on Ilpum Edu, right?

203
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,930
I was wondering if you knew
anything about that incident.

204
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,640
It's certain that the study guides
you put together were leaked.

205
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,100
But how could there be so many errors?

206
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,270
How would I know?

207
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,350
I have amnesia.

208
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,860
Right.

209
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,110
By the way, you said last time

210
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,950
that it's going to be very interesting.

211
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,530
So you really wanted to attend
the KPEDA event.

212
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,620
Oddly, what you said
kept ringing in my head.

213
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,380
I felt as if you already knew

214
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,050
what was going to happen there.

215
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
How could that be?

216
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,650
Take care.

217
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,770
Have a good day.

I brought everything I have.

You have to look after me now, sir.

223
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,610
Have some coffee.

Okay, now to find the relative maximum

00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,570
I'll draw a graph of the f prime of x.

Are you ready?

230
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,250
I'll check it now.

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,850
I knew we could do it!

238
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,940
Was it all a lie from the start?

239
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,490
Why?

240
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,610
Seriously, why?

241
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,010
Mr. Noh.

242
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,350
Sir, are you okay?

243
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,190
Just ten seconds.

244
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,610
No.

245
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,990

GOTOP EDUCATION
DIRECTOR MA EUNJUNG

247
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,190
Ms. Ma, are you going somewhere?

248
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,570
I'm not feeling well,
so I'm going home early.

249
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,950
Ms. Ma.

250
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,820
Do you have a minute?

251
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
I understand you, Ms. Ma.

252
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,000
I know you used to be
a very promising instructor.

253
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,930
If you hadn't quit after getting married,

254
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,640
you would've become
an amazing top instructor by now.

255
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,520
But after getting married,
because of the career gap,

256
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,230
you had to come back here

257
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,190
as a teaching assistant,
not an instructor.

258
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,650
I can fully understand…
how sad you must've been.

259
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,740
On top of it, as a mother,

260
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,870
you had to take on your ex-husband's debt

261
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,410
to maintain custody of your son.

262
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,670
I don't believe anyone has the right
to criticize you for this incident.

263
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,000
They don't understand even 10%…

264
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,590
No, not even 0.01% of the pain
you've endured.

265
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,440
I didn't mean to do it.

266
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,740
I was harassed by creditors every day,
but I didn't have any money.

267
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,080
I really needed to do something.

268
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,540
Just at that moment, Mr. Park…

269
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,260
promised me an instructor position
at Ilpum Edu…

270
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,470
I would've done the same too.

271
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,800
But, Mr. Noh

272
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,140
won't ever forgive you.

273
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Ms. Ma.

274
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,200
If you help me,

275
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,070
I'll help you too.

276
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,910

CAN'T EVEN MAKE A PROPER STUDY GUIDE

279
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,630
I think we need to…

280
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,170
refund all our study guides.

281
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,550
Refund? All of them?

282
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,680
Yes.

283
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,600
Ms. Ma.

284
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,810
Ms. Ma, that idiot!

285
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,730
Where is Ms. Ma?

286
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,980
Tell her to come here now. At once!

287
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,480
Sir.

288
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,690
What? You really showed up…

289
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,780
Well…

290
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,200
I…

291
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,790
What?

292
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,840
Speak of the devil.

293
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,260
What now?

294
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,550
How will you pay for all this damage?

295
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,560
Say something. Say it!

296
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,690
Ma Eunjung. How dare you!

297
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,860
Hello, Mr. Park.

298
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,650
I'm Oh Segi,
the deputy CEO of Gotop Education.

299
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,780
Ms. Ma, you may go now.

300
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,780
I'll talk to him on your behalf.

301
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Sir,

302
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,000
I did my best.

303
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,830
Don't go! Ms. Ma! Darn it.

304
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,170
Can you give us a minute?

305
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,300
Well…

306
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,720
Okay.

307
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,930
You have a nice office.

308
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,230
Ms. Ma told me everything.

309
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,350
No, I don't know anything.

310
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,020
Do you have evidence?
Do you have evidence that I took them?

311
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,650
You always find evidence
if you investigate.

312
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,200
Don't get cute with me.

313
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,780
Hey, you stay out of this.

314
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,330
Tell that janitor thug Noh Gojin
to come here.

315
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,620
If I stay out of this,
it won't do you any good, Mr. Park.

316
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,960
You know Mr. Noh's temper.

317
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,250
It's going to be a litigation battle.

318
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,380
Will you be able to handle it?

319
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,300
We already secured

320
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,180
Ms. Ma's confession.

321
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,150
But if you and I

322
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,150
become good friends,

323
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,150
such an unfortunate situation
won't happen.

324
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,240
Your sandwiches are ready.

325
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,280
Thank you.

326
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,030
Have a good day!

327
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,670
Something seems different about her.

328
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,840
Right?

329
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,090
She used to have no presence
like dust in the wind,

330
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,800
but now she has an air about her.
Like she carries a certain ambience.

331
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,100
She gives off the vibe
of a rich Cheongdam-dong housewife.

332
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,350
She seems so elegant.

333
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,650
Isn't that heavy?
Do you want me to help you carry it?

334
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,450
Ms. Sooyeong!

335
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,660
We were both very surprised that day,
weren't we?

336
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,910
Yes.

337
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,670
I didn't know you were Mr. Noh's fiancée.

338
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,210
Oh, I'm sorry.

339
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,800
No need to apologize.

340
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,430
I didn't tell you
that I was the CEO of Baek Edu either.

341
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,510
Thank you for your understanding.

342
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,720
What do you

343
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,020
like about this girl?

344
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,400
Is something wrong?

345
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,610
I met my first love.

346
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,610
First love?

347
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,160
The one who got you
the dress that you lent me?

348
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,370
Yes.

349
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,410
I waited for 12 years to see him.

350
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,960
For 12 years?

351
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,710
Wow, you're so amazing.

352
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,420
But…

353
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,220
he has a fiancée.

354
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,890
He must've been so lonely alone.

355
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:30,060
But I was so heartbroken

356
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,520
actually seeing another woman with him.

357
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,480
On top of that,

358
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,230
it turns out that I know the woman.

359
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,190
Seriously?

360
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,990
What would you do if you were me?

361
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,070
Of course, you shouldn't give up.

362
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,700
You could die tomorrow.

363
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,370
"I could die tomorrow."

364
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,750
Good advice.

365
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:04,010
You're right. I won't give up on him
no matter what now.

366
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,760
He's the only one who can make me happy.

367
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,310
Okay. I'll root for you too.
You can do it.

368
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,800
Please take your medicine.

369
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:54,220
How do you plan on
getting your money back if you're sick?

370
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,690
TOP PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR

371
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,610
Here you go.

372
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,700
No, not yet.

373
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,290
I guess you don't trust me.

374
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,830
You're Mr. Noh Manners' underling.
How could I trust you?

375
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,790
But the underling is
usually the one who cooperates.

376
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,560
What's this?

377
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,310
M&A CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS

378
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,070
Mr. Jang of Think Academy is
in critical condition.

379
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:34,490
These are the M&A terms and conditions
that Mr. Noh worked hard on for six months

380
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,120
to acquire Think Academy
after Mr. Jang fell ill.

381
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,460
If you have a look, Ilpum Edu

382
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,000
might be able to take over Think Academy.

383
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,250
So,

384
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,760
what do you want from me?

385
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,610
Where should I put this?

386
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,950
Well, just put it anywhere over there.

387
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,700
I'll go home now.

388
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,080
I cooked side dishes
and put them in the refrigerator, so--

389
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,830
I don't eat day-old side dishes.

390
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,630
Make fresh ones again.

391
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,200
Then I'll go home now.

392
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,820
Wait.

393
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,740
Who will do the dishes then?

394
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,120
Should I do them?

395
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,210
Of course, I should.

396
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,220
Then I'll go home now.

397
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,470
You're going home already?

398
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,760
Sorry?

399
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,600
But…

400
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:07,690
the living room is so dirty right now.
How can you leave?

401
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,520
Please clean it now.

402
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,860
Right now?

403
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,610
Yes. Right now. At once. Immediately.

404
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,280
All done.

405
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,700
What about the dressing room?

406
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,240
I can't sleep
if the dressing room is dirty.

407
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,660
Okay, sir.

408
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,830
I'm all done now.

409
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,040
The study is dirty too.

410
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,550
I can't sleep if the study is dirty.

411
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,380
I cleaned the study,

412
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,430
the bedroom, and the bathroom too.

413
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,470
And it's past 11 p.m. now.

414
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,720
Where did the time go?

415
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,980
With that kind of mindset,
when will you pay me all back?

416
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,610
And from now on, you won't
be able to go home until midnight,

417
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,240
so come prepared.

418
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,670
That darn money!

419
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,000
The only thing he cares about is money.

420
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,060
Where are you going?

421
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,980
To buy cola.

422
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,100
Cola?

423
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,230
But you don't like cola.

424
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,230
I can't drink it if I don't like it?

425
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,860
Well? Aren't you going home?

426
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,820
Yes… I'm going now.

427
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,850
Aren't you going to go buy cola?

428
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,530
Goodnight.

429
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,250
Why isn't he going?

430
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,540
His focus…

431
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,550
Once he's fixed on something,
he wouldn't notice the end of the world.

432
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,580
Was my house always this big?

433
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,700
Drink this.

434
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,000
Thank you.

435
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,210
Actually, I was waiting for you.

436
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,380
If you had something to say,
you could've called.

437
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,300
My fiancée might feel uncomfortable,

438
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,640
so I don't like to meet
with other women outside.

439
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,600
I guess Ms. Sina is the jealous type.

440
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,730
I'm friends with her.

441
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,900
So, to be honest,
I was very surprised that day

442
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,780
to find out Ms. Sina was your fiancée.

443
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,660
I met her for the first time in Gangneung.

444
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,540
I even lent her the dress
that my first love got for me.

445
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,460
What a small world, right?

446
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,390
By the way, how about dinner
all together this weekend?

447
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,430
I want to congratulate you guys
on your engagement.

448
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,220
The day is also my birthday.

449
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,350
It's your birthday?

450
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,230
Yes.

451
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,230
Since it's my birthday,
you wouldn't turn it down, right?

452
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,990
Fine. I'll come with my fiancée.

453
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,570
I'll treat you to somewhere nice.

454
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,290
It's 75 degrees Celsius.

455
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,450
I confirmed it.

456
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,460
Ms. Lee Sina.

457
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,380
Please make yourself available
for dinner this weekend.

458
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,840
Pardon?

459
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,760
Let's have dinner together.

460
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,760
-Me?
-Yes.

461
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,340
Why?

462
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,930
Ms. Baek Sooyeong invited us.

463
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,850
Oh, I see.

464
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,600
What?

465
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,640
Wait, that means
you want me to pretend to be

466
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,440
your fiancée
in front of Ms. Sooyeong again?

467
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,060
What? You don't want to?

468
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,940
-Of course, I don't.
-Why not?

469
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,070
Why don't you want to pretend
to be the fiancée of a man

470
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,070
so great like me
who is handsome, smart, and rich?

471
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,990
What a narcissist. Seriously.

472
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,750
I'm sorry, but I won't be going.

473
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,410
I'll let Ms. Baek know.

474
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,500
"Article Two of the contract.

475
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,170
The debtor will become
a hostage of the creditor

476
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:11,300
and offset
the financial liabilities with labor.

477
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,590
First,

478
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,050
the debtor will faithfully act
and fulfill the role of a fiancée

479
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,220
even better than a real fiancée would."

480
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,930
Did you forget already?

481
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,940
With that kind of mindset,
when will you pay me all back?

482
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,620
By the way, we're the only ones here.

483
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,200
I rented the place for you two.

484
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,370
The entire place?

485
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,040
Yes.

486
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:49,630
Is this your first time here?

487
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,710
Yes.

488
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,260
Yes, it's my first time.

489
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,520
This is on another level
since you're rich.

490
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,980
I feel so uncomfortable
that I might get indigestion.

491
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,070
I didn't do this because I'm rich.

492
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,530
I wanted to do it for you.

493
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:27,290
I pre-ordered the most famous dish
from this restaurant.

494
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,420
Please enjoy.

495
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,840
It looks so delicious.
Thank you for the food.

496
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,760
I asked them to remove the onions…

497
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:44,850
Why?

498
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,440
Don't you hate onions?

499
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:53,400
Oh, right.
I heard that I used to be like that.

500
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:56,150
But I enjoy them now.

501
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,320
My honey told me that
if I keep eating things I didn't like,

502
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,540
perhaps I'll learn to like them.

503
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:10,630
Open your mouth.

504
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,210
Honey, open your mouth.

505
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,200
Happy birthday.

506
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,490
Thank you.

507
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,070
Happy birthday.

508
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:46,870
But you don't seem like someone
who was born in spring.

509
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:51,670
I don't?

510
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:58,880
I'm so curious how you met.

511
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,510
Ms. Sina, what made you fall for Mr. Noh?

512
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,260
Pardon?

513
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,680
Well…

514
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,860
What made me fall for him?

515
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,110
It's his personality.

516
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,530
He really had no manners--

517
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,250
He's so great and kind, you know?

518
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,550
What about you, Mr. Noh?

519
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,510
What made you fall for Ms. Sina?

520
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,720
Although I can't really remember,

521
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:44,800
perhaps it's her beauty.

522
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,270
I've never seen someone
so pretty in my whole life.

523
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:54,650
The moment I saw her in the hospital room,
I thought my heart was going to explode.

524
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:02,820
But…

525
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,530
what made me really fall for her

526
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,790
was the fact that she stayed by my side.

527
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:21,670
I had always been all alone,

528
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,010
but she never left my side.

529
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,690
She didn't abandon me.

530
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,780
Can we have more coffee, please?

531
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:02,920
Pardon me.

532
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,440
-Ow, that's hot!
-I'm sorry, ma'am. Are you okay?

533
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:16,900
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

534
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,400
What are you doing?
You need to be careful!

535
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,480
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, ma'am.

536
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,070
I'm all right.

537
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,780
Did you get burned? Are you all right?

538
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,990
I'm all right.
I'm going to use the restroom.

539
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:33,000
I'm so very sorry.

540
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,020
Why did he get so upset?

541
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,600
People might think I'm really his fiancée…

542
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:02,690
I had always been all alone,

543
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,690
but she never left my side.

544
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,860
He must've been lonely.

545
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,870
We've come here together before.

546
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,380
We sat at this table too then.

547
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,840
Is that so?

548
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,760
I don't recall at all.

549
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,300
When your memories do come back,

550
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,760
what would you do?

551
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,890
What if…

552
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,890
you loved someone else?

553
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,900
Even if

554
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,190
I loved someone else who I don't remember,

555
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:45,690
it would be like the wind.

556
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,860
A wind that blew away without a trace.

557
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:53,280
Even the wind might have its own reason.

558
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:55,290
An unavoidable reason--

559
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:56,700
An excuse, I suppose

560
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,660
or an obsession.

561
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,180
What's taking her so long?

562
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,350
I wish my hand got burnt instead.

563
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,730
Since you can't see my heart.

564
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:31,030
Can't you see…

565
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:33,660
my heart that's been burned?

566
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,630
Please try to remember.

567
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,440
What's this?

568
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,940
For the cost of the handkerchief.

569
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:09,670
It's pretty.

570
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,730
These look pretty.

571
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,810
-Do they? Let's see.
-Yes.

572
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:17,320
Happy birthday to you

573
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:21,200
Happy birthday to you

574
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:26,250
Happy birthday, my dear Sooyeong

575
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,830
Happy birthday to you

576
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,070
What is it?

577
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,040
I'm about to go home.

578
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,920
But this box has been
just sitting there for a few days,

579
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,790
so I'll put it in the storage cabinet
before I head out.

580
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,300
It's okay.

581
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,430
I'll put it away before I go.

582
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:22,390
-Just leave it.
-I'll put it away.

583
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,600
I said, just leave it!

584
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:30,940
I'm sorry.

585
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,320
What happened to the earrings?

586
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,410
Deceiving me wasn't enough

587
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:46,620
that now you even steal from me?

588
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:02,380
-What are you doing?
-Apologize.

589
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:04,470
-Let go now.
-Apologize!

590
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,720
-I said, let go!
-I said, apologize!

591
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,850
Apologize!

592
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:12,560
Apologize! I said, apologize!

593
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,190
Apologize to me now! Do it!

594
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,530
-Hey!
-Are you really out of your mind?

595
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:29,580
Are you completely out of your mind?

596
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:35,960
You're dead meat now.

597
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,390
Hey! Stop!

598
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,400
Hey!

599
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,520
Where do you think you're going?

600
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,490
-Hey!
-"Hey"?

601
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:46,150
I'm not going to put up
with a scumbag like you anymore.

602
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,530
What?

603
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:50,330
I'm no longer your secretary or a hostage.

604
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,910
I'm… me!

605
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,660
You make no sense…

606
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,160
So what?

607
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,750
I'll repay you for the damages.

608
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:00,540
I don't have money right now,
but I'll pay you back before I die, okay?

609
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:02,250
If you don't like it,

610
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,760
report me to the police,
sue me, or send me to prison!

611
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,920
Do as you wish.

612
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,010
I guess I've been too easy on you lately.

613
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,930
Do you have a death wish?

614
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,230
I already experienced
what it means to die, you jerk!

615
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:20,980
Live until you're old and gray?

616
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,110
That's a delusion.

617
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:27,070
You might die tomorrow. That's life.

618
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:30,200
I'll never live like this again.

619
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,200
I'll never live like a fool again!

620
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:34,700
You never know when you might die.

621
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,750
I'm going to live my life
happily without regrets.

622
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:46,590
Your nose is bleeding.

623
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,600
Darn it.

624
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:57,480
Hey! I guess you must be
out of your mind right now,

625
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,730
so you don't realize what you've done!

626
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,310
You made a mistake.

627
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,270
It's over now!

628
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,350
Look at this.

629
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,140
She didn't come to work?

630
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,190
Yes?

631
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,160
Mr. Noh?

632
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:57,080
You need to leave by half past
for the advertising shoot.

633
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,500
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

634
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,650
-Hello?
-Ms. Lee.

635
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,910
You're coming to the studio today, right?

636
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:37,200
After Mr. Noh's advertisement shoot,

637
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,660
we want to quickly shoot
the mock exam review video.

638
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,910
I'm sorry to ask, but could you please
bring the mock exam monitoring files?

639
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,040
I'm not going--

640
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:51,090
Yes, ma'am.

641
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:55,890
Ms. Ma.

642
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:58,850
Isn't the lighting not enough?

643
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:01,890
If you look from here,
I think they'll turn that lighting--

644
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,440
Forget it.

645
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,360
-Director.
-Yes?

646
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:11,780
That lighting isn't enough.
Let's add some more.

647
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:14,110
-Really?
-Yes.

648
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,740
-And that lighting…
-Yes.

649
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,240
It's too dim. Mr. Noh likes it bright.

650
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:20,830
He likes it very bright?

651
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:23,040
Yes. Just turn them all on, please.

652
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,540
-All of them.
-All of them?

653
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,170
-These too, then.
-Yes. He likes attention. It's a must.

654
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,630
-Understood.
-Great.

655
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,920
That's already set up.
Please don't touch it.

656
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,730
Mr. Noh.

657
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,440
-Hello, sir!
-Hello.

658
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:01,790
Make sure to put up the slides properly.
I'll do it like a real lecture.

659
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:04,040
Don't make dumb mistakes

660
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,120
and waste my precious time,
not even a minute.

661
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,130
Yes, sir.

662
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,500
We'll start filming him
giving a lecture in ten minutes.

663
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:26,850
-Hello.
-Hello. Thank you.

664
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,400
Is this all the materials?

665
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:32,650
Okay, got it.

666
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,360
Mr. Noh, please come up to the stage.

667
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:41,660
Can we have this cleaned up, please?

668
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:46,200
-And also turn on this screen?
-Yes, thank you.

669
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:49,750
-Okay. Good.
-Please turn the lights that way.

670
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:51,920
Yes, over there.

671
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,340
Hello. I'm Noh Gojin.

672
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,850
This year…

673
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,070
What the… My goodness.

674
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,200
Oh, no. What happened?

675
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:25,910
Sir.

676
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:28,790
Sir, are you okay?

677
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,920
Are you hurt?

678
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:32,630
Are you?

679
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,920
Are you okay?

680
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:51,350
Sir.

681
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,320
Are you hurt?

682
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:13,750
You're the one who got hurt.

683
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:22,510
But why am I… the one that's hurting?

684
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:27,140
What's…

685
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:30,140
with you?

686
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,760
