00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:10,928
CRAZY LOVE

2
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:32,908
CRAZY LOVE

THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

EPISODE 11

5
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,228
I saw our instructors teach today.

6
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,188
I was envious but also excited.

7
00:00:57,768 --> 00:01:00,818
How can they make their lectures
so fun and easy to understand?

8
00:01:01,318 --> 00:01:04,278
I'll be able to become like them someday.

9
00:01:05,068 --> 00:01:08,318
Lee Sina, let's not give up until then.

10
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:12,118
Let's endure it!

11
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,408
"Good things come to those who wait."

12
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:18,498
No matter how terrible Mr. Noh Manners is,
let's endure it.

13
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,708
Just endure it for a year
and I get a chance to audition.

14
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:22,128
Lee Sina, you can do it!

15
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:37,268
What does this mean?

16
00:01:50,948 --> 00:01:51,948
I…

17
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,448
have glioblastoma.

18
00:01:58,958 --> 00:01:59,998
I have…

19
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:02,088
cancer.

20
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:05,378
I'm…

21
00:02:06,758 --> 00:02:08,168
going to die.

22
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:30,278
Pretend to be his fiancée?

23
00:02:30,448 --> 00:02:31,988
Who cares? I'm going to die anyway.

24
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,868
I have nothing to lose!

25
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:35,158
I'm going to…

26
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:37,578
disappear…

27
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:39,868
from this world anyway.

28
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:44,338
I made him eat onions,

29
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:46,128
scratched his car,

30
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,548
punched holes in his clothes,

31
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:50,878
and cut his plants too.

32
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,838
But…

33
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,558
why do I

34
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:57,808
feel so sad?

35
00:03:03,188 --> 00:03:06,068
He… laughed.

36
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,228
Like me.

37
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,858
He cried.

38
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:14,988
Like me.

39
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:18,158
Like me.

40
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,498
Like me…

41
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,618
Now I know

42
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,788
that I'm not dying…

43
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:30,338
because of him.

44
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:43,688
Sooho,

45
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:49,108
please handle my insurance
and savings account for me.

46
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,988
Please take good care of Dad.

47
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:55,618
Open the gate!

48
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,118
I don't blame anyone anymore.

49
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:04,168
So,

50
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:06,328
please don't be too sad.

51
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:09,708
I'm sorry…

52
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:13,838
for leaving you behind.

53
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:37,198
I made you become ill.

54
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:39,988
Even though you were so ill,

55
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:43,538
you stayed by my side?

56
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,358
GOTOP EDUCATION CEO

57
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:38,838
Why are you doing this?

58
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:42,718
Let's…

59
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:45,768
date.

60
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:02,028
Are you making jokes right now?

61
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,408
Do you think I'm a pushover?

62
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,118
You fired me. How could you…

63
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,498
Do you even know how much distress
you caused me the whole week?

64
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:12,788
You're always like this.

65
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:16,008
You don't care
how others feel and hurt them!

66
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:18,338
Why are you doing this to me?

67
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,798
Look who's talking.

68
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,968
Why are you doing this to me then?

69
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,348
What did I do?

70
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:28,518
Oh, the money?
Are you doing this because of your money?

71
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,018
I said, I'll pay you back.

72
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:34,608
I'll pay you back
even if I have to sell my organs!

73
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:37,738
Is that so? Then,

74
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:40,028
I'll buy your heart.

75
00:06:46,618 --> 00:06:47,618
Date me.

76
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:52,418
Do it with me.

77
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:54,418
Dating.

78
00:07:44,388 --> 00:07:47,638
Hey, you startled me.

79
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,928
What are you doing there so early?

80
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:55,148
A friend of mine…

81
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,228
came to visit Seoul,

82
00:07:58,318 --> 00:07:59,858
so I spent the night at a sauna.

83
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:03,648
I'm going to my room.

84
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:05,108
Okhee.

85
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:06,158
Yes?

86
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:10,998
What does it mean
when a guy wants to date you?

87
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:14,748
What do you mean?
It simply means he wants to date you.

88
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,878
Why? Did Mr. Noh Manners ask you out?

89
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,338
No!

90
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:26,678
You startled me. Okay, he didn't ask you.
Why are you getting angry?

91
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:30,768
By the way, how long
will you pretend to be his fiancée?

92
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,678
I even saw an article
talking about Mr. Noh Manners' engagement.

93
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:35,018
It might be getting out of hand.

94
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:38,808
What if Mr. Noh Manners' memories
do come back suddenly?

95
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:41,568
I know.

96
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:52,328
Now that I think about it,
someone who looks like him was out front.

97
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,998
-What did you say?
-What?

98
00:09:19,438 --> 00:09:20,858
Why would he come here?

99
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:23,858
I'm overreacting.

100
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,608
How did you know I was here?

101
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:35,078
What… are you doing here?

102
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,458
What else? To go to work together.

103
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:42,288
You're no longer fired,
so please get back to work starting today.

104
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:46,218
Is that

105
00:09:47,298 --> 00:09:48,298
what you'll wear to work?

106
00:09:57,438 --> 00:10:00,058
I'm not going to work.
You can't just tell me what--

107
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:02,438
You're not someone who I can order around.

108
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:05,318
I know that I hurt you.

109
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:14,328
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

110
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,788
I won't ever do it again.

111
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,788
Why are you acting like this
all of a sudden?

112
00:10:23,668 --> 00:10:26,128
You said,
I should say sorry when I'm sorry.

113
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:36,178
Why is he smiling so beautifully?

114
00:10:41,228 --> 00:10:43,728
No, don't get soft on him!

115
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,158
No. I won't be going to work.

116
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:20,518
I know how upset you are.

117
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,808
I apologize on his behalf.

118
00:11:23,688 --> 00:11:24,768
Please return to work.

119
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,778
What if you really get fired doing this--

120
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:30,358
Fired?

121
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:33,488
Is that what Mr. Noh told you?

122
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,528
That he'll fire us?

123
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:37,238
-He'll fire us? Us?
-Ms. Ma.

124
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:40,658
Oh my. I can't believe
he's treating us like this.

125
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:42,328
Please calm down.

126
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:43,618
I can't calm down.

127
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:46,838
Are we going to put up with this?

128
00:11:46,918 --> 00:11:50,588
We'll inform the Ministry of Employment
and Labor. We won't take it lying down.

129
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:54,548
We'll reveal to the world
how Gotop bullies its employees!

130
00:11:54,638 --> 00:11:56,388
-Let's go!
-Yeah!

131
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:58,178
I worked so hard for this company.

132
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:11,438
It's as I hoped for.

133
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:14,608
WE DID NOT DO ANYTHING WRONG

134
00:12:14,698 --> 00:12:18,988
Ms. Ma, should we continue to strike?

135
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:21,658
We have to until Mr. Noh apologizes.

136
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:23,998
What happened to your confidence
that you showed earlier?

137
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:25,958
Do you think Mr. Noh will apologize?

138
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,088
I don't think he will ever apologize--

139
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:32,008
Who's calling me?

140
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:45,638
You came alone, right?

141
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:47,188
Yes, sir.

142
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:50,608
So,

143
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:54,398
what are the conditions
that the teaching assistants want?

144
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:56,448
Well, it's…

145
00:12:57,908 --> 00:13:00,948
your apology, sir.

146
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:02,948
My apology, I see.

147
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,538
Fine.

148
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:10,248
Thanks to someone,
I'm very good at apologizing these days.

149
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,628
But under one condition.

150
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,378
If you can take care of that for me,

151
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:20,388
I'll apologize and
let the study guide incident slide too.

152
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:51,168
Let's… date.

153
00:13:52,338 --> 00:13:53,748
Do it with me.

154
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:55,508
Dating.

155
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:58,838
Let's date. Date me.

156
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:19,568
Korea's No. 1 online class,
Gotop Education.

157
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:22,318
Choose… now.

158
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,618
Gosh, the weather is so nice.

159
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:31,168
Are you just going to stay home?

160
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:33,088
Yes, I don't have to be anywhere.

161
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:34,168
How about eating out?

162
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:35,668
Should we?

163
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:38,298
My stomach hurts.

164
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:41,638
It's no fun eating out alone.
I'll just eat ramyeon later.

165
00:14:42,888 --> 00:14:44,508
Sooho is supposed to come here to eat.

166
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:46,018
Sooho?

167
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:49,978
I was concerned
if my dad was skipping his meals,

168
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:51,898
and it made me worry
about the village neighbors

169
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,648
as well as Sooho.

170
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:55,568
I'm sure he's eating fine at school.

171
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,148
Should we order food--

172
00:15:03,238 --> 00:15:04,408
Hello?

173
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:09,078
How may I help you, Mr. Lee?

174
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:13,498
Please help us.

175
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,918
Mr. Noh said he'll fire all of us.

176
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:18,668
Sorry?

177
00:15:19,258 --> 00:15:21,548
You're the only one
who can save us, Ms. Lee.

178
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:25,178
Please come to work
and ask Mr. Noh not to fire us.

179
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:29,268
What… What do you mean?

180
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:33,188
Mr. Noh said he wouldn't fire us
if you come to work, Ms. Lee.

181
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:35,688
Ms. Lee!

182
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,148
If I get fired from Gotop,
I won't be able to pay my mortgage.

183
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,988
Mr. Jang is a newly-wed

184
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,068
and Mr. Kim's mother is ill.

185
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:48,538
If we get fired,
we'll practically become homeless.

186
00:15:48,618 --> 00:15:51,458
Please come to work soon and save us!

187
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:57,248
Please get up and sit down first.

188
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:20,978
Ms. Lee Sina!

189
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:23,148
What brings you here?

190
00:16:23,738 --> 00:16:25,068
I thought you weren't coming.

191
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,118
You play dirty.

192
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,998
I'm not playing dirty.

193
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,498
I'm just smart.

194
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,918
You returned to work.

195
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:37,628
And so did all the assistants.

196
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:39,588
It's two birds with one stone.

197
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,878
Then, you're coming to work from now on?

198
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:49,048
I had no choice but to come this time
for the teaching assistants.

199
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:52,518
If you do something like this
on your own again,

200
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,558
I'll really quit then.

201
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:57,438
-Okay.
-And…

202
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,398
And?

203
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:04,188
It'll take some time,

204
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:07,698
but I'll make sure to pay you back
regardless of the contract validity.

205
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:10,078
Because it was my fault.

206
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:12,118
What else?

207
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:15,078
-Sorry?
-Let's date.

208
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:27,548
Mr. Noh apologized?

209
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:30,048
Yes.

210
00:17:30,138 --> 00:17:32,008
So did the teaching assistants all return?

211
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:33,428
Yes, right aw--

212
00:17:34,978 --> 00:17:37,268
We returned reluctantly.

213
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,188
We're still not satisfied.

214
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:41,898
Why did he apologize all of a sudden?

215
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:43,778
Mr. Lee said,

216
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:48,358
Mr. Noh asked him
what the teaching assistants wanted.

217
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:50,318
So Mr. Lee told him what we wanted,

218
00:17:50,408 --> 00:17:52,698
and Mr. Noh readily accepted it

219
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:55,288
and apologized to the teaching assistants.

220
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:06,918
I hoped that it'd draw more attention
for you and the teaching assistants.

221
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:10,008
In any case,
the study guide incident is wrapped up.

222
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:14,508
Thank you so much.

223
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:16,848
All thanks to you, Mr. Oh.

224
00:18:17,978 --> 00:18:21,978
Now it's your turn to help me, Ms. Ma.

225
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:23,818
Yes, sir.

226
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,488
Please let me know any time.

227
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:39,328
No. After Gojin got into the car accident,

228
00:18:39,408 --> 00:18:42,628
I found out for the first time
that Ms. Lee Sina was his fiancée.

229
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:47,258
What if Lee Sina is deceiving Gojin?

230
00:18:48,258 --> 00:18:50,008
What if she's pretending
to be his fiancée?

231
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:56,848
Did you call for me, ma'am?

232
00:18:57,848 --> 00:18:59,768
-Let me see it.
-Pardon?

233
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,558
Information on Lee Sina.

234
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:05,318
And find out more details

235
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,148
about her.

236
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:12,698
Let's…

237
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,368
date.

238
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:17,948
Let's…

239
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:20,788
date.

240
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:24,458
Do it with me. Dating.

241
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,498
Let's…

242
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:26,798
date.

243
00:19:26,878 --> 00:19:29,008
Let's… date.

244
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:30,838
Dating. Let's date.

245
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,138
Gosh, what's wrong with me?
Enough already!

246
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,848
The owner must be out making deliveries.

247
00:19:43,938 --> 00:19:45,018
Yes.

248
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,398
Thank you.

249
00:19:52,778 --> 00:19:55,698
Isn't that Ms. Lee?
I guess she's back to work.

250
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,868
Yes, but she's acting a little odd.

251
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,368
She was talking nonsense.

252
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:07,788
Perhaps she didn't hurt her leg,
but her head that time?

253
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:11,838
Stop thinking about him. My gosh!

254
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:16,178
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

255
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:31,568
I hope you'd only be distracted by me.

256
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:37,818
Let's go.

257
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,968
Teaching assistants, please get
your own snacks from now on.

258
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:02,928
It's not good for your health to keep
sitting down. To get some exercise,

259
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,888
go get them yourselves.

260
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:08,518
It hurts my woman's arms.

261
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,288
Looks tasty.

262
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:37,548
Fried food isn't good for your health.

263
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:39,758
A nutritious diet is very important.
You can't eat this.

264
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:56,398
Oh, my.

265
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:10,628
Go ahead and eat.

266
00:22:16,338 --> 00:22:18,218
I told you not to carry heavy things.

267
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,508
What's with him?

268
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:31,058
Doesn't it feel like déjà vu a bit?

269
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:33,188
It reminds me of my wife.

270
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:39,358
It's now clear why Ms. Lee
didn't come to work for a whole week.

271
00:22:39,988 --> 00:22:42,738
Most definitely.

272
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,828
Mr. Noh isn't in right now.

273
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:52,328
We're not here to see him.

274
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:53,338
Then?

275
00:22:53,418 --> 00:22:55,548
You, of course!

276
00:22:55,628 --> 00:22:57,628
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

277
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,218
Congratulations?

278
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:05,218
What is it?

279
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:09,638
My wife recommended it.

280
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,018
Keep it a secret.

281
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:15,188
But why…

282
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,818
I also asked my wife to send one.
It'll come in the mail tomorrow.

283
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:23,568
I was wondering why
you didn't come in for a week.

284
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:27,038
I thought you broke up with Mr. Noh.

285
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:29,198
It must be a wedding for "three" now.

286
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:30,788
-How exciting.
-Three?

287
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,828
It's already three of you!

288
00:23:33,498 --> 00:23:35,668
Do you mean…

289
00:23:37,838 --> 00:23:39,418
No way!

290
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:42,048
We're the only ones who know.

291
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:44,718
-We'll keep it zipped.
-It's not like that!

292
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:52,848
What… what are you doing?

293
00:23:56,688 --> 00:23:58,358
-Isn't it amazing?
-It melts in your mouth.

294
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,278
Isn't it tasty?

295
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:00,818
Here you go.

296
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,488
My goodness.

297
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:04,528
Slowly.

298
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:10,828
My goodness.

299
00:24:11,788 --> 00:24:14,418
But I'm only devoted to him.

300
00:24:14,498 --> 00:24:15,788
Devoted to him?

301
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,128
Why do you keep saying that?

302
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,628
Why the heck are you being like this?

303
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:23,048
Seriously, why are you doing this?

304
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,628
Please tell us the reason at least.

305
00:24:27,678 --> 00:24:29,008
Mr. Noh Manners…

306
00:24:29,888 --> 00:24:33,848
Gosh. He paid for
my son's hospital and surgery bills.

307
00:24:36,728 --> 00:24:40,778
Even though he acts mean,
he's a very kind-hearted person.

308
00:24:40,858 --> 00:24:43,238
He lets employees go home on time

309
00:24:43,318 --> 00:24:45,318
and use all their vacation days.

310
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:47,488
We only eat beef
for our company dinners too.

311
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:51,038
Everyone's going crazy
trying to tell him how thankful they are.

312
00:24:51,118 --> 00:24:52,448
It's crazy indeed.

313
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:53,578
Unbelievable.

314
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,418
No way. You're joking, right?

315
00:24:58,838 --> 00:25:01,458
Mr. Noh is a really good person.

316
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:04,548
Perhaps because he's dating.

317
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,888
He's completely changed.

318
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:12,428
Enough already with your revenge
or whatever it is that you're doing.

319
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:15,188
You need to learn to forgive
as human beings.

320
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:18,478
I reluctantly ate this meat
because I was worried it'd burn.

321
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,898
Otherwise, I wouldn't have let you slide.

322
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,278
FOLIC ACID

323
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,118
Folic acid?

324
00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:34,198
-What's this for?
-It's a supplement for pregnant women.

325
00:25:34,788 --> 00:25:35,618
So what?

326
00:25:36,498 --> 00:25:39,788
The instructors gave it to me
thinking I was pregnant.

327
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:42,628
What?

328
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:50,888
How can you laugh right now?

329
00:25:51,638 --> 00:25:55,348
Because you told the teaching assistants
to buy snacks themselves,

330
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,648
carry things for me,
and serve me food at the cafeteria,

331
00:25:58,728 --> 00:26:01,898
they're misunderstanding the situation.
What are you going to do now?

332
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:05,188
If we were actually dating,
you wouldn't have felt as wronged.

333
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:07,988
I'm not joking.

334
00:26:08,448 --> 00:26:09,528
I'm not joking either.

335
00:26:11,828 --> 00:26:13,788
Each day counts.

336
00:26:15,618 --> 00:26:18,458
So when are we going to start dating?

337
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,998
Let's think about it as we eat.

338
00:26:24,498 --> 00:26:27,128
You need to have
regular meals to be healthy.

339
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,348
So what are you going to do now?

340
00:26:34,848 --> 00:26:36,928
What were you thinking
dropping out of school?

341
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:40,978
I'll join your theater company
and audition as much as I can.

342
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:44,018
What about your dad?

343
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:46,478
Don't worry. He'll get over it.

344
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:51,488
Our future is very gloomy,
but thinking about Sina makes it worse.

345
00:26:51,908 --> 00:26:52,778
What about Sina?

346
00:26:53,368 --> 00:26:56,748
I said it's fine now.
She told me to continue acting.

347
00:26:57,328 --> 00:26:58,908
I doubt that.

348
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:07,088
What am I going to do with you?

349
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,178
My goodness. You're so mindless,

350
00:27:11,258 --> 00:27:14,178
and your soul is purer than the water
from Heaven Lake of Paektu Mountain.

351
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:17,388
But to me, you're just so lovely.
What am I going to do?

352
00:27:19,228 --> 00:27:21,938
Oh no. What's wrong, honey?

353
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:23,518
Oh no!

354
00:27:26,648 --> 00:27:28,648
Jeez, you made me panic!

355
00:27:38,078 --> 00:27:40,498
Seriously, why do you keep doing this?

356
00:27:40,578 --> 00:27:41,868
What do you think?

357
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:45,588
I'll tell you if you date me.

358
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:48,798
So…

359
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:54,468
let's start dating.

360
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:01,978
Open up, honey.

361
00:28:15,158 --> 00:28:16,158
You're eating chicken.

362
00:28:17,658 --> 00:28:19,538
Having chicken instead of a proper meal?

363
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:23,158
Enjoy. I'm going to my room.

364
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,078
Okay.

365
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:30,588
Why did she just go inside?

366
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:32,798
See? I told you.

367
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:36,138
She came all the way to my school
and told me to do whatever I wanted.

368
00:28:37,428 --> 00:28:38,558
That's odd.

369
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:40,308
Here you go.

370
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,938
Hey, Lee Sooho. What are you doing here?

371
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:49,318
What do you mean?
I'm here because I'm visiting Seoul.

372
00:28:50,068 --> 00:28:54,528
I'm going to stay here from now on.

373
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,028
Why?

374
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:58,278
I dropped out of school.

375
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:00,698
What did you say?

376
00:29:00,788 --> 00:29:02,448
You told me to pursue acting.

377
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:06,788
Hey, when did I say that?

378
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:08,498
You said that at my school!

379
00:29:08,588 --> 00:29:12,088
I just said it then, but I never told you
to drop out of school, you crazy punk!

380
00:29:12,338 --> 00:29:13,838
How dare you drop out of school!

381
00:29:14,258 --> 00:29:17,388
Why don't you
just drop out of your life too? Come here.

382
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:19,138
-Come here!
-Sina, calm down!

383
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:21,758
-Hey, Lee Sooho!
-Sina, calm down! Go, Sooho!

384
00:29:21,848 --> 00:29:24,388
-You stop right there!
-She's gone crazy.

385
00:29:24,478 --> 00:29:26,308
-Stop right there!
-Sooho, go now!

386
00:29:26,388 --> 00:29:28,478
-Gosh, seriously.
-Calm down.

387
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,068
-Let go of me.
-Calm down, Sina.

388
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:32,148
Let go!

389
00:29:32,318 --> 00:29:35,318
Sina, don't do that. You're scaring me.

390
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,448
You're so scary.

391
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:41,698
It's freezing out here.

392
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:48,708
What are you doing? Let go of me!

393
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:51,038
Who the heck are you?
What are you doing here?

394
00:29:51,668 --> 00:29:53,298
Why are you snooping around here?

395
00:29:55,088 --> 00:29:57,508
It's my older sister's place.
What about it?

396
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:58,928
Older sister?

397
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:05,518
Hey.

398
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:09,018
You're the person
who looks like Noh Gojin.

399
00:30:14,568 --> 00:30:17,738
Hey, let's tell him to come inside now.

400
00:30:19,908 --> 00:30:21,028
Drop out?

401
00:30:21,698 --> 00:30:25,578
That little brat is acting up
since I've been too easy on him.

402
00:30:26,498 --> 00:30:27,958
Gosh, it's so cold outside.

403
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:28,998
-Sooho.
-Hey.

404
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:31,248
How dare you come inside? Get out now!

405
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,388
Use your words.

406
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:50,268
I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

407
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:52,938
No, I'm not.

408
00:30:54,568 --> 00:30:55,898
You're so close.

409
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,278
How could I be?

410
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,118
So this is what your room looks like.

411
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:25,888
Can I…

412
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,148
sleep here tonight?

413
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:34,268
What?

414
00:31:39,238 --> 00:31:41,818
It was a joke. A joke!

415
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:48,198
What do I do?

416
00:31:52,248 --> 00:31:53,248
What are you doing?

417
00:31:53,498 --> 00:31:54,748
Why are you…

418
00:31:57,918 --> 00:32:01,128
Yonggu, is your daughter
and son-in-law living together?

419
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:43,468
Well… Sir.

420
00:32:44,628 --> 00:32:45,798
It's a misunderstanding.

421
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:49,508
Dad, it's a misunderstanding.

422
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:52,678
He just stopped by briefly for work.

423
00:32:54,268 --> 00:32:55,098
Sina.

424
00:32:56,438 --> 00:32:58,188
Is this how I raised you?

425
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:03,188
Dad, it's really not what you think.

426
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:04,698
So,

427
00:33:06,948 --> 00:33:08,158
you're not living together?

428
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:10,988
-No.
-No.

429
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:12,538
Why not?

430
00:33:13,198 --> 00:33:14,038
-Sorry?
-Pardon?

431
00:33:15,288 --> 00:33:16,918
If you don't live together,

432
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:19,748
when will you have kids?

433
00:33:19,838 --> 00:33:21,248
That's right.

434
00:33:21,878 --> 00:33:22,708
But

435
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:26,968
even if they don't live together,
they can still have kids.

436
00:33:35,018 --> 00:33:36,058
Yes, you're right.

437
00:33:39,938 --> 00:33:42,478
Sina, you're getting old now.

438
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:44,318
Have kids first.

439
00:33:46,778 --> 00:33:47,658
What do you…

440
00:33:47,738 --> 00:33:48,868
Okay?

441
00:33:58,748 --> 00:34:02,838
This place is nice and cozy.
It's perfect for living together.

442
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:04,668
Jeez, Dad.

443
00:34:04,758 --> 00:34:09,678
Yonggu, this is why life is unpredictable.
Don't you agree?

444
00:34:10,338 --> 00:34:14,218
We came to track down Sooho
who refused to go to school and left home,

445
00:34:14,598 --> 00:34:16,848
but we got to see this guy.

446
00:34:17,518 --> 00:34:19,348
Your son-in-law.

447
00:34:21,308 --> 00:34:22,568
I guess you're right.

448
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:26,738
Sooho, you should thank
your brother-in-law.

449
00:34:27,528 --> 00:34:31,698
If it weren't for him,
I would've broken your legs by now.

450
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,868
You got that?

451
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:35,828
That's right.

452
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:41,418
Thank you.

453
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:48,048
But you look so much like Noh Gojin.
You must hear that often.

454
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,558
Yes, I hear that it often.

455
00:34:56,058 --> 00:34:57,728
Because I am Noh Gojin.

456
00:35:00,268 --> 00:35:04,148
Are you really… Noh Gojin?

457
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,988
Dad! He's the CEO of Sina's compa--

458
00:35:12,658 --> 00:35:15,528
Wow, the pig's trotters are so tasty.

459
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:20,078
It's tasty.

460
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:21,958
Yes, eat up.

461
00:35:23,128 --> 00:35:26,208
It's getting a little late.
He has to get going now.

462
00:35:26,298 --> 00:35:29,548
-What?
-What do you mean? He needs to sleep here.

463
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,928
-No, he needs to go.
-Stay the night here.

464
00:35:32,008 --> 00:35:33,508
-No, he needs to go.
-Stay the night.

465
00:35:33,588 --> 00:35:34,468
Please get up now.

466
00:35:34,548 --> 00:35:36,138
Come on. Stay over.

467
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:37,468
-He has to go!
-Stay!

468
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:47,438
Son-in-law…

469
00:35:50,238 --> 00:35:51,988
Brother-in-law…

470
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:35,278
I'm sorry. It's hard to sleep, right?

471
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:45,668
I'm about to lose my mind.

472
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:52,838
Because it feels like…

473
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:56,048
I have a family now.

474
00:37:11,278 --> 00:37:16,278
THANK YOU FOR PUTTING IT LIKE THAT

475
00:37:30,668 --> 00:37:34,668
NO, I'M MORE THANKFUL

476
00:37:45,678 --> 00:37:48,478
DID MY DAD'S SUDDEN VISIT SURPRISE YOU?

477
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,978
THE MORE I GET TO KNOW HIM,
HE'S A GOOD PERSON

478
00:37:55,488 --> 00:37:59,488
MY DAD ALSO SEEMS TO LIKE YOU.
HE'S NOT USUALLY THIS PLAYFUL…

479
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,628
You need to relieve your hangover
before going to work.

480
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,918
-I'll…
-It's okay.

481
00:38:55,798 --> 00:38:58,508
I can take the leftover home.
Go ahead and eat.

482
00:38:59,178 --> 00:39:00,178
Yes, sir.

483
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,098
I like you.

484
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:14,648
From the day you first came to my house.

485
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:33,788
I'll protect her.

486
00:39:36,798 --> 00:39:38,458
I'll never give up.

487
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,428
Ms. Sina.

488
00:39:42,678 --> 00:39:44,598
Of course, you should.

489
00:39:45,298 --> 00:39:50,518
Until all your hair turns gray
strand by strand,

490
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:52,518
you need to be with her and protect her.

491
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:03,408
Where did they go?

492
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:22,718
Already?

493
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:26,718
Are you going back home now

494
00:40:26,798 --> 00:40:28,808
-or staying for a few days?
-Well,

495
00:40:28,888 --> 00:40:30,428
I should be heading back.

496
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:34,478
But how come Mr. Chu didn't come with us?

497
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:43,608
Did you come out worried
that your husband ran away?

498
00:40:44,198 --> 00:40:45,488
Come on, Dad.

499
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,318
Give me that.

500
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:49,158
Come on now.

501
00:40:50,408 --> 00:40:51,328
Okay, then.

502
00:40:57,168 --> 00:40:58,128
Good morning.

503
00:41:18,938 --> 00:41:21,648
The interns who don't pass
their instructor auditions

504
00:41:21,818 --> 00:41:25,278
either leave the company
or get assigned as Mr. Noh's secretary.

505
00:41:25,648 --> 00:41:26,568
Previous secretaries

506
00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:28,568
all left the company within three months,

507
00:41:28,868 --> 00:41:32,198
Ms. Lee Sina is the only secretary
who stayed on for more than a year.

508
00:41:32,288 --> 00:41:34,118
She is the type I hate the most.

509
00:41:34,198 --> 00:41:36,368
People who use other people's power
instead of their own,

510
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,538
to obtain what they want easily.

511
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:44,418
You may go now.

512
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:57,098
BAEK SOOYEONG

513
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,028
-Hello?
-Hello, Ms. Baek.

514
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:10,948
I was passing by the area.
Since it's lunchtime,

515
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:13,828
I want to buy you a meal
if that's okay with you.

516
00:42:15,038 --> 00:42:16,708
I felt so terrible about the accident,

517
00:42:17,288 --> 00:42:19,418
so I really wanted
to buy you a meal at least.

518
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:21,878
It's really okay. Please don't worry.

519
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:24,378
If today doesn't work,
another time is okay too.

520
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,668
Just don't refuse, please.

521
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:29,798
Then,

522
00:42:31,178 --> 00:42:34,218
instead of lunch, how about a drink?

523
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:43,648
Your first time drinking in the day?

524
00:42:45,608 --> 00:42:47,608
Yes. How did you know?

525
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:55,948
You look like the model student
who was very obedient to his parents.

526
00:42:56,538 --> 00:42:58,998
No, I'm a terrible son.

527
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:02,878
You're too humble.

528
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,338
Whenever Gojin got drunk,

529
00:43:09,508 --> 00:43:12,848
he always talked about you.

530
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:16,218
It seemed that he missed you a lot.

531
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,308
Is that true?

532
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:26,438
But I feel bad for you two
because he lost his memories.

533
00:43:29,738 --> 00:43:31,948
At first, I thought it was a good thing.

534
00:43:33,448 --> 00:43:38,078
Because that means he also forgot
the bad memories of us breaking up.

535
00:43:40,498 --> 00:43:43,378
I believed that we could start over again.

536
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,548
It's because of Ms. Lee Sina, isn't it?

537
00:43:49,798 --> 00:43:53,638
Gojin believes
that Ms. Lee Sina is really his fiancée.

538
00:43:53,718 --> 00:43:55,348
I'm worried about him too.

539
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:58,928
I wanted to keep
Ms. Lee Sina away from him,

540
00:43:59,478 --> 00:44:03,188
but I didn't want to confuse him
while he was ill.

541
00:44:03,768 --> 00:44:06,768
How could I tell Gojin when everything
is jumbled up in his head due to amnesia

542
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:10,188
that his secretary might be pretending

543
00:44:10,608 --> 00:44:12,908
to be his fiancée for his money?

544
00:44:12,988 --> 00:44:14,948
What if that's really the case?

545
00:44:15,818 --> 00:44:19,698
We need to keep
Ms. Lee Sina away from Gojin right away

546
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,288
before they grow closer.

547
00:44:21,998 --> 00:44:22,998
You're right.

548
00:44:24,368 --> 00:44:25,378
How about this?

549
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:28,998
Ms. Lee Sina is passionate
about becoming an instructor.

550
00:44:29,088 --> 00:44:34,218
I think the best solution would be
for Baek Edu to recruit her

551
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:36,348
to keep her away from Gotop…
No, from Gojin.

552
00:44:36,928 --> 00:44:40,718
Out of sight, out of mind, you know?

553
00:44:42,308 --> 00:44:46,728
I hope that you and Gojin
get back together.

554

Grandma.

557
00:45:48,498 --> 00:45:50,458
Let's go back to the hospital.

558
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:52,958
Please.

559
00:45:53,548 --> 00:45:56,088
My poor baby.

560
00:46:00,678 --> 00:46:05,728
All I need is you.

561
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:08,848
I want to

562
00:46:09,858 --> 00:46:13,858
stay here with my grandson.

563
00:46:16,698 --> 00:46:20,448
All I need is you.

564
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:39,338
No.

565
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,218
I'll never give up.

566
00:46:48,228 --> 00:46:50,438
I'LL BE BETTER TO YOUR DAD FROM NOW ON

567
00:46:50,518 --> 00:46:55,108
DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT WHAT HE SAID
WON'T YOU BE TIRED TOMORROW? GO TO SLEEP!

568
00:47:04,528 --> 00:47:05,658
What are you doing?

569
00:47:05,738 --> 00:47:06,748
You startled me!

570
00:47:07,198 --> 00:47:09,248
Can I use your face toner?
I ran out again.

571
00:47:10,248 --> 00:47:11,168
It's over there.

572
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:18,468
-Okhee.
-Yes?

573
00:47:18,718 --> 00:47:23,348
So, there's this colleague from work
doesn't know what to do

574
00:47:23,428 --> 00:47:25,258
because some guy keeps asking her out.

575
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:27,928
You keep bringing up
the topic of dating lately.

576
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:30,188
Does she like him?

577
00:47:30,268 --> 00:47:31,308
What?

578
00:47:32,348 --> 00:47:34,188
Well, she's not sure.

579
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:37,318
If she isn't sure,
tell her to stare him in the eye.

580
00:47:37,398 --> 00:47:39,148
Stare him in the eye?

581
00:47:39,238 --> 00:47:42,408
Yes. If she really loves him,

582
00:47:42,988 --> 00:47:44,908
she'll hear the sound of bells ringing.

583
00:47:45,368 --> 00:47:46,908
Ding.

584
00:47:46,988 --> 00:47:48,198
Oh, come on.

585
00:47:49,198 --> 00:47:50,828
Then, they can date.

586
00:47:50,908 --> 00:47:52,418
If she likes him, she should date him.

587
00:47:52,498 --> 00:47:54,038
Why worry unnecessarily?

588
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,838
Oh, right. Did you find your diary?

589
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,338
Oh, my diary.

590
00:48:06,388 --> 00:48:09,678
-Should I try?
-Why was the date brought forward so soon?

-Hello.
-Hello.

596
00:48:46,138 --> 00:48:49,638
I want to apply for the interview online,
but I don't see my name.

597
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,138
Well, ma'am--

598
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:54,848
You can't apply, Ms. Lee Sina.

599
00:48:55,478 --> 00:48:57,478
Pardon? Why not?

600
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:03,358
Mr. Noh instructed us
to exclude you from the candidate list.

GOTOP EDUCATION CEO NOH GOJIN

604
00:49:25,878 --> 00:49:26,968
Why did you do that?

605
00:49:27,678 --> 00:49:28,508
Do what?

606
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:32,018
I heard that you gave instructions
to exclude me from the audition list.

607
00:49:33,268 --> 00:49:34,098
I did.

608
00:49:34,598 --> 00:49:35,688
Why?

609
00:49:41,068 --> 00:49:42,648
Because you have no talent.

610
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:46,988
You aren't instructor material.
Please find another career.

611
00:49:49,448 --> 00:49:51,328
Who is the one that judges
whether I have talent?

612
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:53,538
Okhee said this to me.

613
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,998
No one has the right to judge my passion.

614
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:01,128
That's called false hope.

615
00:50:12,388 --> 00:50:13,388
Hello?

616
00:50:16,348 --> 00:50:19,768
CEO Jang of Think Academy?

617
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:33,238
Talent? I don't have talent?

618
00:50:34,408 --> 00:50:36,618
How would he know if I'm talented or not?

619
00:50:37,328 --> 00:50:39,918
How could he be so mean?

620
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,508
But where the heck is my diary?

621
00:50:56,138 --> 00:50:57,308
Hello, Ms. Sooyeong?

622
00:50:59,938 --> 00:51:00,808
Lunch?

623
00:51:10,658 --> 00:51:11,698
What do you think?

624
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:13,448
Is it disappointing compared to Gotop?

625
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,328
No, not at all. It's great.

626
00:51:15,828 --> 00:51:18,748
Actually, I was feeling down today,

627
00:51:18,828 --> 00:51:20,748
and you bought me a delicious lunch

628
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:23,878
and even gave me a tour of Baek Edu.
Thank you so much.

629
00:51:24,878 --> 00:51:25,958
I'm glad to hear that.

630
00:51:26,498 --> 00:51:28,968
Let's go up.
I have some good coffee in my office.

631
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,588
Okay.

632
00:51:47,108 --> 00:51:48,108
What's wrong?

633
00:51:48,818 --> 00:51:49,648
Nothing.

634
00:51:51,148 --> 00:51:51,988
Please have a seat.

635
00:51:52,488 --> 00:51:53,618
Okay.

636
00:52:00,578 --> 00:52:02,288
Oh, this coffee is very good indeed.

637
00:52:06,288 --> 00:52:07,588
By the way, Ms. Sina.

638
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:11,838
-Where was your engagement ceremony?
-Pardon?

639
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:15,888
It didn't seem like anyone attended
Mr. Noh's engagement ceremony.

640
00:52:18,888 --> 00:52:21,138
That's because we got engaged
at his vacation house.

641
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:24,478
His vacation house?

642
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:27,858
Your family members went at least?

643
00:52:27,938 --> 00:52:28,978
No.

644
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:31,068
It was just the two of us.

645
00:52:32,398 --> 00:52:33,238
Just the two of you?

646
00:52:40,248 --> 00:52:43,578
I didn't ask you to meet today
to talk about such trivial things.

647
00:52:47,128 --> 00:52:48,128
Ms. Sina.

648
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:53,628
You told me before that you'll become
an instructor someday, right?

649
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:59,008
What if that someday is now?

650
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,558
-Pardon?
-I want to recruit you, Ms. Sina.

651
00:53:03,228 --> 00:53:04,138
Me?

652
00:53:06,728 --> 00:53:09,438
Am I crossing the line
by saying this to Mr. Noh's fiancée?

653
00:53:09,518 --> 00:53:11,398
Not give me a chance to audition,
but recruit me?

654
00:53:11,478 --> 00:53:16,158
Baek Edu is offering unparalleled
opportunity to new instructors.

655
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:20,288
One real teaching experience is
worth more important than 100 auditions.

656
00:53:20,658 --> 00:53:25,618
You need to stand on a podium and teach
to know your true skills.

657
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:30,798
Besides, I believe in your potential.

658
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:35,928
How does it sound?

659
00:53:40,848 --> 00:53:42,928
Oh no!

660
00:53:43,558 --> 00:53:46,308
Oh no, Mr. Jang!

661
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:52,318
Oh no. This is so terrible.
How could this be?

662
00:53:54,278 --> 00:53:55,608
Darn.

663
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:00,448
Tears won't come out. Jeez.

664
00:54:03,538 --> 00:54:04,698
Darn it.

665
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,868
Perhaps because I'm old.
My tears have dried up.

666
00:54:08,168 --> 00:54:09,168
My eyes are so dry.

667
00:54:14,258 --> 00:54:18,178
Oh, right. Was the article released
about our acquisition of Think Academy?

668
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:21,808
-Yes, it was.
-Good.

669
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,178
Mr. Noh Manners isn't here yet, right?

670
00:54:25,268 --> 00:54:26,268
Not yet, sir.

671
00:54:33,818 --> 00:54:34,778
Just…

672
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:37,028
go back home today.

673
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:40,908
Ms. Jang's wife will
feel uncomfortable seeing you.

674
00:54:44,038 --> 00:54:48,158
My goodness! I guess
you haven't seen the news article yet.

675
00:54:48,328 --> 00:54:53,208
Think Academy agreed yesterday
to be acquired by us.

676
00:54:55,878 --> 00:54:57,378
ILPUM EDU ACQUIRES THINK ACADEMY…
SOON TO BE NO.1 IN THE INDUSTRY

677
00:54:57,468 --> 00:55:00,048
My goodness. How terrible for you.

678
00:55:00,258 --> 00:55:03,428
I heard that you worked
so hard on that deal.

679
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:08,138
This shows that studying a lot
doesn't always make you the winner.

680
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,978
Hey! That's all?

681
00:55:17,488 --> 00:55:18,988
Congratulations.

682
00:55:25,578 --> 00:55:26,738
How many fingers do you see?

683
00:55:29,578 --> 00:55:30,788
What about these?

684
00:55:32,918 --> 00:55:33,748
What are you doing?

685
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,178
VIP ROOM

686
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:44,048
You know

687
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:46,888
who I am at least, right?

688
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:48,428
Who are you?

689
00:55:50,268 --> 00:55:52,648
Do you really…

690
00:55:53,438 --> 00:55:54,478
have amnesia?

691
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,568
You know about that too?

692
00:55:56,648 --> 00:55:58,068
Did you really…

693
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:01,608
lose your mind?

694
00:56:03,618 --> 00:56:07,738
Well, then
did you also forget what I've done to you?

695
00:56:09,618 --> 00:56:11,708
What on earth have you done to me?

696
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:15,128
I made you a math instructor.
Don't you remember?

697
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:17,668
You solved the math problem
from Oxford University in my office,

698
00:56:17,748 --> 00:56:19,798
so I recognized right away
that you were a genius.

699
00:56:19,878 --> 00:56:22,048
So you deceived people
saying that I'm an Oxford graduate

700
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:25,138
and earned a lot of money
by making me the top instructor.

701
00:56:26,928 --> 00:56:28,258
But you threw me away like garbage

702
00:56:28,348 --> 00:56:30,558
when I got accused
of forging my academic records, right?

703
00:56:31,348 --> 00:56:34,348
You were the one
who forged my academic records,

704
00:56:35,018 --> 00:56:36,858
but I was the one who went through hell.

705
00:56:36,938 --> 00:56:37,858
Back then…

706
00:56:40,028 --> 00:56:41,688
That's why I lived relentlessly

707
00:56:42,278 --> 00:56:43,858
to hunt you down.

708
00:56:45,868 --> 00:56:47,078
What else do you want to know?

709
00:56:47,778 --> 00:56:50,118
How I made you donate to your alma mater?

710
00:56:51,198 --> 00:56:52,288
Or…

711
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:54,868
how you took the laxative
you were going to give me

712
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:55,998
and humiliated yourself?

713
00:56:56,668 --> 00:56:58,588
What? You remember everything.

714
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:02,548
I memorized everything.

715
00:57:16,648 --> 00:57:18,308
He handed over Think Academy?

716
00:57:19,108 --> 00:57:20,568
How far are you taking this?

717
00:57:26,448 --> 00:57:27,408
Oh, Gojin.

718
00:57:31,238 --> 00:57:33,788
Why is it so hard to see you
when we work in the same building?

719
00:57:33,868 --> 00:57:35,118
Did you go somewhere?

720
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:37,418
I went to Mr. Jang's funeral.

721
00:57:37,498 --> 00:57:40,128
Oh. I'm going there now.

722
00:57:40,418 --> 00:57:42,048
If I had known, we could've gone together.

723
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:47,588
I heard that
Ilpum Edu acquired Think Academy.

724
00:57:47,678 --> 00:57:48,548
Really?

725
00:57:48,638 --> 00:57:51,808
You've been trying so hard
to acquire them for a long time. That--

726
00:57:54,978 --> 00:57:55,978
Is that right?

727
00:57:56,728 --> 00:57:57,728
Yes.

728
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:01,068
I'd better hear from them what happened.

729
00:58:01,688 --> 00:58:02,648
I'll be back.

730
00:58:05,778 --> 00:58:08,448
Okay. See you when you get back.

731
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,258
Ms. Okhee.

732
00:58:33,348 --> 00:58:35,478
Oh. What are you doing here?

733
00:58:36,728 --> 00:58:37,808
Where is Ms. Sina?

734
00:58:37,888 --> 00:58:38,728
She went to work.

735
00:58:41,728 --> 00:58:44,648
Is something going on with her
by any chance?

736
00:58:44,978 --> 00:58:47,148
Is she unwell or something like that?

737
00:58:47,238 --> 00:58:48,238
No.

738
00:58:48,988 --> 00:58:53,368
Oh, right. She was excited about
being recruited by Baek Edu or something,

739
00:58:53,448 --> 00:58:55,288
and then got mad again
talking about her talent.

740
00:58:55,368 --> 00:58:57,578
She left for work early this morning
for a meeting.

741
00:59:12,098 --> 00:59:14,508
I want to recruit you, Ms. Sina.

742
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:24,938
Come to my office now.

743
00:59:30,778 --> 00:59:31,778
Did you call for--

744
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:50,758
Please erase everything.

745
00:59:55,468 --> 00:59:57,138
Is this what he called me for?

746
00:59:57,808 --> 01:00:00,138
And does he have to write
all the way to the top?

747
01:00:00,348 --> 01:00:02,938
He's a genius, isn't he?
Why can't he calculate it in his head?

748
01:00:22,538 --> 01:00:25,288
And you're an idiot, right?

749
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:30,088
-Sorry?
-You really don't know

750
01:00:30,718 --> 01:00:32,128
why I'm not letting you audition?

751
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,718
You said I have no talent.

752
01:00:42,308 --> 01:00:44,268
If you become an instructor
and achieve your dream,

753
01:00:46,898 --> 01:00:48,478
you won't stay by my side anymore.

754
01:00:52,698 --> 01:00:54,448
I feel anxious without you anymore.

755
01:00:56,738 --> 01:00:57,658
So…

756
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:03,328
can't you just continue to stay…

757
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,248
by my side?

758
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:17,678
I like you.

759
01:01:21,848 --> 01:01:24,938
Lee Sina. I like you.

760
01:01:28,478 --> 01:01:30,228
If you don't want this, tell me now.

761
01:01:31,648 --> 01:01:33,438
I'm fearful and afraid too.

762
01:01:42,578 --> 01:01:43,578
This time…

763
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:48,168
it'll really be three seconds.

764
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,058
