1
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,970
CRAZY LOVE

2
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,950
CRAZY LOVE

3
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,290
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,130
In 2016, with the takeover of
Jungsin Master Education,

5
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,380
Gotop Education was established.

6
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,510
Two thousand…

7
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,010
"Where is the location?"
"It's Mount Kumgang."

8
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,100
He's looking over at Hwaryongso Pond
at Mount Kumgang.

9
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,940
You have to know what this means.

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,190
What does the shape
of flowing water represent?

11
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,070
It's being compared to a dragon…

12
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,490
CHEONGSIMHWAN

13
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,160
LEE SINA

14
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,080
Next up is intern instructor Lee Sina.

15
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,920
GOTOP EDUCATION LECTURE AUDITION

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,170
Hello, my name is Lee Sina.

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,050
Today's lesson will be on nasalization.

18
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,050
I believe it is very important to

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,060
understand the concept

20
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,310
and utilize it in practice.

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,360
I will now explain
how to go about doing this.

22
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,280
Right. So I will explain what occurs

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,910
when two consonants collide.

24
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,450
Okay.

25
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,080
Let's focus on the word "nasalization".

26
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,580
So, the origin of the word means
"to become".

27
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,220
Do you want to resign or get transferred
to the CEO's secretary's office?

28
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,510
Pardon?

29
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,600
At Gotop Education, once interns complete
the two-year program,

30
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,020
they do a teaching demonstration.

31
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,570
If they don't pass the demonstration,

32
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,070
they must either choose between resigning

33
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,150
or getting transferred

34
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,030
to the CEO's secretary's office.

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,740
We have this policy
to raise competitive instructors.

36
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,040
There's no point thinking about this.

37
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,290
Either way, they want you out.

38
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
I'm hungry.

39
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,290
Ms. Lee, you have a glioblastoma.

40
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,540
It's cancer. A brain tumor.

41
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,880
A brain tumor?

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,840
Yes.

43
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,010
I have a brain tumor?

44
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,050
I just had some migraines. How…

45
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,720
How is that possible?

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,560
Cancer can be dangerous
because it can develop without any signs.

47
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,730
Your body was giving you warnings
through these minor symptoms,

48
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,480
which you ignored over the past year.

49
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,560
Have any of your family members
been diagnosed with cancer?

50
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,030
You must have been exposed to
a tremendous amount of stress

51
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,950
for the past year
ever since your migraine started.

52
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,450
Didn't you experience
other symptoms than migraine?

53
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,160
Stress suppresses our immune system
and lowers our ability to fight diseases.

54
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,540
So stress is
one of the biggest causes of cancer.

55
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,880
You should prepare yourself.

56
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm really…

57
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,220
going to die?

58
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,060
What is this?

59
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,570
Of course. I'm so proud of you, daughter.

60
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,690
Yes, I'm on my way with some chicken.

61
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,280
Do you like that?

62
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,560
THE NO. 1 ONLINE CLASS

63
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,900
You must have been exposed to
a tremendous amount of stress.

64
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,070
So stress is
one of the biggest causes of cancer.

65
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,370
Wrap up the shoot with KTS by 11 a.m.

66
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,660
and postpone
the study guides meeting until 2 p.m.

67
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,500
The six o'clock offline lecture
will be delayed. Inform them in advance.

68
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,750
Set the merchandise meeting
at 10 a.m. No, 10:20 a.m.

69
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,130
Wait, no. 10:25 a.m.

70
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,840
Set a 30 minute-meeting
for the commercial shoot after my lecture.

71
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,550
Postpone my 11 a.m. shoot until noon.

72
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,380
Wait, sir.

73
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,970
You were too fast.

74
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,100
What time is the merchandise meeting?

75
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,930
-What time will it be?
-Pardon?

76
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,730
Why don't you just guess?

77
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,070
If you're not smart,
at least learn to take notes quickly.

78
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,990
The space between the rings
should be 5.5cm.

79
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,200
Not 5cm, but 5.5cm!

80
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,660
Were you taking minutes
or writing a novel?

81
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,710
Don't you know
that you're supposed to summarize them?

82
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,050
Never…

83
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,270
serve me onions.

84
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,140
Your coffee, sir.

85
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,940
Wait.

86
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,170
Who would drink this cold coffee?

87
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,050
The perfect temperature for coffee is
between 70 and 80 degrees Celsius.

88
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,680
I told you that numbers make a difference!

89
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,680
How many times must I say this to you?

90
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,350
Must I always repeat myself?
Am I asking you to do the impossible?

91
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,520
TYLENOM

92
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,630
I'm losing my hair?

93
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,760
GOTOP EDUCATION CEO NOH GOJIN

94
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,850
Ms. Lee Sina.

95
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,900
If this is all you can do,

96
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,520
just quit now. Now!

97
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,930
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

98
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,140
What's the value?
Since this is a positive integer,

99
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,520
it is the square root of two fifths.

100
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,570
Now, when you take this over

101
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,660
and graph it like this,

102
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,490
what is the length of this segment?

103
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,450
Remember square root of two…

104
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,370
And the value of the x-axis…

105
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,130
will be two. Then lastly…

106
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,300
I can do it too.

107
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,480
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

108
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,410
The temperature for coffee should be
between 75 and 80 degrees Celsius!

109
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,250
I told you to take out the onions!

110
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,830
I said, write down just the key points!

111
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,460
If this is all you can do, just quit!

112
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,020
Choose… now.

113
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,260
GOTOP EDUCATION CEO NOH GOJIN

114
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,550
This is all…

115
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,390
your fault!

116
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,580
This is a great night.

117
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,500
A really great night.

118
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,690
You solved a math problem
while stargazing again, right?

119
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,030
How can you even think about
a boring math problem…

120
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,330
looking at those beautiful stars?

121
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,120
You really are

122
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,710
a man from Mars with zero sensitivity.

123
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,120
That stupid wine.

124
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,580
Wh-Who are you?

125
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,330
I said, who are you?

126
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,860
What's this about?

127
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,200
What the heck are you doing?

128
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,040
How did you get in here?

129
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,480
What is this?

130
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,850
What do you think you're doing--

131
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,420
Seriously, what on earth--

132
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,720
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

133
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,720
Scumbag.

134
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,390
This is

135
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,600
all your fault.

136
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,890
Because of you…

137
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,940
I'm going to die.

138
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,230
-Hey!
-Don't you dare "hey” me, you punk!

139
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,570
Shut your mouth
before I rip it into pieces.

140
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,370
What? You thought
you were the only one who could curse?

141
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,540
Are you…

142
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,290
Are you out of your mind?

143
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,460
Yes, I am. I am completely out of my mind.

144
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,670
Why wouldn't I be?
I don't have much time left.

145
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,130
I am not putting up with you anymore.
I am not,

146
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,630
and I will not. This is so not fair!

147
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,260
You must've thought I was a fool
for never talking back, haven't you?

148
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,350
Did you think I let that slide
because I was scared of you?

149
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,850
No, I didn't want to waste my time.

150
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,480
Because you're a worthless loser.
No, actually,

151
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,060
I never got back at you
because you were not even worth my time!

152
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,900
-What did you say?
-Hey, Noh Gojin.

153
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,820
I'm warning you.

154
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,120
You'd better watch your back at night.

155
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,240
If you piss me off,

156
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,830
I won't be dying alone.

157
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,620
I'll take you with me.

158
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,540
And one more thing.

159
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,600
You aren't the only one
who can throw things. I can do it too.

160
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,400
If you break other people's hearts,

161
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,020
yours will break with that claw hammer!
Got that?

162
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,910
Stop right there!

163
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,210
You're dead meat.

164
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,960
You are not…

165
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,760
going to get away with this.

166
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,070
Hey. Stop right there!

167
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,620
Stop right there!

168
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,410
You're dead meat.

169
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Hey, get out. Get out!

170
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,960
-I got you.
-Don't touch me!

171
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,590
-Let go!
-Get off!

172
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,380
Seriously!

173
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,230
Open the door.

174
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,740
I said, open the door!

175
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,410
Lee Sina.

176
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,950
Jeez. Hey.

177
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,990
Hey!

178
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,040
Lee Sina.

179
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,040
Lee Sina!

180
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,440
Gosh, he almost caught me.

181
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,650
INCOMING CALL
MR. NOH GOJIN

182
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,950
Why is he calling me?

183
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,660
What? You think I'm scared of you?

184
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,580
-What?
-Hey! You'd better come back here.

185
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,580
How dare you boss me around?
You think I'm your lapdog?

186
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,840
You really are asking for it today.

187
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,260
No, I'm not asking for anything.

188
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,800
-Hey!
-What?

189
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,140
I'm going to catch you.
You just wait there!

190
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,010
Catch me if you can. You think I'm scared?

191
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,140
Lee Sina.
I'm going to catch you no matter what.

192
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,400
I'm going to catch you! Got that?

193
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,170
Hello?

194
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,760
Hello?

195
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Mr. Noh?

196
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,040
Mr. Noh?

197
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,210
Mr. Noh, please answer me.

198
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,880
Mr. Noh!

199
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,460
Mr. Noh!

200
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,210
Mr. Noh, please wake up!

201
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,590
Please wake up, Mr. Noh.

202
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,680
Mr. Noh! What do I do?

203
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,110
GANGNEUNG MEDICAL CENTER

204
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,720
-Okay, one, two, three.
-Two, three.

205
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,490
Mr. Noh Gojin will be all okay, right?

206
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,530
Fortunately, his bones are fine,

207
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,910
but the artery
in his right popliteal fossa has ruptured.

208
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,240
As the bleeding is severe,
we must operate right away.

209
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,660
He'll live, right? He won't die, right?

210
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,500
We'll do our best.

211
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,960
Thank you.

212
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,590
Ma'am.

213
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,800
Please sign the consent form.

214
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,220
-But I'm not his family.
-Please go register.

215
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,040
No! Please.

216
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,300
He cannot die.
Please let him live. Please!

217
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,210
Please let him live.

218
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,130
He cannot die.

219
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,510
Gosh, what do I do?

220
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,160
Please let him live.

221
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,080
Please.

222
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
Blood.

223
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,510
Oh, gosh. Please.

224
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,220
Scumbag.

225
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,900
This is not what I wanted.

226
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,650
I swear to you.

227
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,740
So whoever is listening up there,
please save Mr. Noh. Please!

228
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,410
Please save him!

229
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,410
Doctor!

230
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,370
How did it go, doctor?

231
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,580
The surgery went well.

232
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,670
Thank you. Thank you so much!

233
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,790
Gosh, thank you so much.

234
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,840
He'll stay in the recovery room
and move to a room tomorrow morning.

235
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,470
The nurse will explain in detail later.

236
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,760
-Okay. Thank you, doctor.
-Sure.

237
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,060
Thank you.

238
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,720
Thank you.

239
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,180
Thank you!

240
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,970
Darn it.

241
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,330
Passengers, please fasten your seatbelts.

242
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:39,290
And switch your smartphones and
other electronic devices to airplane mode.

243
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,040
Sir, could you please
turn off your device?

244
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,130
Of course.

245
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,930
What's wrong, Mr. Oh?

246
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,600
-Where is it?
-Your phone?

247
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,140
Yes.

248
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,850
Did you lose it somewhere?

249
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,150
I don't know.

250
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,060
I remember taking it from my house.

251
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,940
I stopped by the office
because I forgot some documents…

252
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,700
I took it out at the office to charge

253
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,700
and left it there.

254
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,330
Gosh. I'm so scatter-brained.

255
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,080
Oh, no.
It'll be quite inconvenient for you.

256
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,420
Well, there's nothing I can do.
I should look on the bright side.

257
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,000
Yes! I'm on a digital detox!

258
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,020
GOTOP EDUCATION DEPUTY CEO OH SEGI

259
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,310
MS. LEE SINA

260
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,570
Mr. Oh isn't answering his phone.

261
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:40,370
I never saw this coming.

262
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,920
So why did you chase after me?

263
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:54,470
No. I'm sorry about that.

264
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,690
But why isn't he waking up?

265
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,110
Sir.

266
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,280
Sir.

267
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,450
Sir!

268
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,030
Sir!

269
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,450
Please come quickly!

270
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,710
Sir! What do I do?

271
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,260
It was a simple convulsion.
You don't have to worry.

272
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,510
I see. Okay.

273
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,890
But why is still not awake?

274
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,720
The surgery ended hours ago.

275
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,430
It's because he has a unique constitution.

276
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,890
A unique constitution?

277
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,560
Mr. Noh is very sensitive to anesthetics.

278
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:50,320
People with his constitution,
unlike others,

279
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,360
cannot be anesthetized completely,

280
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,280
and it takes a long time
to wake up from anesthetics too.

281
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,160
There won't be any problems, right?

282
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,040
Like he'll never wake up…

283
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,250
You don't have to worry about that.

284
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,670
His heart rate, blood pressure,
and temperature are all normal.

285
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,050
And he can breathe on his own too.

286
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,130
Right now, he's just sleeping deeply.

287
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,970
He will wake up soon.

288
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,350
I see. Thank you. Thank you so much.

289
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,210
I drank way too much.

290
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,130
Sina, let's get
something spicy for breakfast.

291
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,420
I went four rounds of drinking
with my senior colleagues,

292
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,130
so I'm craving spicy broth.

293
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,090
How about jjamppong ramyeon?

294
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,720
Lee Sina!

295
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,020
What?

296
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,900
I thought she was on vacation.
Where did she go?

297
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,820
Unbelievable. She went to work again.

298
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:23,080
I knew it. Mr. Noh Manners wouldn't
let her have her vacation that easily.

299
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,870
He didn't give her a summer vacation,
so why would he now?

300
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,080
I have to pee.

301
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,250
Let's hurry.

302
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,210
Oh my gosh!

303
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,760
What… What is this?

304
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,840
I came in to switch the IV bag,

305
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,670
but I couldn't interrupt you

306
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,210
as you were so focused.

307
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,260
-Pardon me.
-Sure.

308
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,390
Aren't you tired?
I don't think you even slept.

309
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,180
I'm all right.

310
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,600
There's a hotel ten minutes from here.

311
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,900
-Pardon?
-You should get some sleep and come back.

312
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,770
No, I'm all right.

313
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,070
I don't know when he'll wake up.

314
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,820
I can't leave him alone.

315
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,320
I think he'll get shocked

316
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,490
and pass out again once he wakes up.

317
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,680
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

318
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,060
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

319
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,680
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

320
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,360
I'm so tired from the trip to Gangneung.

321
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,110
Good morning.

322
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,190
Gosh.

323
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,400
I need some caffeine.

324
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,030
My sandwich and coffee…

325
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,490
is gone.

326
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,250
Now that she knows that I don't like her,
she's really getting on my nerves.

327
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,960
-Hey.
-Good morning.

328
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,040
-Tell Ms. Lee to get me coffee now.
-Good morning.

329
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,550
Ms. Lee? She didn't come to work today.

330
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,420
Did she quit?

331
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,800
Right.

332
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,220
She wasn't that dense after all.

333
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:55,350
She was humiliated at the special lecture.
She would be an idiot not to resign.

334
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,060
Good for her.

335
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,730
She made a wise decision.

336
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,490
No, she's on vacation.

337
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,110
Vacation?

338
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,740
-What vacation?
-I'm not sure.

339
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,160
Maybe she's on vacation
because Mr. Noh is on vacation.

340
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,410
That can't be.

341
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,580
Hey!

342
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,750
Then you need to go and get me coffee!

343
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,840
Don't complain.

344
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,880
Okay.

345
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,970
-Ma'am!
-Yes?

346
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,890
Why didn't you clean my desk?

347
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,850
My goodness.

348
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:38,350
Your desk is very clean, so I forgot.

349
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,070
I'll empty it now.

350
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,830
One more?

351
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,680
Gosh. I can talk now

352
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,810
as my thirst is quenched.

353
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,230
So why didn't Ms. Lee come to work?

354
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,890
She finally quit, right?

355
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,020
I knew it!

356
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,940
When she came to get
a sandwich for Noh Gojin,

357
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,440
I threw in a ton of onions.

358
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,950
Jeez.

359
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,070
No. She's on vacation.

360
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,910
-Vacation?
-Yup.

361
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,410
Mr. Noh Manners let her take days off?

362
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,960
No way.

363
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,170
Well, I don't know the details.

364
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,130
He probably let her take days off
because he was on vacation too.

365
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,170
What?

366
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,630
Mr. Noh Manners definitely
is not the type to do that.

367
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,640
Is he on his last leg?

368
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,260
-What?
-As if.

369
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,310
Not at all.

370
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,940
But where's the other one?

371
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,730
Sora?

372
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,940
She's probably busy studying.

373
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:09,150
She has no time because she's also
working as a water purifier coordinator.

374
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,410
I see. Then…

375
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,580
I'll get going now.

376
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,460
Okay. Bye, ma'am.

377
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,670
-What's going on?
-Vacation?

378
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,540
Go where? Go on vacation?

379
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,510
TAXI

380
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,600
Oh, come on.
The chairwoman will be here soon.

381
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,230
Excuse me, you can't park here.

382
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,940
Move out of the way. Hurry up.

383
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,570
-Should I move out of the way too?
-Hello.

384
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,280
Chairwoman?

385
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,950
Why is it that… you came here in a taxi?

386
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,910
Why not? Am I not allowed to ride taxis?

387
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,750
INAUGURAL CEREMONY
FOR CHAIRWOMAN OF GUNIL FOUNDATION

388
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,710
How did his youngest daughter
become the new chairwoman?

389
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,010
He's quite well-known
for putting aside his daughters.

390
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,510
Because his son is a dumbhead.

391
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,010
And I hear the chairwoman is divorced.

392
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:18,930
Divorced?

393
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,850
It happened a while ago,
and she came back to Korea recently.

394
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,980
I see. I had no idea.

395
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,780
Also, It seems she's serious
about diving into the education industry.

396
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,820
It's not just the foundation,

397
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,950
she also took over
Eutteum School in Seoul.

398
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,620
Really?

399
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:40,950
We will now begin the inauguration
of Gunil Foundation's new chairwoman.

400
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:45,880
Please welcome her
with a warm round of applause.

401
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,550
GUNIL FOUNDATION

402
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,150
It's nice to meet you all.

403
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,730
It's quite the crowd that has shown up.

404
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,070
The Superintendent of Education,

405
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,740
members of the National Assembly,

406
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,990
professors, and students…

407
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,950
Thank you all for coming.

408
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,540
To be honest…

409
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,380
I'm a very shy person,

410
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:31,170
so I declined to hold such a big ceremony.

411
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,970
But after hearing the president
had been hospitalized,

412
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,720
here I wound up.

413
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:38,930
Now that I'm here,

414
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:43,100
I thought it'd be rude of me
not to properly introduce myself.

415
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:46,390
But…

416
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,980
I was so nervous,
I drank two bottles of cheongsimhwan.

417
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:58,490
However, I am quite excited now.

418
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,780
It's been 12 years
since I have last visited Korea.

419
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,160
And out of all the places,
I'm here in Gangneung.

420
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,670
Since I was little,

421
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,130
Gangneung was my grandmother's hometown.

422
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,460
Nobody loved her hometown
more than my grandmother had.

423
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,800
And 30 years ago,

424
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,930
she founded
a private school foundation here.

425
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:25,640
She wanted to provide the best environment
for getting an education

426
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:29,980
to the residents of Gangwon Province
by setting up Baekga University.

427
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,690
Following in my grandmother's footsteps,

428
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:36,820
I dedicate myself to making our
foundation the best in Korea--

429
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:42,200
No… the best in the world
as a leader of the education industry.

430
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,870
I look forward to working with all of you.

431
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,330
Thank you.

432
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,000
I'm Baek Sooyeong.

433
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,930
Thank you.

434
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,520
We'll bring your bags to your room.

435
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,850
Thank you.

436
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,150
Oh, no!

437
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,420
I'm so sorry.

438
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,920
No, it's okay. I didn't see you either.

439
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,550
Hold on.

440
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,430
I don't know which one you should wear.

441
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:31,480
I'm really fine.
I can just clean this with a wet wipe.

442
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,150
No way. It was my fault.

443
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:36,860
I feel awful to let you just go.

444
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,480
I'm really fine.

445
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,700
I only brought suits on this trip…

446
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,420
What is it?

447
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,300
Is there something on my face?

448
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,630
No. It's not that.

449
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:06,050
Are you… an actress?

450
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,640
No.

451
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,640
Oh, I'm sorry. You're just so pretty.

452
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,270
Thank you.

453
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,730
I feel so flattered.

454
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,940
Wait.

455
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,870
This is perfect for you.

456
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:35,370
And it goes well
with the sneakers you were wearing.

457
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,960
What do you think?

458
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,920
Well…

459
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:45,760
You look great in that dress!

460
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,350
You remind me of myself in my twenties.

461
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:54,890
This dress…

462
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,480
My first love bought it for me.

463
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,610
Are you sure I can wear this?

464
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:03,980
It's fine. I'm actually happy
to be able to lend you a dress

465
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,030
that's dear to my heart.

466
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,280
I get the feeling

467
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,620
that you're a very nice person.

468
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,080
Thank you.

469
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,580
-Don't be, it was my fault.
-No, not at all.

470
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,460
Then how should I return this dress?

471
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,960
Well, I'll be here for a few more days.

472
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:26,760
You can leave it
at the hotel desk once you're done.

473
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,140
Okay. By the way, your name…

474
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,970
Sooyeong. My name is Baek Sooyeong.

475
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,520
Baek Sooyeong. Got it.

476
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,620
This wasn't a simple traffic accident.

477
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:06,340
NO ENTRY

478
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:21,900
How meticulous.
The dashcam was wrecked too.

479
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:25,690
Sir, please take a look at this.

480
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,650
A claw hammer?

481
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:29,950
Right. I think there was a scuffle inside.

482
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,740
There are some blood stains on it.

483
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,990
I knew it. It was planned.

484
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,620
And this.

485
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:37,750
What is it?

486
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,750
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

487
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,790
-A letter of resignation?
-Yes.

488
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,420
I think we can start from there.

489
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,880
Yes, sir.

490
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:41,230
Mr. Oh, you must be very tired.

491
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,810
A bit.

492
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,060
Right! Do you want to talk to Mr. Noh?

493
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,940
Gosh, no. If I call him, he'll fire me.

494
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,320
-Pardon?
-He warned me

495
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,410
not to call him on his vacation.

496
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:55,950
I see.

497
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,740
Gosh. We should get some sleep too.

498
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,660
We've been having meetings back-to-back.

499
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,790
Yes. Actually, my mind is going blank.

500
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,790
Good work.

501
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,710
Thank you.

502
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,250
He looks like
such an innocent kid when he sleeps.

503
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,420
Right, Mr. Oh.

504
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,720
I need to tell him about the accident.

505
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,180
MR. OH SEGI

506
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,650
MR. OH…

507
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:13,110
No. He'll be so shocked.

508
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:16,030
He won't be able to come
since he's in the States.

509
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,490
He would just be worried.

510
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,630
Hello?

511
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,550
Is this Ms. Lee Sina?

512
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,470
Yes.

513
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,100
I'm calling from Gwangae Hospital.

514
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:45,220
Ms. Lee, you must get admitted right away.

515
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,350
I understand this is difficult for you,

516
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:49,480
but you must start your treatment
as soon as possible.

517
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,070
You should prepare yourself.

518
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:54,650
You're at the final stage.

519
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:58,570
Hello?

520
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,200
Hello? Ms. Lee?

521
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:03,780
Ms. Lee?

522
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,870
Ms. Lee! Hello?

523
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,370
What am I doing here?

524
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:56,040
You're out of your mind. You're crazy.

525
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,300
You're dying because of him,

526
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,050
yet just to save this guy, I…

527
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,340
Seriously. You're an idiot.

528
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,760
Jeez, such an idiot!

529
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,020
It's not like I hit you with my car.

530
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:17,730
Why did you come after me?

531
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:21,150
You got hit
because of that nasty temper of yours!

532
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:22,820
So I didn't do…

533
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,990
anything wrong.

534
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:27,620
And besides…

535
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,330
you won't die.

536
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,860
ENTRANCE

537
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,410
EXIT

538
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,600
Are you Ms. Lee Sina?

539
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,480
Yes, I am. Who are you?

540
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,940
-We're from the police.
-The police?

541
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:46,110
We followed you here from the hospital.

542
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:48,700
We need you to accompany us to the station

543
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,780
as a witness
to Mr. Noh Gojin's hit-and-run accident.

544
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,160
Jeez, I said it wasn't me!

545
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:56,790
-Let's go.
-You have no evidence!

546
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:58,080
-Ms. Lee?
-Let go of me!

547
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,750
-Follow us.
-Jeez!

548
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,840
-Ms. Lee!
-Yes?

549
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,430
So you're saying
that someone did a hit-and-run?

550
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,840
Yes.

551
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:10,180
Do you think you can catch the driver?

552
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,810
As long as you answer my questions,

553
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:13,970
we'll catch the driver.

554
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:15,180
Okay.

555
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:17,770
Why did you go to his vacation house?

556
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,980
It was pretty late.

557
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:24,780
Well… I had to take care of something.

558
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,990
You mean this?

559
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,950
You rented a car, right?

560
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,500
A black SUV.

561
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,210
-Yes.
-You dented the car, right?

562
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,670
Yes. I bumped into a streetlight.

563
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:43,800
A streetlight?

564
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:46,300
Okay, fine.

565
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:50,720
But what do you think about the fact

566
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:55,350
that the car that hit Mr. Noh and fled
is the same model

567
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,350
as the car you rented?

568
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,150
What are you talking about…

569
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,730
Are you implying
I hit Mr. Noh with my car?

570
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,490
No! Never!

571
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,320
Why would I? Why would I want to hurt him?

572
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,820
Then why did you bring
the claw hammer to his vacation house?

573
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:15,870
You had a fight with Mr. Noh, correct?

574
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:19,000
You planned to hurt Mr. Noh
from the get-go, didn't you?

575
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,210
So after hitting him, you returned

576
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,830
to stage it as if it were a hit-and-run!

577
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,210
No! I didn't hit Mr. Noh with my car!

578
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,630
GOPUM LAW OFFICE

579
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,430
Yes, this is the lawyer's office.

580
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,550
Oh, yes. I remember.

581
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:36,930
I'll be available at 2 p.m. next Tuesday.

582
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:39,350
Yes. Okay.

583
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:40,980
LEGAL ADVICE WILL INCUR A FEE

584
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:48,070
SINA

585
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:57,410
Hey! You made such a mess
in the bathroom. How dare you…

586
00:58:58,950 --> 00:58:59,960
What?

587
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,500
Gangneung Police Station?

588
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:07,750
Why is he staring at me?

589
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,260
It really wasn't me!

590
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,640
I really didn't do it! I'm not the driver!

591
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,800
Please let me out! Please!

592
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:16,930
-Lee Sina!
-Please…

593
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,600
Okhee!

594
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,440
No. Don't talk first.

595
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:31,320
I'll be representing Ms. Lee Sina.

596
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:33,910
So you can talk to me.

597
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,620
Around 1:40 a.m. today,

598
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:42,210
Mr. Noh Gojin was hit by a black SUV

599
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:46,630
ㅁnd Ms. Lee Sina, his secretary,
is our prime suspect.

600
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,010
No.

601
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,050
It really wasn't me!

602
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:56,510
Then why did you go
to his vacation house at that late hour?

603
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,850
You even brought a claw hammer!

604
00:59:57,930 --> 00:59:58,760
A claw hammer?

605
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:03,980
Did you finally kill Mr. Noh Manners?

606
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:05,730
No! Jeez.

607
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:10,480
Once Mr. Noh wakes up,
the truth will be revealed.

608
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:12,440
I really didn't hit him with my car!

609
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,660
Ms. Lee, don't try to stall time.

610
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:18,950
And we have evidence.

611
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:20,490
Bring me the dashcam.

612
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:23,210
The dashcam?

613
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:52,280
Gosh. It really wasn't me!

614
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:55,490
Then tell us
why you went to his vacation house!

615
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,620
Why can't you tell us?

616
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,250
Why did you go there? Answer my question!

617
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:13,260
INCOMING CALL

618
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,390
You may answer it.

619
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,020
Hello?

620
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,610
You need to come right away.

621
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,440
Mr. Noh Gojin woke up.

622
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:36,490
He woke up?

623
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,200
He woke up!

624
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,200
GANGNEUNG MEDICAL CENTER

625
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:52,670
Pardon me.

626
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,460
You should meet with his doctor first.

627
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,360
It's all right, doctor. Go on.

628
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,610
NEUROSURGEON, DR. YOO JAEHO

629
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:17,780
Mr. Noh is really awake, right?

630
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:19,740
Yes.

631
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,160
He's going to clear up
this misunderstanding now.

632
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:27,910
Can we go see him now?

633
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Before you do,
there's something you must know.

634
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,540
What is it?

635
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,050
About the state he's in now.

636
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:37,510
The state he's in?

637
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,380
How is he?

638
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:42,550
Mr. Noh Gojin…

639
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,930
Yes?

640
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,610
He has amnesia.

641
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,330
What… did you say?

642
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,380
Mr. Noh Gojin…

643
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:15,460
has amnesia.

644
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,340
Did you just say amnesia?

645
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:22,720
Are you talking about the thing
that shows up in dramas all the time?

646
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,140
Yes.

647
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:34,400
What?

648
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,400
I'm sorry.

649
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,570
It's just,
what you said was so ridiculous.

650
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,240
It's serious.

651
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,820
No way. How could that happen?

652
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:47,370
You said you took
all the scans for his head.

653
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:50,450
You said it was just a cut
on his forehead, nothing else.

654
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,210
I told you he has a unique constitution

655
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:54,370
where he doesn't feel
any effect of anesthetics, right?

656
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:57,670
That hurts.

657
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,250
What's with him?

658
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:01,720
It hurts.

659
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,300
Please check on his anesthetic level.

660
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,890
His body was under anesthesia,

661
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:10,720
but his mind was awake,
so he was aware of the whole surgery.

662
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:14,100
And in that process,
he had developed a trauma.

663
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,110
My opinion is

664
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:19,270
that this is temporary amnesia

665
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,480
caused as a side effect
of going under anesthesia.

666
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:24,530
He really can't remember anything?

667
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,070
No.

668
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,950
Does he not even know who I--

669
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,490
Probably not.

670
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,540
-Then.…
-Seriously, what on earth--

671
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:38,590
Stop right there!

672
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:40,550
that means…

673
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,260
he forgot everything
that happened that night.

674
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,510
-You're dead meat.
-Hey!

675
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,430
No!

676
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,140
He can't…

677
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:56,350
He can't forget what happened that night!

678
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,900
It was… It was the first time…

679
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:01,070
I got back at him!

680
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,110
Please, calm down.

681
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,700
I know that this is hard to believe.

682
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:16,500
I need to discuss
his condition with his family.

683
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:19,500
Does he really not have any family?

684
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,670
Are you listening?

685
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,590
Hey.

686
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,700
WEDDING INDUSTRY SUFFERS
WHILE SMALL AND DIY WEDDINGS PROCEED?

687
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,080
WEDDING INDUSTRY IN DOOM

688
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,500
Are you sure there's no family?

689
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:07,420
Not even a distant relative?

690
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:14,850
No.

691
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,140
There is.

692
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:19,390
Who is it?

693
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,480
He has a fiancée.

694
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:23,230
A fiancée?

695
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:25,860
Then please tell her to come right away.

696
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,450
You're looking at her.

697
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:37,080
I'm Mr. Noh Gojin's

698
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:39,040
fiancée.

699
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:29,630
