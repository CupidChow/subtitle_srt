EPISODE 1

5
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,770
THE SMILE ANGEL

6
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,730
COOL GOJIN

7
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,580
Oh, my. I'm so anxious.

8
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,580
Anyway, where is this boy?

9
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,120
Son, here! Over here!

10
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,630
-Gosh, what took you so long?
-Ow.

11
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,340
At least he came. He's better than my son.

12
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,170
There really are a lot of people, though!

13
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,840
Gosh, do you think
the fan signing will get canceled?

14
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,680
Last time, it got canceled too
because there were too many people.

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,850
That's what I'm saying.

16
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,810
And I wanted to get him
these wild pine mushrooms.

17
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,770
Oh, my! Seriously!

18
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,900
-What?
-What is he doing?

19
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,400
Hey, you!

20
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,400
Why isn't he getting out of line?
There's a line!

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,990
-We're all standing in line!
-You're going to be in trouble!

22
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,830
-Hey.
-What the heck?

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,960
Excuse me!

24
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,920
-What's with him?
-Don't you see the people in line?

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,260
Is he trying to cut the line?

26
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,130
Hey, why are you trying to cut the line?

27
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,300
We've been standing here
since early morning!

28
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,140
Why is he cutting?

29
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,470
-Oh, come on!
-Who is that guy?

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,640
Hey! Why are you trying to cut the line?

31
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,520
Get in line! The line!

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,360
-Yes! Get in line!
-Get back!

33
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,940
Didn't you all…

34
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,570
come to see me?

35
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,780
YOU'RE MINE

36
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,030
-What is he talking about?
-He should be in line…

37
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,970
It's Noh Gojin!

38
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,590
-What?
-That's him?

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,590
Is it really Noh Gojin?

40
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,510
That's right!

41
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I am Noh Gojin!

42
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,780
I LOVE YOU

45

-Noh Gojin!
-Noh Gojin!

46
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,970
Is math difficult?

47
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,220
-Yes.
-Yes.

48
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,770
Don't worry.

49
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,350
You have me.

SPECIAL LECTURE SIGNING EVENT

54
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,670
The train is now approaching.

55
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,670
Mind the gap
between the train and the platform

56
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,430
as you get on and off the train.

57
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,280
-Hello.
-Hello.

58
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,690
For Mr. Noh Gojin, please.

59
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,780
-One moment, please.
-Okay.

60
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,450
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

61
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,990
Thank you. Have a nice day.

62
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,670
Thank you.

63
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,130
One triple-shot Americano, please.

64
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,210
Okay.

65
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,470
Here you go.

66
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,560
Thank you.

67
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,940
Hello. Please, make it whole wheat bread.

68
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,770
Hot chili and mustard sauce.
Two slices of cheese. Lots of pickles.

69
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,150
And make sure absolutely no onions.

Guys, what are you looking at?

78
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,730
Eyes only on me.

79
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,850
I'm the best instructor in Korea.

80
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,520
Who's the best social studies instructor?

81
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,530
Gong Heechul! Ahem!

82
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,700
Do English like me and it's easy!

83
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,530
Even easier than a piece of cake!

84
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,120
I, Michelle Lee,
will spoon-feed it to you.

85
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,630

I'll take care of your English--

91
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,680
Achoo!

92
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
Hey.

93
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,360
Go away, you fakes.

94
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,530
The real deal of Korean is here.

95
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,530
Is grammar frustrating?

96
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,110
I, Kim Chabae, am the real deal.
Just follow me.

97
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,020
There are only two ways
you can choose to deal with math.

98
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,850
The first one is to give up.

99
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,650
The other…

100
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,400
is to take my course.

101
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,070
The choice is yours.

102
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,190
But the result…

103
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,530
may be fatal.

104
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,500
What are you staring blankly at?

105
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,750
You seem to have
a lot of time on your hands.

108
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,470
Five minutes.

109
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,930
The entrance.

110
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,590
The elevator.

111
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
The hallway.

112
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
The office.

113
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,390
Three.

114
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,310
Two.

115
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,600
One.

116
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,810
Hello, sir.

117
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,570
Fifty…

118
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,570
What would this be?

119
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,160
Pardon?

120
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,090
I… told them to take out the onions.

121
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,400
Do you know what kind of people
annoys me the most in the world?

122
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,190
People who don't do their job right

123
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,110
but still take their salary without fail.

124
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,950
They're parasites
who only grub money from me.

TYLENOM

126
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,840
Could you tell Mr. Noh…

127
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
Weren't you an intern?

128
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,680
Yes.

129
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,020
Right? Weren't you
an admin assistant for my team?

130
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,690
No wonder you looked familiar.

131
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,400
I always remember our team's interns.

132
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,650
I didn't know you worked here.

133
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,400
Mr. Noh's secretary?

134
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,940
-Yes.
-How long? A month?

135
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,780
-No.
-Three months?

136
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,740
I've been here longer.

137
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,080
Longer than three months?
You're pulling my leg.

138
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,450
No secretary of his has ever
lasted longer than three months.

139
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,210
Are you serious?

140
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,130
No way. Everyone quit in tears.

141
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,710
What a miracle. Ms. Lee…

142
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,970
Ms. Lee Sinyoung,
you're one miraculous secretary!

143
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,640
You're Guinness World Records worthy.

144
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,100
-My name isn't Lee Sinyoung--
-Please let Mr. Noh know that I'm here.

145
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,940
Sir, Mr. Kang Min is here to see you.

146
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,070
CELEBRITIES INVESTIGATED
FOR ILLEGAL GAMBLING OVERSEAS

147
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Sir.

148
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,030
It was an innocent hobby. A hobby.

149
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,370
You went abroad…

150
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,670
for a mere hobby then?

151
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,290
I went abroad on a trip

152
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,920
and just went there for a little fun.

153
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,380
I went to the police station

154
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,220
and testified that it was only
an innocent hobby, nothing else.

155
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,850
I knew it.

156
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,360
I knew you'd understand me, sir.

157
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,110
The deputy CEO can be a bit uptight.

158
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,450
No matter how much I explained,
he kept saying frustrating things

159
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,070
like taking time off to repent.

160
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,200
He said I should go on a break
for a year, you know?

161
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,870
Gosh, that's frustrating indeed.

162
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,830
Right?

163
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,500
I even got
a very long apology letter ready.

164
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,380
I put my soul into writing it.

165
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,460
Come on in.

166
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,090
Is someone joining us?

167
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,890
Did you call me, sir?

168
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,350
Get me the envelope over there.

169
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,730
Envelope?

170
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,780
You may go now.

171
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,500
What is this, sir?

172
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,080
-Sign it.
-Sign it?

173
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,000
I see. Sign a letter of oath?

174
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,380
Of course I will.

175
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,300
I'll never gamble in my life again
or something like that, right?

176
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,180
"Contract termination agreement.

177
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,310
Based on the terms of the contract term--"

178
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,520
Sir, are you abandoning me now?

179
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,690
Sign it.

180
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,400
Sir… have you already forgotten?

181
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,910
I'm one of the founding members of Gotop.

182
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,530
I'm the top English instructor
who helped you build up Gotop this much!

183
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,370
I said, sign it.

184
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,500
Sir, why are you doing this to me?

185
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,670
Don't you know who I am? I'm Kang Min.

186
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,460
I'm Kang Min, the English instructor

187
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,210
who can even teach a dog
to speak English in one month!

188
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,890
Jeez, you really are dense.

189
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,390
Can't you figure it out
when I tell you to do something?

190
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,610
Do you think

191
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,900
I'm kicking you out because of gambling?

192
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,610
Gambling?

193
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,160
That isn't that big of a deal. Hey.

194
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,660
As long as you make money,

195
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,290
I wouldn't dismiss you
even if you committed murder.

196
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,120
-Then--
-Then why?

197
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,510
Because you're a useless piece of trash
who only gambles around.

198
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,010
The top instructor? When was that?

199
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,050
You're a thing of the past.

200
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,970
I don't value things
that don't make me money.

201
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,650
I ought to dispose of garbage
into a garbage can properly.

202
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,480
Holding onto it

203
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,570
will only cause it to reek.

204
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,070
Noh Gojin,

205
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,410
you scumbag.

206
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,780
I brought in so much money
for this company.

207
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,490
The money I made
allowed you to build this building.

208
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
But what?

209
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,750
I'm not the top instructor anymore?

210
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,590
I don't bring you enough money now,
so you treat me like garbage?

211
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,840
That's how the world works.

212
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,590
Once proven useless, you get eliminated

213
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,220
and disposed.

214
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,100
Got it?

215
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,430
Don't be an amateur.

216
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,180
You scumbag!

217
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,400
One more thing. I get that you're upset,
but let's get one thing straight.

218
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,570
I built this building

219
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,940
all on my own.

220
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,400
I'm the top of the top instructors
in Korea.

221
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,870
I, Noh Gojin, did it. Okay?

222
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,500
I'm going to kill you!

223
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,370
Noh Gojin, you scumbag!

224
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,210
Let go! I said, let go of me!

225
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,790
I'm going to kill you!

226
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,460
Die! Damn you.

227
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,670
Noh Gojin, you scumbag!

228
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Let go of me!

229
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,100
Get this cleaned up.

230
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,070
Come on. Let go of me.

231
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,570
Please listen. You know who I am, right?

232
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,160
Look at me. I'm Kang Min.

233
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,280
That lunatic. I'm going to kill him!

234
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,280
Let go!

235
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,830
Noh Gojin, you scumbag!
I'm going to kill you.

236
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,790
Let go. Let go of me, you lunatics!

237
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,250
Let go of me!

238
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,000
Noh Gojin, you lunatic.
I'm going to kill you!

239
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,010
RECIPIENT: NOH GOJIN

240
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,530
As of today, Mr. Kang Min has been
dismissed from Gotop Education.

241
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,700
-Really?
-Are you serious?

242
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,160
I thought you deserve to know clearly
why he was dismissed.

243
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,090
He was let go,
not because of his gambling,

244
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,750
but his performance.

245
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,510
It was because of his performance.

246
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,890
Mr. Kim Chabae,

247
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,470
I heard you've been working all night.

248
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,890
Yes, sir. I've been working day and night

249
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,350
to serve you and the company

250
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,850
with all of my energy.

251
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,280
That's not something to be proud of.

252
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,900
You're practically advertising
that you're really dumb.

253
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,120
I should've just slept.

254
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,330
Ms. Michelle Lee, when will you break
the 10-billion-won mark in sales?

255
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:36,250
You know exactly how much I paid
to break your contract with Ilpum Edu.

256
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,130
That's 13 billion won.

257
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,300
PLUS PACKAGE SALES STATUS

258
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,090
Graphs are so great.

259
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,100
Anyone can understand them so easily.

260
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,890
This isn't some
buy-one-get-one-free snack deal.

261
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,600
When will you start pulling your weight?

262
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,900
Apparently, a social studies instructor,

263
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,280
whom no one has heard of,
is causing a sensation.

264
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,070
I came across
such a messed-up news article.

265
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,780
How dare they, when Mr. Gong Heechul here
is the best social studies instructor.

266
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,580
Jeez, don't you know
they are fishing for some traction?

267
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,960
Right?

268
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,380
Those new academies these days

269
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,760
always put my name in
to promote their own instructors.

270
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,050
You should be thanking me, sir.
It's free promotion for Gotop, you know?

271
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,640
I can promote the company
just fine on my own.

272
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,510
Besides, money doesn't lie.

273
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,190
If our sales were to drop even a tiny bit,

274
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,570
I'd really like to know
the name of that instructor.

275
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,400
Right.

276
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,320
The best instructor is
the one with the highest profits.

277
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,830
Your value today must go up
even by 100 won compared to yesterday,

278
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,330
if you want to survive
here at Gotop Education.

279
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Also…

280
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,050
-Mr. Oh!
-Deputy CEO!

281
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,300
Mr. Oh, you're here.

282
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,320
RECIPIENT: NOH GOJIN

283
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,500
I put a package on your desk.

284
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,620
-Hello.
-Hello.

285
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,580
You know…

286
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,800
Are you going to have some tea?

287
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,260
If it's for me, I'm good, sir.

288
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,810
It's just us here. Drop the honorifics.

289
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,470
We're at work, sir.

290
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,140
Enough already.

291
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,570
I'll take care of Mr. Kang's dismissal,
so nothing backfires.

292
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,190
Okay.

293
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,860
In that case,

294
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,700
let's grab dinner tonight.

295
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,830
I'm sorry, sir.

296
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,700
I have an important appointment today.

297
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,040
I apologize.

298
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,040
You have plans today?

299
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,290
Yes.

300
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,380
Okay, then.

301
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,680
-You may go now.
-Okay. Thank you.

302
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,230
He has plans?

303
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,810
He forgot about my birthday?

304
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,110
Goddamn birthday.

305
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,570
Who cares about birthdays anyway?

306
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,860
The most childish thing in the world

307
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,370
is blowing out candles on birthdays
and making a huge scene out of it.

308
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,080
Ta-da!

309
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,920
Happy birthday to you

310
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,630
Happy birthday, my dear brother Gojin
Happy birthday to you

311
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,010
Gojin, happy birthday.

312
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,560
What is this? How childish.

313
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,320
Gojin, I'm really sorry
that I can't have dinner with you today.

314
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,360
I know it's just you.

315
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,870
Birthdays are overrated.

316
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,740
Gosh, I don't even like cake.

317
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,410
Come on. Have some.

318
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,330
No peaches in it, right?

319
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:50,050
Who else but me would know
that you're allergic to peaches?

320
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,590
Of course not. Don't worry and eat.

321
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,720
Does it taste good?

322
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,720
Not bad.

323
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,230
Gojin, can you give Mr. Kang

324
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,400
another chance?

325
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,150
I thought you would take care of it.

326
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,650
That was the deputy CEO
of Gotop Education speaking.

327
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:19,870
But I'm asking you now…
as your one and only brother.

328
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,790
I don't have to tell you

329
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,830
how important you are to me. Right?

330
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,880
Without you, there would be
no Gotop Education or me.

331
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,340
So I take your word for it
when it comes to most things. However…

332
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,800
not Kang Min.

333
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,180
That punk has already crossed the line.

334
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,280
Oh, right. Are you really going
to do the special lecture?

335
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,620
To be honest, I'm against it.

336
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,580
You'll be doing it with Mr. Park
who ruined your life.

337
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,620
That's why I'm doing it,
so I can see that jerk's face.

338
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,460
GOTOP EDUCATION CEO NOH GOJIN

339
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,560
What is it?

340
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,390
What?

341
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,020
It's nothing. It's something I ordered.

342
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,780
When did you say
you were going to the States?

343
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,110
On the 24th. I'll be gone for five days.

344
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,910
-That's pretty long.
-Gosh, tell me about it.

345
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,830
I'll be having three meetings
with Mos Company.

346
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,620
This is our first step
into the American market.

347
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,870
We ought to be careful.

348
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Oh, right. And Eutteum School was
acquired by Gunil Group.

349
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,880
Darn it.

350
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,970
Why are the conglomerates
getting into our industry?

351
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,680
What do you plan to do on your vacation?
Going to Gangneung again?

352
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,470
Don't just stay in your vacation house
and get around.

353
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,720
The beaches in Gangneung
are really nice, you know.

354
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,730
Don't worry about me.

355
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,310
I'll be spending
a romantic time with my girlfriend.

356
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,560
-You don't have a girlfriend.
-I do.

357
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,900
I'll go right after the special lecture

358
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,490
and spend an amazing time
with my girlfriend. So don't you dare

359
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,910
call me from the States.

360
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,160
Yes, sir. I won't.

361
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,290
I can't believe I'm using
last year's summer vacation days now.

362
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,620
But can you reconsider
the special lecture--

363
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,370
Gosh, seriously. There you go again.

364
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,250
Stop that nonsense
and just get back to work.

365
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,630
Oh, Gojin.

366
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,640
Happy birthday.

367
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,910
WRITING THIS WITH MY BLOOD NOW
YOUR BLOOD NEXT TIME

368
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,290
YOU SCUMBAG!
YOU MAKE ME WANT TO VOMIT

369
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,080
NOH GOJIN, I HOPE YOU DIE

370
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,000
It's obvious

371
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,380
that this punk has no life.

372
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,600
How cute.

373
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,450
Here is your sandwich, ma'am.

374
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,080
What?

375
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,370
This is ham and cheese.

376
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,460
Where's the beef special?

377
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,960
Well, it was sold out.

378
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,760
I'll go earlier next time. I'm sorry.

379
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,140
I see. There is no need for that.

380
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,560
Next time, just quit.

381
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,270
The fact that you stayed
this long assisting our CEO

382
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,020
is a tragedy.

383
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,940
A tragedy.

384
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,370
You eat it.

385
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,960
1 YEAR!

386
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,330
Pack your things.

387
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,390
If this is all you can do, just quit!

388
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,400
Run now. This is hell.

389
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,900
Not even Hades would put up with this!

390
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,420
No.

391
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,670
I put up with it.

392
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,500
I gave it my all and put up with it.

393
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,300
1 YEAR!

394
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,220
I put up with it for a year.

395
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,470
I'm so proud of you, Lee Sina!

396
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,170
Happy birthday indeed.

397
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,090
What are you doing over there?

398
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,890
-Hurry. Come on.
-Let's run.

399
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,310
-Darn it.
-Hurry.

400
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,930
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

401
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,690
-Come on. Let's go.
-There.

402
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:26,770
-Hurry.
-No, that way.

403
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,820
My condolences.

404
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,880
Mr. Oh.

405
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,550
Are you going home now?

406
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,510
Yes.

407
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,100
Ms. Lee,

408
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,350
can we talk for a moment?

409
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,770
Well… Okay.

410
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,900
Ta-da! Ms. Lee, congratulations
on your one-year work anniversary!

411
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,070
How… did you know?

412
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,700
Mr. Noh asked me to give this to you.

413
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,330
I'm sure he knows too.

414
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,960
Thank you so much for your hard work.

415
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,420
Thank you.

416
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,380
And this.

417
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,340
A small bonus for your vacation funds.

418
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:37,880
Vacation funds?

419
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:41,180
You should take some days off
while Mr. Noh is on vacation, Ms. Lee.

420
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,390
You didn't get off
summer vacation last year either.

421
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,270
Well…

422
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,600
Thank you.

423
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,980
Also… don't give up on your dream

424
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,400
of becoming an instructor.

425
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,990
Wherever you are

426
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,490
or whatever you may be doing,

427
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,030
as long as
you don't give up on your dream,

428
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,290
your dream will come true in the end.

429
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,290
I'll let you know if there's an opening.

430
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,330
Okay. Thank you.

431
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,630
This is going to taste great

432
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,300
Let's eat.

433
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,260
What's that?

434
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,860
Why did you buy flowers?

435
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,860
I didn't. They were a gift.

436
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,860
From whom?

437
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,740
My angel.

438
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,030
"My angel"?

439
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,120
Your crush, the deputy CEO?
Did he ask you out?

440
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,700
No, it's not like that.

441
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,330
Then why are you blushing?

442
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,580
I'm not blushing.

443
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,000
If he didn't ask you out,
why did he give you flowers?

444
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,550
For my one-year work anniversary.

445
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,050
He thanked me for my work.

446
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,880
Jeez, that's all?

447
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,510
Okhee, it's finally been a year for me.

448
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,810
I put up working
as Mr. Noh Manners' secretary for a year!

449
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,850
I'll have a chance to apply
if there's an opening!

450
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,100
My dad was right.

451
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,650
"Good things come to those who wait."

452
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,860
Hey. Wait another year
and you'll become a druggie.

453
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,400
Go get a head CT.

454
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,200
You've been
constantly taking headache pills.

455
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,820
Gosh, you nag so much.

456
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,870
I already booked an appointment.

457
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,500
He really is an angel without wings.

458
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,960
How did he even remember this?

459
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,210
All of his secretaries quit.

460
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,000
No one has lasted three months
under that jerk,

461
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,550
but you lasted a year.

462
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,130
He must be so grateful
to have a pushover like you.

463
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,590
But he's terrible at giving gifts.

464
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,970
You're losing hair
and suffering from shingles,

465
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,760
chronic migraines, and indigestion.

466
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,850
You had to take a fistful of pills.

467
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:54,640
Flowers? He should've bought you
some ribeye steak.

468
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,690
-You get out.
-Jeez, I just meant…

469
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,690
-Get out.
-Don't push. It's dangerous. Gosh!

470
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,620
“Don't give up on your dream
of becoming an instructor.”

471
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,670
Gosh, he's so cool.

472
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,890
MR. NOH GOJIN, MR. PARK YANGTAE
ROOTING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION

473
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:49,740
It's been a while
since I've been back to my alma mater.

474
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,370
-Hello.
-Hello. Welcome.

475
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,290
It's been so long.

476
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,040
-Thank you for inviting me.
-Welcome.

477
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,590
Nice to meet you.

478
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,760
Is that…

479
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,990
Welcome.

480
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,910
The two best instructors
from the private education sector,

481
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,330
Mr. Noh Gojin of Gotop Education

482
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,420
and Mr. Park Yangtae of Ilpum Edu.

483
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,590
I'm so happy to have you both here.

484
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,340
The two best instructors?

485
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,510
You're going to give people
the wrong idea.

486
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,600
Ilpum Edu has
a long history and tradition.

487
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,930
How could it be compared
to Gotop with no roots?

488
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,850
You sure are funny.

489
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,810
Shall we go inside?

490
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,230
What's wrong?

491
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,820
Number one…

492
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,320
shouldn't walk side by side
with lowly number two.

493
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,130
He's so annoying.

494
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,340
You think you're a movie star? Jeez.

495
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,890
What a great world we live in now.

496
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,940
How did a lowlife janitor
without any class

497
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,730
get to give a lecture
at the most prestigious university?

498
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,650
Don't you agree, Mr. Noh?

499
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,020
CEO PARK YANGTAE

500
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,690
What are you doing?

501
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
Hey!

502
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,570
Why are you scribbling on my board?

503
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:22,910
Wait.

504
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:32,920
Did you…

505
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,050
solve this?

506
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,220
Really?

507
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:44,680
It wasn't even that hard.

508
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,640
Fine. I'll erase it.

509
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,410
You're right.

510
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:03,450
I have you to thank, Mr. Park,
for helping a lowlife like me

511
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,620
become an instructor.

512
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,880
That's why I prepared
a nice surprise for you

513
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,290
as a token of my gratitude.

514
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,130
Please look forward to it.

515
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,800
That's a nice tie.

516
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,050
Is it made of gold foil?

517
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:29,020
What? What are you doing?

518
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,900
What the heck are you doing?

519
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:32,860
What was that?

520
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,320
Hey.

521
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,490
I was just wondering
if you had wings when you fell.

522
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,910
How does it feel to be number two?

523
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:45,830
What, you punk?

524
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,960
You can't get worked up already.

525
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,080
Once my lecture ends,

526
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,590
you're going to get humiliated
in front of the juniors.

527
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,760
-Why you--
-Oh, right.

528
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:00,680
Don't go on the Internet today.

529
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,010
You'll be too embarrassed to fall asleep.

530
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,680
Why you…

531
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:06,390
Hey!

532
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:08,980
Hey, Noh Gojin! Stop right there!

533
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,480
Hey!

534
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,990
Who are these two-bit thugs?

535
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,030
Do you have a death wish?

536
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,990
Darn you, Noh Gojin!
I'm going to kill you!

537
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,910
-Sir, please calm down.
-Noh Gojin! Hey!

538
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,410
Darn it. Let go of me!

539
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,880
NOH GOJIN, THE STAR LECTURER!
ROOTING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION

540
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,010
MR. NOH GOJIN, MR. PARK YANGTAE
SPECIAL GUEST LECTURE

541
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,930
CEO NOH GOJIN

542
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,060
Move aside.

543
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,600
Hey, where's the file for the big data?

544
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:56,360
You said you would bring it
after you check it yesterday.

545
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,150
Where did I put it?

546
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,490
Where is it? Where did I put it?

547
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,410
Oh, no! This is bad.

548
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:07,120
If you were the file, where would you be?

549
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,040
What? You said you would--

550
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,420
Forget it.
Mr. Noh is going to throw a fit.

551
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,170
I'm in trouble. What do I do?

552
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,090
Tell Ms. Lee to bring it.

553
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,720
But you don't know where it is.

554
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,680
Right. So tell Ms. Lee
to find it and bring it here.

555
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,510
As mentioned,

556
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,980
very special guests
have come to our school today.

557
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,020
Mr. Park Yangtae of Ilpum Edu

558
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,150
who represents
the private education sector

559
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:40,030
and the star instructor,
Mr. Noh Gojin of Gotop Education.

560
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,360
Let's give them a warm welcome.

561
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,240
MR. NOH GOJIN, MR. PARK YANGTAE
SPECIAL GUEST LECTURE

562
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,960
After listening
to their lectures for the youth,

563
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,340
we'll also have a Q and A session.

564
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:05,260
First, Mr. Park Yangtae
of Ilpum Edu will give his lecture.

565
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,520
Hello, I'm Park Yangtae,
the CEO of Ilpum Edu.

566
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:20,610
I feel so great and youthful again

567
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:24,070
standing here looking at you today.

568
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:29,200
I'm nervous and full of emotions
to be back at my alma mater

569
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,450
after so long…

570
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,330
My apologies.

571
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:37,500
Mr. Park.

572
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,050
I'm good.

573
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:44,630
Come on, Mr. Park.

574
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:46,590
Are you still upset?

575
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:55,560
Everyone,

576
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:58,440
earlier in the waiting room,

577
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,940
I pulled a small prank on Mr. Park.

578
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,610
My intention was
to get friendlier with Mr. Park,

579
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:07,740
but he seems to have been upset about it.

580
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,450
Mr. Park, I would like to apologize.

581
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,080
Please accept this water
as a token of my apology

582
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,370
and forgive me.

583
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,020
Did you spike it
with the strongest you could find?

584
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:36,980
Yes, sir.

585
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,320
Please drink up!

586
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:56,580
One more thing, everyone.

587
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:01,670
Please give a big round of applause
to Mr. Park once again.

588
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:02,670
Mr. Park…

589
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,170
will donate one billion won

590
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,800
to his alma mater for you guys!

591
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,760
One billion won?

592
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,560
THE LEGEND OF ADMISSIONS
CEO PARK YANGTAE

593
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:20,730
Gosh, he loves his juniors so much.

594
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,690
I'm so touched.

595
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,150
All right now,

596
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:31,030
why don't we listen
to the great Mr. Park's lecture now?

597
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,780
Sir,

598
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:37,040
you have my full attention.

599
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,840
It only feels like yesterday

600
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:53,640
I was sitting where you are sitting now.

601
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:58,600
I'm feeling so many things right now.

602
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:05,190
Today…

603
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,690
-Today…
-What's going on?

604
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:14,950
I'll be talking about the path
that the youth ought to take and…

605
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:22,000
the world of online classes…

606
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,380
you are curious about…

607
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,590
-Please excuse me.
-What?

608
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,800
-One moment.
-What's wrong with him?

609
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,850
Mr. Park must be feeling
a bit too nervous.

610
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,900
Perhaps… why don't I start then?

611
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:58,580
Oh, gosh.

612
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,660
Excuse me. Help!

613
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:03,120
It's urgent! Please!

614
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,020
Gosh.

615
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:53,090
Questions?

616
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:58,680
Any questions?

617
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:06,480
You with the glasses in the sixth row.

618
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,860
Is your IQ really 190?

619
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:16,030
I entered the Mega Society 14 years ago.

620
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,280
So it should be higher by now.

621
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:20,700
Next question.

622
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,410
Aren't you sick of teaching
the same CSAT Math every year?

623
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,670
I'm very sick of it.

624
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,710
And it's quite lame too.

625
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,750
-Then why do you do it?
-To make money.

626
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,010
What? Is that funny?

627
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,220
Yes, it's a bit disappointing.

628
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,890
-Why is that?
-You're a genius.

629
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,930
But you're doing it just for money.

630
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,400
Have you ever…

631
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,980
starved because you had no money?

632
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:59,070
-No.
-I have. I starved for a week

633
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,820
because I didn't have any money.

634
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,450
My parents killed themselves
because they were poor.

635
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,540
My grandma also died in pain

636
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,500
because she couldn't afford
to get her cancer treated in time.

637
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,250
And I, who was nine at the time…

638
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,470
could only watch her suffer and die.

639
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,390
I'm going to do
everything I can to make money.

640
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:32,480
I won't die doing manual labor
like William James Sidis

641
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,860
or of tuberculosis
like Srinivasa Ramanujan.

642
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,530
I…

643
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,360
do not want to die
a miserable death because of poverty.

644
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,120
ROOTING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION

645
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:59,470
My story was a bit somber, wasn't it?

646
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:03,640
But don't you feel

647
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:05,930
like we've become a bit closer now?

648
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:13,600
Yes. Giving a lecture wouldn't be any fun
without these gleaming eyes.

649
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:19,360
All right.
Let me start my real lecture now.

650
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,320
Please look over here.

651
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,530
SPECIAL GUEST LECTURE

652
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,790
Ms. Lee forgot the flash drive.

653
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,500
I'm sorry. I should've prepared it myself.

654
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,090
It's my fault.

655
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,970
Well…

656
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,310
My secretary forgot

657
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:52,770
the presentation…

658
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:07,780
Wait.

659
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:13,870
Does anyone here

660
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,710
want to be an instructor?

661
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,920
That's a lot of you.

662
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:26,430
But if you are one of these people,

663
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:30,680
you should give up that dream
right away. Because…

664
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,640
you'll never become an instructor.

665
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,230
Curious to find out who?

666
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,300
If you can't help prepare for others,

667
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,960
you can't help prepare
for yourself either. Why?

668
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,340
People like that

669
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:11,310
are mostly careless,
irresponsible, and lazy.

670
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:16,140
In the ever-changing battlefield
of the online education industry,

671
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:19,270
they will…

672
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,740
never become an instructor.

673
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:28,910
Or else, I'll eat my hat.

674
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,720
NOH GOJIN'S MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS

675
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,250
Gosh, my head hurts.

676
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:52,490
They will…

677
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,200
never become an instructor.

678
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:13,890
Don't give up on your dream
of becoming an instructor.

679
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:18,850
That's right. Don't give up, Lee Sina.

680
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,310
Don't you know who you are?

681
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,150
You're the miraculous secretary
who survived a year in this hell.

682
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,400
Be confident. That's right.

683
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,570
You can do it, Lee Sina!

684
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,360
Hello! This is Lee Sina from Catch Korean!

685
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:34,990
Today, we're going to study morphemes,

686
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,780
which a lot of you have
a hard time understanding…

687
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:37,780
Ms. Lee.

688
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:39,870
Are you working late today?

689
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:41,960
Yes, I am!

690
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,180
Ms. Lee Sina, this is Gwangae Hospital.

691
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,600
Your appointment is at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

692
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:10,570
Ms. Lee Sina.

693
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,860
-Yes.
-Please go in.

694
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,490
NOH GOJIN'S MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS

695
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,710
Pardon me.
Where are all the teaching assistants?

696
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,380
They're having a meeting in Gangneung.

697
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,130
-Gangneung?
-Yeah.

698
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:55,420
Out of the blue, Mr. Noh made everyone
come to Gangneung this morning.

699
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:58,050
They were all scrambling
to get over there.

700
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,130
You didn't know?

701
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,140
-No.
-My goodness.

702
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,140
Even I knew it
and I'm just a cleaner here.

703
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,520
How could his secretary not know that?

704
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,640
Jeez, seriously.

705
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,680
Yes? Hello?

706
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,890
Is this Ms. Lee Sina?

707
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:46,510
Yes, this is she.

708
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,520
I'm calling from Gwangae Hospital.

709
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,140
You were busy earlier,
so you only took the MRI scan, correct?

710
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,310
Yes.

711
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,940
Can you come to the hospital now?

712
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:05,200
When did your migraines
start to get serious?

713
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:10,000
I think it's been about a year.

714
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,120
Recently, I've been taking
headache pills every day.

715
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:13,630
DR. HAN JIHO

716
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,590
I advise you to get admitted.

717
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:21,720
Get admitted?

718
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,970
Ms. Lee, you have a glioblastoma.

719
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:27,760
A glio… What's that?

720
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:30,430
It's cancer. A brain tumor.

721
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:34,940
You should prepare yourself.

722
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:38,570
What do you mean, prepare myself?

723
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,370
You're at the final stage.

724
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:52,330
I… have a brain tumor?

725
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,750
I'm going to die?

726
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:11,100
Is this a dream?

727
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:15,810
Am I having a dream right now?

728
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:04,360
-Did you wait long?
-You didn't have to come.

729
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,410
-Goodness.
-Since it's snowing a lot.

730
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,000
I guess…

731
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:21,420
I won't be able to get old like them.

732
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:23,790
Who are you?

733
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,220
I said, who are you?

734
01:07:58,450 --> 01:07:59,330
What's this about?

735
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,540
What the heck are you doing?

736
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:11,510
How did you get in here?

737
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:56,050
