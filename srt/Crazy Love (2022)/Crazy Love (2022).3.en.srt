CRAZY LOVE

THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

EPISODE 3

5
00:01:34,308 --> 00:01:37,348
Hey, have you lost your mind?
What do you mean, his fiancée?

6
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:39,938
That punk has amnesia.

7
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:43,018
But still. This is totally insane.

8
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:44,148
They'll find out soon…

9
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,368
Did you really try
to kill Mr. Noh Manners?

10
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:53,788
It sounds suspicious.

11
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:55,118
Otherwise, why did you go there?

12
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,788
Why did you go there with a claw hammer?

13
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:05,208
You're right. I went there to kill him.

14
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:13,508
VIP WARD

15
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:32,238
You can't enter his room.

16
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,328
Ms. Lee Sina is our prime suspect…

17
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:43,748
What is it?
The vehicle inspection results came out?

18
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:46,418
What about the bloodstains?

19
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:50,168
None. It wasn't a collision with a person?

20
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:53,638
Okay, got it.

21
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:59,138
He said no, right?
Sina didn't hit him, right?

22
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:00,478
We don't know yet.

23
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:03,978
We just don't have conclusive evidence,
but all circumstantial evidence

24
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:06,688
points to Ms. Lee Sina.

25
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:10,068
Hence, Ms. Lee Sina is
still our prime suspect.

26
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,318
I'm telling you, she didn't hit him!

27
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:15,408
She's too nice to even harm a fly.

28
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:17,288
-You're her lawyer.
-I'm not a lawyer.

29
00:03:19,288 --> 00:03:20,118
Didn't you say

30
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:22,958
that you're representing Ms. Lee Sina?

31
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:27,918
I said that because
I'm a friend who lives with her.

32
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:30,128
I'm…

33
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,758
an actress.

34
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:37,638
I'm a stage actress
who works part-time at a lawyer's office.

35
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,728
If you have any free time,
please come watch a play

36
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,438
at Daehangno.

37
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:48,318
Here you go. One more.

38
00:03:48,398 --> 00:03:50,108
Okay, thank you.

39
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:53,358
Please make sure to come.

40
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:15,048
Mr. Noh Gojin?

41
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:21,928
How are you doing?

42
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,558
You've been calling me that

43
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:29,728
from the moment I woke up.

44
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:33,858
Is that my name?

45
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,158
Noh Gojin?

46
00:04:37,738 --> 00:04:38,988
Yes, that's right.

47
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:43,658
Is there anything you can remember?

48
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,078
No.

49
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,998
That name sounds so unfamiliar.

50
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:54,798
Noh Gojin.

51
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:57,508
What about my age?

52
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,968
How old am I?

53
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:05,138
You're 35 years old by Korean age.

54
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:07,188
I'm 35?

55
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:10,858
Then,

56
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:13,858
why did I end up here?

57
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,648
You came to the hospital
after a car accident.

58
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:18,448
A car accident…

59
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:22,078
So that's why

60
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:24,118
my leg is like this.

61
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,288
May I ask you something?

62
00:05:31,788 --> 00:05:33,588
I have a pretty serious injury on my leg.

63
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:36,298
Then why can't I
even remember my own name?

64
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:39,258
We'll do another brain scan,

65
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,138
but I believe

66
00:05:41,218 --> 00:05:44,518
that you were traumatized
during the surgery.

67
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,598
Traumatized?

68
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:50,858
Because you have a unique constitution,
you cannot be anesthetized.

69
00:05:51,688 --> 00:05:53,978
You were not anesthetized completely,

70
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:56,108
so you were aware of the whole surgery.

71
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:59,408
It's a side effect caused by stress.

72
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:01,198
It's a type of trauma.

73
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:06,078
Does that mean…

74
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,328
that I'll have to keep…

75
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,248
living like this
without even knowing who I am?

76
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:17,378
It's highly probable
that your amnesia is temporary.

77
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:19,468
Based on previous cases,

78
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:24,508
patients who've lost their memories
due to side effects of anesthesia like you

79
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:26,138
mostly got their memories back

80
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:28,768
even though their recovery time
may have varied.

81
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,648
Is that really the case?

82
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,728
They really got their memories back?

83
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:34,978
Yes.

84
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:39,898
I know you must feel very anxious,

85
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:43,908
but the best thing you can do now
is to give yourself some time

86
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:45,788
and keep making efforts.

87
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:53,708
Do you remember her by any chance?

88
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:14,728
Please take a closer look.

89
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:21,238
Remember it.

90
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,908
Just remember the fact
that you got slapped by me at least.

91
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:26,238
Then I'll stop here.

92
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:31,828
No, I don't.

93
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:37,378
No. You have to remember me.

94
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,128
I've never seen her before.

95
00:07:42,798 --> 00:07:43,928
She's someone

96
00:07:44,928 --> 00:07:47,758
who is the closest to you.

97
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:54,058
Closest to me?

98
00:07:56,688 --> 00:07:57,648
Who is she?

99
00:07:58,858 --> 00:07:59,898
She is…

100
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:02,858
your fiancée.

101
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:06,528
My… fiancée?

102
00:08:08,118 --> 00:08:09,078
Yes.

103
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:10,748
It's me.

104
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,538
Your fiancée.

105
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,378
I won't die with things like this.

106
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:35,848
How is he? Did he recognize Sina…

107
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:38,108
I mean, his fiancée?

108
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:42,738
He really has amnesia.

109
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:46,858
Mr. Noh Gojin doesn't even remember
his own name right now.

110
00:08:46,948 --> 00:08:48,068
Not even his own name?

111
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:49,578
No, he doesn't.

112
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,868
That's insane.

113
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,118
But perhaps,

114
00:08:53,828 --> 00:08:57,038
their love can help him heal.

115
00:08:57,628 --> 00:08:58,538
Love?

116
00:09:00,378 --> 00:09:01,628
That should be the case, right?

117
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,668
Their love can help him heal, right?

118
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:08,298
Because love is so great.

119
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,388
-So great.
-All right!

120
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:11,928
Love is so great!

121
00:09:12,348 --> 00:09:14,888
Doctor, I love you!

122
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,058
So you're…

123
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:20,978
my fiancée?

124
00:09:21,898 --> 00:09:22,728
Yes.

125
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:36,578
What's wrong?

126
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:37,828
My head…

127
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:39,788
My head hurts so much.

128
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:41,538
Should I call the doctor?

129
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:42,998
I remember…

130
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:52,928
You remember…

131
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,308
something?

132
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:58,938
No.

133
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:01,688
I remember nothing.

134
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:07,778
I'm tired.

135
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,868
Maybe I thought too hard.

136
00:10:12,318 --> 00:10:13,698
I want to rest.

137
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:16,368
Right, don't force yourself too hard
to remember things.

138
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:19,418
The doctor also said that
remaining calm is best for you.

139
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,748
I'll be outside. Please rest well.

140
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,958
Wait.

141
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:35,138
Yes?

142
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,478
Thank you.

143
00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:41,768
I heard that I have no family.

144
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:45,568
I'm so relieved

145
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:47,898
that I'm not alone.

146
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:14,048
What's wrong? Are you okay?

147
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:16,968
Okhee.

148
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:18,678
What? What happened?

149
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:21,808
He really must be dying.

150
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:23,018
What?

151
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:25,398
What the heck are you talking about?

152
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,568
Noh Gojin said…

153
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:33,488
Noh Gojin said…

154
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:36,278
Yeah, what did Mr. Noh Manners say?

155
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:38,988
"thank you."

156
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:40,118
What?

157
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:42,118
He thanked me.

158
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,378
How is this possible?

159
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,958
That's insane.
He really did lose his mind.

160
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:51,758
My goodness. This is crazy.

161
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:53,508
What are the odds of this happening?

162
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,638
Unbelievable.

163
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,928
He's the one who mistreated me.
How can he be at peace?

164
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:04,308
He can't just forget.

165
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:09,778
He can't just forget everything
and thank me with an angelic face.

166
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:11,738
I…

167
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:17,238
What did I do so wrong?

168
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:18,738
I really worked hard all my life.

169
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:21,158
There wasn't a moment
in my life when I didn't work hard.

170
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:23,748
I've never done
anything bad in my whole life!

171
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:25,368
Why is this happening to me?

172
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,038
What did I do so wrong?

173
00:12:27,128 --> 00:12:29,298
Why? Why do I have to die?

174
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:35,338
Why would you die because of this?

175
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:41,348
Fine. Cry.

176
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:44,518
You'll feel better after crying.

177
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:48,608
By the way,

178
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:49,858
it's not true, right?

179
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,898
What you said earlier.

180
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:55,948
You went there to kill him.

181
00:12:57,908 --> 00:12:58,818
You were joking, right?

182
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:02,698
I know you so well.

183
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:05,918
Sina, you're so timid.
You'd never dare kill anyone.

184
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,378
Gosh, this is making me so angry.

185
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,838
The police are suspecting you
to be the hit-and-run driver,

186
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:12,878
and Mr. Noh Manners has lost his mind.

187
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:15,378
What if you get blamed for everything?

188
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:17,048
Let's do something.

189
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:20,298
-I'll call my boss--
-Don't.

190
00:13:20,888 --> 00:13:22,348
I didn't do anything wrong.

191
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:25,558
I swear on my father's life.

192
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:28,898
Then please go confess now.

193
00:13:28,978 --> 00:13:30,938
-Tell the police that you lied about--
-No.

194
00:13:32,018 --> 00:13:34,228
-I don't want to.
-Why not?

195
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:38,488
I'm going to get revenge.

196
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:40,908
Revenge?

197
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:42,698
I won't…

198
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:44,908
put up with him anymore.

199
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:47,868
I'm not just going to die like a fool.

200
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,958
Noh Gojin, that scumbag!

201
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:54,918
I'm going to destroy him.

202
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:04,348
We're here, ma'am.

203
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:06,558
The automatic stop has been activated.

204
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,638
Ma'am.

205
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:09,438
Ma'am?

206
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:12,688
We're here.

207
00:14:13,398 --> 00:14:15,648
Oh… Right.

208
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:19,448
Ma'am.

209
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:21,698
Aren't you taking this?

210
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:38,718
Hello? I'm at the hospital.

211
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,638
I came to visit
the president of the school.

212
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:44,468
Okay. I'll call you on the way.

213
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:45,968
Okay. Bye.

214
00:15:03,908 --> 00:15:06,408
Oh, right. Did you hear?

215
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,488
What?

216
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:10,078
Noh Gojin is hospitalized here.

217
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:11,708
Noh Gojin?

218
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,328
That top instructor Noh Gojin?

219
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:16,418
That's right. He's at the VIP Ward.

220
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,008
That's crazy.

221
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,128
Thanks to Mr. Noh's lectures,
I placed at the top level for math.

222
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,178
-Seriously?
-That's amazing.

223
00:15:58,628 --> 00:15:59,628
Hi.

224
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,418
How have you been?

225
00:16:05,718 --> 00:16:07,048
It's been so long.

226
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:19,728
How much were you hurt?

227
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:22,278
Who…

228
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:24,488
are you?

229
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,278
Do you know me?

230
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:22,838
You want me to do this?

231
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:23,918
Yes.

232
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:33,888
Don't be frustrated and do it slowly
even if you can't do it well…

233
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,808
The Ramanujan Summation states
that if you add

234
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:23,768
all the natural numbers,

235
00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:26,438
it'll equal to -1/12, a negative number.

236
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,408
The aviation security regulations
announcement.

237
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:33,698
The quantity of liquids and gels

238
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:38,328
you can carry onboard
international flights is restricted…

239
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:41,208
Mr. Oh, your car isn't here, right?

240
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,588
I'll drive you home.

241
00:18:43,668 --> 00:18:45,128
Thank you, but it's okay.

242
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,008
I have to go to the office
for my cell phone.

243
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:50,678
It might've exploded
because of the continued missed calls.

244
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,428
My car is at the office too.

245
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:53,848
I'll drive you there--

246
00:18:53,928 --> 00:18:55,718
Gosh, it's okay.

247
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,228
You worked hard.
Please rest well and see you at work.

248
00:19:08,818 --> 00:19:10,198
You're really going to do it?

249
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:15,618
You really resent
Mr. Noh Manners, don't you?

250
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:19,578
Fine. Go for it.

251
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,868
Get your revenge.

252
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:27,128
It's unbelievable that he has amnesia.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

253
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:29,798
Do it. Get revenge.

254
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:34,008
It's your engagement ring,

255
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:37,178
You need the perfect prop
if you're to be his fiancée.

256
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:38,968
Wait.

257
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:42,638
But what if Mr. Noh Manners
recovers his memories soon?

258
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:45,268
It doesn't matter
even if he does tomorrow.

259
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:49,188
I'm going to die anyway, so who cares?

260
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:53,778
You're right. We'll all die anyway.

261
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:55,118
You have nothing to lose.

262
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:58,788
Lee Sina, you're so cool.
You should've been like this sooner.

263
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:02,958
I know.
Why did I put up with it like a fool?

264
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,418
Hey, take this chance
and get back at him for everything.

265
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:07,288
Hit him in the head,

266
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:08,668
and spit in his water.

267
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:10,378
Mix in a laxative in his food too.

268
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,048
Do everything you want. Here you go.

269
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:31,688
Let me show you what true acting means.

270
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:34,528
This is how you can be more real
than his actual fiancée

271
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,318
by pouring your blood, sweat,
and tears into acting.

272
00:20:37,408 --> 00:20:41,198
I'll give you
a special crash course in acting.

273
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,388
Be careful.

274
00:21:14,528 --> 00:21:15,528
Are you comfortable?

275
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,558
I'm sorry.

276
00:21:50,938 --> 00:21:52,398
I won't massage that part.

277
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:01,828
Enjoy.

278
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:14,338
Have some kimchi.

279
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:20,798
Water?

280
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,138
Here you go.

281
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:30,938
Are you okay?

282
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:40,528
Sir, they're so romantic.

283
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:41,618
Shush.

284
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:46,118
This is what a real fiancée is like.

285
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,618
First, you have to show people
how sincere and devoted you are.

286
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:53,918
You touch their hearts like that first.

287
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:55,998
Then I get revenge step by step.

288
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:57,128
That's right.

289
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:14,938
Drink this.

290
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,278
This is your favorite water, honey.

291
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:20,488
Honey?

292
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:23,818
Honey, eat lots and die…

293
00:23:27,288 --> 00:23:30,958
Work hard to death
to recover your memories, okay?

294
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:32,368
Thank you.

295
00:23:52,268 --> 00:23:53,098
How is it?

296
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:55,058
It tastes good.

297
00:23:55,688 --> 00:23:59,028
Doesn't it? This isn't ordinary water.

298
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:02,108
It's much better
than imported mineral water,

299
00:24:02,198 --> 00:24:04,738
so I really went out of my way
to get it for you, honey.

300
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,948
What kind of water is it?

301
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:16,918
ONION EXTRACT

302
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:22,508
Ta-da!

303
00:24:23,218 --> 00:24:24,678
What's all this?

304
00:24:24,758 --> 00:24:26,468
You love onions so much, honey.

305
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,218
Don't they look so delicious?

306
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:32,138
I had to go through all sorts of trouble
to get these specially made from a hotel.

307
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:33,558
You have to eat everything, okay?

308
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,688
Did I like onions--

309
00:24:38,188 --> 00:24:40,358
Try it first. You'll really love it.

310
00:24:43,528 --> 00:24:44,818
Chew well. Come on.

311
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,118
Isn't it so delicious?

312
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:56,288
Honey, you also love onion rings.
Try these.

313
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,668
You really love raw onion too.
You always got an extra serving.

314
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,798
Oh, are you thirsty?
You should drink some onion extract.

315
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:04,968
Here you go. Onion extract juice.

316
00:25:05,048 --> 00:25:07,048
No, it's okay. It's okay!

317
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,888
Come on. Drink up.

318
00:25:14,428 --> 00:25:16,688
I really don't want to go.

319
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:19,018
My stomach feels so awful.

320
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:20,688
That's why you should get some fresh air.

321
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:22,938
All you've done is lie down and eat.

322
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:24,648
Oh, right!

323
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,948
I forgot to put sunscreen on you.

324
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:29,118
You can't get sunburned.

325
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,168
Here you go.

326
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:48,258
You can't get sunburned, honey.

327
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,848
I have to apply it very thoroughly.

328
00:26:02,568 --> 00:26:04,028
Is that a facial mask?

329
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,948
Now that I'm outside, it feels very nice.

330
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,538
-Hello.
-Mr. Oh.

331
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:21,418
You're back a week early.

332
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,588
The meeting went well,
so I came back early.

333
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:24,628
I see.

334
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,508
To celebrate that…

335
00:26:30,678 --> 00:26:34,058
-I got you a souvenir.
-You really didn't have to. Thank you.

336
00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:36,308
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Yes, sir.

337
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:45,148
My goodness.
You're back to the office, Mr. Oh!

338
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,318
Hello, it's been a while.

339
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,608
Goodness. How was your business trip?

340
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:51,818
It was great. Thank you for asking.

341
00:26:52,408 --> 00:26:54,988
You were gone only for a few days,

342
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,748
but it felt like years to me.

343
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:58,248
Goodness.

344
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:03,668
The office feels so gloomy without you.

345
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,208
I'm serious.

346
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,508
I really missed you.

347
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:13,338
I really missed you too, Ms. Gong.

348
00:27:13,428 --> 00:27:16,058
Oh, right. Since I missed you…

349
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,428
Ta-da.

350
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,228
My goodness. What's this?

351
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,518
It's nothing big. Just a souvenir.

352
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:27,318
You shouldn't have.

353
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:28,778
Thank you.

354
00:27:28,858 --> 00:27:30,278
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

355
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:31,908
Well then, I'll get going.

356
00:27:31,988 --> 00:27:33,238
Okay. Thank you.

357
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,528
-Thank you.
-Bye.

358
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:38,948
GOTOP EDUCATION

359
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,918
CALLS

360
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,958
I had so many missed calls. Jeez.

361
00:27:52,628 --> 00:27:53,638
Hello?

362
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:57,758
Yes, this is Oh Segi, Deputy CEO
of Gotop Education. Who's this?

363
00:27:59,348 --> 00:28:00,478
Police?

364
00:28:02,058 --> 00:28:03,388
How may I help you?

365
00:28:05,188 --> 00:28:08,688
What did you say?
Mr. Noh got hit by a car?

366
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:18,508
Ms. Ma.

367
00:29:27,438 --> 00:29:28,608
Since that's the case…

368
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:30,858
What's going on?

369
00:29:31,318 --> 00:29:33,438
Mr. Noh Manners…

370
00:29:33,528 --> 00:29:37,408
What? Tell us the details… Jeez.

371
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:42,038
Hey! Did you hear…

372
00:29:42,118 --> 00:29:44,078
-Seriously? No way.
-Let's go.

373
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:02,808
-Noh Gojin got hit by a car!
-Noh Gojin got hit by a car!

374
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:15,108
NOH GOJIN

375
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,438
CEO NOH GOJIN WITH AN IQ OF 190

376
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:20,618
KOREA'S NO. 1 ONLINE CLASS

377
00:30:22,618 --> 00:30:25,368
Korea's No. 1 online class,
Gotop Education.

378
00:30:25,948 --> 00:30:28,458
Choose… now.

379
00:30:32,088 --> 00:30:33,128
Now I get it.

380
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,838
I'm a very popular, top instructor,

381
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:40,388
who is the CEO of Gotop Education, right?

382
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:43,848
Yes, you finally realized.

383
00:30:44,848 --> 00:30:46,558
I never imagined

384
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:50,598
I was a person who taught others.

385
00:30:51,978 --> 00:30:52,938
I've done…

386
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:56,028
such a good job with my life.

387
00:31:01,658 --> 00:31:04,238
Sure, you've done a good job

388
00:31:04,408 --> 00:31:06,118
making other people suffer.

389
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:12,958
Then, how did we meet?

390
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,708
At work, of course.

391
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:15,998
The CEO and his secretary.

392
00:31:16,088 --> 00:31:19,048
Oh, I see. You're my secretary.

393
00:31:19,548 --> 00:31:24,008
Then everyone at work should know
that we're engaged, right?

394
00:31:25,678 --> 00:31:27,098
-No.
-Why not?

395
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:29,518
Because…

396
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:31,978
we dated each other secretly

397
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:34,148
and exchanged vows on our own.

398
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:35,648
That's why no one knows.

399
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:36,898
Secretly?

400
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:39,608
Why secretly?

401
00:31:39,688 --> 00:31:41,698
Because people gossip too much
about office romances.

402
00:31:41,778 --> 00:31:43,908
Besides, the employees will feel
very uncomfortable.

403
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:46,988
I see.

404
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:56,668
You still can't believe the fact
that I'm your fiancée?

405
00:31:59,088 --> 00:31:59,918
No.

406
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:08,768
Then I should tell you how we met.

407
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:14,058
We met a year ago
when I was pointed as your secretary.

408
00:32:15,938 --> 00:32:18,398
You were a very nasty boss.

409
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:23,148
You tormented your secretaries

410
00:32:23,238 --> 00:32:25,318
that none of them
lasted more than three months.

411
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:28,698
I tormented my secretaries?

412
00:32:28,788 --> 00:32:31,748
Yes. It was so hard for me too.

413
00:32:31,828 --> 00:32:33,748
You threw sandwiches at me
and insulted me.

414
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,288
It was a living hell!

415
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:40,458
But, one day…

416
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,008
you confessed

417
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,298
that you have feelings for me.

418
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,678
I confessed?
Suddenly after tormenting you?

419
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,438
Because you loved me so much.

420
00:32:58,438 --> 00:32:59,648
Basically,

421
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,108
you were crazy about me.

422
00:33:04,988 --> 00:33:06,238
Are you crazy?

423
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,618
How could I say something so horrific?

424
00:33:08,698 --> 00:33:10,578
What? Acting isn't easy.

425
00:33:11,238 --> 00:33:14,828
You have to pour your heart
and soul into it

426
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,998
-as much as you can.
-Jeez.

427
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:20,338
I rejected you at first.

428
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,588
But you cried and begged
saying you couldn't live without me

429
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,838
and threatened to kill yourself
unless I accepted you.

430
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:28,008
-No, please marry me!
-Let go.

431
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:29,258
Please marry me!

432
00:33:29,348 --> 00:33:31,138
No, I'm going to kill myself!

433
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,468
Please marry me!

434
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:35,268
I… begged you?

435
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:36,308
Yes.

436
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:39,188
So I accepted you in the end.

437
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:42,398
And we got engaged a month ago
at your vacation house

438
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,488
here in Gangneung.

439
00:33:45,318 --> 00:33:47,108
We exchanged vows secretly.

440
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,328
I was a bit sad to do it
without our families there,

441
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:55,498
but I did so
trusting your passionate love for me.

442
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:01,878
What? "Trusting your passionate love…"

443
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,718
With the gaze full of love,
say his name like this.

444
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:10,258
Oh, Gojin.

445
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:18,308
Okay, fine. Let's say I do that.

446
00:34:18,978 --> 00:34:19,978
Will he believe me?

447
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:21,688
Even if he lost his memories,

448
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,358
I need at least one picture with him
for him to believe me.

449
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:26,778
Yes, pictures.

450
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,908
We can just create them.

451
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:44,838
Wait, what was that just now?

452
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:54,638
This is our engagement ring.

453
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:58,558
If you can't even trust
our memories together,

454
00:34:59,518 --> 00:35:01,808
I have no other way to prove it to you.

455
00:35:03,858 --> 00:35:04,938
Doctor.

456
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:08,818
There is nothing more I can do.

457
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,278
What else can I do to prove my love?

458
00:35:21,368 --> 00:35:22,418
I'm sorry,

459
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:24,838
but honestly,

460
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:28,048
everything feels like a dream

461
00:35:28,758 --> 00:35:30,128
and not real.

462
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:35,508
Most patients with amnesia
have difficulty accepting their reality.

463
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:38,348
A woman who you don't know
says she's your fiancée.

464
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:40,518
It's hard to accept that.

465
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:46,898
I guess I have to tell him this after all.

466
00:35:48,568 --> 00:35:51,028
The police suspect me
to be the hit-and-run driver.

467
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:53,408
Even though I'm the one
who saved your life,

468
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,778
they think I'm the culprit who hit you.

469
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:01,368
But the circumstances are…

470
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,368
Yes, I understand your point of view.

471
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:05,838
I went to his vacation house
with a claw hammer.

472
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:07,458
You have a reason to suspect me.

473
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:11,878
On top of that,
Gojin and I had a big argument that night.

474
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:14,928
Because Gojin…

475
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:24,598
cheated on me!

476
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,068
Honey.

477
00:36:29,028 --> 00:36:30,228
Why are we taking this picture?

478
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:32,278
You don't need to know.

479
00:36:39,578 --> 00:36:41,868
He cheated on me
immediately after we got engaged.

480
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,748
So I thought about breaking up,

481
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:45,578
and couldn't even tell anyone about it

482
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:46,998
including our families.

483
00:36:51,048 --> 00:36:53,218
I wish I were the real culprit.

484
00:36:55,628 --> 00:36:57,298
If I had just let it slide,

485
00:36:57,388 --> 00:36:59,508
this accident wouldn't have happened.

486
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,178
Yes.

487
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,228
I'm worse than the culprit.

488
00:37:09,398 --> 00:37:11,068
-Please arrest me.
-What…

489
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:12,608
It's all my fault…

490
00:37:14,528 --> 00:37:16,158
that Gojin got into the accident.

491
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:44,558
I got goosebumps. I'm so good at acting.

492
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:46,308
Gosh, I'm amazing.

493
00:37:47,228 --> 00:37:48,268
Wow.

494
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,108
Hi, Okhee.

495
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:53,728
How did it go?

496
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:56,948
My master, you are a true actress.

497
00:37:57,028 --> 00:37:59,528
You taught me so well. Hey.

498
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:01,948
I guarantee you'll make it
to Cannes one day.

499
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,368
Wow, you should've seen
Mr. Noh Manners' face.

500
00:38:05,448 --> 00:38:07,958
His face turned bright red, all flustered.

501
00:38:11,628 --> 00:38:13,128
Oh, the dress.

502
00:38:23,888 --> 00:38:24,888
Gojin!

503
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:27,018
What happened to you?

504
00:38:27,478 --> 00:38:28,478
My goodness. Your leg…

505
00:38:29,398 --> 00:38:30,348
Are you okay otherwise?

506
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,768
Is everything else okay?

507
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:36,688
Who are you?

508
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:40,698
Jeez.

509
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:42,828
I guess you're feeling all right.

510
00:38:42,908 --> 00:38:44,658
You're even joking around.

511
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:47,578
Do you even know
how scared I was on my way over here?

512
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,078
My hands are still shaking.

513
00:38:59,258 --> 00:39:02,388
Sorry. Who is he?

514
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:04,758
Mr. Oh.

515
00:39:07,268 --> 00:39:08,228
Mr. Oh?

516
00:39:09,188 --> 00:39:14,148
I see. So he must be
the deputy CEO of Gotop Education.

517
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:17,738
Why are you speaking formally to me
all of a sudden?

518
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:21,528
Gojin, it's me. It's Segi.

519
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:24,198
Am I older than you?

520
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:34,038
Amnesia?

521
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,458
Yes.

522
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:39,548
So you're telling me

523
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,338
that Mr. Noh…

524
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,968
He can't remember anything?

525
00:39:48,968 --> 00:39:49,808
No.

526
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,648
He can't even remember his own name.

527
00:39:55,688 --> 00:40:00,438
Ms. Lee, you're not asking me
to actually believe that, are you?

528
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:02,488
How does that make sense?

529
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:05,318
Noh Gojin is the top instructor in Korea.

530
00:40:05,448 --> 00:40:07,788
How is it possible
that he can't remember me

531
00:40:07,868 --> 00:40:09,448
who is closest to him or his own name?

532
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,958
I'm sorry.

533
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:21,418
CONSULTATION ROOM, DR. YOO JAEHO

534
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:24,548
Mr. Noh Gojin lost all his memories.

535
00:40:26,138 --> 00:40:30,098
He'll never get his memories back?

536
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:34,228
No, it was all temporary
base on the patients

537
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:36,308
-who had side effects from anesthesia.
-I see.

538
00:40:37,898 --> 00:40:40,398
Then what can we do

539
00:40:40,478 --> 00:40:42,568
to help him recover his memories faster?

540
00:40:42,738 --> 00:40:46,568
The only thing you can do now
is to keep stimulating his brain.

541
00:40:46,818 --> 00:40:49,618
You need to bring up memories
that the patient is familiar with.

542
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:52,578
For example, you can stimulate
his brain with special memories

543
00:40:52,748 --> 00:40:56,538
such as memorable places
or his favorite foods.

544
00:40:56,628 --> 00:41:00,168
It'll require significant efforts
from his guardian.

545
00:41:00,748 --> 00:41:01,758
Understood, sir.

546
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:05,468
Then please tell me everything
that the guardian needs to do.

547
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:08,678
But his guardian is doing
such a great job already.

548
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,388
His guardian?

549
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:12,728
Who would that be?

550
00:41:12,808 --> 00:41:15,308
His fiancée standing right over here.

551
00:41:15,388 --> 00:41:16,978
Fian…

552
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:35,248
This isn't…

553
00:41:36,248 --> 00:41:37,958
a dream, right?

554
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:40,958
You're…

555
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:43,508
Gojin's fiancée?

556
00:41:46,178 --> 00:41:47,258
Yes.

557
00:41:50,598 --> 00:41:53,558
You really got engaged to Gojin?

558
00:41:54,268 --> 00:41:55,268
Pardon?

559
00:41:58,228 --> 00:41:59,228
Yes.

560
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,108
When?

561
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:02,568
A month ago…

562
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,108
the two of us exchanged vows

563
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,778
at his vacation house in Gangneung.

564
00:42:09,868 --> 00:42:10,818
A month ago?

565
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:19,038
You know how close I am to Gojin, right?

566
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:22,748
You're very close friends.

567
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:26,468
No, we're not just close friends.

568
00:42:26,548 --> 00:42:29,888
He and I are like real brothers.

569
00:42:29,968 --> 00:42:34,428
But Gojin never told me anything
about exchanging vows.

570
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,768
No, I've never heard him
mentioning you at all…

571
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,308
I do.

572
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:40,848
I'll go right after the special lecture

573
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:43,398
and spend an amazing time
with my girlfriend. So don't you dare

574
00:42:43,768 --> 00:42:45,398
call me from the States.

575
00:42:47,278 --> 00:42:49,948
No way. He wasn't bluffing?

576
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:01,288
Hello?

577
00:43:03,878 --> 00:43:04,878
Yes.

578
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,798
Yes, okay. Bye.

579
00:43:24,648 --> 00:43:25,768
I fully understand.

580
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:28,318
Pardon?

581
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:44,838
There's more in the refrigerator.

582
00:43:45,588 --> 00:43:47,128
You're always full of surprises, Gojin.

583
00:43:48,048 --> 00:43:49,048
Sorry?

584
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:55,678
Take a look at this.

585
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,218
Is that…

586
00:43:59,218 --> 00:44:00,228
me?

587
00:44:00,518 --> 00:44:01,518
Yes, it is.

588
00:44:01,768 --> 00:44:04,098
We took it on your birthday
just a few days ago.

589
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:10,108
This is a picture of us
from six years ago.

590
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,238
At the time,

591
00:44:12,908 --> 00:44:15,698
we were practically living in the office

592
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:17,528
building up Gotop.

593
00:44:19,038 --> 00:44:20,408
-I see.
-Do you remember?

594
00:44:23,368 --> 00:44:24,368
I'm…

595
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,048
much better looking than you.

596
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:32,088
You're still full of yourself.

597
00:44:34,718 --> 00:44:38,258
I was just stating a fact.

598
00:44:42,938 --> 00:44:46,808
You really don't remember my face?

599
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:52,028
No, I don't.

600
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,878
Something urgent came up at work,
so I'll head out first.

601
00:45:12,968 --> 00:45:14,718
I'll come back as soon as I finish up.

602
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:16,088
Okay.

603
00:45:23,558 --> 00:45:26,688
Please take good care of Gojin.

604
00:45:28,398 --> 00:45:29,358
Okay.

605
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,538
He believed me so easily.

606
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:50,458
Hello?

607
00:45:50,538 --> 00:45:51,958
You dropped off dry cleaning?

608
00:45:52,378 --> 00:45:53,378
Yes.

609
00:45:58,428 --> 00:45:59,638
Thank you.

610
00:46:04,558 --> 00:46:06,978
GOTOP CEO NOH GOJIN IN A HIT-AND-RUN

611
00:46:08,478 --> 00:46:10,148
NOH GOJIN FOR MATH
GOTOP CEO NOH GOJIN… HIT-AND-RUN ACCIDENT

612
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:11,058
NEWS NOW
CEO NOH IN HIT-AND-RUN

613
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:12,608
GOTOP CEO NOH GOJIN IN A HIT-AND-RUN

614
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:15,528
The famous instructor Noh Gojin
was hit by a hit-and-run driver

615
00:46:15,688 --> 00:46:20,368
in front of his vacation home
in Gangneung this morning.

616
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:23,618
Mr. Noh was found
by Ms. Lee, his secretary.

617
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,198
He was unconscious when he was found…

618
00:46:25,288 --> 00:46:27,458
-Give us an update!
-Please tell us!

619
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:29,628
MR. NOH, WE BELIEVE YOU'LL RETURN!
WE'LL PROTECT YOU

620
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:30,918
LET'S PROTECT NOH GOJIN

621
00:46:40,718 --> 00:46:44,218
Is that true
that it wasn't just a hit-and-run?

622
00:46:44,308 --> 00:46:46,218
Did someone attempt to kill Mr. Noh?

623
00:46:46,308 --> 00:46:47,678
Was it motivated by revenge?

624
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:53,108
The police are still investigating.

625
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:56,488
I apologize, but I can't provide
any more information.

626
00:46:56,988 --> 00:46:58,028
Wait, sir!

627
00:46:58,108 --> 00:46:59,608
-Mr. Oh!
-Please tell us!

628
00:46:59,698 --> 00:47:00,858
-Please tell us!
-Mr. Oh!

629
00:47:03,948 --> 00:47:04,948
Please restrict access

630
00:47:05,078 --> 00:47:07,998
-and ask the police for assistance.
-Yes, sir.

631
00:47:08,658 --> 00:47:09,868
Mr. Oh.

632
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:12,708
Please make sure Gangneung police
and the hospital keep quiet.

633
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,538
Those are the only sources of information.

634
00:47:14,628 --> 00:47:16,088
-You're right!
-Gosh.

635
00:47:16,168 --> 00:47:17,758
I heard that…

636
00:47:26,058 --> 00:47:28,018
Mr. Oh, is it really true?

637
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:31,098
The news only mentions
that it was a hit-and-run.

638
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:34,018
Did someone really try to kill Mr. Noh?

639
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:39,108
Who is this scumbag that did
such a terrible thing to our CEO?

640
00:47:39,188 --> 00:47:41,068
The police are still investigating.

641
00:47:42,738 --> 00:47:43,658
What in the world?

642
00:47:43,738 --> 00:47:47,158
It's not surprising. I'm sure
many people hold grudges against Mr. Noh.

643
00:47:47,238 --> 00:47:49,788
I knew he'd be destroyed
like this one day.

644
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,578
Ouch! Hey--

645
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:56,088
I'm sorry.

646
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,718
The police requested our cooperation
for their investigation.

647
00:48:00,798 --> 00:48:03,928
They might ask you a few questions.

648
00:48:04,428 --> 00:48:05,848
I ask for your full cooperation.

649
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:07,468
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

650
00:48:07,808 --> 00:48:09,728
It's going to be a bit hectic for a while.

651
00:48:09,808 --> 00:48:12,728
Please use the employee-only entrance.

652
00:48:13,848 --> 00:48:16,728
I have one more request.

653
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:19,568
Please avoid reporters.

654
00:48:20,068 --> 00:48:24,488
An unnecessary comment could result
in misunderstanding and rumors

655
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,238
that end up hindering Gotop Education.
So, please be extra mindful.

656
00:48:28,328 --> 00:48:29,658
-Yes, sir.
-Understood.

657
00:48:31,198 --> 00:48:32,328
Lastly,

658
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:34,788
there's no need to be shaken up.

659
00:48:35,418 --> 00:48:36,788
You have nothing to worry about.

660
00:48:36,878 --> 00:48:40,458
Mr. Noh is fine and will return soon.

661
00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:45,468
Mr. Oh!

662
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,848
Gosh.

663
00:48:48,808 --> 00:48:50,218
Is Mr. Noh all right?

664
00:48:50,308 --> 00:48:53,638
Yes, he is. His surgery went well,
and he's recovering fine too.

665
00:48:54,638 --> 00:48:58,938
Perhaps…
someone really hit him on purpose?

666
00:48:59,018 --> 00:49:00,228
We don't know yet.

667
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:03,198
The police are investigating
with that possibility in mind.

668
00:49:03,278 --> 00:49:04,568
I see.

669
00:49:05,448 --> 00:49:09,578
Oh, I'll just need to postpone
his show schedule by one week, right?

670
00:49:09,658 --> 00:49:14,158
The producers keep calling the office.

671
00:49:14,538 --> 00:49:17,878
They're throwing a fuss
worried that their shows will be affected.

672
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:21,588
Well then, I'll inform them.

673
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,298
Ms. Ma.

674
00:49:25,968 --> 00:49:30,008
The doctor says he must rest still.

675
00:49:30,098 --> 00:49:34,058
I see. Then two weeks will suffice, right?

676
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:42,528
Hello?

677
00:49:43,278 --> 00:49:44,898
Yes, okay.

678
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,028
Let's give that some more thought.

679
00:50:04,258 --> 00:50:07,178
Noh is currently recovering
after emergency surgery.

680
00:50:07,258 --> 00:50:10,048
It has been revealed
he is not in critical condition.

681
00:50:10,388 --> 00:50:13,308
According to the police's initial report
from the scene of the accident,

682
00:50:13,388 --> 00:50:16,938
although there were
several surveillance cameras in the area,

683
00:50:17,018 --> 00:50:18,648
they were not working properly

684
00:50:18,728 --> 00:50:21,228
causing difficulties in finding evidence
for the hit-and-run driver…

685
00:50:23,148 --> 00:50:24,108
Hello?

686
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:25,858
Mr. Oh is here.

687
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:27,488
How is it?

688
00:50:27,818 --> 00:50:30,198
He is calm. But…

689
00:50:31,068 --> 00:50:33,618
I don't think it was just a hit-and-run.

690
00:50:34,738 --> 00:50:35,908
There's something more.

691
00:50:36,538 --> 00:50:38,538
Got it. Keep a close eye on him.

692
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:40,708
And call me right away
if anything happens.

693
00:50:49,428 --> 00:50:51,888
FROM GOTOP EDUCATION CEO NOH GOJIN

694
00:50:51,968 --> 00:50:53,348
Noh Gojin!

695
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:58,978
Who did such a great thing?

696
00:50:59,058 --> 00:51:01,308
WISH YOU HEALTHY BOWEL MOVEMENTS
FROM NOH GOJIN

697
00:51:35,388 --> 00:51:37,518
Darn it, why aren't you picking up?

698
00:51:59,498 --> 00:52:00,828
How may I help you?

699
00:52:00,908 --> 00:52:03,628
Is Ms. Baek Sooyeong
in Room 1210 here now?

700
00:52:04,668 --> 00:52:06,918
She just stepped out.

701
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:07,998
Oh, is that right?

702
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:12,128
Then could you please give this to her?

703
00:52:12,218 --> 00:52:13,678
Okay, we will.

704
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:14,588
Thank you.

705
00:52:16,298 --> 00:52:17,388
Are you all right?

706
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:21,688
-Yes.
-But you look so pale.

707
00:52:22,058 --> 00:52:23,348
Are you really all right?

708
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,358
Yes, I'm fine.

709
00:53:12,108 --> 00:53:13,528
Hello? Dad?

710
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:15,778
What are you doing?

711
00:53:16,528 --> 00:53:18,068
I… I'm at work.

712
00:53:19,368 --> 00:53:22,998
Is that right?
Isn't that the sound of waves I hear?

713
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,458
Are you in Gangwon Province?

714
00:53:25,748 --> 00:53:30,298
It's the sound from a video
on my computer.

715
00:53:30,378 --> 00:53:33,128
I see. On your computer.

716
00:53:33,758 --> 00:53:35,928
I thought you were here.

717
00:53:36,468 --> 00:53:39,008
Is everything okay?

718
00:53:40,638 --> 00:53:42,348
Yes, it is.

719
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,478
Nothing much is going on.

720
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:47,098
Why do you ask?

721
00:53:47,188 --> 00:53:51,688
I just asked because…
I've been having bad dreams lately.

722
00:53:52,778 --> 00:53:55,398
That's good if everything is okay.

723
00:53:57,778 --> 00:53:59,618
Are you crying?

724
00:53:59,698 --> 00:54:02,158
No… Why would I cry?

725
00:54:05,658 --> 00:54:07,328
It sounded like you were crying.

726
00:54:07,918 --> 00:54:12,798
By the way,
did your boss get into a car accident?

727
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:15,378
How did you know, Dad?

728
00:54:15,758 --> 00:54:17,338
I saw it on TV.

729
00:54:17,928 --> 00:54:18,888
I see.

730
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:22,508
Maybe that's why I had bad dreams.

731
00:54:24,558 --> 00:54:25,558
Take good care of him.

732
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,268
Okay.

733
00:54:29,398 --> 00:54:31,268
I'll take good care of him.

734
00:54:32,568 --> 00:54:35,528
The police in charge restricted access
to Mr. Noh Gojin's vacation house

735
00:54:35,608 --> 00:54:37,608
and are searching for witnesses…

736
00:54:37,698 --> 00:54:40,068
My accident is being reported on the news.

737
00:54:40,868 --> 00:54:43,908
Considering the fact the accident happened
in front of Noh's vacation house,

738
00:54:43,988 --> 00:54:45,618
they're keeping all possibilities open

739
00:54:45,698 --> 00:54:49,498
and will focus all their efforts
on finding a suspect.

740
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:50,828
I kept thinking about it.

741
00:54:51,878 --> 00:54:54,088
I couldn't eat or sleep.

742
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:57,758
I kept thinking over and over again

743
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:00,758
trying to figure out
why you're doing this.

744
00:55:05,598 --> 00:55:07,228
Are you doing this on purpose?

745
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,188
You're pretending
not to know me on purpose, right?

746
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:15,728
Or is it revenge?

747
00:55:17,068 --> 00:55:20,818
Are you still upset with me
that you're getting revenge like this?

748
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,738
But how can you be so cruel
and ignore me like this--

749
00:55:23,828 --> 00:55:24,698
Excuse me.

750
00:55:26,868 --> 00:55:28,618
You were like this last time too.

751
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:31,878
Who are you?

752
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:33,748
What's wrong with you?

753
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:36,208
I'm sorry,

754
00:55:37,758 --> 00:55:39,418
but I have amnesia.

755
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:42,338
So I can't remember anything.

756
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,178
Do you know me?

757
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:52,018
Amnesia?

758
00:55:55,938 --> 00:55:57,818
What the heck are you talking…

759
00:55:59,568 --> 00:56:00,608
Mr. Noh.

760
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:09,748
I suppose he knows me very well too.

761
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,668
LOBBY

762
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:24,298
He has amnesia?

763
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:47,528
It's me. Can you find
some information on a patient?

764
00:56:48,868 --> 00:56:50,788
He's in Room 1202
at Gangneung Medical Center.

765
00:56:51,698 --> 00:56:52,908
His name is Noh Gojin.

766
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:58,918
LAWYER BAE BYUNHO

767
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:01,418
I'm Bae Byunho, a lawyer.
You remember me, don't you?

768
00:57:02,298 --> 00:57:03,418
How did this happen--

769
00:57:04,048 --> 00:57:05,218
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

770
00:57:05,298 --> 00:57:07,428
I just got a call from Mr. Oh.

771
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:10,138
How can you have amnesia?
It's like a bolt from the blue!

772
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:13,268
My heart is still pounding so hard
from the shock.

773
00:57:13,348 --> 00:57:14,478
I'm here…

774
00:57:17,558 --> 00:57:18,568
Please say hello.

775
00:57:19,608 --> 00:57:20,938
That's my fiancée.

776
00:57:21,528 --> 00:57:22,398
Fiancée?

777
00:57:22,488 --> 00:57:23,358
Who?

778
00:57:25,278 --> 00:57:27,068
This person right here.

779
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:30,988
Who?

780
00:57:31,658 --> 00:57:32,618
Don't you know?

781
00:57:33,748 --> 00:57:35,078
She's my secretary.

782
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:36,288
Who?

783
00:57:47,218 --> 00:57:49,508
You're Mr. Noh's fiancée?

784
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:51,558
Yes.

785
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:54,768
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

786
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,228
-Pardon?
-It's odd.

787
00:57:56,308 --> 00:57:57,938
Mr. Noh has amnesia,

788
00:57:58,018 --> 00:57:59,858
and suddenly,
you're saying you're his fiancée.

789
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:02,648
Honestly, I can't help but doubt you.

790
00:58:02,728 --> 00:58:06,068
You know that Mr. Noh's stalker
pretended to be his fiancée before, right?

791
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,068
Fine.

792
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:13,828
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

793
00:58:14,788 --> 00:58:16,288
Are you really Mr. Noh's fiancée?

794
00:58:24,128 --> 00:58:25,258
She is.

795
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:28,008
Mr. Oh.

796
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,088
Hello, sir.

797
00:58:29,178 --> 00:58:30,088
Ms. Lee…

798
00:58:30,968 --> 00:58:32,558
is Mr. Noh's fiancée.

799
00:58:33,178 --> 00:58:34,058
Pardon?

800
00:58:34,138 --> 00:58:36,348
Mr. Noh is especially sensitive
about this issue

801
00:58:36,428 --> 00:58:39,848
because he's harassed
by all sorts of rumors.

802
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:41,858
So he was careful about it.

803
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,028
Oh, I see.

804
00:58:45,608 --> 00:58:47,528
But why did you come here?

805
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:50,818
I asked you to come to my office.

806
00:58:50,908 --> 00:58:53,828
I thought I should pay him a visit.

807
00:58:53,908 --> 00:58:58,788
Don't you know all too well
that people are watching

808
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:01,328
Mr. Noh's every movement?

809
00:59:01,918 --> 00:59:02,748
I'm sorry, sir.

810
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:04,298
Please be careful.

811
00:59:06,048 --> 00:59:07,048
And…

812
00:59:08,218 --> 00:59:09,048
please apologize.

813
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:11,968
I'm sorry.

814
00:59:13,598 --> 00:59:14,598
Okay.

815
00:59:15,848 --> 00:59:17,428
Well, I understand clearly now.

816
00:59:18,058 --> 00:59:20,848
Ma'am, please take care.

817
00:59:21,598 --> 00:59:23,438
-Bye, sir.
-Thank you. I'll give you a call.

818
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:25,358
Is it going down?

819
00:59:25,438 --> 00:59:28,358
ENDOSCOPE, FAMILY REST AREA

820
00:59:33,568 --> 00:59:34,778
When did you get here?

821
00:59:35,618 --> 00:59:36,618
Just now.

822
00:59:38,288 --> 00:59:40,248
How is Gojin? Is everything okay?

823
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:41,788
Yes.

824
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:44,128
That's good. Let's go inside.

825
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:47,668
Wait, I…

826
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:50,548
Thank you for your help earlier.

827
00:59:52,048 --> 00:59:54,138
I just told the truth.

828
00:59:56,928 --> 00:59:59,978
But what about you?

829
01:00:02,938 --> 01:00:06,438
Do I suspect you
to be pretending to be his fiancée?

830
01:00:10,028 --> 01:00:12,028
-It doesn't matter.
-What?

831
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,408
Whether you're really his fiancée or not,

832
01:00:15,488 --> 01:00:16,908
it doesn't matter to me.

833
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:18,908
That's not what's important.

834
01:00:19,868 --> 01:00:21,158
What's important is

835
01:00:21,248 --> 01:00:24,708
the fact that you're by Gojin's side.

836
01:00:25,328 --> 01:00:27,668
Just like the day he got hit by the car.

837
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:32,218
If you weren't there that day,

838
01:00:33,128 --> 01:00:34,178
Gojin would've…

839
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:39,058
died, right?

840
01:00:42,098 --> 01:00:43,978
Just thinking about it makes me shudder.

841
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:47,058
Thank you, Ms. Lee.

842
01:00:49,068 --> 01:00:51,858
Gosh, I called you Ms. Lee again.

843
01:00:52,648 --> 01:00:53,488
Ma'am.

844
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:57,368
I should call you that now, right?

845
01:00:58,028 --> 01:00:59,408
No, it's okay.

846
01:00:59,788 --> 01:01:02,078
Thank you, ma'am.

847
01:01:02,908 --> 01:01:04,168
Oh, okay.

848
01:01:27,188 --> 01:01:28,108
