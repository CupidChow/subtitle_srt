1
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,970
CRAZY LOVE

2
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,950
CRAZY LOVE

3
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,290
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,880
Kang Min, you gambling addict.

5
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,960
Does it still look like…

6
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,260
I have amnesia to you?

7
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,980
I know what you have done.

8
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,060
Run away quickly.

9
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,440
Noh Gojin has amnesia.

10
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,440
I'm the one who sent it.

11
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,280
Great bait, wasn't it?

12
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,790
I'm so good at fishing.
Want to go fishing with me sometime?

13
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,540
I didn't realize

14
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,710
I was so good at acting.

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,470
Deceiving people

16
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,010
was a piece of cake.

17
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,050
Of course.

18
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,560
I do have an IQ of 190.

19
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,810
What's wrong?
Did you think you wouldn't get caught?

20
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,150
That's why I said you're so dumb.

21
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,280
Sir, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,120
I was so drunk that day

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,910
that I must've been out of my mind.

24
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,870
Driving drunk on top of
committing a hit-and-run?

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,790
Sir, I'm so sorry.

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,460
I beg for your forgiveness just this once.
Please, sir!

27
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,340
Forgiveness?

28
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,140
That's too bad.
The word doesn't exist in my vocabulary.

29
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,060
As you know,
Noh Gojin isn't a big pushover like that.

30
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,850
You already know that.

31
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,860
Who…

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,450
made you do it?

33
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,750
EPISODE 5

34
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,920
GOTOP EDUCATION
2023 ENTRANCE EXAM INFORMATION SESSION

35
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,640
GOTOP EDUCATION
2023 ENTRANCE EXAM INFORMATION SESSION

36
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,940
Hello, everyone.

37
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,150
Welcome to the Gotop Education
2023 entrance exam information session.

38
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,780
Today's information session is
also being live-streamed

39
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,160
due to overwhelming requests
we received from parents.

40
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,580
Then we will start with
briefing sessions on intensive strategy

41
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,790
for each subject
by Gotop's top instructors.

42
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,170
First, this instructor can help you

43
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,290
get to the very top
even from the very bottom.

44
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,170
So-called the "Miracle English Wiz."

45
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,420
Top English instructor Michelle Lee
will kickstart the briefings.

46
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,720
Everyone, please welcome her
with a round of applause!

47
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,940
MIRACLE ENGLISH WIZ
MICHELLE LEE

48
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,190
I'm English instructor Michelle Lee.

49
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,030
Please clap.

50
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,110
2023 ENTRANCE EXAM INFORMATION SESSION
SPECIAL OPEN LECTURE

51
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,280
Mr. Kang Min?

52
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,240
You can't run from me.

53
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,740
ILPUM EDU CEO PARK YANGTAE

54
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,370
You got me strawberry juice.

55
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
Yes.

56
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,010
Looks tasty.

57
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,720
But I wanted tomato juice.
I guess you got confused.

58
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,810
Still, not bad. Thank you.

59
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,190
Sure.

60
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,440
By the way,

61
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,610
did Mr. Kang Min…

62
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,660
Right. He can't remember.

63
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,870
It's nothing.

64
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,370
Sorry, I'm a little late.

65
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,420
How are you feeling?

66
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,500
Good.

67
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,250
You'll go on stage in 20 minutes.

68
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,250
Okay.

69
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,090
If you feel dizzy, nauseated,

70
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,840
or anything else, just tell me.

71
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,140
I can go up on your behalf.

72
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,850
Are you concerned

73
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,350
that I'll ruin it like the last interview?

74
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,730
Your health is more important than
the entrance exam information session.

75
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,400
Will you really be okay?

76
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,900
I'll be fine.
I feel really great right now.

77
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,700
Okay, I'm glad to hear that.

78
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,200
I'm fine,

79
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,530
so don't worry too much, Segi.

80
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,750
Well, shall we get going then?

81
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay.

82
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,500
I'm done.

83
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,920
Oh, I see.

84
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,760
Here you go.

85
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Be careful.

86
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,940
Which subject will you score high on?

87
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,780
What do I teach?

88
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,190
-Social studies!
-Social studies!

89
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,570
What do you think my answer is?

90
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,530
-Social studies!
-Social studies!

91
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,910
Social studies no matter what.

92
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,910
Social studies is the subject
that you can score high.

93
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,290
Social studies
rather than difficult science.

94
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,660
Choose social studies,
get placed at the top level,

95
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,620
and get good results.

96
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,130
-What?
-Social studies!

97
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,420
Social studies! That's right.

98
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,090
Most parents think only math
and English are important.

99
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,310
But Korean is the real key to the CSAT.

100
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,600
When you convert it to the standard score,
you'll see it clearly.

101
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,940
Let's compare it on the screen.

102
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,650
Here we go.

103
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,820
Ta-da.

104
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,780
Next…

105
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,830
That's right. It's me, Kim Chabae.

106
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,090
Usually, well…

107
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,300
Mr. Noh is here.

108
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,930
Hello.

109
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,470
Hello, Mr. Noh.

110
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,430
Hello, sir.

111
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,350
Wait.

112
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,940
Are you ready?

113
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,990
Wow, I can feel your passion.

114
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,160
I see that the parents
are fervently taking notes.

115
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,540
We're also getting a tremendous number
of real-time comments online.

116
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,210
Then lastly,

117
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,300
this is who you've all been waiting for.

118
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,760
He is the top instructor in Korea
as well as an entrance exam expert.

119
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,430
He's the CEO of Gotop Education,
the industry's No. 1 company.

120
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,600
Mr. Noh Gojin!

121
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,230
KOREA'S TOP INSTRUCTOR
GOTOP EDUCATION CEO NOH GOJIN

122
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:52,450
KOREA'S TOP INSTRUCTOR
GOTOP EDUCATION CEO NOH GOJIN

123
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,220
He's the best.

124
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,230
KOREA'S TOP INSTRUCTOR
GOTOP EDUCATION CEO NOH GOJIN

125
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,260
Hello. I'm Noh Gojin.

126
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,980
What's going on?

127
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,690
Oh, he wanted to stand up to present.

128
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,070
Mr. Noh said that?

129
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,400
Yes.

130
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,500
One second, please.

131
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,760
Didn't you sprain your ankle?

132
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,590
Just do it sitting down.
I'll ask them to zoom in.

133
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,930
-No.
-Why not?

134
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,600
It doesn't look like
it'll make a big difference, right?

135
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,310
But it does.

136
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,060
It makes a significant difference
on people's level of focus.

137
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,730
Even greater for online classes
than in-person ones.

138
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,900
Such a trivial detail yields
a completely different result

139
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,450
and determines
whether it's the best class.

140
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,450
Is that right?

141
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,870
Do you know the difference
between No. 1 and No. 2?

142
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,710
Just a hair's breadth.

143
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,420
The best is distinguished
by one hair's breadth.

144
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,090
That tiny little difference
that everyone just brushes off.

145
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,760
That's why I'm the best.

146
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,760
Because of that tiny difference.

147
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,860
He's the same.

148
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,650
Pardon?

149
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,740
Nothing.

150
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,990
I've held entrance exam
information sessions all over the country.

151
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,660
I've even held many of them abroad.

152
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,000
Amazingly enough,

153
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,550
there is one thing that all parents
and students everywhere have in common.

154
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,460
Guess what that is.

155
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,180
Working hard.

156
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:03,270
Both parents and students believe
that if you just work hard,

157
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,350
you'll be able to get into
the college of your choice.

158
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,070
However, that's such naive thinking. Why?

159
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,030
Because it's missing "on what."

160
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,530
On what?

161
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,990
What should you work hard on and how?

162
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,700
"If you know your enemy and know yourself,
you will not fear a hundred battles."

163
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,120
What's important is strategy.

164
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,500
In order not to lose in a battle at least,

165
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,460
you must know your enemy.

166
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,130
The same goes for the entrance exam.

167
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,840
Strategy is the key…

168
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,470
to my child's successful admission
to college.

169
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,810
Then what is that strategy?
Curious, aren't you?

170
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,610
Let's dive into it together right away.

171
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,610
2023 COLLEGE ENTRANCE
CUSTOMIZED STRATEGY FOR MY CHILD

172
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,370
Some of your children attend
public high schools,

173
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,450
specialized ones, or private ones.

174
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,370
Some are in the top level
and some are in the bottom level.

175
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,410
My goodness.

176
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,960
The children…

177
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,880
Unbelievable. I can't believe
he just got discharged from the hospital.

178
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,630
He didn't even rehearse it once.

179
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,840
How could he

180
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,260
present it so eloquently? Seriously.

181
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,930
I think our CEO is really

182
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,850
the smartest genius in the Universe.

183
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,640
Don't you agree, Mr. Oh?

184
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,980
Yes, he really is a genius.

185
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,940
Be realistic and find the categories
that suit your child.

186
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,860
Regular admission or grade-based?

187
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,280
Comprehensive review or essays?

188
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,530
STRATEGY NO. 1

189
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,790
You gave birth to them,

190
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,250
but you really can't
figure out your own child?

191
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,920
The first strategy.

192
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,550
Understand the key aspects
of the categories that suit your child

193
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,140
and find the most optimal combination.

194
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,720
Second.

195
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,180
Meet the minimum CSAT requirement
of the college.

196
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,360
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

197
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,650
Have a good day.

198
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,740
Every parent shows
love and support for their child,

199
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,740
but that alone won't help your child
get into colleges.

200
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,120
You gave birth to them,

201
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,710
but you really can't
figure out your own child…

202
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,210
I see you're studying.

203
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,800
-Hyesun, what are you doing?
-…financial support.

204
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,760
No matter how smart your child may be,
he can't succeed without such support.

205
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,050
What's wrong with you, Hyesun?

206
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,600
You badmouth him, but you're listening
to his entrance exam information session?

207
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,980
Back off. Those are separate matters.

208
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,520
We need to get revenge,

209
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,150
but my son still needs to go to college.

210
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,820
Don't tell me your son is taking
Noh Gojin's online class too.

211
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,780
What?

212
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,610
Isn't that a given?

213
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,530
Noh Gojin's the best instructor in Korea.

214
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,290
-Wow, you're--
-Amazing, aren't I?

215
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,160
That's why they say moms are strong.

216
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,540
You guys don't have kids.
You wouldn't understand.

217
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,380
It was harder than last year's CSAT.

218
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,710
How much harder I wonder.

219
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,720
No one would imagine he has amnesia.

220
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,760
He's really amazing.

221
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,560
He's just like how he used to be
when we first met.

222
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,480
He's shining so bright.

223
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,960
He's out of this world.

224
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,040
No wonder people worship him.

225
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,380
How could he do such a good job
when he has amnesia?

226
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,050
It really makes no sense at all.

227
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,930
I wish I could be like that too.

228
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,520
What's this?

229
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,610
What's that?

230
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,780
What's this knife?

231
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,290
These are gifts for Mr. Noh,
but there are more--

232
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,010
I was going to cut some fruit.

233
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,230
What's up with this knife?

234
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,320
-The best!
-Wow!

235
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,030
-Mr. Noh, you're so great.
-Awesome.

236
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,530
You did an amazing job.

237
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,490
Everyone, thank you so much
for all your hard work today.

238
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,530
We will continue to look forward to you.

239
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,370
Shall we all cheer together?

240
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,240
Okay, Gotop Education,

241
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,750
-we can do it!
-We can do it!

242
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,120
-Thank you!
-All right!

243
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,120
-Good job!
-Let's go!

244
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,750
-All right!
-Great!

245
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,380
Mr. Noh.

246
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,550
How did I do? Was it all right?

247
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,010
Yes, you did a very good job.

248
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,350
What a relief. I'm glad
I didn't disappoint you this time.

249
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,020
I was so shocked.

250
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,900
The moment you stood up,

251
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,020
I remembered what you told me before.

252
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,570
When we filmed an online class last time,
even though you sprained your ankle,

253
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,780
you insisted on standing to teach
for the entire six hours.

254
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,740
You told me then
that the best is different

255
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,620
just by a hair's breadth.

256
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,080
You said, it may seem
that sitting or standing won't matter,

257
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,040
but that tiny difference
is what sets the best apart.

258
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,090
Do you remember that?

259
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,300
No.

260
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,260
I just thought that I wouldn't
be able to focus if I did it sitting down.

261
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,720
Oh, I see.

262
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,510
I was so startled
thinking you remembered it.

263
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,230
But how could you do such a good job

264
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,440
as if you don't have amnesia?

265
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,360
If I didn't have a meeting tonight,

266
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,570
it would've been great
to grab a drink together.

267
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,320
How unfortunate.

268
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,330
See? They're already rushing me to come.

269
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,370
Yes, I'm on my now. Okay.

270
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,340
Sorry, Gojin.

271
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,500
Oh well. It's okay.

272
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,920
Gojin, let's grab a drink together
for sure next time. Okay?

273
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,590
Ms. Ma?

274
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,470
Yes, sir.

275
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,310
Would you please
walk Mr. Oh to the waiting room?

276
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,560
I have to head out
for an external meeting.

277
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,690
Okay. Please don't worry.
I'll take good care of Mr. Noh.

278
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,110
Mr. Noh, thank you
for all your hard work today.

279
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,860
Mr. Noh,

280
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,740
let me help you walk.

281
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,870
I can walk on my own.

282
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,410
Oh, will you?

283
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,500
-It's dangerous.
-No, it's okay.

284
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,260
Why did he get so many gifts?

285
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,430
Everyone needs to find out
how terrible Mr. Noh Manners actually is.

286
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,320
Did you attend my lecture?

287
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,070
Oh… yes.

288
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,740
It was great.

289
00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:00,030
When you stood up
from your wheelchair like this,

290
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,200
it was so moving.

291
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,120
It looked like a scene out of a movie.

292
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,090
The moment you came on stage,
the comments started to pop up nonstop.

293
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,710
I thought our server was going to explode.

294
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,960
Don't you agree, Ms. Lee?

295
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,130
Yes.

296
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,310
Oh, my gosh!
Look at all these gifts. Seriously.

297
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,480
Your popularity doesn't subside, Mr. Noh.

298
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,770
You are the Sun that will never go out.

299
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,070
The Sun.

300
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,240
So hot.

301
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,030
You're so hot
that my face turned bright red.

302
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,830
Thank you all for your hard work.

303
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,540
Yes, sir.

304
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,170
How about Mr. Oh?

305
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,170
He has an external meeting,
so he headed out first.

306
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,680
Why do you ask?

307
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,800
Just because he isn't here.

308
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,220
I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

309
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,390
Hello?

310
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,310
Yes, I made a reservation.

311
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,030
No, we'll be there soon. Thank you.

312
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,660
It's the barbecue restaurant
that I reserved for our company dinner.

313
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,910
You… can't come, can you?

314
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,500
To what?

315
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,920
The company…

316
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,090
dinner.

317
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,630
Company dinner?

318
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,740
What easy lives they've been having
while I was away.

319
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,580
Are they dressed for a fashion show
or a presentation?

320
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,580
This isn't a fan meet.

321
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,120
If you want to become a celebrity,
go audition for a movie.

322
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,000
You didn't work that hard to be so tired.

323
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,890
Darn it! Company dinner?

324
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,810
What in the world?
Mr. Noh Manners came to a company dinner.

325
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,360
I know. Maybe he really lost his mind.

326
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,610
Perhaps he really did.

327
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,410
Okay, everyone!

328
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:52,160
Today is a historical day for us.

329
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:58,590
Mr. Noh finally joined us
at our company dinner.

330
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,380
Give a round of applause!

331
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,090
Make some noise!

332
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,390
Mr. Noh.

333
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,060
I'm so honored that you joined us
at the company dinner.

334
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,610
Chabae threw such a fuss
saying how he messed up the presentation.

335
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,780
He's forgotten all about it.
He's brownnosing again.

336
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,490
That's why
he's the official brownnoser of Gotop.

337
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,320
He's always brownnosing.

338
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,660
You're so cool.

339
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,290
He's like a little, green puppy.

340
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,500
Okay, everyone.

341
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,500
Please raise your glass.

342
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,300
This is a historical moment.

343
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,840
We must hear a word from Mr. Noh
before we toast, right?

344
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,300
Here, sir.

345
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,070
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

346
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,360
This company dinner is also an investment
that the company is making in you.

347
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,700
I hope you become more valuable tomorrow

348
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,120
-compared to today. Even by 100 won--
-Okay!

349
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,630
Thank you for your great words.

350
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,880
Let's toast for Mr. Noh. Cheers!

351
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,300
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

352
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,590
-Make some noise!
-All right!

353
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,810
Make some noise!

354
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,270
-All right!
-Cheers!

355
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,400
-Cheers!
-All right!

356
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,360
Give me your glass.

357
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,990
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

358
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,620
I'm okay.

359
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,280
-I'm okay.
-I'm sorry.

360
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,740
Jeez, I'm not that drunk.

361
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,450
My goodness. Let me do it.

362
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,790
It's okay. I can do it.

363
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,750
For Gojin.

364
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,000
For Gojin!

365
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,760
I was wondering why
she was acting all pompous.

366
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,720
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

367
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,430
She was currying favor with that old man?

368
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,310
You're dead meat today.

369
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,810
Why is your hand trembling?

370
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,390
-I got a hand tremor.
-Ma'am!

371
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,100
-Yes?
-Cold noodles, please!

372
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,190
Okay, coming right up!

373
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,940
-Ma'am, for you!
-Another serving of meat here, please.

374
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,020
Coming right up.

375
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,990
-This time for sure…
-Your cold noodles are here.

376
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,830
Enjoy your food.

377
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,460
Who else ordered cold noodles?

378
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,220
-What was that? Are you okay?
-Gosh!

379
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,850
Idiot. He's all over the place.

380
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,770
Mr. Kim, are you all right?

381
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,200
I'm okay.

382
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,280
As long as the missus is fine.

383
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,490
-Missus?
-Missus?

384
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,700
Who?

385
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,410
Gosh, Ms. Ma.

386
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,960
Can't you be more careful? Seriously!

387
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,500
What…

388
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,550
Do you know who she is?

389
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,380
She's Mr. Noh's fian--

390
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,220
Shall we go for the second round?

391
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,100
-Second round!
-Second round!

392
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:45,900
-Second round!
-Second round!

393
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,190
For Gotop!

394
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,070
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

395
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,580
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

396
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,340
Have a drink, have a drink, have a drink

397
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,430
Let's keep drinking until the end
Have a drink

398
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,720
Tonight, you and I

399
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,640
Will become one
Drink, drink, drink, drink

400
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,600
Why would you slow down?

401
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,020
-Go on, down it.
-Cheers!

402
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,690
On Monday, Mr. Gong buys drinks

403
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,940
All right, all right

404
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,820
On Tuesday, Mr. Hwang buys drinks

405
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,410
On Wednesday…

406
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,700
Okay, everyone.

407
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,750
Cheers!

408
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,290
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

409
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,590
Do you get the joke?

410
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,340
Have a drink, have a drink, have a drink

411
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,970
Let's keep drinking until the end
Have a drink

412
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,140
Tonight, you and I

413
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,390
Will become one
Drink, drink, drink, drink

414
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,440
Have a drink, have a drink, have a drink

415
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,360
Let's have another drink. Here you go.

416
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,270
Gosh, it's too much.

417
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,820
Why don't you ever finish?

418
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,780
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

419
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,410
Ms. Lee. Let's have a glass together.

420
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,320
Cheers.

421
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,580
Here.

422
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,790
Drink up now.

423
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,790
Ms. Lee.

424
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,670
-Ms. Lee!
-Ms. Lee!

425
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,210
-Ms. Lee!
-How long will you make us dance and wait?

426
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,760
Drink up now.

427
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,890
-Ms. Lee!
-Ms. Lee!

428
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,810
-Ms. Lee!
-Ms. Lee!

429
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,180
-Ms. Lee!
-Ms. Lee!

430
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,900
Okay. Please fill up your glass.

431
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,110
It's the first time ever
Mr. Noh has joined our company dinner.

432
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,070
We must celebrate.

433
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,200
For Mr. Noh! Cheers!

434
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,620
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

435
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,710
Cheers?

436
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,220
Cheers.

437
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,120
One glass doesn't seem enough.

438
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,080
Come on.

439
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,420
Make some noise!

440
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Jeez.

441
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:14,820
Two glasses don't seem enough either.

442
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,840
Let's all drink!

443
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:49,850
Quiet!

444
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,190
Next up.

445
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,060
Mr. Noh!

446
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,170
All right, Mr. Noh!

447
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:27,050
As you leave

448
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,270
You wave your hand

449
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,690
As if you're leaving me

450
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,480
Someday

451
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:42,610
It'll become a memory

452
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,200
If I long for you

453
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,870
Maybe I'll get to see you again one day

454
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,540
Like in the movies

455
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,460
I hope a miracle happens

456
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,960
Because I couldn't keep our love

457
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,010
In those difficult times

458
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,180
You remain in my memories

459
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,560
Of the beautiful past

460
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,060
I'll sing a song.

461
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,230
CANCEL

462
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,190
See you again one day…

463
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,110
Gosh, my ears hurt.

464
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,820
What happened?
Why did the song suddenly stop?

465
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,740
I'm sorry.

466
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,620
Why would you be sorry?
Good job. Well done.

467
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,210
I'm sorry.

468
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,430
That was very wrong of you.

469
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,550
Then Ms. Lee,

470
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,680
please sing a song as a penalty!

471
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,020
Ms. Lee!

472
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,640
-Ms. Lee!
-Ms. Lee!

473
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,690
-Ms. Lee!
-Ms. Lee!

474
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,480
-Come on!
-Ms. Lee!

475
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,820
I WANT TO FALL IN LOVE

476
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,540
I exercise

477
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,420
And work hard

478
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:26,970
On weekends, I go to the movies too

479
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,850
-I guess every man to his trade.
-I go to a bookstore

480
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,230
I get immersed in a book

481
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:44,190
And my heart flutters
At the unfamiliar world

482
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:50,410
A life like this really seems nice

483
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,620
I'm living such a great life

484
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,920
Then why?

485
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,040
I'm so lonely

486
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,010
Tears roll down my cheeks

487
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:14,720
Even when my life is so splendid

488
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,060
Loneliness approaches

489
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,860
And asks me a question

490
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:30,490
Are you really happy at this moment?

491
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,490
-And I answer
-You're totally captivated.

492
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,290
I'm so lonely

493
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:45,290
What is the reason for my existence?

494
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,840
What is love?

495
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,930
I'm really curious

496
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:59,180
I'm in love, but I'm still lonely

497
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,480
What is life…

498
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,230
Oh, no!

499
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,030
My bad!

500
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,240
Darn it.

501
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,030
Oh, no. That was terrible of me.

502
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,240
-Gosh.
-I'm so sorry.

503
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,330
You were singing so well.

504
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,500
As an apology, I'll offer you a drink.

505
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,750
You sing so well.

506
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,340
You're so great

507
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,000
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

508
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,260
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

509
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,220
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

510
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,260
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

511
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,550
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

512
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,230
Ms. Ma,

513
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,520
what are you doing to the missus?

514
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,100
What's going on?

515
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:50,070
Chabae, why do you
keep looking for the "missus"?

516
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,690
Because he's drunk.

517
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,320
Drunk?

518
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,160
Mr. Kim, I guess you're very drunk.

519
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,120
Your wife is at home.
Why are you asking for her here?

520
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,960
Who's drunk? I'm not drunk!

521
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:10,090
The missus is right over here.

522
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:15,630
Gotop Education CEO Noh Gojin's fiancée!

523
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,010
-Fiancée?
-Fiancée?

524
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,390
-Fiancée?
-Seriously?

525
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,720
-Fiancée?
-No way.

526
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,060
Ms. Lee?

527
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,100
Fian…

528
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,150
You're Mr. Noh's… fiancée?

529
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,940
Ms. Lee is engaged?

530
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,820
Mr. Noh, I'll protect you.

531
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,490
-Ew.
-Gosh.

532
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,590
I'm sorry…

533
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,280
Mr. Noh!

534
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,950
It's Noh Gojin! Noh Gojin's right here!

535
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,870
Are you trying to take advantage of me
pretending to drive me home?

536
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,460
You scumbag!

537
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,840
-Scumbag, my foot--
-I really hate you!

538
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,090
Sir, are you driving me home?

539
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,920
I didn't know you could be so kind.

540
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,380
By the way,
why are you carrying this around?

541
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,760
-Let me lean on your shoulder.
-You…

542
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,760
My goodness.
You two look so happy together.

543
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,470
What?

544
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,440
No!

545
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,860
No. Cover your mouth like that.

546
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,320
True love is to show everything you got.

547
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,360
Even what's inside of you.

548
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,280
True love, my foot!

549
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,950
Gosh, my head hurts so much.

550
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,880
Disgusting!

551
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,510
Calm down.

552
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,890
Calm down. I'm Noh Gojin.

553
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,400
I've gone through all sorts
of hardship in life and still survived.

554
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,440
The only one in the Universe.
Noh Gojin the best.

555
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,930
It's me.

556
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,140
Your fiancée.

557
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,140
What idiots.

558
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,020
They believed that?

559
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,690
Fiancée, my foot.

560
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,950
Look at this face.
Why would I get engaged to her?

561
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,050
I need you to take care of something here.

562
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,370
Fiancée?

563
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:21,630
That ordinary-looking secretary
is that punk Noh Gojin's fiancée?

564
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,970
Yes. That was the reason

565
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,760
why that insolent Ms. Lee
didn't quit her job for a year.

566
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,180
She enticed Noh Gojin.

567
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:36,810
Wow, she's amazingly skilled.

568
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,350
Why didn't I notice her?

569
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,280
You're close to her, aren't you?

570
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,280
Pardon?

571
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,290
We're best friends.

572
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,210
Great.

573
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,250
Help me when I get on with my plan.

574
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,300
You brought it, right?

575
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,840
Yes.

576
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,940
NOH GOJIN'S MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS

577
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,070
At the meeting held in Gangneung,
Mr. Noh added new questions

578
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,610
and even reviewed it himself.

579
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:30,200
It's the final version
to be published next month.

580
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,570
Is that so?

581
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,870
NOH GOJIN'S MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS

582
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,210
Where am I?

583
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,180
I slept on the street?

584
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:45,190
Thank you, but I don't need it.

585
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Just toss it.

586
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,480
Pardon?

587
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,150
Who's here so early in the morning?

588
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,860
Who is it?

589
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,330
Do you remember me?

590
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,790
You're that person from last time.

591
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,090
You came to my hospital room.

592
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,710
You do remember me.

593
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,970
But what brings you to my house?

594
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,350
Oh, I moved in downstairs.

595
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,140
This is rice cake as a moving-in treat.
Please try some.

596
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,070
Aren't you going to accept it?

597
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,780
Oh, yes.

598
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,720
It's just like when we first met.

599
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,590
You need to be careful.

600
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,720
Blades can be very dangerous.

601
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,110
I'm not!

602
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,280
I'm not a student here.

603
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,620
Why are you treating me like a kid?

604
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,530
You're not that old either.

605
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,620
But why are you talking down to me?

606
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,710
Because you did it first.

607
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,750
So you are a kid.

608
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,170
You have to return

609
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,590
my handkerchief, okay?

610
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:27,950
Do you remember?

611
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,040
Remember what?

612
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,340
Let's introduce ourselves again.

613
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,880
Hello, Mr. Noh Gojin.

614
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,470
My name is Baek Sooyeong.

615
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:46,180
Let's be friends.

616
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:56,730
Sina!

617
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,400
-Are you heading to the theater?
-Yes.

618
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:07,120
You reek of alcohol.
You must've gotten wasted.

619
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,790
My goodness.

620
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:12,870
But where did you drink
that you look so awful?

621
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,670
You look like you slept on the streets.

622
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,090
What is this smell? Did you vomit?

623
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,630
No, I didn't.

624
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:32,440
Jeez. You should always be prepared.

625
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:36,230
Even though he lost his memories,
he's still a guy.

626
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,860
Mr. Noh Manners might kiss you
without warning.

627
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,240
-Hey!
-You startled me.

628
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,320
When you act,
sometimes there are kissing scenes.

629
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:50,200
You should be prepared for that
by brushing your teeth and washing up.

630
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,620
That's my advice to you
as your master of acting.

631
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:53,910
Hey. Go now.

632
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,960
Hurry inside and wash up, okay? Bye!

633
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,010
Why can't I remember?

634
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,280
Does it cause memory loss too?

635
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:32,450
I should speed things up.

636
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,630
Look at you startled.

637
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,930
Honey, you make it so obvious
that you were exempt

638
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:53,680
from military service,
which everyone else fulfills.

639
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,810
What a feeble man.

640
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,070
Come on, get up!
We have to go to the hospital now!

641
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,280
Get up! We have to go now! Run!

642
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,800
This is… the hospital?

643
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,300
We're going to the hospital next week.

644
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,300
We have to prep ahead and look nice
to go to the hospital next week.

645
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,180
You're a star, honey.

646
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,140
We have to prepare in advance. Right?

647
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,650
-Welcome.
-Hello.

648
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:44,440
Isn't this…

649
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,990
the women's section?

650
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,160
We're buying clothes for me.

651
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,490
You're still sick.

652
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,700
You're sick. No point in looking nice.

653
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,040
The way I look reflects on you.

654
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,090
I'm the fiancée
of the CEO of Gotop Education,

655
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,380
the No. 1 private education company
in Korea.

656
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,550
If I dress poorly,

657
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,800
people will talk bad about you.

658
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:11,970
They'll call you stingy.

659
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,470
Stingy?

660
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,270
That dress is so pretty.

661
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,980
Thank you.

662
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,860
That card…

663
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,490
The corporate card.

664
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,410
-The corporate card?
-Yes.

665
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,580
Gotop Education corporate credit card.

666
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:20,830
I don't have any other card
except this corporate credit card.

667
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,710
So I paid your hospital bills
and all other expenses with this card.

668
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,550
That's crazy…

669
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,760
The company credit card
isn't a personal credit card.

670
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:38,060
You shouldn't use
the corporate credit card

671
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:41,020
for personal use. Don't you think?

672
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,940
Come on. It's all yours anyway, honey.

673
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:51,400
By any chance, do you feel like
you're wasting money on me?

674
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:56,280
Do you care about this money more than me?

675
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:58,870
Is that so? Is that the case?

676
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,290
How could you care more
about money than me?

677
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:02,660
How could you be like that?

678
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,040
How could you care more
about money than me?

679
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,630
You choose money over me?

680
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:09,250
-How could you--
-No, it's not that.

681
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,710
It's not, right? I knew it.

682
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,630
You're a fool who only cares about me.

683
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:19,050
That outfit is so pretty.

684
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:20,760
I'll get that one too.

685
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:44,120

688
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,080
Hello.

689
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,670
-Hello.
-Hello.

690
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,930
What was that about?

691
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,480
Hello.

692
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:48,270
Hello.

693
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,020
-Hello.
-Hello.

694
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,400
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

695
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,940
-Hello.
-Hello.

696
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,610
-Hello.
-Hello.

697
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,190
Hello.

698
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,950
Hello.

699
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:01,740
-Hello.
-Hello.

700
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,410
-Hello.
-Hello.

701
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:08,960
Hello.

702
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,500
It was Mr. Kim Chabae, wasn't it?

703
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,510
Yes. He told people at the company dinner.

704
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,050
You went to the company dinner?

705
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,590
Gojin too?

706
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:22,550
Yes.

707
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,890
Amnesia really changes a person.

708
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,190
Gojin really hates company dinners.

709
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,020
It worked out for the best.

710
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:35,940
Pardon?

711
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,860
Because of the fiancée issue,
his behavior change will be less obvious.

712
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,320
No one would imagine that he has amnesia.

713
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,370
Since people already found out,

714
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,460
please be proactive as his fiancée.

715
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,040
-Pardon?
-Ma'am, you can do it!

716
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,170
What? I can…

717
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,110
Here are yesterday's purchases
that were restocked today

718
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:18,230
and the additional items
ordered over the phone.

719
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,150
Addi--

720
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:24,910
Additional orders?

721
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:25,990
Yes, sir.

722
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,540
Okay.

723
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,120
Thank you.

724
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:52,480
She should be in my office by now.

725
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,560
Where did he put it?

726
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,540
…so it was revealed.

727
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,120
But, news of the rising interest rate…

728
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,880
What? I didn't turn it on.

729
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,670
…is making domestic companies that have
invested in Asian countries more anxious.

730
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,130
Next, crime and accident news.

731
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,760
The hit-and-run driver who hit
Gotop Education CEO Noh Gojin

732
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,300
turned himself in today.

733
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,600
The hit-and-run driver was Kang,
an instructor at Gotop Education.

734
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,980
He testified that he acted

735
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,770
out of anger holding a grudge
after being terminated.

736
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:37,690
No way.

737
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:38,770
After the crime, Kang…

738
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:40,860
Sora, you're here.

739
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,690
-Did you… see the news?
-The news?

740
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:46,610
What news out of the blue?

741
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,120
That Mr. Noh Manners… He is arrested.

742
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,620
Mr. Noh Manners is arrested?
What are you talking about?

743
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,580
The hit-and-run driver.

744
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:56,540
-He got caught?
-He got caught?

745
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:59,080
-Kang Min.
-Who?

746
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:01,840
You mean, the same Kang Min that we know?

747
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,010
Yes.

748
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,140
Mr. Kang Min, who got fired
due to gambling, is the culprit.

749
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:14,350
My goodness. I can't believe
that Mr. Kang Min was the culprit.

750
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:17,350
That's nonsense.
How could Kang Min be the culprit?

751
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,310
I know.

752
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,400
I went to Gotop
because I liked Mr. Kang Min.

753
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:25,030
Hey, guys!

754
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:26,860
-You're one step behind today.
-What?

755
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:30,120
We know that Mr. Kang Min is the culprit,
and we're already in shock.

756
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,910
Not that one.

757
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,580
It's about Ms. Lee.

758
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,120
What about Ms. Lee?

759
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:38,750
She's the fiancée.

760
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,630
I see. She got engaged? Jeez.

761
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:45,340
They say,
a fair face may hide a foul heart.

762
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,720
Then she'll quit being a secretary?

763
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,180
-She quit?
-She quit?

764
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,180
No!

765
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,060
She's Mr. Noh Manners' fiancée.

766
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:59,140
She's the wife of Gotop Education's CEO.

767
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:00,060
-What?
-What?

768
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:02,060
Jeez, what's wrong with you girls?

769
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,230
How do you feel right now?

770
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,070
Please say a word to Mr. Noh Gojin.

771
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:15,290
Who… made you to do it?

772
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,950
-Pardon?
-The accomplice.

773
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:22,630
The accomplice you're working with
who wants to kill me. Who is it?

774
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:24,960
There's no accomplice.

775
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:28,340
I did it all on my own.
I'm telling the truth.

776
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,180
Do you expect me to believe that?

777
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,680
Yes, Mr. Noh. It was all me.
I'm really telling the truth.

778
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,560
Okay, fine.

779
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:45,400
In any case, you need to disappear.
Where do you want to go?

780
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:48,820
Do you want to keep your mouth shut
and turn yourself in

781
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,490
to remain as a hit-and-run driver…

782
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,250
or become a murderer
who came back to kill me?

783
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,250
But…

784
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,290
Choose wisely.

785
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:04,130
-You only get one chance.
-Sir.

786
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:06,090
For your information,
whichever one you choose

787
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,380
is fine with me.

788
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,390
Don't you have any words
for Mr. Noh Gojin?

789
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,470
I'm sorry.

790
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,600
We'll go inside now.

791
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,020
-Moving through, please.
-What were your motives?

792
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,150
Did you see the news--

793
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:32,990
The culprit who hit me with a car
finally turned himself in.

794
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,160
I heard he's one of our instructors.

795
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,080
Yes.

796
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,250
Gojin.

797
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:47,750
So you saw the news.

798
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,220
Are you all right?

799
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,220
Yes.

800
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,370
Darn it!

801
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,380
