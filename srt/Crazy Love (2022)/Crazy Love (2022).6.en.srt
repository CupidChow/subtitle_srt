1
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,980
CRAZY LOVE

2
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,320
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

3
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,290
Number 879. You have a visitor.

4
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,340
EPISODE 6

5
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,800
HOPE DETENTION CENTER

6
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,370
Isn't that…

7
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,830
the deputy CEO of Gotop Education?

8
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,750
Why was he here?

9
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,830
Jeez.

10
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,340
Mr. Noh Manners, that punk. What is he
scheming now that he sent him here?

11
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,420
What time is the visitation?

12
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,030
Mr. Noh, let's eat--

13
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,080
Gojin, you shouldn't
climb up like that already.

14
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,450
Be careful. It's unsafe. Come down.

15
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,540
It's okay. I'm really fine now.

16
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,340
Gosh.

17
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,960
Wow, but what's all this?

18
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,970
Math isn't my expertise,
but it looks unique.

19
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,850
I write it out for fun.

20
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,680
It's like a game.

21
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,850
A game?

22
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,180
The world of a math genius is
totally beyond my comprehension.

23
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,270
Hold my hand.

24
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:29,900
What's wrong?

25
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,200
Nothing.

26
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,740
Here. Okay, let's eat.

27
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,330
Ta-da. I bought these too.

28
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,130
When we used to
practically live in the office,

29
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,960
we ate this until we got sick of it.

30
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,430
I thought you might remember that time
if you saw this.

31
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:54,890
Try it.

32
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,900
It tastes good.

33
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,570
This is good
since I haven't had it in a while.

34
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,570
Where is Ms. Lee?

35
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,120
She had a quick errand to run
on her lunchtime.

36
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,410
By the way, Gojin…

37
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,580
can you talk comfortably around me now?

38
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,710
Since you keep acting so formal,

39
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,670
I feel awkward…

40
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,130
and a bit sad.

41
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,390
Hey, Segi.

42
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,060
Yes. That's it.

43
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,440
Keep that up from now on. Okay?

44
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,940
Did you just get here?

45
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,410
I went to see you earlier,
but they said you weren't at work yet.

46
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,700
Oh, I had an external meeting.

47
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,990
I see.

48
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,910
By the way,

49
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,040
was Kang Min his name?
That hit-and-run instructor.

50
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,250
Yes. Why do you ask?

51
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,010
I want to visit him.

52
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,420
Visit him?

53
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,640
But you can't even remember him.
What would you visit him for?

54
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,390
I want to ask him…

55
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,850
why he did that to me.

56
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,350
KANG, HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER,
FORMER GOTOP EMPLOYEE, TURNS HIMSELF IN

57
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Getting goosebumps again.

58
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,730
I can't believe
Mr. Kang Min was the culprit.

59
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,490
I was so shocked
that I couldn't even sleep.

60
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,160
That arrogant punk Kang Min kept gambling

61
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,950
and now his life is practically over.

62
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,080
Wait a second.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,210
Was that why?

64
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,460
What are you talking about?

65
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:51,960
Nothing.

66
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,840
-Gosh, what?
-Come on, Mr. Gong!

67
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,630
Well, Mr. Noh Manners
became so nice recently.

68
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,760
He came to a company dinner

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,550
and even greets you with a smile
as if he lost his mind.

70
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,350
I thought that was because
he had brain damage from the accident.

71
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,770
But that's not the case.

72
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,690
He's like that because of Kang Min.

73
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,360
He's totally frightened
because of Kang Min.

74
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,030
It's because he's afraid that one of us
will try to kill him like Kang Min.

75
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,280
I can guarantee it. I do.

76
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,110
You're right. That's it.

77
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,740
No, he's not frightened
because of Kang Min.

78
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,950
Then why did he change?

79
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,660
-Ms. Lee.
-Ms. Lee?

80
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,830
-Ms. Lee?
-He changed because he fell in love.

81
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,460
-Nah.
-That's nonsense.

82
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,510
Men are so dense.

83
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,430
What changes people is love, not fear.

84
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,850
It's totally like a romance novel.

85
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,520
A bad boy falls in love
and becomes gentle as a lamb.

86
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,690
What? Mr. Noh Manners
sent out a group e-mail.

87
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,910
What? Why would he send a group e-mail?

88
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,410
What is this?

89
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,580
What's wrong?

90
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,240
Announcement to all employees.

91
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,160
Let's all go home
right on time starting today.

92
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,880
If you haven't used
your monthly and annual vacation days…

93
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,090
…please use them ASAP.

94
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,550
And starting this month, every two weeks,

95
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,050
I'll pay for the company dinners
of all departments.

96
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,880
However, the menu must be beef.

97
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,970
That's all.

98
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,760
SEND
SUBJECT: ADVISING ALL EMPLOYEES

99
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,850
MAIL SENT SUCCESSFULLY

100
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,520
My goodness!

101
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,140
My goodness! Mr. Park!

102
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,560
Mr. Park, look! Look at this!

103
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,190
It says we'll eat beef
for all of our company dinners.

104
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,900
What's happening?

105
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,780
Seriously?

106
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,950
Fiancée?

107
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,250
Hyun, did you see this?

108
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,330
-Yes. Insane.
-Seriously?

109
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,090
Ms. Ma!

110
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,130
What?

111
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,630
This.

112
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,420
ADVISING ALL EMPLOYEES

113
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,590
What's this?

114
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,680
Did Noh Gojin really lose his mind?

115
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,380
It's the first business you started
independent of your family.

116
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,630
How do you feel?

117
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,920
I've prepared a lot,

118
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,010
so I'm confident.

119
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,390
Please write many good reviews.

120
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,640
Of course. Don't worry.

121
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,930
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but Ms. Baek has another appointment now.

122
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,730
-Sure, it's okay.
-Thank you for coming.

123
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,310
Thank you.

124
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,650
You have a visitor.

125
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,980
A visitor?

126
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,070
WISHING YOU PROSPERITY
ILPUM EDU CEO PARK YANGTAE

127
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,370
Mr. Park!

128
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,410
My goodness.
So good to see you, Instructor Baek--

129
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,540
No… CEO Baek.

130
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,000
It's been so long.

131
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,960
I know. It feels like yesterday
you were an intern at Ilpum Edu.

132
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,590
Please have a seat. Let's have some tea.

133
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,180
Your office is great.

134
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,650
We can have tea another time.

135
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:43,150
More importantly,
how could you deceive me like that?

136
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,610
I couldn't believe

137
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,950
you're the youngest daughter
of Gunil Group's owner.

138
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,740
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,200
But I didn't hide it to deceive you.

140
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,950
I just wanted to be Baek Sooyeong,

141
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,960
not the youngest daughter
of Gunil Group's owner.

142
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,790
You're so humble.

143
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,880
The class of a person of nobility
is on another level.

144
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,210
By the way, this is for you.

145
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,430
What is it?

146
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,350
You're one of us now.

147
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,230
You should come to the Private Education
Development Association's regular events.

148
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,600
Already?

149
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,230
I thought I could attend
starting next year or so.

150
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,820
Don't I need to wait a year in general?

151
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,200
I'm the chairman of KPEDA.

152
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,990
Don't worry about a thing
and just attend, Ms. Baek.

153
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,250
I'll give Baek Edu
a splendid welcome ceremony.

154
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,040
Thank you, Mr. Park.

155
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,100
The heavens are surely on my side.

156
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,100
If I have Baek Edu on my side,

157
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,520
it's only a matter of time
until I destroy Gotop. That's right.

158
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,240
Shall I start working
on the missus of Gotop now?

159
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,910
Hello, Ms. Ma.

160
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,830
Pardon? That Lee Sina…

161
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,790
Ms. Lee Sina?

162
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,210
Yes. Understood, sir.

163
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,220
What for? Why Lee Sina?

164
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,930
-Hello.
-Hello, sir.

165
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,930
-Hello.
-How are you?

166
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,060
Sir.

167
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,610
Thank you for taking care of all of us.

168
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,280
SEGI

169
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,410
Gojin, great job.

170
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,620
I thank you too!

171
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,540
What's wrong?

172
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,250
I'm not sure
why everyone's thanking me today.

173
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,510
Let's go. We'll be late
for the doctor's appointment.

174
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,930
-Have a good day, sir.
-Bye.

175
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,430
Thanks, you two. You must be hungry.

176
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,810
Have some of this first.

177
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,650
Guys! It's totally crazy!

178
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,490
How did you know
that it was totally crazy for us today?

179
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,860
No, I meant that it's crazy at Gotop.

180
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,820
What happened there?

181
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,370
Listen.

182
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,870
Mr. Noh Manners said
that he'll boost employee welfare,

183
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,040
and told us to only eat beef
at company dinners.

184
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,460
Our cleaning department is also
having a company dinner today

185
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,760
eating beef.

186
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,170
-Is he crazy?
-Is he crazy?

187
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,430
Yes, he sure is crazy.

188
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:03,520
Goodness. He's gone crazy the moment
he fell for that clumsy Ms. Lee.

189
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,440
But I totally welcome him
losing his mind this way.

190
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,030
See? I told you
that I had a bad feeling about it.

191
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,660
I suspected Ms. Lee to be the culprit.

192
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,530
But it turns out that she's his fiancée.
That's crazy.

193
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,080
I know. It's more shocking to me
that Ms. Lee is his fiancée

194
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,120
than Kang Min being the culprit.

195
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,790
What if we had asked her to join us?

196
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,250
That would've been a total disaster.

197
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,590
Then what do we do now?

198
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,090
What do you mean?
We continue with our plan.

199
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,840
-Yes.
-Well,

200
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,560
you shouldn't get emotional
when taking revenge like Kang Min.

201
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,890
That results in a crime.

202
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,730
So, you have to keep your cool.

203
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,940
Like us.

204
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,860
HOPE DETENTION CENTER

205
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,960
Why did you come?

206
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,800
I said I'd come by myself.

207
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,170
I was worried about you.

208
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,470
MEETING ROOM

209
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,200
How is your health?

210
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
I'm…

211
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,490
all right.

212
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,040
That's good.

213
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,830
Your health is important,
so make sure to eat--

214
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,130
Mr. Oh.

215
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,210
Yes?

216
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,050
Can you…

217
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,760
give us a moment?

218
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,470
I want to speak to Mr. Kang Min alone.

219
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,730
MEETING ROOM

220
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,710
It's Lee Sina, isn't it?

221
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,290
Lee Sina

222
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,960
lured me out
of my vacation house that night.

223
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,010
And you waited and hit me with a car.

224
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,840
You and Lee Sina are accomplices, right?

225
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,680
-Sir, what do you mean…
-What?

226
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,890
Are you going to deny
knowing who Lee Sina is?

227
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,900
Yes. I don't really know
who you're talking about.

228
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,030
You two were meeting in front of me too.

229
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,410
But you still don't know?

230
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,830
I did?

231
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,200
When?

232
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,040
I don't really know who Ms. Lee Sina is.

233
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,170
You punk. Is that what they teach you
in prison? To deny everything?

234
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,970
Lee Sina?

235
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,310
Who the heck is Lee Sina…

236
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,360
Sir, I really don't know who Lee Sina is,

237
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,360
and there was no accomplice.

238
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:45,200
I turned myself in and came to prison.
I have nothing else to hide, you know?

239
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,490
You know my secretary, right?

240
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,460
Yes, your secretary…

241
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,130
who's been working under you for a year--

242
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,380
That's… Ms. Lee Sina?

243
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,110
Ms. Sina. I have to tell you something.

244
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,730
I'll wait for you until you come
to the Seeun Department Store lounge.

245
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,700
Why is she so late?

246
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,790
Ms. Sina.

247
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,550
DEATH THREAT
ACCIDENT IN FRONT OF VACATION HOUSE

248
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,170
ACCOMPLICES? SINCE WHEN?
D-DAY

249
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,760
AMNESIA

250
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,390
ONLY ONE WHO WORKED FOR A YEAR
POSSIBLY SOME OTHER PURPOSE?

251
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,470
THROWS RESIGNATION LETTER
AT THE VACATION HOUSE

252
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,680
PRETENDS TO BE THE FIANCÉE

253
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,180
CUT-UP DOLL
DEAD RAT AND DEATH THREAT

254
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,390
TOP ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR
GAMBLES ABROAD, BAD FINANCE

255
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,530
Kang Min doesn't know who Lee Sina is.

256
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,410
The two are not accomplices.

257
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,790
The perfect timing

258
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,210
was just a coincidence.

259
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,130
If so…

260
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,760
why is Lee Sina… doing this?

261
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,860
PRIVATE DETECTIVE

262
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,410
We're here.

263
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,250
Why are we here?

264
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,590
Congratulations on your engagement.

265
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,760
Why so surprised? Was it a secret?

266
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,310
How could Mr. Noh get engaged
so discreetly like a thief?

267
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,730
I wonder if there's a reason for that.

268
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,480
Got a bun in the oven?

269
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,150
-No!
-It's okay.

270
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,650
Don't feel embarrassed.
That's how things are these days.

271
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,530
That darn punk… I mean,

272
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,870
Mr. Noh, who I care about
like my own child, is engaged.

273
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,490
I must congratulate you. Right?

274
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,450
Here you go. Pick one.

275
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,580
-Pardon?
-A betrothal present.

276
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,840
If one isn't enough,

277
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,470
you can pick two.

278
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,220
Oh… okay.

279
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,430
Please pick.

280
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,450
Mr. Park, I can't accept it.

281
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,410
Is this the wench?

282
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,050
-Honey!
-"Honey"?

283
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,140
You've been quiet for a while.
You're cheating again?

284
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,020
Honey, how did you know I was here?

285
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,900
What? Are you upset
that you got caught red-handed?

286
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,320
Who the heck are you?

287
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,280
Me?

288
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,160
No, it's not like that.
Honey, it's not what you think!

289
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,700
If not,

290
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,870
why would you buy this wench a bag?
You're just a figurehead.

291
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,540
The thing is that this lady is…

292
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,460
"This lady"?

293
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,300
-Hey, did you hit on him?
-Honey!

294
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,880
-Honey, no!
-Did you hit on him?

295
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,550
-Stop it, honey!
-You did, didn't you?

296
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,010
-You wench!
-Stop!

297
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,720
-Who do you think you are?
-Honey, no!

298
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,180
Please let go!

299
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,060
You bit me?

300
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,320
You bit me because of that wench?

301
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,070
Honey, please calm down and listen to me.

302
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,780
Listen to what?

303
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,130
Gosh.

304
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,680
Who the heck are you?

305
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,510
Who are you, old lady?

306
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,560
Old lady--

307
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,690
Hey! Who do you think you are?

308
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,640
Me?

309
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,650
I'm the CEO of Gotop Education.

310
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,570
This woman?

311
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,860
She's my fiancée.

312
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,490
I told you you had it wrong!

313
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,990
Over here.

314
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,990
Yes, sir.

315
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,660
From here to there.

316
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,670
Pack them all up.

317
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,300
All of them?

318
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,170
She'll pay for them.

319
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:38,920
Ring them up.

320
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,550
Why do I have to do that… sir?

321
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,180
You need to apologize.

322
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,980
You grabbed my fiancée by the hair.

323
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,860
Did you think… apologizing was enough?

324
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,820
Jeez, you've watched too many soaps.

325
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,200
When villains just apologize,

326
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,620
the main characters always forgive them.

327
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,200
You think it's the same in real life?

328
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,750
Come to your senses. Don't be so naive.

329
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,170
Or…

330
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,720
are you poor?

331
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,800
You don't have money?

332
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,730
And yet you assaulted my woman?

333
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,190
How dare you.

334
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,360
You should know your place.

335
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,950
Do you want to apologize now…

336
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,540
or become the laughingstock
of the nation by being on tonight's news?

337
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,630
On top of it, your husband's company
will become famous too.

338
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,600
Here… you go.

339
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,010
No!

340
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,780
-That crazy punk.
-Oh, no.

341
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,280
Damn Mr. Noh Manners.

342
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,780
No way…

343
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,330
Oh, my gosh!

344
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,920
Do this to all of them,

345
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,550
and send them
to the CEO's office at Ilpum Edu.

346
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,070
Welcome, ma'am.

347
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,240
It's been so long. Have you been well?

348
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,540
Yes, ma'am.

349
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,580
The luxury goods department's closing time
will be delayed by about ten minutes.

350
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,710
-I apologize.
-What happened?

351
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,670
We had a little bit of trouble.

352
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,220
-Trouble?
-It's nothing serious.

353
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,680
Shall we go inside?

354
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,270
Let's get in.

355
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,190
Oh, my phone.

356
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,580
Going down.

357
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,670
I was… a little dizzy.

358
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,730
Are you okay?

359
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,080
Hello?

360
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,580
Sina? It's Mr. Chu calling.

361
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,960
Hello, Mr. Chu. How are you?

362
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,670
Hey, why isn't Sooho picking up his phone?

363
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,380
Tell him to come home right away.

364
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,540
May I ask why?

365
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,840
Your dad's tractor rolled off!

366
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,380
What?

367
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,890
Oh, gosh. What do I do?

368
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,200
What's wrong?

369
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,910
Where are we going?

370
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,290
YEONGDONG EXPRESSWAY

371
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,890
Oh, no.

372
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,020
Dad!

373
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,500
It rolled off on its own.

374
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,220
I called Sooho, but he didn't answer.

375
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,680
That's why I called you.

376
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,600
Why would it roll off on its own?

377
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,060
It's because you don't know
how to drive it properly.

378
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,020
I drove a tractor by myself
and entered through

379
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,900
the elementary school gate
on my first day.

380
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
You lent me a crappy machine.
Don't make a fuss.

381
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,520
It's not crappy.

382
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,440
It never broke down in ten years.

383
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,950
No wonder. I thought it was strange.

384
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,490
It usually rolls off like that
once every ten years or so.

385
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,910
You lent me a machine
that was about to have an issue.

386
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,040
What did you say?

387
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,330
Please stop, you two.

388
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,330
It's so fortunate
that neither of you is hurt.

389
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,420
You're right.

390
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,630
Did you eat yet?

391
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,340
Let's go eat.

392
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,760
Who's that?

393
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,590
It's very nice
that his eyes are big and focused.

394
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,710
A nose like that brings good fortune,
doesn't it?

395
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,550
You're right. It's a lucky nose.

396
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,760
Hey, look at his lips.

397
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:07,100
They're very straight.
That means he'll become rich.

398
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,180
Do you think so?

399
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,140
Doesn't he look too pretty for a guy?

400
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,810
Does he look too pretty?

401
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,480
You're right. He does look too pretty.
Fine now?

402
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:22,110
Jeez, who cares as long as he makes
good money? Are you jealous?

403
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,540
Wow, his face has no flaws.

404
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,750
It's sweet.

405
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,360
It's sweet.

406
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,010
What a pleasant face.

407
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,510
Are both of your parents still around?

408
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,020
No.

409
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,900
I see. He says they aren't.

410
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,360
I heard.

411
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:43,070
Then, I…

412
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,070
can be a father to you.

413
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,990
Yonggu.

414
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,420
Then you have
a new pretty-looking son now.

415
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,130
-Great.
-Gosh, Dad.

416
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,970
I'm not saying this
because she's my daughter.

417
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,890
You won't be able to find
anyone like her anywhere.

418
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:10,760
She's smart, diligent, kind,

419
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,470
and smart.

420
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,520
I… think so too.

421
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,070
That must be why

422
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,030
I got engaged to her.

423
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,530
-Engaged?
-Engaged?

424
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,700
-See? I told you. They're together.
-Engaged…

425
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,620
Didn't you know?

426
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,500
We're engaged--

427
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,080
Isn't this fruit so sweet?

428
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,960
It's delicious, isn't it?

429
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,550
Should we head back to Seoul now?

430
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,630
Heading back already?
But you just got here.

431
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,640
He's right. It's getting late.
You should eat before you go.

432
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,270
No, it's okay. We're very busy,
so we have to go back now.

433
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,600
-What?
-Let's hurry back.

434
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,730
Gosh, what is he doing?

435
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,400
Who the heck drove such an expensive car
to this countryside?

436
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,400
Hey!

437
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,740
You came down early.

438
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,700
You don't have to work late?

439
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,870
Get lost.

440
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,410
Did you see this?

441
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,910
Isn't it awesome?

442
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,540
Hey, get away from it
while I'm still nice.

443
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:26,920
You should take pictures too. It's rare
to see a car like this in the countryside.

444
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:28,970
I said, now.

445
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,390
-Get away from it now!
-I didn't take enough pictures yet.

446
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,780
Be quiet.

447
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
What was that?

448
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,730
Oh, no!

449
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,020
Mr. Noh!

450
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,820
My goodness. It's really Mr. Noh Manners.
What is he doing here?

451
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,400
Chu Okhee!

452
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,660
I'm just practicing for my audition
for the role of a female ghost.

453
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,870
But did he really faint?

454
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
Come on, honey. You're making me blush.

455
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,100
I told you to stop that!

456
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,560
How is Mr. Noh Manners?

457
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,270
He seems all right.

458
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,860
Hey, what kind of a man faints
because of that?

459
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,860
He hates horror movies.

460
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,070
He went to the ER
watching a horror movie once.

461
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,530
Look after your fiancé.

462
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,870
Fiancé?

463
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,540
Whose fiancé?

464
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,620
By the way,

465
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,670
doesn't he look like Noh Gojin?

466
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,670
Hey!

467
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,590
Where's Dad?

468
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:37,260
Dad? He went to the warehouse
to cover up the potatoes from the rain.

469
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,310
Did he?

470
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,600
Okay.

471
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:47,980
Wait…

472
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,610
what are you two doing here?

473
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,280
Well?

474
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,070
I… came to see my family.

475
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,570
But you didn't say you were coming.

476
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,290
Oh, that's because…

477
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
You two.

478
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,540
You'd better tell me the truth.

479
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,380
You two!

480
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,220
Is it another audition?

481
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,520
You really need to snap out of it!

482
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,560
No, it's not like that.

483
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,770
Don't you dare deny it.

484
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,980
Go back to school now and study.

485
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,400
But it's Mom's death anniversary.

486
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,980
-You want me to leave?
-What are you talking about?

487
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,280
-It's next week--
-Next week?

488
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,450
Wow, don't tell me you forgot
it was Mom's death anniversary.

489
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,620
MOM'S DEATH ANNIVERSARY

490
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,330
What's wrong with me?

491
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,610
Where am I?

492
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,280
Gosh, why at that moment--

493
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,080
Darn it!

494
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,530
Mom,

495
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,110
how did you leave?

496
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,120
What do I do about Dad and Sooho?

497
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,630
Is he still sleeping?

498
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,010
Yes.

499
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,060
Dad.

500
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,560
Yes?

501
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,640
Starting next year,

502
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,900
just buy the pancakes.

503
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,190
Why would I do that?

504
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,240
It's a lot of work.
They sell them at the market.

505
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,650
Jeez, it's no trouble at all.

506
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,990
Your mom comes home once a year to eat.

507
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,450
It's our love and devotion for her.

508
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,250
It's too hard for you to do it all alone.

509
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,620
Why would he do it alone? What about you?

510
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,790
What if I run late?

511
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,420
Don't worry. I can handle it myself.

512
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,550
Sooho, aren't you going
to your part-time job?

513
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,220
What part-time job?

514
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,060
At a convenience store.

515
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,060
But…

516
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,100
I'm going to quit.

517
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,190
It hasn't been that long.
Quitting already?

518
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,730
The owner makes me do all sorts of things.

519
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,230
And he also nags a lot.

520
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,610
I really can't stand it.

521
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,700
Fine. Quit. Don't put up with it.

522
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,700
You have to endure it.
What are you talking about?

523
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,540
It's not easy making money.

524
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,580
You have to endure it
even though it's unfair. Look at me.

525
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,870
I only went to elementary school,

526
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,830
but because I endure and work hard,

527
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,090
I got to send you guys to college

528
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,510
and have a house and a field to farm on.

529
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:46,430
Even potatoes and cabbages
have to endure to be fruitful.

530
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,680
Youngsters these days just want to quit
at the smallest inconvenience.

531
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,810
Am I wrong?

532
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,730
Yes.

533
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,190
You're wrong, Dad.

534
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,900
Don't put up with it.

535
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,980
Don't put up with it like a fool.

536
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,740
Sooho isn't a potato or a cabbage.
He is a person.

537
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,570
If a person puts up with everything,

538
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,990
they die.

539
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,420
I'm going to wash up.

540
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,300
What…

541
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,340
What's with her?

542
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,470
Mr. Noh.

543
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,230
Are you all right from the shock earlier?

544
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,610
Well…

545
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,450
it was quite eventful thanks to you.

546
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,000
Then I'll get going now.

547
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,500
By yourself this late at night?

548
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,550
Please, I want to go by myself…

549
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,130
this late at night.

550
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,260
My goodness!

551
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,390
You're awake. Sorry about earlier.

552
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,140
Did your mom come?

553
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,980
I came to have a drink with her.

554
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,860
Yes, please go inside.

555
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,650
That's an unfamiliar face.

556
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,030
-That's Yonggu's son-in-law.
-Son-in-law?

557
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,870
-Yonggu's son-in-law?
-Son-in-law?

558
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,490
So, it's his son-in-law.

559
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,140
To become a son-in-law
in Gangwon Province,

560
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,060
you must drink no matter what. Right?

561
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,480
-Yes, of course.
-Yes, of course.

562
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,400
-You must drink.
-Of course.

563
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,520
-Go easy on him, guys.
-What?

564
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:29,610
Hey, Lee Yonggu.
Are you taking his side already?

565
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,240
Shall we have your son-in-law
pour us a drink?

566
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,490
-Yes.
-Sounds good.

567
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:37,950
I'll pour it for you.

568
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,040
-What?
-What?

569
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,210
Not you. Yonggu's son-in-law.

570
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,120
Go ahead.

571
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,470
You should pour it for your father first.

572
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,220
Yes, sir.

573
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,930
Gosh, what is he doing?

574
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:57,550
I have some already.

575
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,100
Yes, sir.

576
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,270
He's pouring you makgeolli.

577
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,190
He's good at figuring people out.

578
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,990
Hey, don't shake it. You'll spill it.

579
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,240
But I didn't shake--

580
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,820
All right. Good.

581
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,700
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

582
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:27,290
Here you go.

583
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,540
Here you go.

584
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:29,630
Here you go.

585
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,380
Take it.

586
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,800
Take it.

587
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,850
He can't drink.

588
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,930
-What?
-Hey, Sina.

589
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,350
Are you taking
your husband's side already?

590
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:50,730
No, it's not like that.

591
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,440
Would you like anything else?

592
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,030
-Oh, we're out of water.
-Water.

593
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,650
-We'll go get some water.
-Yes, water.

594
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,110
-Water.
-Water.

595
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,910
-Water.
-Look at those two. Jeez.

596
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,330
Doesn't he look so much like Noh Gojin?

597
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,710
Wow, this snack is so delicious.

598
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,370
He totally…Oh, it's delicious.

599
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,580
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

600
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,670
Water!

601
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,340
First, pour a drink for everyone.

602
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,590
When everyone gets drunk after that,
we can just leave.

603
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,850
-Okay, cheers!
-Cheers!

604
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,060
Gosh, this is great.

605
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,400
-All right!
-Great!

606
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,950
He can drink after all.

607
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,160
Let me pour you one.

608
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,660
Cheers!

609
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,370
Hey, what's that?

610
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,750
No, it's really okay.

611
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:49,170
-Gosh.
-Drink up.

612
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,250
-Drink up.
-Drink up all the way.

613
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,920
Drink up. Come on.

614
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:57,550
-Oh, gosh!
-What?

615
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,630
What's wrong?

616
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,220
I feel so bad for these crabs.

617
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:07,560
-What's wrong with you?
-You startled me!

618
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,520
-Jeez.
-What is she talking about?

619
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,900
-My goodness!
-My goodness! He can really drink.

620
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,020
He can really drink.

621
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,980
Yonggu's son-in-law
certainly doesn't disappoint.

622
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:19,530
Yonggu's son-in-law indeed.

623
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,990
For Yonggu's son-in-law.

624
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,070
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

625
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,120
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

626
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,430
-If I long for you
-If I long for you

627
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:50,270
-Maybe I'll get to see you again one day
-Maybe I'll get to see you again one day

628
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,150
-Like in movies
-I need more snacks.

629
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:57,320
-I hope miracles like that happen…
-Otherwise, my stomach will hurt.

630
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,400
Yonggu's son-in-law, come join us.

631
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:01,820
Yes, come join us.

632
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,780
My goodness. Yonggu's son-in-law's here.

633
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,320
-Join us.
-Drink with us.

634
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,410
-Give him a drink.
-Have one more drink.

635
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:10,870
-Next year's potato farming…
-That's what I'm saying.

636
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,670
You just need to do it.

637
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,380
-Okay.
-But…

638
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,630
potatoes didn't grow well in our town,
so I didn't get to eat any.

639
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,380
So you need to grow them, okay?

640
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,090
That's it, okay?

641
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,470
Gosh, it's not like that.

642
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,680
Oh, you're here!

643
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,680
-I brought this.
-All right!

644
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,930
-Wow!
-All right!

645
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,140
You brought such a precious drink.

646
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,600
-Dad!
-Wow!

647
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:37,730
Now.

648
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,800
Here, here. Guess what I got!

649
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,050
All right!

650
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,640
Drink!

651
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,780
Those people are like leeches.

652
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,170
Number 5938!

653
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:41,300
Number 5938! Pull over to the right.

654
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,920
Me?

655
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:45,300
Me? Why?

656
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,030
May I help you?

657
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,660
You can't drive so fast on a country road.

658
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,750
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

659
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,750
Turn off the engine.

660
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,470
So you didn't drink.

661
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:34,890
See?

662
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,770
I told you I didn't drink.

663
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,190
But you still reek of alcohol.

664
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,070
Where were you in this neighborhood?

665
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:47,820
Sorry?

666
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,910
SUPERMARKET

667
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:52,870
I'm exhausted.

668
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,000
He should've gotten back safely, right?

669
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:03,710
Hello?

670
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:06,460
What?

671
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:10,050
I was trying so hard
not to drink there by doing this.

672
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:11,760
-That's why I smell like…
-But look!

673
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,850
Please stop! What's wrong with you?

674
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,220
Who are you?

675
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,350
I'm his guardian.

676
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:30,910
It's all a lie when they say
that people are nicer in the countryside.

677
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:33,370
They even detained an innocent person.

678
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:38,870
Yes, people are cold-hearted
in the countryside,

679
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,210
so go back to Seoul now.

680
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:44,290
I'll go now.

681
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,270
PLEASE REFUEL

682
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:11,030
What's wrong?

683
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,290
I'm out of gas.

684
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,010
Since it's late,
let's go back to my house for now.

685
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,270
How do we get there?

686
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,920
I'm his guardian.

687
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,090
Guardian?

688
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,260
How ridiculous.

689
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,640
We best get some sleep here
and head out early in the morning.

690
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,140
Sleep here?

691
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:52,270
Or what? Sleep on the streets?

692
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,200
They're all good people.

693
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,500
My dad's friends.

694
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:12,330
They don't just offer drinks to whomever.

695
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,300
It was because
it was my mom's death anniversary.

696
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,680
That's just how they console my dad.

697
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,310
So please don't think poorly of them.

698
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,160
REST IN PEACE

699
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:28,410
When did your mother

700
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,660
pass away?

701
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,670
When I was 12.

702
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,170
You were very young

703
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:42,970
like me.

704
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,860
You must've

705
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,070
been scared too.

706
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:33,270
Oh, my car.

707
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,320
Hello?

708
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,660
I put gas in Mr. Noh Manners' car.

709
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,660
What? How did you know?

710
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,160
My youngest aunt's husband is
a police officer, you know?

711
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,330
He's sorry he didn't realize
it was the son-in-law.

712
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,840
I loaded your dad's gifts too,
so head up first.

713
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,340
Talk to you later.

714
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,800
Gifts?

715
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,390
What's all this?

716
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,850
Why are all these potatoes in my car?

717
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:24,780
I put them in there.

718
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,070
We have to take home
some regional specialty products.

719
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,240
Get in.

720
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,490
Wait.

721
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,790
But,

722
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:35,330
how do I even sit?

723
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,390
My car… Please pull over.

724
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:53,310
Why?

725
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,930
Let's toss these potatoes.

726
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:59,650
-Excuse me?
-Let's just toss them.

727
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,940
Why do I have to suffer
because of these potatoes?

728
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:08,200
And because of the dirt from the boxes,
my car is totally ruined now.

729
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,120
Do you even know how hard farmers work
to grow these potatoes?

730
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,790
They may not seem much to you,
they're very precious crops.

731
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,660
That's not my problem.

732
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:20,790
I can't drive to Seoul like this,
and frankly, I don't want to.

733
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,250
And…

734
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
even if you were to offer
1,000 boxes of potatoes,

735
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,260
you can't buy this car.

736
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:29,130
Then which is the rational choice?

737
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,680
Even a three-year-old
would know the answer.

738
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:36,640
Gosh, darn it.

739
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:14,680
She finally gets it.

740
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,350
This is the rational choice.

741
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:19,430
It's so much better.

742
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,390
Okay, let's go now.

743
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,110
What are you doing? Aren't you getting in?

744
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:32,530
No.

745
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,160
Why not?

746
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,950
To transport my potatoes,
this darn car is too crappy.

747
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:42,250
-What did you say?
-I'm not throwing away the potatoes.

748
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:44,250
I'm throwing away this worthless car.

749
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,420
Even if you were to offer me
1,000 truckloads of these darn cars,

750
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,840
I wouldn't exchange them for my potatoes.

751
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,430
So go back on your own.

752
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,770
TAXI

753
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,860
POTATO

754
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:16,950
Thank you.

755
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,250
-Thank you.
-No problem.

756
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:26,960
-Bye, sir.
-Bye.

757
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:30,840
Wait, sir.

758
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,800
Please take this.

759
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,170
You really don't have to.

760
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,640
-Thank you for the potatoes.
-Bye.

761
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,480
Please take these potatoes!

762
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,520
Pesticide-free potatoes
that my dad grew himself!

763
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:53,690
They're very sweet and delicious.
Please take a box. Okay?

764
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:54,780
-They're free.
-Really?

765
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,240
-Can we take a box?
-Yes, you can.

766
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:59,870
They're very sweet and delicious.
Cook them and enjoy.

767
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:00,990
-Enjoy!
-Thank you.

768
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:02,870
Please take these potatoes.

769
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,660
They're free. Pesticide-free potatoes.

770
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,210
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

771
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:08,540
Free potatoes over here!
Would you like some?

772
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:09,710
-Are they really free?
-Yes.

773
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:10,750
-One box, please.
-Okay.

774
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:40,200
What? Are potatoes
more important than people?

775
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,160
People are more important.

776
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:47,000
Why did she get so upset
for throwing away some potatoes?

777
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,150
I'm sure she already left by now.
She wouldn't still be here.

778
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,300
Hello? Mom?

779
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,510
Me? I'm out making deliveries.

780
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:46,890
It's not hard. Not at all.

781
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,940
How about you, Mom? Is your knee okay?

782
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,560
Make sure you go see the doctor, okay?

783
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:55,320
I'll come home this weekend.

784
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,610
I want to eat your kimchi stew.

785
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,950
Mom, I have to go now.
I'll call you again later, okay?

786
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,970
I felt wronged.

787
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:05,550
Why…

788
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,350
Why was I the only one
who had to die like this?

789
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:13,350
But…

790
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,650
I realized it at that moment.

791
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:25,490
"Goodbye."

792
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:31,410
My death was a very fortunate death,

793
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:37,330
as it allowed me time
to say my last goodbyes.

794
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,120
