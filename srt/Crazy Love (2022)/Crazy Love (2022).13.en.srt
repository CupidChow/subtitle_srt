EPISODE 13

5
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:44,927
Yes, you're right.

6
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:47,637
I don't have amnesia.

7
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:52,927
I deceived you.

8
00:00:56,477 --> 00:00:57,307
I'm relieved.

9
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:01,727
It's okay as long as you remember me.

10
00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:05,567
Nothing changes

11
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,067
just because I remember you.

12
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:13,407
I know you're angry with me.

13
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:16,167
But…

14
00:01:17,997 --> 00:01:19,627
I didn't abandon you.

15
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:22,877
-Actually, at that time--
-It's okay.

16
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:28,047
It doesn't matter
whether you abandoned me or not.

17
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:32,717
Things are over between us already.

18
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:41,187
No.

19
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:43,687
It's not over for us yet.

20
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:46,197
If it's really over,

21
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,567
why did you pretend not to know me?

22
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,327
I didn't realize it.

23
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:54,617
Lee Sina…

24
00:01:56,707 --> 00:01:58,247
Until I fell in love with her…

25
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:04,087
I didn't realize my hatred toward you…

26
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:08,887
was gone.

27
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:53,967
MY DEAR MS. LEE

28
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:00,307
Are you home now?

29
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:03,017
No.

30
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:04,897
What? Why not?

31
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:08,237
Come outside after ten minutes.

32
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:33,507
Is something wrong?

33
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,597
-No.
-Then what?

34
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:38,177
I just missed you.

35
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:41,687
What?

36
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:44,227
I was so worried that something happened.

37
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:48,477
It's nice to know
that you were worried about me.

38
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:52,107
Should I keep making you worry?

39
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:56,077
Let me see your phone.

40
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:17,217
When you miss me, instead of running over,
look at these pictures.

41
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:29,937
Thank you for coming into my life.

42
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,707
I didn't realize it.

43
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:53,667
Lee Sina…

44
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:55,637
Until I fell in love with her,

45
00:04:57,137 --> 00:04:58,717
I didn't realize my hatred toward you…

46
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:02,227
was gone.

47
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:05,517
It's because…

48
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,607
he's still angry with me.

49
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,687
Yes.

50
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,027
That must be why.

51
00:05:49,147 --> 00:05:50,227
Oh, gosh!

52
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:51,267
What are you doing?

53
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:57,107
Well, I'm a little sick
of the company cafeteria food.

54
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,407
The rolled omelet, ham, and rice

55
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:02,447
are all shaped like a heart.

56
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:06,787
Everything is shaped like a heart.

57
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,537
I heard if you start to date late,
you get more into it.

58
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:12,997
Lee Sina, you're crazy over him

59
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:14,667
to wake up so early to do this.

60
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:19,927
Be quiet and eat that.

61
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:25,267
Hey, no thanks. I don't want the scraps.

62
00:06:25,347 --> 00:06:26,597
You're not the only one dating.

63
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,767
I'll pack lunch for my dear Sooho too.

64
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:48,957
You made all this…

65
00:06:49,787 --> 00:06:51,747
just for me?

66
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,047
It's not much.

67
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:03,677
Aren't you going to eat?

68
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,137
You have to feed me.

69
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,077
That tastes a hundred times better.

70
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:31,287
Eggs too, please.

71
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,667
-This one?
-Yes.

72
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:02,777
Sir.

73
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:07,287
I… I'm sorry.

74
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:10,037
Please continue.

75
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:11,537
No, it's okay…

76
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:18,707
-Shall we continue?
-Gosh, continue what?

77
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,597
I'm so tired.

78
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:28,807
Yes, you must be.

79
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:30,347
I feel like I'm the only one working.

80
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:32,137
Hello.

81
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:34,347
-Hello.
-Hello.

82
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:45,737
Can we meet briefly outside the office?

83
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,827
Yes, sir. Okay.

84
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:04,757
INCOME STATEMENT

85
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,087
GOTOP EDUCATION INCOME STATEMENT

86
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:07,007
INCOME STATEMENT

87
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:09,927
INCOME STATEMENT

88
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:15,937
What's all this?

89
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:18,437
It's for Gotop's future.

90
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,627
Oh my.

91
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:43,457
It hasn't even been that long.
He's calling me already?

92
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:46,217
I said he can look at my pictures
whenever he missed me.

93
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:57,227
Is this place okay for you?

94
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:59,897
There aren't any good places around here.

95
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,767
I like it.

96
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:05,987
I just wanted to get a drink with you.

97
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:07,487
I'm relieved.

98
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:11,697
-A bottle of soju, please.
-Okay.

99
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:26,087
Why did you do that?

100
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:27,507
You want Sina's scolding again?

101
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:29,297
If she sees us drinking this late,

102
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:31,217
she'll nag both of us to death.

103
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,967
Gosh, you're right.

104
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:37,727
By the way, who is that woman she's with?

105
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:40,347
She looked stunning.

106
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:41,397
What?

107
00:10:42,397 --> 00:10:43,687
Say it again.

108
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:46,607
Stop right there.

109
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:50,657
Who did you say was stunning?

110
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:52,827
Of course, I meant…

111
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,337
Hey! Answer me immediately!

112
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:22,397
Ms. Sina.

113
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:26,147
You said you'd root for me, right?

114
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:28,737
-Pardon?
-My first love.

115
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,317
Oh! Yes.

116
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:33,447
Can you still root for me even now?

117
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:34,947
Of course.

118
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:46,747
My first love…

119
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,087
is Mr. Noh Gojin.

120
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:55,677
My first love
who I waited desperately for 12 years

121
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,717
is him.

122
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:02,687
I know

123
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:05,517
that Mr. Noh is
pretending to have amnesia.

124
00:12:06,897 --> 00:12:09,027
He's taking revenge on me
because he misunderstood

125
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,607
that I abandoned him.

126
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:14,317
That's why he needed a fake fiancée too.

127
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:17,787
Gojin…

128
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:20,327
still loves me.

129
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:24,827
So please end things from your end.

130
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:44,057
Gojin still loves me.

131
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:48,067
So please end things from your end.

132
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:43,157
Gojin!

133
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:44,287
Hello.

134
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,207
Where are you going?

135
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,377
To a convenience store.

136
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:53,457
Oh, by the way,

137
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,877
can I come hang out at your place?

138
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:57,337
What?

139
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:00,177
Sure… Come over.

140
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,507
Yes!

141
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,677
-Your sister is home, right?
-No. She left already.

142
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:08,097
She already left for work?

143
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:09,057
Yes.

144
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:10,727
What's with her?

145
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,067
Did she go without me?

146
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,897
Oh, right. She must've gone ahead

147
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:18,357
feeling embarrassed to be hungover.

148
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,657
-She drank?
-I saw her

149
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:23,287
drinking with a stunning woman
at a food stall last night.

150
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:54,067
Why did you want to see me?

151
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:58,397
I thought we finished
our discussion last night.

152
00:15:00,277 --> 00:15:03,697
I realized something
after thinking all night.

153
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:05,787
What is it?

154
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:10,497
How much I like Noh Gojin.

155
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:13,667
So what?

156
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:18,087
I'm going to continue to stay by Mr. Noh.

157
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,847
You'll be the one
who will get hurt in the end.

158
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:27,137
Because Gojin will
come back to me after all.

159
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:32,477
I'll ask Mr. Noh directly how he feels.

160
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,237
Being misdiagnosed taught me something.

161
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:44,657
I need to follow my heart
this very moment and live my life.

162
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:48,947
I'm going to

163
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,207
keep loving Mr. Noh.

164
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:56,417
What is it that you want?

165
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,757
Money? Or becoming an instructor?

166
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:02,627
I can give you everything you want.

167
00:16:06,387 --> 00:16:08,677
No, I don't need all that.

168
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:13,597
Do you think you're my match?

169
00:16:17,357 --> 00:16:21,357
You can never beat me, Ms. Lee Sina.

170
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:43,627
I'm going to

171
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,597
keep loving Mr. Noh.

172
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,867
Ms. Lee Sina isn't as good
at keeping a secret as I thought.

173
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:10,537
What?

174
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:12,957
Are you worried that I was mean to her?

175
00:17:13,037 --> 00:17:16,207
Don't get her involved in our problem.
She has nothing to do with it.

176
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:18,287
I came to tell you that.

177
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:26,757
You always make me miserable.

178
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,387
I waited for 12 years to protect you.
12 long years!

179
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,597
How can you tell me
you love another woman?

180
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,017
How can you do that
when you don't even have amnesia?

181
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,027
Are you doing this on purpose

182
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:45,357
to take revenge on me?

183
00:17:47,697 --> 00:17:49,277
Please don't do this.

184
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:53,947
I'm not taking revenge.

185
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:56,247
I don't

186
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,167
hate you anymore.

187
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:00,167
Because…

188
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:06,717
even at this very moment,
I'm worried about her.

189
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:09,757
I don't want her
to get hurt because of me.

190
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,677
I'm the one
who got hurt now because of you.

191
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:16,807
It's me,

192
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,897
not Lee Sina!

193
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:21,397
It's all in the past now.

194
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:25,067
You'll be fine soon.

195
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:39,367
"I'll be fine"?

196
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,747
Sir, the research team meeting
is in ten minutes.

197
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:27,257
Let's just…

198
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:32,637
skip work today.

199
00:19:37,387 --> 00:19:40,437
Are you upset
that I came to work ahead of you?

200
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:42,517
No.

201
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:46,107
Then, is something wrong?

202
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,567
What did you do with the ring?

203
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,907
Oh. I took it off.

204
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,407
Why?

205
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:58,657
Because it's a fake engagement ring.

206
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:08,797
We aren't a fake couple anymore.

207
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:15,217
You met with Ms. Baek, right?

208
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,927
How did you know?

209
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:25,727
Why don't you ask me
what my relationship with Ms. Baek is?

210
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:28,937
Why don't you get upset
that I didn't tell you?

211
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,067
Are you holding it in again?

212
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,737
I don't hold things in anymore.

213
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,447
Then why don't you say something?

214
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:41,707
It seems like you need some time.

215
00:20:44,037 --> 00:20:45,417
Someone said to me once

216
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:48,497
that it takes time to break up too,

217
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:52,087
not just to fall in love.

218
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,897
I hated and resented her for a long time.

219
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,977
I could only feel my broken heart.

220
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,647
If I didn't have you,

221
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,987
I'd still be living that way like a fool.

222
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:26,497
I was afraid

223
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,207
that you might hold it in again.

224
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:33,717
It's okay

225
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:36,047
because I won't tell you
about my first love either.

226
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,757
You can't do that.

227
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:44,227
Why not? It's up to me.

228
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:46,187
Gosh, how dare you.

229
00:21:46,437 --> 00:21:47,437
Who was it?

230
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:49,857
Who was it?

231
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:51,897
It's not like you'd know
even if I told you.

232
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,147
Maybe I do.

233
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,357
I doubt it.

234
00:21:54,437 --> 00:21:56,817
When? What was it like?

235
00:21:56,907 --> 00:21:58,907
-What?
-What was it like?

236
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,167
You got the exams? When can you send them?

237
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:17,467
Okay. I'll transfer the balance
as soon as I get them.

238
00:22:17,877 --> 00:22:19,507
Yes, I will.

239
00:22:23,557 --> 00:22:26,847
Now I'll go big
as soon as I do a live broadcast

240
00:22:26,937 --> 00:22:28,307
with the expected questions.

241
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:30,897
What? "The rising sun"?

242
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,777
Shin Jinyoung, that rookie,
is no match for me!

243
00:22:36,817 --> 00:22:37,987
What did you say?

244
00:22:39,987 --> 00:22:40,987
Hey, there.

245
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,367
I said it digested well.

246
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,997
I'm filming a video log today,

247
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:54,497
but my face looks so gloomy.

248
00:22:54,587 --> 00:22:56,877
Should I borrow
a mini lighting equipment from Mr. Gong?

249
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:58,047
But he went to Baek Edu.

250
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,377
Oh, right.

251
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:02,677
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

252
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:07,677
I feel his absence now that he's gone
even though he was so obnoxious.

253
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:09,137
You're right.

254
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,487
It's me, Michelle Lee. Nice to see you--

255
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,237
Gosh, seriously.

256
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:36,047
Ms. Ma, did you borrow from a loan shark?

257
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:39,927
This fell out of your diary.

258
00:23:41,177 --> 00:23:42,587
What do you mean, a loan shark?

259
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:45,097
It was on the ground
in front of the office,

260
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:46,717
so I just picked up the garbage.

261
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:49,387
I see.

262
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:54,397
If you need money, just tell me.

263
00:24:00,487 --> 00:24:01,947
Hey, Lee Mikyung!

264
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:05,867
Don't you know who I am?

265
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:09,407
I'm senior to you.

266
00:24:10,037 --> 00:24:11,577
You messed with me last time too.

267
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,877
Now that you're popular,
you think you're all that?

268
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:16,417
How dare you act so rudely to your senior.

269
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:20,297
Do you think you'll be popular forever?

270
00:24:21,467 --> 00:24:22,467
I don't think so.

271
00:24:28,307 --> 00:24:30,847
Gosh, I was just trying to help.

272
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,137
Why is she throwing a fuss
when I was being nice?

273
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,947
MS. MICHELLE LEE, I'LL REPORT YOU
FOR FORGING YOUR ACADEMIC RECORDS

274
00:24:46,697 --> 00:24:48,287
CEO PARK YANGTAE

275
00:24:56,917 --> 00:25:00,707
The head of Gotop will change.

276
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,757
Finally,

277
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,677
will I be able to exercise my rights
for the 3% shares I bought share by share?

278
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:14,887
Mr. Noh Manners. You're done for.

279
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:22,107
Come on in

280
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:26,567
Sir.

281
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:29,327
The study guides meeting ran over.

282
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:30,407
I'm sorry.

283
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,537
What? You little…

284
00:25:33,707 --> 00:25:34,707
Oh, I see.

285
00:25:37,457 --> 00:25:42,207
Things can get delayed sometimes.
It happens, you know?

286
00:25:42,297 --> 00:25:44,377
It's okay.

287
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:47,547
You may get back to work.

288
00:25:47,637 --> 00:25:48,717
Yes, sir.

289
00:25:51,177 --> 00:25:53,267
Hey, have you seen him?

290
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:54,677
Who…

291
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:57,897
That man who works for Ms. Baek.

292
00:25:57,977 --> 00:25:59,477
Oh, you mean, Mr. Cho?

293
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:02,777
Yes, him. You've never seen him
somewhere else besides Baek Edu?

294
00:26:02,857 --> 00:26:04,437
No, I haven't.

295
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:08,197
Really? Why do I get this feeling
that I've seen him somewhere before?

296
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,537
I wonder how Sooho is doing.

297
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,747
-Should I go say hi?
-No, you can't.

298
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:21,337
-Why not?
-It's late.

299
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:24,087
No, it's not. Besides, I'm just saying hi.

300
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:25,717
No, you can't.

301
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:28,887
I have a lot to do.
Please go now. Drive home safely.

302
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,387
But…

303
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:41,267
Do-re-mi-fa-sol

304
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:43,647
Why can't I keep it up high?

305
00:26:45,987 --> 00:26:49,857
Okay, shall we solve the next question?

306
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,577
Okay, shall we solve the next question?

307
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:56,827
Escaping from the Enlightenment ideas,

308
00:26:58,707 --> 00:27:01,287
seeking new ways of employing prosody,

309
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:06,587
and experimental mind…

310
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,127
Sorry.

311
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:28,987
MY DEAR MR. NOH

312
00:27:35,907 --> 00:27:38,037
MY DEAR MS. LEE

313
00:27:38,117 --> 00:27:40,747
Why doesn't she answer my calls
whenever she goes home these days?

314
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,717
I found a good restaurant.

315
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,967
It's a bit far,
but I heard that it's really good.

316
00:27:57,517 --> 00:27:58,387
Let's go there.

317
00:27:59,017 --> 00:28:01,637
I'm sorry, but I have so much to do today.

318
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:03,267
Let's just eat around here today.

319
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:05,977
But I heard it's really good.

320
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,937
SUSHI SANGMU, RAW SALMON, TUNA
SUSHI WITH DELICIOUS RICE

321
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,577
It's delicious.

322
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:19,997
Isn't this place good?

323
00:28:20,287 --> 00:28:21,497
Yes.

324
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,077
By the way,

325
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,837
what do you need to do?

326
00:28:29,587 --> 00:28:30,417
Come on. Eat up now.

327
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:44,097
The key point is…

328
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:55,027
The key point here is…

329
00:28:56,197 --> 00:28:58,577
CLASSICS

330
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:00,537
Okay, contemporary literature is…

331
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:23,267
Ms. Lee.

332
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:25,397
You're neglecting your duties lately.

333
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:27,227
I'm sorry.

334
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:29,567
Do you think

335
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,737
you've got me wrapped around your finger?

336
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,487
Sorry?

337
00:29:35,237 --> 00:29:39,327
Don't you think you're neglecting
your duties to your boyfriend lately?

338
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:41,787
I've been getting stood up
every day these days.

339
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:43,787
Have you been
going on dates with some other guy?

340
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,707
Since you've got me
wrapped around your finger,

341
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:48,587
you don't feel the need
to be nice anymore?

342
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,757
That's nonsense.

343
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,877
Then, can we go on a date this weekend?

344
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:57,927
Let's do that next weekend instead.

345
00:30:12,817 --> 00:30:15,527
What kind of a couple
doesn't go on a date on a weekend?

346
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:16,987
That's not a couple then.

347
00:30:27,247 --> 00:30:28,327
What?

348
00:30:33,877 --> 00:30:34,707
Gojin.

349
00:30:35,797 --> 00:30:38,217
Oh, Sooho!

350
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:41,007
I've been counting down until the weekend
to come over to your place.

351
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,347
May I come in?

352
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:46,807
Sure… Come on in.

353
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:47,767
All right!

354
00:30:54,357 --> 00:30:56,817
Wow. It's amazing.

355
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:01,197
I've never seen a place like this.

356
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,877
Wow, your sofa is so nice.

357
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:24,007
Hello? Sorry? What did you say?

358
00:31:26,097 --> 00:31:27,637
It's practically a department store.

359
00:31:35,107 --> 00:31:36,107
Do you like them?

360
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,107
Do you want to keep them?

361
00:31:40,027 --> 00:31:41,737
-Seriously?
-Yes.

362
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:44,367
You can take anything else you like.

363
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:46,077
Gojin!

364
00:31:46,157 --> 00:31:47,447
I love you!

365
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:53,627
Okay, Sooho. I'm glad you're happy,

366
00:31:53,957 --> 00:31:55,457
but can you get off of me, please?

367
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:57,627
I'm already taken, you know?

368
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:02,297
I don't want anyone
taking away my big sis.

369
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,887
She's like a mom to me.

370
00:32:07,517 --> 00:32:10,767
But since it's you, I think I can
make an exception to trust you with her.

371
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:18,397
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE KOREAN LANGUAGE
IN THE MIDDLE AGES

372
00:32:24,117 --> 00:32:28,237
Okay, today, we'll talk about
the characteristics of… Middle Korean…

373
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:31,457
The characteristics of the Korean language
in the middle ages…

374
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:36,997
Today…

375
00:32:53,057 --> 00:32:54,057
Today…

376
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,777
To be honest, I felt shy at the beginning,

377
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,947
so I hid my face like this to practice.

378
00:33:09,827 --> 00:33:11,247
I love you.

379
00:33:11,997 --> 00:33:12,907
Hey, Okhee.

380
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:14,117
Gosh, you startled me.

381
00:33:14,207 --> 00:33:16,207
You have a lot of masks, right?
Can I borrow them?

382
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:18,127
-What for?
-I need them for something.

383
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:20,627
They're all over there. Take them.

384
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:25,887
By the way, have you seen Sooho?
I haven't seen him since earlier.

385
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:27,467
Maybe he went to a convenience store.

386
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:33,307
Sooho, where are you?

387
00:33:34,687 --> 00:33:36,647
Where? Mr. Noh Manners'--

388
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:40,437
I mean, Mr. Noh's place?

389
00:33:45,237 --> 00:33:46,447
Sooho, you have a death wish?

390
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,237
What are you doing here?

391
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,987
I asked him to come hang out.

392
00:33:51,077 --> 00:33:52,247
Please don't take his side.

393
00:33:52,747 --> 00:33:53,747
Wait!

394
00:33:58,707 --> 00:34:00,287
You can kill me later,

395
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:02,837
but let me eat first.

396
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:06,717
I'm hungry.

397
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:20,107
It's so good.

398
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:24,897
Wow, I can't believe I get to eat
jjajangmyeon in such a fancy house.

399
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:27,357
I'd have no regrets even if I died now.

400
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:28,947
-Hey, you--
-Hey.

401
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:31,407
Let him eat in peace.

402
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,157
Here you go, honey. Open up.

403
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:36,827
My goodness. Eat up.

404
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:39,537
She's right.
It's nice to all eat together.

405
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:43,087
Please stop taking his side.
He'll act up thinking you've got his back.

406
00:34:43,747 --> 00:34:45,207
I'm his little bro starting today.

407
00:34:48,677 --> 00:34:50,757
Oh, you didn't forget
about tomorrow's dinner, right?

408
00:34:51,387 --> 00:34:54,097
Of course not. I've been dying waiting.

409
00:34:54,557 --> 00:34:55,427
Dinner?

410
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:57,227
What dinner?

411
00:34:57,307 --> 00:35:00,687
Oh, our high school friends
will be visiting Seoul tomorrow.

412
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:02,227
Oh, I see.

413
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,227
I heard Heeseok is coming too.

414
00:35:04,817 --> 00:35:06,487
-Heeseok?
-Yes.

415
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:08,817
You cried your eyes out
when Heeseok went to the military.

416
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:10,817
Yes, I cried so much.

417
00:35:11,817 --> 00:35:12,777
-When?
-The military?

418
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:13,867
-What time?
-7 p.m.

419
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,657
-She cried?
-Did you make a reservation?

420
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,907
-Is he that first love?
-I did. This place.

421
00:35:18,657 --> 00:35:19,667
Isn't it totally nice?

422
00:35:19,747 --> 00:35:22,587
Yes, it is. The food looks so good.

423
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:26,087
It's so great to see you guys.

424
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,337
A tiring trip to Seoul, right?

425
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,337
Not at all. Thanks to you guys,
we get to visit Seoul.

426
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:33,347
I got to get away from Gangneung
to get some fresh air

427
00:35:33,427 --> 00:35:35,637
and get a break
from my childcare duties. It's so great.

428
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,267
Hey, let's all go
to my theater company tomorrow.

429
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:41,727
Of course.
We've got to see you act, Okhee.

430
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:44,897
Are you dating?

431
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:47,737
Your face is glowing.

432
00:35:47,817 --> 00:35:49,357
-She is--
-No, I'm not!

433
00:35:50,397 --> 00:35:51,527
Well…

434
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:55,237
Anyway, it's so great to see you guys.

435
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:58,037
It's good to see you guys,
but I'm hungry now.

436
00:35:58,117 --> 00:36:00,247
Let's eat first. Pick now.

437
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:01,367
What should we eat?

438
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:23,147
Hello.

439
00:36:23,227 --> 00:36:26,227
I'm Noh Gojin, Ms. Sina's boyfriend.

440
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,647
-What?
-Oh my.

441
00:36:29,737 --> 00:36:31,777
-My goodness.
-Her boyfriend?

442
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,027
-Oh my.
-Gosh.

443
00:36:34,117 --> 00:36:35,617
What are you doing here?

444
00:36:35,697 --> 00:36:39,577
Your friends are in town.
Of course, I should come say hello.

445
00:36:40,537 --> 00:36:42,957
-Oh my.
-Unbelievable.

446
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,667
Please eat anything you'd like.

447
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:49,007
And I reserved a suite at a hotel.

448
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,467
-A suite?
-Amazing!

449
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:54,337
You haven't seen each other much.

450
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,597
You've got to have fun all night.

451
00:36:58,427 --> 00:37:00,977
Lee Sina, you're so lucky.

452
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:03,347
Where did you find yourself
such a great boyfriend?

453
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:05,437
You make Gangwon Province proud.

454
00:37:09,817 --> 00:37:10,897
Are you looking for someone?

455
00:37:11,777 --> 00:37:14,237
Sorry? Well…

456
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:17,867
I guess Mr. Heeseok isn't here yet?

457
00:37:19,657 --> 00:37:20,827
Are you referring to me?

458
00:37:25,617 --> 00:37:26,577
That's Heeseok.

459
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:30,127
When she entered
the military out of the blue,

460
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,297
we all cried our eyes out together.

461
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:35,177
Salute!

462
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,927
Sergeant First Class Oh Heeseok.
Nice to meet you.

463
00:37:41,347 --> 00:37:42,347
Oh, I see.

464
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,387
You're Ms. Heeseok.

465
00:37:46,147 --> 00:37:47,357
Nice to meet you.

466
00:37:55,527 --> 00:37:56,907
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

467
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:59,447
-I'm drinking too much.
-My goodness.

468
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:02,327
Thank you so much.

469
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,707
Have fun.

470
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:07,997
But you still have to
think about me, okay?

471
00:38:09,707 --> 00:38:10,537
I'll call you.

472
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:14,087
Gosh, I drank so much.

473
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:19,757
-My goodness.
-You said you weren't dating.

474
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,307
-And?
-Do you remember?

475
00:38:28,397 --> 00:38:30,607
Your boyfriend at the time--

476
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:35,607
Are you all right?

477
00:38:36,237 --> 00:38:37,407
Yes, I am.

478
00:38:38,277 --> 00:38:39,617
My goodness.

479
00:38:40,197 --> 00:38:43,157
My car was pulling in. You just jumped
in front of it without even looking.

480
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,367
Watch it!

481
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:47,117
What did you say?

482
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:49,997
You almost hit a person,

483
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,787
but you didn't even apologize. How rude!

484
00:38:53,377 --> 00:38:56,007
A person should watch out for cars. Okay?

485
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:59,137
You watch out.

486
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:00,797
Oh my.

487
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:03,677
How dare you talk so rudely.

488
00:39:03,757 --> 00:39:05,637
You were rude first.

489
00:39:05,717 --> 00:39:09,057
What? How ridiculous.

490
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:12,977
Sis.

491
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,147
What's going on?

492
00:39:16,357 --> 00:39:17,487
Sooyeong.

493
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:20,447
Well, they're the ones who were careless
and almost ran into my car,

494
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,947
but they got upset
and started to argue with me.

495
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:25,997
Let's just go.

496
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:29,247
No. I heard that there are
many insurance frauds these days.

497
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:31,077
Maybe that's what you are.

498
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:32,497
What did you say?

499
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:33,667
How dare you call us that!

500
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:35,747
What? I know I am right.

501
00:39:36,337 --> 00:39:37,377
How old are you?

502
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:39,587
-How dare you talk down to me?
-Gosh!

503
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:40,757
-Sis!
-Don't talk down to me.

504
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,337
-Sis!
-Let go of me!

505
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:43,847
-Oh my!
-Sina!

506
00:39:43,927 --> 00:39:44,927
Oh no.

507
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,427
-Ms. Sina!
-Are you okay?

508
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:48,427
Don't touch her!

509
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:05,447
Let's go.

510
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:25,887
Why are you still here?

511
00:40:27,347 --> 00:40:29,727
I wanted to see
Lee Sina's face one more time.

512
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:35,187
I didn't fall down
because of Ms. Sooyeong.

513
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:38,567
Go now.

514
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:44,237
Forget about everything
and have fun with your friends, okay?

515
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:27,697
I told you not to get her involved.
She has nothing to do with our problem.

516
00:41:28,657 --> 00:41:30,077
Are you really Noh Gojin?

517
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:33,787
Are you the same Noh Gojin
who I used to know?

518
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,587
What did I do so wrong?

519
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,507
I've only loved you.

520
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:51,307
You come and go as you please.

521
00:41:52,557 --> 00:41:53,847
That's what love is to you?

522
00:41:57,607 --> 00:41:59,647
I can explain everything.

523
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:01,357
It was beyond my control.

524
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:03,317
Do I really have to hear about it?

525
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:06,407
After all this time?

526
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:16,117
If you leave now, I'll never forgive you.

527
00:42:24,337 --> 00:42:26,587
What did I do so wrong?

528
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:30,757
What did I do?

529
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:37,307
GOTOP EDUCATION

530
00:42:44,107 --> 00:42:46,237
-This is--
-It's a second ledger set.

531
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,237
Mr. Noh has been evading taxes.

532
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,447
Mr. Noh--

533
00:42:52,617 --> 00:42:55,697
Mr. Noh has been evading taxes?

534
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,787
Yes.

535
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:03,497
You just need to be honest
and inform the public about it.

536
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,587
Before Gotop gets into further trouble,

537
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:08,257
I want to rectify
Mr. Noh's dictatorial ways

538
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:10,587
and protect Gotop.

539
00:43:11,597 --> 00:43:12,547
Please help me.

540
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:18,347
I want to help you.
But since this is such a big issue,

541
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:20,307
I'm hesitant to be the one to reveal…

542
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:23,437
Ms. Ma, it's time that you teach again.

543
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:26,067
To fill Mr. Noh's shoes,

544
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:27,397
Gotop will need

545
00:43:28,237 --> 00:43:30,947
great new math instructors.

546
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:31,987
Besides…

547
00:43:34,157 --> 00:43:37,827
if you want to bring your son
from your parents as soon as possible,

548
00:43:38,037 --> 00:43:41,497
shouldn't you secure
your position as an instructor now?

549
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:46,207
He's right. I must do it

550
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,337
for both Gotop and myself.

551
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:54,217
GOTOP EDUCATION
DIRECTOR MA EUNJEONG

552
00:44:01,687 --> 00:44:03,807
-Hello?
-Are you ready?

553
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:07,857
Yes.

554
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,147
The door is opening.

555
00:44:17,787 --> 00:44:20,117
Are they moving out today?

556
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:21,667
Yes.

557
00:44:23,247 --> 00:44:24,247
Hold it, please.

558
00:45:20,097 --> 00:45:21,347
Eunhee isn't here yet?

559
00:45:21,767 --> 00:45:22,767
No, not yet.

560
00:45:23,097 --> 00:45:24,097
What's that?

561
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,607
I got you guys one too.

562
00:45:27,107 --> 00:45:28,227
Ta-da.

563
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:32,237
You can apply it anywhere you want.

564
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:38,697
-Oh, it looks nice.
-Yes.

565
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:41,247
Sora, you have a great beauty sense.

566
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:43,577
It really gets absorbed by the skin.

567
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,787
It looks nice and moist.

568
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:47,837
Does it?

569
00:45:52,337 --> 00:45:55,797
I guess Mr. Noh Manners really changed.

570
00:45:55,877 --> 00:45:59,557
I asked my old colleague who is
an instructor in a passing comment.

571
00:46:00,137 --> 00:46:01,717
He really told them to go home on time

572
00:46:01,807 --> 00:46:03,387
and they ate beef at the company dinner.

573
00:46:03,477 --> 00:46:06,767
I asked too, and they really get to pull
their monthly paid vacation days together.

574
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,977
And he greets them too.

575
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,487
Should we stop now?

576
00:46:13,567 --> 00:46:16,027
We should stop, right?

577
00:46:17,987 --> 00:46:19,907
Welcome.

578
00:46:22,537 --> 00:46:25,247
A club sandwich with ham and eggs, please.

579
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:26,247
Okay.

580
00:46:37,677 --> 00:46:38,757
Hello.

581
00:46:39,637 --> 00:46:42,347
I'm Director Ma Eunjeong,
the top teaching assistant

582
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:44,017
to CEO Noh Gojin of Gotop Education.

583
00:46:44,977 --> 00:46:46,977
I would like to make

584
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:49,687
a conscious declaration here today.

585
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:52,267
-Out of the blue?
-What's going on?

586
00:46:52,357 --> 00:46:54,067
As someone who loves students

587
00:46:54,647 --> 00:46:57,397
and is concerned
about Gotop Education's future,

588
00:46:57,907 --> 00:47:00,027
this wasn't an easy decision.

589
00:47:02,117 --> 00:47:05,617
I would like to report CEO Noh Gojin's
tax evasion and bullying acts.

590
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:12,457
This right here
is the evidence of his tax evasion.

591
00:47:14,627 --> 00:47:15,667
Also,

592
00:47:16,207 --> 00:47:18,757
I call the teaching assistants
who were bullied as witnesses.

593
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:29,597
I would like to report CEO Noh Gojin's
tax evasion and bullying acts.

594
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:34,437
This right here

595
00:47:35,777 --> 00:47:37,187
is the evidence of his tax evasion.

596
00:47:40,317 --> 00:47:44,367
Also, I call the teaching assistants
who were bullied as witnesses.

597
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,597
NEWS

598
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:16,567
TOP INSTRUCTOR NOH GOJIN SUSPECTED
OF TAX EVASION AND BULLYING EMPLOYEES

599
00:48:28,747 --> 00:48:32,367
All the shareholders here
have agreed to support us.

600
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:36,337
We've all agreed to vote
for dismissing CEO Noh Gojin

601
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:37,877
at the extraordinary general meeting.

602
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:39,877
Thank you.

603
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,927
But our combined votes won't be enough

604
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:45,757
to secure the two-thirds majority.

605
00:48:47,137 --> 00:48:48,557
You don't need to worry about that.

606
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:53,477
There is another shareholder

607
00:48:54,397 --> 00:48:55,517
who will support us.

608
00:48:59,317 --> 00:49:00,147
Well, then.

609
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:04,867
Let's toast.

610
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:08,787

-Resign!
-Resign!

636

-Since Mr. Noh is in trouble,
-Investigate!

637
00:50:08,757 --> 00:50:10,097
-we should help.
-Investigate!

638
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:14,807
-Noh Gojin, step down!
-Yes, ma'am. But how?

639
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:18,227
I want to make Gotop mine.

640
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:19,897
Pardon?

641
00:50:19,977 --> 00:50:23,237
Including Gotop's instructors, affiliates,

642
00:50:23,817 --> 00:50:25,067
and Noh Gojin.

643
00:50:26,147 --> 00:50:28,567
I want to make all of Gotop mine.

644
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,907
The only way for us to help Mr. Noh

645
00:50:34,247 --> 00:50:36,407
is to take over Gotop.

MY DEAR MR. NOH

648
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:05,857
Noh Gojin, realize your wrongdoing!

649

-Realize!
-Realize!

650
00:51:08,657 --> 00:51:09,657
Where are you going?

651
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:11,317
I'm stepping out for a second.

652
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:14,407
What? Who is here?

653
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:25,377
What are you doing here?

654
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,467
Hello.

655
00:51:40,647 --> 00:51:42,357
I'm sleepy
now that I had chicken and beer.

656
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,067
Gosh, this is so comfy.

657
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:52,947
I don't know who got you this,
but it's so nice.

658
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,697
Seriously, what happened?

659
00:51:54,777 --> 00:51:56,697
Do you even know
how many times I called you?

660
00:51:56,787 --> 00:51:59,497
Why? Because you missed me so much?

661
00:52:00,497 --> 00:52:01,827
I wasn't joking.

662
00:52:02,997 --> 00:52:04,087
Are you all right?

663
00:52:07,337 --> 00:52:08,337
What about you?

664
00:52:09,337 --> 00:52:10,337
Aren't you afraid

665
00:52:11,257 --> 00:52:12,337
that I might get ruined?

666
00:52:12,427 --> 00:52:14,137
Why would I be afraid of that?

667
00:52:14,217 --> 00:52:16,887
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

668
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:20,557
Did you evade taxes?

669
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:21,687
No.

670
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,307
Did you bully employees?

671
00:52:23,397 --> 00:52:25,857
I bullied Lee Sina and paid the price.

672
00:52:27,357 --> 00:52:28,397
It's fine then.

673
00:52:28,487 --> 00:52:29,567
What's fine?

674
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:30,647
We have to fight.

675
00:52:30,737 --> 00:52:32,737
I'll sue all the people
who post malicious comments

676
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:35,077
and the reporters who didn't check facts.

677
00:52:35,157 --> 00:52:37,577
I won't hold in anymore.
I'll make sure they pay the price.

678
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:42,207
Why did you laugh?

679
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:47,667
That's right. Lee Sina won't lose.

680
00:52:48,797 --> 00:52:50,797
Even almighty Noh Gojin
is under your thumb.

681
00:52:58,097 --> 00:52:59,427
You're the only one

682
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,017
that I'm afraid of.

683
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:21,447
GOTOP EDUCATION CEO NOH GOJIN

684
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:23,707
You're here.

685
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,077
It's a good morning.

686
00:53:28,627 --> 00:53:30,707
The CEO's seat is nice.

687
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:35,087
If you wanted that seat,

688
00:53:35,677 --> 00:53:36,757
why didn't you say so?

689
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,307
If I did, would you have given it up?

690
00:53:40,057 --> 00:53:40,887
Yes.

691
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:45,267
Thank you, even if they're empty words.

692
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:52,147
Shouldn't you find a wise solution

693
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:55,487
to protect Gotop?

694
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,027
A wise solution?

695
00:53:59,117 --> 00:54:02,327
Close to 40% of the members
cancelled their membership already.

696
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:04,707
Parents are boycotting

697
00:54:04,787 --> 00:54:07,037
and the press has been
attacking us for days.

698
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:10,207
Search and seizure will proceed soon too.

699
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:15,377
Gotop is no longer a small company

700
00:54:15,467 --> 00:54:17,547
that you and I started six years ago.

701
00:54:18,137 --> 00:54:21,507
Because of the CEO's wrongdoing,

702
00:54:22,017 --> 00:54:24,847
many people are
about to lose their jobs overnight.

703
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:26,727
For some reason, it seems like

704
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,517
you want that to happen.

705
00:54:30,727 --> 00:54:32,727
Would you have said
the same thing six years ago?

706
00:54:33,987 --> 00:54:35,487
That I should give up

707
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:38,237
since we have no hope
when we're eating cup noodles

708
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,117
and can't even afford a rent
of a tiny office?

709
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:45,367
I made a mistake

710
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,707
back then.

711
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,967
Think carefully about…

712
00:55:00,177 --> 00:55:01,387
what's really best for Gotop.

713
00:55:15,487 --> 00:55:17,607
TAX-EVADING BULLY NOH GOJIN
APOLOGIZE AND RESIGN!

714
00:55:17,697 --> 00:55:19,407
-Apologize, Noh Gojin.
-Apologize, Noh Gojin.

715
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:22,027
-Investigate him.
-Investigate him.

716
00:55:25,657 --> 00:55:28,917
Gotop Education is facing a crisis
due to an internal accusation

717
00:55:28,997 --> 00:55:30,917
of CEO Noh Gojin's
tax evasion and bullying.

718
00:55:30,997 --> 00:55:33,417
The civic groups are continuing
with lawsuits and complaints

719
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:36,257
and the National Tax Service's
search and seizure is taking place today.

720
00:55:43,137 --> 00:55:44,057
This way.

721
00:55:54,687 --> 00:55:56,647
NOH GOJIN
TOP INSTRUCTOR IN THE UNIVERSE

722
00:56:12,127 --> 00:56:13,457
NATIONAL TAX SERVICE

723
00:56:17,337 --> 00:56:19,797
Wait. Please don't do that.

724
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,127
Please stop.

725
00:56:21,257 --> 00:56:22,717
I said, stop!

726
00:56:25,387 --> 00:56:26,387
You can't take that!

727
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,977
Please step aside. You can be charged
with obstruction of justice.

728
00:57:38,337 --> 00:57:40,707
INDUCEMENT, ACTION PLAN

729
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,477
What happened that day

730
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:58,977
wasn't just an accident?

731
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:04,197
Is Mr. Oh the one…

732
00:58:11,157 --> 00:58:13,117
Is that why you ate a peach that time?

733
00:58:13,197 --> 00:58:15,537
To pretend to have amnesia
in front of Mr. Oh?

734
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:17,667
It would've been better

735
00:58:19,207 --> 00:58:21,377
if I really had amnesia.

736
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,837
I wanted to find out

737
00:58:28,597 --> 00:58:29,927
why he did it and what he wanted.

738
00:58:31,137 --> 00:58:32,467
So I waited.

739
00:58:34,557 --> 00:58:35,557
But…

740
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:41,227
I still don't know.

741
00:58:58,747 --> 00:59:01,997
LOVE HALL

742
00:59:35,827 --> 00:59:40,037
OH SEHEE, BORN ON AUGUST 30, 1990
DIED ON APRIL 15, 2015

743
00:59:43,797 --> 00:59:45,047
It was a long wait, wasn't it?

744
00:59:47,837 --> 00:59:49,377
Finally, the day has come.

745
00:59:51,007 --> 00:59:53,177
I'll make Noh Gojin fall

746
00:59:55,597 --> 00:59:57,767
from the highest point possible.

747
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:28,587
Are you worried?

748
01:00:29,547 --> 01:00:30,377
No.

749
01:00:32,177 --> 01:00:33,717
You're a terrible liar.

750
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:37,387
Your expression tells me
that you're worried to death.

751
01:00:45,307 --> 01:00:46,397
Please don't worry.

752
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:48,777
I'm going there to finish the battle.

753
01:00:53,237 --> 01:00:54,987
If you're so worried,

754
01:00:55,867 --> 01:00:57,157
why don't you give me a peck?

755
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:10,047
Don't be discouraged.
Be bold and confident, okay?

756
01:01:10,297 --> 01:01:12,677
Just be yourself. Got it?

757
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:38,577
NOH GOJIN
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

758
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:12,857
EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING

759
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:19,947
-How have you been?
-How is it going?

760
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:21,907
-Hey, there.
-You're here.

761
01:02:22,617 --> 01:02:25,247
What is Mr. Park doing here?

762
01:02:26,077 --> 01:02:27,247
-What?
-Why is he here?

763
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,287
-Oh my.
-What is he doing here?

764
01:02:29,377 --> 01:02:31,167
-I don't understand.
-What?

765
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,347
Hello.

766
01:02:43,517 --> 01:02:44,517
Hello.

767
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,557
-Hello.
-Hello.

768
01:02:47,137 --> 01:02:49,147
-Hello.
-Hello. You're here.

769
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:37,397
Okay, we'll get started

770
01:03:37,487 --> 01:03:40,777
with Gotop Education's
extraordinary general meeting.

771
