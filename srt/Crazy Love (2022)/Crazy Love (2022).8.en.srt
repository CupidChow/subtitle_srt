CRAZY LOVE

EPISODE 8

5
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,300
By the way,

6
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,510
I actually don't have…

7
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,570
…amnesia.

8
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,210
I don't have amnesia.

9
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,590
I was acting all along.

10
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,470
Hard to believe?

11
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,050
I don't blame you.

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,680
I was also surprised by
how good of an actor I was.

13
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,480
Okay, then. Shall we talk
about our first meeting?

14
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,690
You showed up on February 21 of last year

15
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,230
at 9:53 and 28 seconds.

16
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,940
You wore tacky gray plaid pants
and black loafers

17
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,860
and interrupted my reading time.

18
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,200
Since that very day,
you totally got on my nerves!

19
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,990
You didn't follow the 5.5cm binder rule,

20
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,910
your meeting minutes were
wordy like a novel,

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,500
and you got me drinking tea
when I asked for a driver.

22
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,960
Worst of all, your lukewarm coffee was
so bad that even a dog wouldn't drink it!

23
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,000
But…

24
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,840
the real highlight…

25
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,760
was at my vacation house.

26
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,100
Hey!

27
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,930
Hey! Do you think I let that slide
because I was scared of you?

28
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,480
No, I didn't want to waste my time.

29
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,690
-Because you're a worthless loser.
-Because you're a worthless loser.

30
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,900
-No, actually, I never got back at you
-No, actually, I never got back at you

31
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,150
-because you were not even worth my time!
-because you were not even worth my time!

32
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,360
What do you think?

33
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,530
I have it perfectly memorized
word for word, don't I?

34
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,070
But

35
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,330
fainting was a little lame.

36
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,120
"It's me. Your fiancée."

37
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,040
That was totally awesome, don't you think?

38
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,510
I wasn't the only one
who was good at acting.

39
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,930
My fiancée was very good too.
You gave me goosebumps.

40
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,180
You were terrible at your job,

41
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,430
but it turns out
that you had great acting skills.

42
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,480
Why don't you try switching careers
while you're at it?

43
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,310
I'm so sorry.

44
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,150
Thanks to you, I got to eat so many onions

45
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,280
and even got covered in vomit.

46
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,660
It even got inside my ear.

47
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,200
I suffered so much
because of you, my fiancée.

48
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,830
How do you plan to make up for all this?

49
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,170
I'm so sorry, Mr. Noh.

50
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,540
No need to say sorry.

51
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,960
You can just serve your time in prison.

52
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,300
You punched holes everywhere
on my limited edition suits and vase.

53
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,520
You turned my cacti into cucumbers,

54
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,640
charged everything
on my corporate credit card,

55
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,810
and even scratched my car.

56
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,610
That's easily over a billion won.

57
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,230
On top of it,
you pretended to be my fiancée.

58
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,150
Isn't that…

59
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,950
considered fraud?

60
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,370
With all that, you'd make the news.

61
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,660
"Pretending to be his fiancée,

62
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,330
commits a billion-won fraud."

63
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,210
You'd better find a lawyer soon.

64
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,300
And make sure you tell this
to Mr. Lee Yonggu in Gangwon Province.

65
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,800
His tiny house and land

66
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,390
will all be seized.

67
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,560
A father should pay

68
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,270
for his daughter's fraud.

69
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,150
Sudden shock could be
detrimental to the elderly.

70
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,690
Make sure you tell him ahead,
so that he doesn't pass away.

71
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
Right.

72
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,370
What the heck are you doing?

73
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,950
No!

74
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,620
Dad!

75
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,790
Dad! Get up, Dad!

76
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,630
What do you think you're doing?

77
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,840
Dad!

78
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,130
-You're under arrest for fraud.
-What?

79
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,180
Dad!

80
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,890
Lee Sina, the accused, took advantage
of victim Noh Gojin having amnesia

81
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,640
and pretended to be his fiancée

82
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,560
causing him one billion won
worth of damages.

83
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,730
And as she shows no sign of remorse,

84
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,270
I, therefore, sentence her
to ten years in prison.

85
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,980
No!

86
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,860
No, you can't do this!

87
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,370
Sir, I'm sorry!
I think I really lost my mind.

88
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,910
I beg for your forgiveness
just this once. Please.

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,210
You all say the same, boring things.

90
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,210
You know I'm not a pushover
who forgives people.

91
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,760
There is, isn't there?

92
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:24,930
Sorry?

93
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:27,970
Who is it?

94
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,520
Who ordered you to do it?

95
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,100
What do you mean, who ordered me?

96
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,940
There's no such thing.
No one ordered me to do it.

97
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,690
No one ordered you to do it,

98
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,450
yet you happened to lure me
out of my vacation house at that moment,

99
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,870
I happened to get hit by a car
while I was talking to you on the phone,

100
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,830
and again,

101
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,710
you happened to take me to the hospital

102
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,460
suddenly as my fiancée?

103
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,920
That's because…

104
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,810
But seriously, no one ordered me to do it.
It was me. I did it all on my own.

105
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,270
Is that so?

106
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,730
So you did it on your own too?

107
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,450
Fine.

108
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,530
My hands are tied.

109
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,910
You need to disappear too then.

110
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,790
To prison.

111
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,870
No, sir! Wait! Please!

112
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,960
I'll pay it back.
I'll pay it back however I can,

113
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,760
so please spare my father's house.
I beg you.

114
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,380
I'll do anything you ask for.

115
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,260
Sir, please. Just this once.

116
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,550
You'll do anything?

117
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,010
Yes.

118
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,430
-Seriously?
-Yes, anything. I'll do anything.

119
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,560
I beg for your forgiveness
just this once. Please.

120
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,900
Please, sir.

121
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,650
Please.

122
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,810
PAYMENT AGREEMENT CONTRACT

123
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,350
Sign it.

124
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,350
What's… this?

125
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,770
A hostage contract.

126
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,190
Hostage?

127
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,990
OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES

128
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,910
"As of today,
Lee Sina is Noh Gojin's hostage."

129
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,660
Something like that.

130
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,250
TO OFFSET LIABILITIES WITH LABOR

131
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,330
CONTINUE TO ACT AS FIANCÉE,
WORK AS DRIVER AND HOUSEKEEPER

132
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,670
What's the matter? You don't want to?

133
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,710
If not, you can just go to prison instead.

134
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,840
No, sir.

135
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,150
Listen carefully.

136
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,410
You have to continue to be thick-skinned

137
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,320
and pretend to be my fiancée.

138
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,330
Keep pretending to be your fiancée? Why?

139
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,000
You're a hostage. Are you questioning me?

140
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,420
No, I wasn't.

141
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,800
Behave well.

142
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,380
If you tell anyone
that I don't have amnesia,

143
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,010
it won't end with
just working for me without pay.

144
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,390
It'll be a vendetta

145
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,850
beyond your imagination.

146
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,520
A bloody revenge will follow.

147
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,530
I'd be better…

148
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,700
I'd be better off dying.

149
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,210
I want to go back!

150
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,050
The train is now approaching.

151
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,090
Mind the gap
between the train and the platform

152
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,930
as you get on and off the train.

153
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,950
Have a good day.

154
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,590
Thank you.

155
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,380
Here is your order.

156
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,720
Pardon me.
You definitely removed the onions, right?

157
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,100
Yes.

158
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,810
Thank you.

159
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,560
Have a good day!

160
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,810
What was that?

161
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,860
I thought he had a new secretary.

162
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,490
I know. Ms. Gong said that Ms. Lee quit
to get ready for the wedding,

163
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,490
-and that a new secretary came.
-Yeah.

164
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,160
It's fake then.

165
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,410
Fake news.

166
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,620
Ms. Gong, the top informant
of Gotop Education,

167
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,460
could be so off like this.

168
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,250
Do you know what happens
when Earth's current temperature

169
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,340
rises by one degree?

170
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,380
A giant glacier will melt down,

171
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,180
there will be endless famine,

172
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,220
more than 50 million people
won't have sufficient water,

173
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,890
and 10% of land animals

174
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,100
will face the danger of extinction.

175
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,110
Thus, what does one degree
of temperature difference mean?

176
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,740
It's a tremendous
and unacceptable mistake.

177
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,410
The temperature of this coffee is
69 degrees Celsius.

178
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,370
Unacceptable.

179
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,250
What's with

180
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,340
that disrespectful expression?

181
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,970
You brought me lukewarm coffee
even a dog wouldn't want to drink.

182
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,300
I'll buy you a new one.

183
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
I'm sorry.

184
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,480
Perhaps the house is a bit dusty.

185
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,630
Gosh, my back.

186
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,140
I'll clean it quickly.
I'm cleaning it now.

187
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,880
I'm suddenly craving bulgogi today.

188
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,460
Is the place called, "Master's Bulgogi"?

189
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,090
I heard there's always
a line out the door there.

190
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,470
I see. I'll go get it right away.

191
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,490
I heard that eating too much meat
is terrible for your health.

192
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,240
It would've been a disaster.

193
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,580
I want to eat very fresh…

194
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,170
very fresh live octopus.

195
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,890
Please prepare them well.

196
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,180
Use lots of sesame oil.

197
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,310
Wait…

198
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,990
I can't eat it.

199
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,290
I feel so bad for the octopus.

200
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,830
Oh well.

201
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,750
I'll just eat a sandwich.

202
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,500
-What?
-What's wrong?

203
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,970
You said you'd do anything, right?

204
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,330
So handsome.

205
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,580
NOH GOJIN
TOP INSTRUCTOR IN THE UNIVERSE

206
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,510
Hello, sir.

207
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,310
Something seems different, but not really.

208
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,600
They're beyond my comprehension.

209
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,650
Please follow me.

210
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,060
Let's go inside.

211
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,280
-Hello.
-Hello.

212
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,570
-Hi, kids.
-Come this way.

213
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,780
Do-re-mi-fa-sol

214
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,330
I'll take care of it.

215
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,540
-Can you summarize this?
-Sure, will do.

216
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,040
-Go now.
-How does this work?

217
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,750
Hey, go now.

218
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,040
-Gosh, there isn't much time.
-Hey, want drinks after?

219
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,750
-Jeez, how can you drink every day?
-What's going on?

220
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,090
What's wrong?

221
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,390
What's going on?

222
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,390
-My goodness.
-What's going on?

223
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,850
What are these cuties doing here?

224
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,140
What's going on?

225
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,320
-So cute.
-They're already different, right?

226
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,280
The mothers in Gangnam already have
everything lined up for kids that age.

227
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,160
That's why they're visiting
the private education company already.

228
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,950
They're from Gotop's company daycare.

229
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,740
-I'll go with them.
-Sure.

230
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,080
What are
the company daycare kids doing here?

231
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
Let's follow them too.

232
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,290
Why would we do that?

233
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,670
Gosh, don't you get it?

234
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,340
It's for advertising.

235
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,000
They called the reporters to show off

236
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,880
that we're operating a company daycare.

237
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,340
Reporters?

238
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,010
That punk. He goes cheerfully
as long as there's a camera.

239
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,310
What?

240
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,180
Wait for me!

241
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,600
I'm going too.

242
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,320
Come this way.

243
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,990
This way. Good job.

244
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,250
Over here?

245
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,890
What's going on here?

246
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,890
Did these people hear that I have amnesia?

247
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,580
-Sir, thank you for the on-time dismissal!
-Sir, thank you for the on-time dismissal!

248
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,620
On-time dismissal?

249
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,170
Sir, my kids are very happy with me.

250
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,170
It was hard for employees
with kids to work late,

251
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,130
but we get to go home
with our kids these days.

252
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,220
Our kids love it so much.

253
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,720
Kids, do you remember what we prepared?

254
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,100
Okay, begin!

255
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,020
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

256
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,770
-That's mine!
-Mine.

257
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:51,850
Mine!

258
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,940
-Mine!
-Mine!

259
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,480
No!

260
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,280
Sir, thank you for letting us pull
our monthly paid vacation days together.

261
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,160
I got to go see my family
on my mother's birthday

262
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,570
without worrying about my in-laws.

263
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Monthly paid vacation?

264
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,040
Sir, the beef was so delicious.

265
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,120
Our company dinners are on another level.

266
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,920
You're awesome. You're the best.

267
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,130
Beef?

268
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,260
The thing is… Actually…

269
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,310
Oh my. What's with her?

270
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,800
I'm not going to run away
without paying the bill, okay?

271
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,550
You know where I live
and my social security number too.

272
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,430
Neulpureun Hospital is so big.
How can you be so heartless?

273
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,850
I won't run away
without paying the hospital bills.

274
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,350
Yes, I will!

275
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,570
I'll make sure to pay my child's bills
even if I have to sell my organs,

276
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,360
so don't you worry. Darn you!

277
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,160
Gosh, darn freaking money.

278
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,420
I wish money fell from the sky. Seriously.

279
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,510
Customer number 194.
Please come to counter number 5.

280
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,590
-May I help you?
-I'm here to settle some bills.

281
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,640
Patient's name, please.

282
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,510
I don't know the patient's name,

283
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,850
but the guardian's name is Gong Pilsun.

284
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,890
Okay.

285
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,770
You'll pay for all the unpaid bills?

286
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,770
Yes. Gotop Education CEO Noh Gojin

287
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,530
found out about the employee
Ms. Gong Pilsun's situation

288
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,360
and said he'll pay
for the entire unpaid bills on her behalf.

289
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,990
I'm so sorry.

290
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,960
-What's going on?
-My gosh.

291
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,870
Lee Sina!

292
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
Sir, I owe you my life.

293
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,220
You saved my son's life.

294
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,140
-What?
-He really did that?

295
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,680
I'll never forget what you've done for me.

296
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,390
From now on,
I'll make sure no one troubles you.

297
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,890
If anyone plays pranks on you,

298
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,110
I'll not let them slide. Mark my words!

299
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,320
I'll protect you, sir. That's right.

300
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,030
A round of applause!

301
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,790
-All right!
-Mr. Noh!

302
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,850
We're here.

303
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,040
It was 31,700,000 won.

304
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,840
You paid for that lady's son's surgery
and hospital bills with my money?

305
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,720
Yes.

306
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,720
You used my precious money carelessly,

307
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,510
as much as you wanted,
cheerfully, as you liked.

308
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,100
I'm so sorry.

309
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,730
It's okay.

310
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,360
Since my fiancée will pay it all back.

311
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,480
Right?

312
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,320
Why aren't you answering?

313
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,540
Yes.

314
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,000
I'll pay it all back.

315
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,310
Who knew things would turn out like this?

316
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,730
It's 31,700,000 won.

317
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,030
Please just let me die instead.

318
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,780
What am I going to do?

319
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,300
I'm so thirsty.

320
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,290
What the heck?

321
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,760
Okhee.

322
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,260
What am I going to do now?

323
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,550
What now?

324
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,720
I'm going to die.

325
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,930
Why would you die?

326
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,310
Mr. Noh Manners' memories--

327
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,690
If you tell anyone
that I don't have amnesia,

328
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,110
it won't end with
just working for me without pay.

329
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,610
Darn it.

330
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,410
What about your hubby
Mr. Noh Manners' memories?

331
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,620
No, it's not that.

332
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,040
Then what? What's wrong?

333
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,100
Nothing. Forget it.

It's… finally today.

336
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,830
Yes, sir.

337
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,580
How much time
do we have left counting down?

338
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,630
Exactly 30 minutes, sir.

339
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,210
They'll be released in 30 minutes.

340
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,940
Noh Gojin!

341
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,070
I'll make sure you pay for humiliating me!

What's this? It's identical.

350
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,980
How is this possible?

351
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,360
It's totally identical.

352
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,530
They just copied and pasted it.

353
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,320
We worked so hard to make this. Ms. Ma!

354
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,910
-Goodness.
-Oh my!

355
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,620
How is this possible?

356
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,330
How could they be identical?

357
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,460
-I think someone leaked our materials.
-No.

358
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,040
I think someone leaked our materials.

359
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,130
-Ms. Ma.
-Was it you?

360
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,380
You know how hard we worked-- Mr. Oh!

361
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,260
How in the world…

362
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,760
How could this be?

363
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,350
Yes. Okay.

364
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,650
Sir.

365
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,480
The first set of copies are
sold out already!

366
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,750
That arrogant punk.

367
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,960
They say fools rush in
where angels fear to tread. How dare he!

368
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,800
He's just a janitor!

369
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,140
MA EUNJUNG

370
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,350
Yes, sir.

371
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,150
Ms. Ma? Yes. How is Mr. Noh Manners doing?

372
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,860
Mr. Noh didn't come to work today,

373
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,070
and Mr. Oh only came
to the research office briefly and left.

374
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,870
Why didn't Mr. Noh
come to the office today?

375
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,790
Knowing his personality,

376
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,130
maybe he fainted…
from his rising blood pressure.

377
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,170
That's it!

378
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,260
Knowing Mr. Noh Manners' personality,
I'm sure he fainted.

379
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:05,430
At this rate,
maybe he won't make it to KPEDA either.

380
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,430
Perhaps.

381
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,220
Congratulations on your success, sir.

382
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,310
I owe my success to you, Ms. Ma.

383
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,310
Just hang in there a little longer.

384
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:22,570
Ilpum Edu will
pave your way for teaching soon.

385
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,570
Thank--

386
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,280
Thank you, sir.

387
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,200
Salute!

388
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,050
What's going on? Why did you tell me
not to come to the office?

389
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,050
Actually, there's a problem at work.

390
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,840
Problem? What problem?

391
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,760
You don't remember it,

392
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:54,850
but we prepared math study guides
before you got into the accident.

393
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:59,900
Ilpum Edu released study guides
that are almost identical to ours today.

394
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,650
On top of that,
it was an explosive success

395
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,530
with the first set of copies
sold out in a day.

396
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,740
If they're almost identical,
they're the same, right?

397
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,790
Yes, that's the case.

398
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,830
How is that possible?

399
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,790
I know. I feel ashamed as the deputy CEO.

400
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,750
Perhaps,

401
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,710
someone from our side
leaked the materials?

402
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,590
I thought about that too,

403
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:30,930
but rather than reprimanding
the teaching assistants in research,

404
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:35,680
we should urge them to release
different study guides quickly.

405
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,060
What do you think?

406
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,980
Okay. I'll go with your suggestion.

407
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,610
I take your word for it
when it comes to most things.

408
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,950
So I take your word for it
when it comes to most things, however…

409
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,870
What's wrong?

410
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,210
What? Nothing.

411
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,290
Thank you, Gojin. I'll take care of it.

412
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,540
Oh, right. And this.

413
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
What is it?

414
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,720
The Korean Private Education
Development Association.

415
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,340
It's a group for industry personnel.

416
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:15,260
They're having a big event
for their tenth anniversary.

417
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,520
We have to RSVP our attendance by today.

418
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,850
Since it'll be hard for you to go,
I'll go on your behalf.

419
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,310
No. I'll go.

420
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,730
But you won't remember
any of the members--

421
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,030
I just need the members' information
ahead of time. I can memorize it quickly.

422
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,900
Somehow,

423
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,740
I have a feeling
that it's going to be very interesting.

424
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,910
If you're so worried,

425
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,580
I'll go with Ms. Sina.

426
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,880
Me?

427
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,670
No, I'm not going.

428
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,300
Please go with him.
I won't be so worried then.

436
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,130
May I help you?

437
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,090
Well… The thing is…

438
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,140
Please relax.

439
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,970
I can solve all your issues…

440
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,720
since I'm a lawyer.

441
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:24,640
Okay.

442
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,320
It's concerning my friend.

443
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:37,570
She pretended to be the fiancée
of a man who has amnesia.

444
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,490
And she damaged some of his belongings.

445
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,580
But the damaged items are very expensive,

446
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,710
so the amount is significant.

447
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,040
How much?

448
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,590
About… one billion won.

449
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,470
One billion?

450
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,050
My friend is trying to pay it all back
by working diligently.

451
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,010
But the man said
he'll seize her father's house,

452
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,140
so she's very worried about that.

453
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,060
-She's a gold digger.
-No, she is not!

454
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,810
She used a man who has amnesia,

455
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,440
pretended to be his fiancée, and committed
a billion-won fraud. That's a gold digger.

456
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,860
But she had a good reason--

457
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,490
All crooks have their reasons.

458
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,620
There is nothing more to talk about.

459
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,830
Don't bother getting a lawyer.
Go tell her to turn herself in right away.

460
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,870
-Turn herself in?
-If she wants leniency.

461
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:32,960
Is there… no other way?

462
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,460
There is just one.

463
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,300
What is it?

464
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,390
Do everything the victim says
no matter what

465
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:43,850
and negotiate well.

466
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:48,810
That's the only way out, Ms. Lee Sina.

467
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,990
How did he know my name?

468
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:03,990
Did I tell him?

469
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,450
Whatever.

470
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,040
God, please let me get out of this mess.

471
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,470
Darn it!

472
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,010
When your phone rings,

473
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,770
you'd better pick it up
before the fifth ring.

474
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,100
MR. NOH GOJIN

475
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,110
Hello, sir?

476
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:40,320
I don't care whatever
my fiancée is doing wherever she is.

477
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,950
Come immediately to the beauty salon
in Cheongdam-dong in ten minutes.

478
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,030
Pardon?

479
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,870
Hello-- Darn it!

480
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,250
Taxi!

481
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,790
Taxi!

482
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,340
Welcome. Do you have a reservation?

483
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,300
No, I don't know about the reservation,

484
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,550
but Mr. Noh Gojin asked me to come.

485
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,680
What are you doing? What's going on?

486
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,770
What are you doing?

487
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,030
What now?

488
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,920
Why am I getting this?

489
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,360
What is it now?

490
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,750
What the heck are you doing?

491
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,000
All done, sir.

492
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,660
Well, I guess putting lipstick
on a pig does work.

493
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,180
Ms. Lee Sina.

494
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,470
Do you know the difference
between the truth and a lie?

495
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,390
Pardon?

496
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,270
A show.

497
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,360
A lie requires a splendid show.

498
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,450
That way, it's easier to entice people
without creating any doubt.

499
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,490
Now, let's go to put on a show.

500
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,290
I'm faking amnesia
and you're faking to be my fiancée.

501
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,350
These are new products
not yet available in the store.

502
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,780
You're so beautiful
no matter what you wear, Ms. Baek.

503
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,360
Everyone's going to be stunned
when they see you.

504
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,030
No.

505
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,740
There's only one person I want to stun.

506
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:25,960
I want to be the most beautiful woman
in his eyes today.

507
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,180
That one.

508
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,840
10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY
KPEDA REGULAR EVENT

509
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,010
You're here.

510
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,430
By the way, Mr. Park. Congratulations.

511
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,430
Your new study guides are so successful.

512
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:22,640
Gosh.

513
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,900
No big deal.

514
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,610
What do you mean, no big deal?
Your old skills are shining through.

515
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:28,860
-Of course.
-That's right.

516
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:34,360
At this rate, you're going to break
the math study guide top sales record.

517
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,830
You're making me blush.

518
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,910
-He's too humble.
-I know.

519
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:57,050
Sorry. I need to use the restroom.

520
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,410
Mr. Noh! Step aside.

521
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:23,290
I was so shocked
after hearing about your accident.

522
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:28,130
I'm glad you've fully recovered like this.

523
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,500
Who is he kidding?

524
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,170
I'm sure he was thrilled
to hear me suffer.

525
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,800
Thank you for your thoughts.

526
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,100
Of course.

527
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,680
I thought

528
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:48,060
you weren't coming, Mr. Noh.
What a surprise.

529
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,900
Why wouldn't I come?

530
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:55,950
Were you hoping that I wouldn't come?

531
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,030
Because of the incident with your wife.

532
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,030
I trust that you received the bags?

533
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,660
What bags?

534
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,210
At a department store recently--

535
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,130
Mr. Noh. I heard that
you'll be publishing new study guides

536
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,840
at the end of next month.

537
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:16,920
You should stay alert.

538
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:21,220
Mr. Park might replace
your study guide top sales record.

539
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,720
The third set is already sold out, right?

540
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:26,850
Gosh. The fourth set.

541
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,400
-Already? The fourth set?
-The fourth set?

542
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,110
Wow, you're amazing.

543
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,070
You really are.

544
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:52,290
GOTOP EDUCATION DEPUTY CEO OH SEGI

545
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:58,090
You cherished Mr. Kang Min too, right?

546
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:02,550
So I take your word for it
when it comes to most things, however…

547
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,760
I take your word for it
when it comes to most things.

548
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,750
Great watch.

549
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:34,790
What? Out of the blue?

550
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,510
It looks nice.

551
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,640
It's bleeding.

552
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:54,270
10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY
KPEDA REGULAR EVENT

553
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:04,620
Sir! We have a problem.

554
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,740
What is it? Why are you making a fuss?

555
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,720
There are comments posted
saying our guides have errors.

556
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,550
What do you mean by errors?

557
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,180
NUMBER 10 ON PAGE 78 IS WEIRD
I WANT A REFUND

558
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:30,180
What's all this?

559
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:31,890
DID YOU REVIEW IT PROPERLY?
WASTE OF MONEY

560
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:34,770
Thief.

561
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,730
What did you say?

562
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,110
What did you just say?

563
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,360
You stole my study guides.

564
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,950
Have you lost your mind?
When did I do that?

565
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,780
Do you have evidence? Do you?

566
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:50,620
Evidence?

567
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,750
I planted…

568
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,920
fifteen erroneous questions inside.

569
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,790
What?

570
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,460
A special event.

571
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,800
I was going to give gifts
to the first 100 students

572
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,340
who find the erroneous questions.

573
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:06,930
The latest cell phone.

574
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,220
Perhaps because the questions are hard,
it's taking a little while.

575
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:14,390
But you'll be flooded with complaints now.

576
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,020
What are you talking about?

577
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,980
You didn't even review them, did you?

578
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,530
I told my research team
that I reviewed them all myself,

579
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:29,580
and that they were the final version
to be published right away.

580
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,750
You should've tried solving them.

581
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:37,580
But I doubt you could've found the errors
since your brain is rusty.

582
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,130
That's how you become
old and insignificant, Mr. Park.

583
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,470
You opened the Champagne bottle too early.

584
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,390
You're no match for me. Do you know why?

585
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,610
Because I was destroyed by you before.

586
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:16,210
It's not true.

587
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:20,080
That punk is bluffing me.

588
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:23,210
He's blinded by jealousy,
so he's lying to me.

589
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,010
He's lying…

590
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,720
-Oh no!
-Mr. Park!

591
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,260
-Wake up, Mr. Park!
-Gosh.

592
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,600
-Mr. Park!
-Wake up, Mr. Park!

593
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,520
-Mr. Park!
-Call an ambulance!

594
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:39,560
10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY
KPEDA REGULAR EVENT

595
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:42,440
Did we come too late?

596
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,650
The star of the show always comes last.

597
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,900
Then I have time
to check myself in the mirror, right?

598
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,110
Yes.

599
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:12,390
Great.

600
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:14,970
Perfect.

601
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:21,770
It hurts.

602
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:27,110
Oh, my. Thank you…

603
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:29,400
Oh, Ms. Sooyeong!

604
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,200
Ms. Sina!

605
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,540
Wow, you look so pretty.
I almost didn't recognize you.

606
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,500
No, you look
so much more beautiful than me.

607
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,040
We run into each other often.

608
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:45,630
Tell me about it.

609
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,720
I guess you don't wear heels very often.

610
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:54,430
No, since I always
have to run around for work,

611
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,220
I generally don't prefer to wear heels.

612
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:59,390
But higher things are great,
so don't give them up.

613
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,190
Maybe because I'm a country bumpkin.
Heels aren't for me.

614
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:06,610
Don't worry. If you wear them often,
you'll get used to them.

615
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:13,660
By the way, you said last time
you work at Gotop Education, right?

616
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:17,160
Yes, I came here today
because our CEO is attending the event.

617
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,120
By any chance, are you Gojin--

618
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,420
Are you Gotop Education CEO's secretary?

619
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,380
Yes.

620
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,760
Wow, what a small world.

621
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,430
We're sharing a man.

622
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,010
Pardon?

623
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,100
Nothing.

624
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,350
What brings you here today?

625
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:45,480
You'll find out soon.
See you in a little bit then.

626
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:46,900
Okay.

627
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,620
My goodness. What happened?

628
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,500
They think
Park Yangtae had sleeping pills.

629
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,040
I heard the study guides are
full of errors. I guess he feels ashamed.

630
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:21,350
But what's taking this woman so long?

631
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:34,990
Look, sir.

632
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:38,740
My goodness. You're here.

633
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,120
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

634
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Where is Mr. Park Yangtae?

635
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,500
He had an urgent personal matter.

636
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,960
In any case, welcome.

637
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,090
I'm not even qualified yet.

638
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,050
I hope I'm not inconveniencing you
by attending today.

639
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:58,510
Please don't say that.

640
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,180
It's an honor to have you at the KPEDA.

641
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,060
I'm glad you came.

642
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:05,230
One moment, please.

643
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:09,020
Okay, everyone.
May I have your attention, please?

644
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:13,860
She recently acquired Eutteum School
and launched Baek Edu.

645
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,900
She's the youngest daughter
of Gunil Group's owner

646
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,490
as well as the newest member of KPEDA.

647
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,910
Let me introduce
CEO Baek Sooyeong of Baek Edu.

648
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:34,840
Oh, right. And Eutteum School was
acquired by Gunil Group.

649
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,920
Hello.

650
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:40,010

654
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:22,590
Higher things?

655
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,890
The best is having peace of mind.

656
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,990
CEO of Baek Edu?

657
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,530
I'm sorry for not telling you sooner.

658
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:50,040
I wanted us to be friends
who feel comfortable around each other.

659
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,960
Why on earth
are you back in my life again?

660
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:00,720
Are you upset?

661
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,430
So are you not going to be my friend?

662
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,190
Fine. Let's be friends.

663

I want to introduce to my friend.

665
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:39,340
This is my fiancée Lee Sina.

666
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,430
Fian… Fiancée?

667
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:48,310

-Congratulations!

673
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:33,270
My fiancée feels uncomfortable
at events like this,

674
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,400
so we just came to say hello today.

675

I need your permission.

684
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,130
-Pardon?
-But I'm not going to ask for it.

685
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,720
Because I'm…

686
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,310
so desperate right now.

687
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,190
