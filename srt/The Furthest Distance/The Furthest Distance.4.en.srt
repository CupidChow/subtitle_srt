00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:48,479
Here.

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,520
This one.

19
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,600
What?

20
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:52,479
Milk.

21
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,479
I've read your medical report.

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,999
Although there're no major problems,

23
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,960
you still need to rest.

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,759
No staying up late. No coffee.

25
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,040
I've told you all

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,839
that I'm fine.

27
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,440
Don't worry for nothing.

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,479
Aren't all young men like that now,

29
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,199
crying out for rest and quiet-quitting,

30
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,519
yet also trying to give it their best?

31
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's get down to business.

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,479
Listen.

33
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:20,199
Can we push our program back
a couple of days?

34
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:23,639
I've been studying rainbow glass
at the glass workshop lately.

35
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,320
But I'm not satisfied with

36
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,400
the colors I have made.

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,199
So, it might take a few more days for me

38
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,280
to make some adjustments.

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,959
All I can say is

40
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,199
I'll try to postpone it for you.

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,519
But you need to hurry up.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,280
Because during the last meeting,

43
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,880
Liu had already had issues.

44
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,880
Luckily, I gave Qin Yunsheng a hint

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,799
and we played along.

46
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,120
Understood.

47
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,400
Speak of the devil. Look.

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,239
Qin Yunsheng?

49
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,199
(Remember to take the gastroscopy.)

50
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,799
I remember that in your report,

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,880
there was this test, right?

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,679
Didn't you take it?

53
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,799
I have confidence in my body.

54
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,919
Are you scared?

55
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,639
Who's scared?

56
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,720
If not, you should go and do it.

57
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,199
I just don't think it's necessary.

58
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,519
Look at you.

59
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,720
You're scared.

60
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,359
Not scared at all.

61
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,479
Not scared at all.

62
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,720
I have to go.

63
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,320
I have to hurry back and study my glass.

64
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,199
Drink less coffee.

65
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,959
And get the gastroscopy done.

66
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:40,584
(Glass Workshop)

67
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,600
(Remember to take the gastroscopy tomrrow.)

68
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,880
I'm really busy today.
I'll take a rain check.

69
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,679
(When will you
schedule the gastroscopy?)

70
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,319
I'm in the middle of
glassblowing. Rain check.

71
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:27,144
(Garden Road)

72
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:30,359
(Gastroscopy!)

73
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,200
It's not perfect timing, Dr. Qin.

74
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,200
I just finished my breakfast.

75
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,119
I had two boiled eggs.

76
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,239
Egg rolls with pork floss.

77
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,400
Fried dough sticks.

78
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,479
Sandwiches.

79
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,520
And a cup of soy milk.

80
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
I'm so full. I can't do it.

81
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,080
I should do it next time.

82
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,439
Ying,

83
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,999
you don't even eat this much
for breakfast in a month, right?

84
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,840
It was a bit exaggerated, wasn't it?

85
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,400
Ying,

86
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:12,840
why don't you want to
have a gastroscopy?

87
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,359
What's the rush for that?

88
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,879
I'll do it later.

89
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,799
I have a physical each year.
What could go wrong?

90
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,400
Hurry up.

91
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:38,960
Hello?

92
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,479
Dr. Qin.

93
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,720
Here's the thing.

94
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,879
After the session,

95
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,280
we will enter the formal construction.

96
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,040
Next, you may have to
do an interview with Miss Su.

97
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,479
Will we do it together?

98
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,720
Of course.

99
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:56,879
No problem.

100
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,799
Alright. I wonder when you're available.

101
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,056
The sooner, the better.

102
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:05,760
An interview is fine.

103
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:06,760
But I have a request.

104
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:07,999
I won't do it with him.

105
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,040
Why?

106
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,520
Did you two fight?

107
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,200
You have no idea.

108
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,679
He's been acting like a blabber,

109
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,640
constantly nagging me.

110
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,879
About what?

111
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,679
Just help me out this time, will you?

112
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,600
So it's settled.

113
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,040
I'm driving. Bye.

114
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,640
Let me do it.

115
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Didn't we agree to interview separately?

116
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,600
I suggested to do it together.

117
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,720
After all, we have to consider
the reaction.

118
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:06,559
Dr. Qin, here's the thing.

119
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:07,640
Because recently...

120
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,919
I came today
just for the interview.

121
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,479
So, let's get down to business.

122
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,600
Later,

123
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,960
we will have a comment part

124
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:19,040
between the designer and the client.

125
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:19,840
For now,

126
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:21,879
let's go through the script.

127
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,319
So,

128
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,479
Su, there you go.

129
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,040
Okay.

130
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:32,239
Dr. Qin is a highly critical,

131
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,200
yet exceptionally tasteful client.

132
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,439
For me, his case

133
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,840
represents a challenge,

134
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:38,319
but I enjoy the process.

135
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:41,999
What about you, Dr. Qin?

136
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:47,080
There's no doubt that Miss Su is

137
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
an excellent designer.

138
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:50,600
But she is obstinate in her work,

139
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,319
refusing to listen to valid suggestions

140
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,319
or communicate.

141
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,520
As an outstanding designer,

142
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:57,679
she always prefers to
stay in her comfort zone

143
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,319
and lacks the courage to break through.

144
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,960
Which valid suggestion of yours

145
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
did I not listen to?

146
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,960
You should know
which one I'm referring to.

147
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,200
Then how do I lack courage?

148
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,160
Even a minor gastroscopy scares you.

149
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,999
Where's your courage?

150
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,760
I just don't have the time to do it now.

151
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,600
Don't make excuses to cover your fear.

152
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:27,119
What breakthrough can one make

153
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,600
if they are afraid
of undergoing a gastroscopy?

154
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,799
Don't say things like that.

155
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:35,959
I don't like it.

156
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:37,880
Who says Su doesn't dare

157
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,040
to get a gastroscopy?

158
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,839
She just doesn't dare.

159
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,319
There's no reason for her to fear it.

160
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,839
Are you speaking for your friend?

161
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,799
I'm not speaking for anyone.

162
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,839
Even I dare to get one.

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,719
Why wouldn't she?

164
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,240
Yes, you do.

165
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,919
But she doesn't.

166
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:50,880
Is it you who know her

167
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:51,679
or is it me?

168
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,319
I can't tell.

169
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,799
Enough.

170
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,959
You don't need to provoke me.

171
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,079
Just a gastroscopy.

172
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,199
What's the big deal?

173
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,319
I'll do it.

174
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,719
I'm on an empty stomach now.

175
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:01,959
I'm going to do it now.

176
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,520
So, you kept urging her
to do the gastroscopy,

177
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,679
but she kept procrastinating.

178
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,559
Yeah.

179
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,599
We do have to think of a way.

180
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,199
But I think she's scared of
doing the gastroscopy.

181
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,760
She had gastroenteritis.

182
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,079
It's necessary to do one.

183
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,520
But all my urging is useless.

184
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:26,919
From what I know about her,

185
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:29,439
urging and coaxing her doesn't work.

186
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:31,079
Nothing we can do then.

187
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:32,880
Well,

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,599
she's naturally competitive.

189
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,160
Look at her name,

190
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,120
Su Ying.

191
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:39,000
It's a homophone for win or lose.

192
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,160
It's in her name.

193
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,640
So,

194
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,439
we have to do exactly the opposite.

195
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,599
Provoke her.

196
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,959
Yes.

197
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,199
Scared?

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,400
You seem to be scared of lots of things.

199
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,640
Could you do the biopsy for her

200
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,839
when you do the gastroscopy?

201
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,719
Okay.

202
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,480
Have you had nothing over eight hours?

203
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,120
Yes.

204
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,520
It's just a routine check-up.

205
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,679
Don't be nervous.

206
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,919
I'm not.

207
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:42,880
I knew from the internet

208
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:44,480
you can tell if a person is healthy

209
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:46,319
by looking at their palm lines.

210
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:47,439
Look at my palm lines.

211
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:48,520
How clear they are.

212
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,839
So healthy.

213
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,120
I won't have a problem, right?

214
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,679
Pretty good.

215
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,079
He is to see patients,

216
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,679
not to fortune-tell.

217
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,199
Let's do a gastroscopy.

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,439
Once done, there will be a barcode.

219
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,400
With the code,

220
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,679
you can print the report by yourself.

221
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,240
Fine.

222
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,280
Okay. Let's do one.

223
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:09,079
Let's do it.

224
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,319
I'm going to the restroom.

225
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,160
Okay.

226
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,240
Yunsheng.

227
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,679
Yunsheng!

228
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,480
Director Ruan,

229
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:36,319
why you are here?

230
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,919
I came to visit you.

231
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,240
I heard you brought a girl

232
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,640
to the hospital together?

233
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,679
Good for you, lad.

234
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,839
Who told you?

235
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,439
They sure can gossip.

236
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,679
How is it at the Emergency?

237
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,480
Busy?

238
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,799
Yes.

239
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,040
See?

240
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,040
Oh, I have to go.

241
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,959
Wait.

242
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:05,319
Since you're not busy,

243
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,959
return to the Cardiology Department.

244
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,160
No, thanks.

245
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:10,360
Yunsheng, look.

246
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,120
Your qualifications and professionalism.

247
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:14,439
Everything is qualified.

248
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,160
If you're rated excellent
two years in a row,

249
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,919
you can be promoted
to associate director.

250
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,919
Your grandfather, your father, and me.

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,199
We all hope that you can be

252
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,160
the first youngest department director

253
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:26,799
since the establishment
of Meichi 30 years ago.

254
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,280
Director.

255
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,360
How old were you back then?

256
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,439
Not old.

257
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,240
Thirty-seven maybe.

258
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,319
That's amazing.

259
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,480
If I apply seven years later,

260
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,199
I will also be the youngest.

261
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,319
Yunsheng,

262
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,439
the Cardiology Department really needs

263
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,640
talents like you.

264
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,760
No matter where we are,
we strive to save lives.

265
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,439
Yes.

266
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,319
But isn't the cardiac surgery department

267
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,919
the most related to life?

268
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,199
Right.

269
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,799
Sit, please.

270
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,640
Listen, these days,

271
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,120
a professional cardiothoracic surgeon

272
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,120
- is hard to find.
- Yes.

273
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,040
Mostly they are physician assistants.

274
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:01,839
Yes.

275
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,880
You are very clear about

276
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,439
why I'm looking for you.

277
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:05,000
Yes.

278
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,120
Though it's not urgent,

279
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,439
it's also not a trivial matter.

280
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,439
Right?

281
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:11,160
Our department is really
looking forward to your return.

282
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,120
When your father

283
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:14,240
entrusted you to me,

284
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,839
I promised him, Yunsheng.

285
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:16,520
I...

286
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,120
Alright then.

287
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:30,760
Go do your work.

288
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,079
Pay attention to your diet
when you go home.

289
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,679
Don't drink water that's too hot.

290
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,799
In recent days,

291
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,760
you'd better have

292
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,520
liquid food or semi-solid foods.

293
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,199
Don't eat spicy, greasy,

294
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,400
stimulating foods.

295
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,919
Also, avoid strenuous exercise.

296
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:54,400
Relax and get more rest.

297
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,120
Okay?

298
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:56,040
Thank you.

299
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:57,480
Oh, right.

300
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,439
This is

301
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,160
left by Dr. Qin specifically.

302
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:09,520
(Remember to consume the glucose.)

303
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,919
I think

304
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,919
the solution to the rainbow project

305
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,240
needs some adjustment.

306
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,760
A while ago, during a meeting,

307
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,839
they said Su Ying is not in good health.

308
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,079
The sample of the rainbow glass

309
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,480
has not been produced until now.

310
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,360
In short,

311
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,559
this program

312
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,599
absolutely cannot follow
the architectural approach.

313
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,640
So, what do you mean?

314
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:36,679
Change the plan.

315
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,439
No rainbow glass.

316
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:39,959
What if I insist?

317
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,760
You insist?

318
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,439
Du Huixuan.

319
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,319
Don't think I don't know who is

320
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,120
supporting Su Ying all along.

321
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,040
She didn't even show up
at the proposal meeting.

322
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:50,880
What was she doing?

323
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,079
Is she putting on airs?

324
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,199
Oh, my God.

325
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,000
That rainbow glass.

326
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,799
How long has it been?

327
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,880
What have you made?

328
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,760
The filming was delayed.

329
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,799
She didn't come to
the proposal meeting last time.

330
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,000
But only her plan
was unanimously approved.

331
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,480
The postponement of the filming

332
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,040
is to make the final show

333
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,839
at its best.

334
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,919
Alright. Fine.

335
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,760
In the end,

336
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,120
regardless of the reason,

337
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,040
if she fails to make the rainbow glass

338
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,000
and the program cannot go on,

339
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,679
who's going to take the responsibility?

340
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,799
I am.

341
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,280
I'll leave my words here now.

342
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,839
If for any reason,

343
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,520
Miss Su causes the program
to be delayed,

344
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,120
I'll take responsibility and resign.

345
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,880
Not these wrinkles.

346
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,640
Su Ying.

347
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,719
Come. Over here.

348
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:49,640
I'm going back.

349
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,599
Help me contact

350
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,880
the glass workshop and check

351
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,199
how's the color modulation going.

352
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:54,480
I'll go there in the next days.

354

(May be stomach cancer.)

355
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,760
Take the medicine on time.

356
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,559
- Thank you, Dr. Qin.
- Okay.

357
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,959
Dr. Qin.

358
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,640
Are you looking for your friend?

359
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,599
Yes. Did she print the report?

360
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,959
Just printed the report.
She's already left.

361
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,079
She left?

362
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,040
Don't be afraid.

363
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,040
Medical technology is so advanced.

364
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,639
I will be fine.

I need to buy a wig.

Dr. Qin?

371
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,159
The report is out?

372
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,799
Let me take a look.

373
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:42,359
It came out so quickly.

374
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:01,920
Su Ying.

375
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,079
You are so busy with work.

376
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,040
You don't eat on time,

377
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:07,159
nor sleep...

378
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:07,639
I know.

379
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,159
I know I have many problems.

380
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,240
I will improve.

381
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,359
I will eat on time.

382
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,480
I will sleep on time.

383
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:13,240
I will listen.

384
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:14,159
Is that okay, Dr. Qin?

385
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,280
And annual physical.

386
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,200
Okay, okay.

387
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,240
I will do it every year.

388
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:19,920
Alright.

389
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,000
Come with me.

390
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,359
Where are you taking me?

391
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,079
Yes, that's a mistake.

392
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:32,920
Biopsy results take three to five days.

393
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,559
How could you possibly get them today?

394
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:39,208
(Su Ying, male, 40 years old)

395
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:44,680
(Female, 29 years old)

396
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,839
This report belongs to someone else.

397
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,000
Could you please return it?

398
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,000
Thank you very much.

399
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,119
You're welcome.

400
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:55,839
Please calm down.

401
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,079
Get the biopsy report

402
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,399
after three workdays.

403
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,280
Did you get that?

404
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,319
Okay, okay.

405
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:03,920
Thank you, Doctor.

406
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,159
Then I'll come to see you in three days.

407
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,839
- Alright. No problem.
- Thank you.

408
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,879
Thank you.

409
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,079
You're welcome.

410
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:20,839
A qualified doctor

411
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,559
needs to master professional theory,

412
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,000
practical operation skills,

413
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,399
and strong psychological quality.

414
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,159
Normally, I don't smile.

415
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:31,440
Unless I really...

416
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,000
Unless you really can't help it.

417
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,159
Laugh all you want.

418
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,079
While I'm still in a good mood,

419
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
laugh as much as you want.

420
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,680
Oh, right.

421
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:48,799
Have you been looking for me
for a while?

422
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,720
How did you know I was on the staircase?

423
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,960
In hospitals, when patients break down,

424
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,480
they usually go to the staircase.

425
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:56,559
Out of experience.

426
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,680
Well,

427
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,399
where will doctors go

428
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,559
if they break down?

429
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,599
Where is your breakdown space,

430
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,680
Dr. Qin?

431
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,040
Mine?

432
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,559
I should have known it was here.

433
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,159
When I'm sad and upset,

434
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,480
I will come here alone.

435
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,159
This is your so-called...

436
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:44,159
Breakdown space.

437
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,159
Yes.

438
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,000
Thank you.

439
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,280
Do you know

440
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,319
what my biggest feeling is?

441
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,200
What is it?

442
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:09,159
Humans, in the face of disease,

443
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,879
are so small and helpless.

444
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,680
I just think you doctors

445
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,639
are really great.

446
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,799
You are the last barrier

447
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,079
between patients and the Grim Reaper.

448
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,119
In fact, in addition to

449
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,839
saving lives and treating injuries,

450
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,760
doctors have to learn to face

451
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,280
their own pain and powerlessness.

452
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,119
The pain and powerlessness you feel

453
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:50,680
when you fail to keep
what you want to save the most.

454
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,839
But you've tried your best.

455
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,720
So, you'll have no regrets.

456
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,680
That's not true.

457
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,559
Regrets are regrets,

458
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,119
because many things

459
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,119
can't be replayed.

460
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,159
People always have to move forward,

461
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,480
don't they?

462
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,319
When I went for surgery before,

463
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,000
my teacher told me

464
00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:33,960
that performing surgery is actually like

465
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,559
walking in a maze.

466
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,079
The more complex the surgery,

467
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,159
the slower the pace.

468
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:42,559
Once you slow down,

469
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:46,040
you will find the way out.

470
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:52,480
Slow down

471
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,799
and you'll find the way out.

472
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,040

House Design is a six-year-old project,

505
00:27:06,632 --> 00:27:07,520
which is outdated.

506
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,079
I didn't expect

507
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
that with your involvement,

508
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,079
this season would gain such momentum.

509
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,280
Quite impressive.

510
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,000
Hardly.

511
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:18,280
However,

512
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,720
someone thought

513
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,200
it was all because of her own efforts.

514
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,720
Are you referring to Du Huixuan?

515
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,000
She thought the Glass House

516
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,000
was her own project.

517
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,720
The designer Su Ying is also hers.

518
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,480
She even dared to make a promise to me.

519
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:35,960
So, your visit this time is...

520
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,599
I'm just afraid the show can't go on.

521
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,520
It would be great

522
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:43,200
if there would be someone

523
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,799
who'd replace Su Ying.

524
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:48,879
And this person

525
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,639
has to be your own man.

526
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,480
What do you say?

527
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:00,319
As long as you are willing to come,

528
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,520
of course, I'll support you.

530
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,200
Something is wrong with Ying today.

531
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,240
She was the most
enthusiastic about fritting.

532
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,720
What happened today?

533
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,720
What is on her mind?

534
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,399
Is it because the test results came out

535
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,720
and hit her badly?

536
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,159
Yes.

537
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,599
Shall we ask her what happened?

538
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,559
Agreed.

539
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,200
Ye, go ask.

540
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:34,920
Chen, could you go ask?

541
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,879
Me?

00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:37,280
Mingshi.

543
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,839
I think you should go.

Let's go together.

545
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,680
Go.

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,240
Easy.

00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,280
What a good day today.

548
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,200
Yeah.

00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:55,559
Ying.

550
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,920
Are you in a good mood today?

551
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:59,200
Ying,

552
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,480
you could tell us

553
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,559
if something's going on.

554
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,920
You can't keep it all to yourself.

555
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,119
I'm fine.

556
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,480
Don't worry.

557
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,319
Well.

558
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,399
Has the medical report been out?

559
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,480
Why are you all asking about that?

560
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,240
You're this concerned?

561
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,720
When you were hospitalized,

562
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
we were all worried.

563
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,960
So worried.

564
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,480
Last time you disappeared
after getting the results,

565
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,720
Dr. Qin called every single one of us.

566
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:24,879
Coincidentally,

567
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,280
I'm about to go see Dr. Qin right now.

568
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,520
Ying,

569
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,319
it's not that serious

570
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,559
to confront Dr. Qin.

571
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:32,559
Ying, our most urgent matter

572
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,960
is fritting.

573
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,440
Right.

574
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,280
You're right.

575
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,960
We were too anxious before.

576
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,200
Sometimes,

577
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,520
we need to slow down.

578
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,599
Wait for the wind.

579
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:45,960
Right.

580
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,960
Wait for the wind.

581
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,159
Is there wind?

582
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,839
Did you hear it?

583
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,359
No, I didn't.

584
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,599
Mingshi, did you see it?

585
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,960
I didn't see anything.

586
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,079
Where's the wind?

587
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,159
Keep up.

588
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,319
Time's up.

589
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,960
How many?

590
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,599
It's so hard to pick them up.

591
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
I've picked up six.

592
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,720
Yunsheng,

593
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,799
I heard you hold the record
for picking up beans.

594
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,119
Could you teach me?

595
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:45,920
I wasn't good at first.

596
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,159
Practice makes perfect.

597
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,359
Practice more.

598
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,879
I'll give it another go.

599
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,599
Okay.

600
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:53,599
Ready?

601
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,119
Go.

602
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,399
Hurry up.

603
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,879
(Are you resting, Dr. Qin?)

604
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,319
(Meet me in the garden.)

605
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:16,159
A return present.

606
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,559
Open it.

607
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,760
It can improve your actions per minute

608
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,240
and focus.

609
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,240
Most of you doctors

610
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,480
need to practice this, yes?

611
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:32,839
For six years old.

612
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
The boss said
it's suitable for all ages.

613
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,359
Don't underestimate this maze.

614
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
It's difficult.

615
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:44,200
Well,

616
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:45,960
if you can find your way out,

617
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,280
I'll grant you a wish.

618
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:49,359
Thanks.

619
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,240
Huixuan.

620
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
Hurry up. Get in the car.

621
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,480
Hazelnut latte. Your favorite.

622
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:34,960
Thanks. That's considerate.

623
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:38,680
Your senior sister
went to talk to Dr. Qin

624
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,799
about their work?

625
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,680
She has been almost
stuck in the glass workshop.

626
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,960
She made the glass

627
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,559
with one furnace after another,

628
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,879
but she always felt unsatisfied.

629
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,680
In her mind,
it's only sixty out of a hundred.

630
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,920
It's sixty.

631
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,599
What else then?

632
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,040
Sixty points is already enough.

633
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,440
At this critical moment,

634
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,200
is she trying to

635
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,639
create a sky-filling stone?

636
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,599
Huixuan.

637
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,799
What's wrong with you?

638
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,040
You don't seem quite right.

639
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,480
It's fine.

640
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:04,559
Creating. I understand.

641
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,200
Let her go at her own pace.

642
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,879
When do you think

643
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,079
it would be appropriate for us
to finalize our plan?

644
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:12,200
- One week?
- Two...

645
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:17,200
Wait, Huixuan,

646
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,040
what's wrong?

647
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:18,760
What happened?

648
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:19,960
I'm going to

649
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,119
film the show in three days.

650
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,319
If we postpone it,

651
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,639
I'm going to fail to finish it.

652
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:24,639
But considering

653
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:25,480
her current condition,

654
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,040
I can't put any pressure on her.

655
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,799
Right.

656
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:32,839
Oh, right.

657
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,760
Here.

658
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,240
Snack.

659
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,559
A reward for me? Thank you.

660
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,359
No, no.

661
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,359
For Ying.

662
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,920
Doesn't she request not to be disturbed?

663
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,839
Take this as bait

664
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,319
and help me check on her progress.

665
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,559
No problem. Leave it to me.

666
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,920
Rest assured.

667
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,200
I will urge her,

668
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,119
not push her.

669
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,440
No. Don't rush her.

670
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,799
I just want to know the progress simply.

671
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,280
Okay, then. I'll leave now.

672
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,720
Drive safe.

673
00:33:59,319 --> 00:33:59,839
Thank you.

674
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,040
No problem. Bye.

675
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,559
Bye.

676
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:02,119
Bye.

677
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,360
Look, that's the feeling.

678
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:12,920
So your color-matching ratio was right.

679
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:16,279
Slow and steady wins the race.

680
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,320
Some things simply can't be rushed.

681
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:19,960
Write it down.

682
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,880
- I'll try something else.
- I'm back.

683
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,440
Huixuan asked me
to bring some food for you.

684
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,920
After you finish, let's give it our all.

685
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,119
Thank you, Huixuan.

686
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,920
Ying,

687
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,920
Huixuan specifically asked me

688
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,759
about our progress.

689
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,279
Is she under any pressure?

690
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,279
Hurry up.

691
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,440
Let's speed up.

692
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,040
Okay.

693
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:41,719
Okay.

694
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,840
Hello, Huixuan. What's wrong?

695
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:01,360
What?

696
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,520
Okay. I'll tell Ying right away.

697
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:06,719
Ying.

698
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,679
Something's wrong.

699
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,119
Huixuan just called and said

700
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,320
the crew's warehouse is leaking.

701
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,679
All of our materials are flooded.

702
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,279
How many?

703
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,360
Not sure yet.

704
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,159
But we need to find a new warehouse.

705
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,400
Stay here and watch.

706
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:19,840
Okay.

707
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,400
Mingshi, come.

708
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:20,920
Okay.

709
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:21,599
Be careful.

710
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,320
Sure. Rest assured.

711
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,279
Hello, Ms. Li.

712
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,279
I wanted to ask

713
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,159
if you have any available warehouses.

714
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,279
I need one...

715
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,199
Alright.

716
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,559
Fine. I'll leave you.

717
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:44,920
Bye.

718
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:52,960
Hello, Mr. Wang.

719
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,440
This is Su Ying.

720
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,239
I wanted to ask

721
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,279
if your empty garage...

722
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
You're out of town.

723
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,920
I'll contact you when you're back.

724
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,119
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

725
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:21,239
Drive faster.

726
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,199
Okay.

727
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,040
Hello, Dr. Qin.

728
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,679
I wanted to ask

729
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,599
if your hospital has

730
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,520
any unused warehouses.

731
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,480
Our storage rooms
aren't quite available lately.

732
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,480
What happened?

733
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,960
Our warehouse is leaking.

734
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,239
We have to move now.

735
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,599
I see.

736
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,040
If you store things,

737
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,639
it doesn't have to be a warehouse.

738
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,520
Is the glass house OK?

739
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:51,559
The glass house?

740
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,880
Because your materials
are originally for the glass house.

741
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,320
Consider it an early admission.

742
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,440
Alright.

743
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,520
Take it over.

744
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,440
Huixuan.

745
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,559
How is it?

746
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,599
The specific loss
is still being calculated.

747
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,239
Move them out now.

748
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:03,159
Close and lock the door.

749
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,320
Ying,

750
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,480
they are already loaded.

751
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,159
Okay.

752
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,480
You stay here with Huixuan

753
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,559
and check the warehouse.

754
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,360
I'll deliver the first batch now.

755
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,480
You alone?

756
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,079
Ying...

757
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,199
It's okay.

758
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:21,040
Huixuan, you are soaked.

759
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,400
Wear this. Don't catch a cold.

760
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,239
Leave the rest to me.

761
00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:27,000
Have a rest.

762
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,960
Come on. Move it over there.

763
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,320
I will help you.

764
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,360
Wipe it off. Don't catch a cold.

765
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:15,840
Thank you.

766
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,520
It's okay.

767
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,159
We must preserve the materials.

768
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,320
The loss is still unclear.

769
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:31,279
But we must hurry up
and replenish the stock.

770
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,719
Well, then.

771
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,599
I'm soaking wet.

772
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:07,639
Come in.

773
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:09,840
Put on the jacket.

774
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,400
I'm not cold.

775
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:11,320
You wear it.

776
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,920
I just checked inside.

777
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,079
The main reason for this leak

778
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:17,960
is on the ceiling.

779
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,440
Several pipes have loosened.

780
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,840
No way. The warehouse

781
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:24,880
was just repaired last month.

782
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,400
- Then why?
- Miss Du.

783
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,279
I just checked it out.

784
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,639
A designer named Su

785
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,960
came to our team today

786
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,119
and picked the warehouse here.

787
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,279
Su?

788
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,719
It can't be Ying.

789
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,159
She has been with me all day today.

790
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,599
Who could it be then?

791
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:41,279
Okay. I got it.

792
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,239
Go do your work then.

793
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,960
Normally this warehouse

794
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,719
is all pre-arranged by the crew.

795
00:40:46,759 --> 00:40:48,159
No one will come to pick it anymore.

796
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,320
A new designer?

797
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,480
The last name is Su.

798
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,119
Is it Su Ziyang?

799
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,559
Su Ziyang?

800
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:58,119
How come you work with him?

801
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:00,520
I suspect he was sent by Mr. Liu.

802
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,840
Why wouldn't Mr. Liu

803
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,559
give you a heads-up
before he sent someone?

804
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:05,400
And why would he use our warehouse?

805
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:07,279
If it had really been someone
sent by Mr. Liu,

806
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,159
he must've done it on purpose.

807
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:10,320
So you're saying

808
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,759
Mr. Liu is deliberately targeting us.

809
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,040
Not you.

810
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,119
Me.

811
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,400
You?

812
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:16,800
What do you mean?

813
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:18,840
It's nothing.

814
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,199
Do they think Ying

815
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
can't make rainbow glass,

816
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:22,599
so they pick on you?

817
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,840
Don't get involved.

818
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,000
He is aiming at me.

819
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:25,800
Also,

820
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,520
don't tell Ying about this.

821
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,559
She's under enough pressure already.

822
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,440
Did you hear that?

823
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:38,079
I said don't let Ying know.

824
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:47,320
Thank you.

825
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,880
Now we're not waiting
for the wind to come,

826
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,360
but for the rain to stop.

827
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,559
You have such a breakdown experience,

828
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,199
yet your mental state remains so good.

829
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:17,320
That's rare.

830
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,599
I'm used to it.

831
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:22,400
My psychological resilience
is much improved now.

832
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:25,880
Oh, right.

833
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,000
I have some good news.

834
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,719
The prototype of the rainbow glass
has come out.

835
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:30,599
Really?

836
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:31,880
Congratulations to you.

837
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,639
It's congratulations to us.

838
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,079
Yes. It's us.

839
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,440
You know.

840
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,840
The rainbow glass
is really hard to make.

841
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:40,759
Because it needs to
be precise to the degree.

842
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,920
And then...

843
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,440
That's nice.

844
00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:45,400
What?

845
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,040
I haven't had such a feeling
for a long time.

846
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:54,920
Are you saying...

847
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:01,679
Actually,

848
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:04,759
I can tell you have a unique affection

849
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,159
for the cardiac surgery department.

850
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,079
Dr. Qin.

851
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,000
I think

852
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,119
the biggest regret in life

853
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,119
is stubbornly sticking to
what you shouldn't

854
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,279
and easily giving up what you shouldn't.

855
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:41,239
By the way,

856
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,559
is my biopsy report out yet?

857
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,599
Soon. What's wrong?

858
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:52,880
Are you afraid?

859
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:56,400
What's there to fear?

860
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:57,599
Listen.

861
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,199
I am very bold now.

862
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,000
Then don't be late tomorrow.

863
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:03,920
I won't be late.

864
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,639
What do you mean?

865
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:10,759
I object.

866
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:12,199
(House Design)
I'm afraid it's not up to you.

867
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:13,960
What right do you have to replace her?

868
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,480
Have you seen the actual rainbow glass?

869
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,199
I have spoken with the higher-ups.

870
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:20,480
Given this situation,

871
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,559
they also agreed to replace Su Ying.

872
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:23,960
Have you consulted

873
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,759
