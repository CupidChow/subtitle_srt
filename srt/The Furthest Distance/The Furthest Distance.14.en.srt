You really know how to choose.

35
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,490
I could stay here for a month.

36
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:01,210
There are many other beautiful sights
on this island.

37
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:02,411
Where do you want to go next?

38

00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:37,096
Hello, I need it.

52
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,810
I'll keep it for ten minutes.

53
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:40,072
Okay, I'll be right there.

54
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,888
Let's go.

55

Hello, I am Miss Su.

56
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,336
Is there a vacancy?

Yes.

62
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,690
And there's a bed curtain. Look.

63
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,650

What sound?

68
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,450
It might be the sound of my heartbeat.

69
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,291
Sorry.

70
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,890
Our manager will be here soon.

71
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:59,810
Sorry to have troubled you.

72
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,330
Huixuan, there is a restroom here.

73
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,091
- Ying?
- Ying?

74
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:03,411
Ying?

75
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:04,520
Dr. Qin?

76
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:08,411
Are you two coming back or going out?

77
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:10,010
- Coming back.
- Going out.

78
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,144
What?

79
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,411
- Coming back.
- Going out.

80
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:17,890
Going out or coming back?

81
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,488
Miss Su, I'm sorry.

82
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:22,611
I didn't expect you two
to need the room in such a hurry.

83
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,411
It's fine.

84
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,171
Of course it matters.
It was a serious fault on our part.

85
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:29,490
We gave the room card to you
before it was even cleaned.

86
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,851
It affected your stay.

87
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,130
How about this? I'll give you
a 30% discount on the room rate.

88
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,048
Thank you.

89
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,211
Okay. Our room is now clean.

90
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:39,411
I wish you a pleasant stay.

91
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:46,611
Were our rooms cleaned?

92
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,091
We'll have a dinner
together tonight, right?

93
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,370
We're going there now.

94
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,690
Chen, help me prepare something.

95
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:54,130
Isn't Ying's room card with us?

96
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:56,570
Ye, let's go and buy some drinks.

97
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,370
We're going to buy some drinks. Go.

98
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,411
Isn't the room card with us?

99
00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:08,450
Let me squeeze in.

100
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,051
It looks good.

101
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:10,171
- Send it to me.
- I will send it to you.

102
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:13,890
How was it? Did any of you
have any romantic encounters today?

103
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:16,450
There were quite a few handsome guys.

104
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,211
But no romantic encounters.

105
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,890
You were luckier than I was.

106
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,490
Today I met a creepy old man.

107
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,330
Really?

108
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,091
Luckily, Chen was there
to drive him away.

109
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,890
if it had been a handsome guy,
would you have driven Chen away?

110
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:30,091
It was not impossible.

111
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:36,968
Try it. The mangoes here
are exceptionally tasty.

112
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:39,330
This mango is so big.

113
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,171
Thanks.

114
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:41,032
Right.

115
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,890
I've been craving this for a while.

116
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,370
Let me feed you first.

117
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,704
I'll feed you.

118
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,752
So sweet.

119
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:55,171
- It's especially for Dr. Qin.
- Try it. Is it yummy?

120
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:56,130
It's so delicious.

121
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:58,330
I can't watch them. So sweet.

122
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:00,072
I'm envious of you.

123
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,490
Don't be envious of me.

124
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:03,531
You used to be busy.

125
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,771
Now you've resigned.

126
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:06,771
You can think about

127
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,104
starting dating.

128
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:10,450
I haven't found the right one yet.

129
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,731
From my perspective,

130
00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:14,570
finding a date is harder
than picking a topic.

131
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,171
What's so hard about that?

132
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,330
If you look hard enough,
you're sure to find one.

133
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:21,091
Maybe he's right in front of you.

134
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,330
What are you talking about?

135
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,611
- Huixuan.
- The barbecue is here.

136
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:26,171
It's just cooked. Try one.

137
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:27,810
The barbecue is right in front of us.

138
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:30,971
I think

139
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:32,771
we should all toast Ying

140
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:35,370
for organizing this island trip for us.

141
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:35,771
Right.

142
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,651
- Come on.
- Drinks.

143
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:38,504
Here you are.

144
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:39,816
I'll also make a toast.

145
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:42,051
I have a lot of fun with you guys.

146
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,851
This drink represents

147
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:46,971
the renewal of Huixuan.

148
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:48,971
Let's drink it and forget
our worries, okay?

149
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:49,731
No more worries.

150
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:50,010
Alright.

151
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:51,010
- Drink up.
- No worries.

152
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,171
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

153
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,450
No more worries.

154
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:00,971
Do we need some music?

155
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,531
Yes.

156
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:01,971
Right.

157
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:03,051
Not exciting enough.

158
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:04,424
I'll go play some.

159
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:07,971
- Yunsheng is well-prepared.
- He is multi-talented.

160
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,448
I found this.

161
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,370
You can play guitar?

162
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,168
A little.

163
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:24,364

188
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,704
Are you an actor?

189
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:39,450
I'll give you this keychain.

190
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:40,840
Thank you for today.

191
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,810
I was just doing what was right.
It is a small matter.

192
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,000
No need to thank me.

193
00:09:45,771 --> 00:09:47,810
But it'd have been better
if he had been a handsome guy.

194
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,051
If he is a handsome guy,
you must not come over.

195
00:09:50,411 --> 00:09:51,371
Imagine.

196
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:52,291
A beach,

197
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,224
a handsome guy

198
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,970
and eight-pack abs.

199
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,808
Enough.

200
00:09:57,171 --> 00:09:58,411
If that's the case,

201
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,011
let me do a trick for you.

202
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:01,288
You can do it too?

203
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:02,184
Let me start it.

204
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,112
Come on.

205
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,584
Watch closely.

206
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:06,440
There's nothing, right?

207
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,776
Nothing.

208
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,240
And nothing on the back, right?

209
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,171
Nothing.

210
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:13,970
Get ready, and watch carefully.

211
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,920
Okay.

212
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,600
What?

213
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,592
There's still nothing.

214
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,171
You dare trick me?

215
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:26,970
Chen, you dare trick me.

216
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:47,570
Thanks.

217
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,930
Huixuan, are you happy today?

218
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:50,248
Yes.

219
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:51,880
That's good.

220
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:53,096
What's wrong?

221
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,696
May I ask you

222
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:56,330
if you regret resigning?

223
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,970
I wouldn't say I regret it.

224
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,330
Just a bit of a pity.

225
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:07,090
I've been
with the House Design for six years.

226
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,291
Not being able to continue with it,

227
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,330
and instead saying goodbye in this way.

228
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:15,330
I think you have nothing to regret.

229
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:18,011
You've made House Design
popular these past six years.

230
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,970
But at the same time,

231
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,450
it made you successful.

232
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,011
I remember you once told me that.

233
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:25,970
Persistence itself is meaningless,

234
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,970
but during the process of it,

235
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:31,210
it is meaningful
to improve yourself and create value.

236
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,491
After so many years of practices,

237
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,610
you now understand planning
and can do promotion and editing.

238
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:38,771
Aren't you a one-person team?

239
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,610
Well then, use the encouragement
I gave you back then to encourage me.

240
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,291
But after hearing your words,

241
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:49,930
I do feel a lot more relieved.

242
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:55,251
If you ever feel
life is not going as planned,

243
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:58,210
it's actually you are granted
a long vacation.

244
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:03,048
At this time, you should enjoy
the holiday and get plenty of rest.

245
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,810
When the holiday is over,

246
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:07,251
greet the new beginning.

247
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:12,891
I want to start over,

248
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,610
but I don't know what to do next.

249
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:17,160
I haven't thought it out yet.

250
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,771
Just do what you love to do.

251
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,624
Like,

252
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,371
experiencing a sweet love.

253
00:12:28,651 --> 00:12:30,491
Why does everyone tell me to be in love?

254
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,930
Worrying I can't get married?

255
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,491
How can it be? You are so excellent.

256
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:37,160
Cheers.

257
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:38,450
To my beauty?

258
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,400
Yes.

259
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,810
No matter what decision you make,

260
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,011
I will support you.

261
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,690
I will stand by your side.

262
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,850
Mr. Yang, here's all the information

263
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,651
about Dr. Qin
that you wanted me to find.

264
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,810
(Personal Information)
He had a beloved ex-girlfriend, Mi Su.

265
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:21,970
To fulfill her wish,

266
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:24,051
he asked Miss Su
to design the glass house.

267
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,970
This video was cut
into the show at the time

268
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:36,200
and got a high click rate.

269
00:13:43,371 --> 00:13:45,251
It's been so long
since I watched the stars relaxedly.

270
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,450
It feels like the stars
are so far away from us.

271
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,850
Someone once said

272
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,850
the atoms formed during the Big Bang

273
00:13:52,251 --> 00:13:54,730
were the same as the ones in our bodies,

274
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:56,040
so they are not far away.

275
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,810
Because we are stars ourselves.

276
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,730
We are stars ourselves?

277
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:01,896
Quite romantic.

278
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,011
Yes, it is.

279
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:10,171
I wish we'd be like this forever.

280
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,688
Me too.

281
00:14:16,371 --> 00:14:17,288
Do you know

282
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,411
the thing I've enjoyed the most
since my childhood is watching stars?

283
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:24,970
I want to travel to every corner
of the world to see the stars.

284
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,112
Why?

285
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,570
Because I believe

286
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,491
each star has its own story.

287
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,371
I feel they are talking to me.

288
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,768
Well.

289
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:40,850
Pick one

290
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:42,690
among these many stars

291
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,051
to represent our story.

292
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:51,730
The brightest one.

293
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,608
That one?

294
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:56,131
Name it.

295
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,280
Me?

296
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:02,330
Naming it.

297
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,131
How about Peanut Brittle?

298
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,616
Sweet.

299
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,930
Alright, Peanut Brittle.

300
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,690
I know you're not usually romantic,

301
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:42,930
but you're always surprising me
and being romantic.

302
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,131
I just hope

303
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,690
you are happy

304
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:50,771
every day.

305
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:55,330
Thank you for liking me.

306
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,531
I am very happy right now.

307
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:02,570
Besides watching stars,

308
00:16:03,491 --> 00:16:04,360
what do you want to do?

309
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,171
I want to do this.

310
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:22,696
♪You make the changing seasons♪

311
00:16:22,696 --> 00:16:25,544
♪Meaningful♪

312
00:16:25,544 --> 00:16:30,024
♪You make me long for♪

313
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:32,424
♪Meeting you again♪

314
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,491
(Fight Hard to Win)
(A new update, waiting for your advice.)

315
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,784
(Scrat)
(Sure.)

316
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:22,410
You can't skip breakfast to lose weight.

317
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,691
Bread with an egg

318
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,971
is already a scientific breakfast
for losing weight. Eat it.

319
00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:28,968
I'll eat then.

320
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:30,408
Huixuan,

321
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,691
the sandwich here seems pretty tasty.

322
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:33,576
Take a bite.

323
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:35,771
Really? Is it better than yours?

324
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,090
I guess it's not.

325
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,130
Check your phone.
Ying opened up about their relationship.

326
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,000
What?

327
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,491
This is too sweet.

328
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:50,890
Give it a like!

329
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,848
I've already liked it.

330
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,771
What should we comment?

331
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,531
May you be together forever.

332
00:17:55,731 --> 00:17:57,170
I want sweet love too.

333
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,872
(Su Ying, love is a happy thing.)
May you be together forever.

334
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:02,691
That's so corny.

335
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,130
Director, what are you happy about?

336
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,211
What are you two happy about?

337
00:18:17,211 --> 00:18:18,184
What are you happy about?

338
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,890
- Perfect match.
- Perfect match.

339
00:18:23,404 --> 00:18:26,956
(Su Ying, love is a happy thing.)

340
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:42,988
(Su Ying, love is a happy thing.)

341
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,610
Don't you know breaking up
is not something to joke about?

342
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,531
I am not joking.

343
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,570
Our relationship

344
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,731
is getting more and more tiring somehow.

345
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,531
It's filled with quarrels
and explanations.

346
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,890
Since you started working,

347
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,531
we have almost never had
a good time together.

348
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:19,291
You make progress and I support you.

349
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,931
You say this is
for a better life for me.

350
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:23,144
I am moved.

351
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,810
But I always come after your job.

352
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:30,090
You have never put me first.

353
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,000
Never.

354
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:39,570
At first, I would argue with you,

355
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:43,691
but gradually,

356
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,170
I am used to it.

357
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,291
Used to being ignored by you.

358
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,170
You often say

359
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:08,291
I am your haven.

360
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,816
What about me?

361
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,691
Where is my haven?

362
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,890
Look, we brought back delicious food
for you from the island.

363
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:35,931
Thank you.

364
00:20:35,931 --> 00:20:37,610
Try this one.
This one is particularly good.

365
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,504
My favorite.

366
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:39,531
Thank you.

367
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,330
I have a gift for you too.
You couldn't go with us,

368
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,931
but I brought back
the sound of the sea for you.

369
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,072
Listen to it.

370
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,051
There really is a sound.

371
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:52,370
By the way, there is also the jet ski.

372
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,531
You must play with us next time you go.

373
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,610
It's okay.
She couldn't make it this time,

374
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,890
but she can join us next time.

375
00:20:58,251 --> 00:21:01,251
Because Ying often organizes
such activities for us, right?

376
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,370
Here's my gift for you, Tian Mei.

377
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:04,610
It's a lucky rope.

378
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,890
I hope you are always lucky
and things go smoothly for you.

379
00:21:07,944 --> 00:21:08,810
Thank you.

380
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,531
I want it too.

381
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:10,376
I want it too.

382
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,291
Can I forget the two of you?

383
00:21:12,531 --> 00:21:13,448
Here, Chen.

384
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:14,370
Thank you, Mingshi.

385
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,251
I knew you wouldn't.

386
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,456
I wish you all the best.

387
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,051
I've been receiving gifts
from you since the day I joined.

388
00:21:19,251 --> 00:21:20,136
I'm hesitant to take more.

389
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,090
No problem, because we are family.

390
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:25,896
Right.

391
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:30,090
Yesterday, Ying's package arrived.

392
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,430
(To Su Ying, from ADA Committee)
Sent by the ADA Committee.

393
00:21:34,451 --> 00:21:37,691
ADA? Isn't that the most famous award
in the industry?

394
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:38,731
- Yes.
- Yes.

395
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,531
I know it's very difficult to win.

396
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,491
Is this an invitation for Ying?

397
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:44,890
Is she going to participate in it?

398
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:45,971
It must be.

399
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,856
- That's amazing.
- Amazing.

400
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:47,890
I'll notify her right away.

401
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,971
I'll call her.

402
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:50,408
What are you talking about?

403
00:21:51,051 --> 00:21:52,051
- Ying.
- Ying.

404
00:21:52,731 --> 00:21:54,810
This is an invitation
from the ADA Committee for you.

405
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,584
I already know.

406
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,451
So you will really participate?

407
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,890
They sent me an email
about it last week.

408
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,112
But weren't we working
on a case at that time?

409
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,370
You've succeeded
in both career and love.

410
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:10,731
Right. How could you be so calm
about such a big thing?

411
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:11,491
Yeah.

412
00:22:11,491 --> 00:22:13,640
This is just an invitation,
not an award announcement.

413
00:22:13,771 --> 00:22:16,251
Even if it's just an invitation,
it's still a great recognition.

414
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:18,731
Yes, if I remember correctly,

415
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,130
it's probably the only major award
you haven't won.

416
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:24,840
Don't worry. This time

417
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,451
Ying will certainly win it.

418
00:22:27,451 --> 00:22:29,051
- Of course.
- Yes, she will.

419
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,610
This invitation is not only
a recognition of me as an individual,

420
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,771
but also of our entire firm.

421
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,330
You're right.

422
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,170
So let's hold a meeting

423
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,531
to discuss it right away.

424
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,680
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.

425
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:43,931
By the way,
I have something to tell you.

426
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:45,864
Come in.

427
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,291
What's it?

428
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,251
Mr. Yang of Tiandi Corp once came by.

429
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,752
Yang Zhengwen?

430
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,291
It seemed he would like
to work with you on a case.

431
00:22:58,531 --> 00:23:00,370
The firm has a very full workload now,

432
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,011
so we're not considering it for now.

433
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:04,170
But after all, he is...

434
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,051
I know what you will say.

435
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:08,170
No matter how big or good the case is,

436
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:09,928
I won't take it.

437
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,771
Let's discuss

438
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:13,810
which work to use for the competition.

439
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,304
Express some opinions.

440
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,440
Ying has too many successful works,

441
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,291
so it's hard to choose.

442
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,264
Right.

443
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,211
Ying, I think
the KNK building is very famous.

444
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:24,360
We can consider it.

445
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:29,051
And the courtyard converted
from an ancient building is so popular.

446
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,011
It's full of tourists.

447
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,330
I think the glass house
is quite suitable.

448
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:40,251
Think about it. The ADA competition
focuses on humanistic care.

449
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:42,810
Many previous entries exhibited
small yet beautiful buildings.

450
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,570
The KNK building
and the courtyard are famous now,

451
00:23:47,731 --> 00:23:49,890
but they look so commercialized.

452
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:53,251
The glass house is not a large building,

453
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,211
but the story behind it
is very touching.

454
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,291
I think it is more in line
with the spirit of ADA.

455
00:23:58,731 --> 00:23:59,656
What do you think?

456
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,188
(Garden Road No. 123)

457
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:17,451
You came just when I needed you.

458
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:19,971
Mingshi told me right away.

459
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,850
You have so many works.

460
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,570
Have you decided which one to choose?

461
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:25,928
Not yet.

462
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:31,272
Let me tell you. I think the glass house
is the most suitable.

463
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,011
The glass house.

464
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,771
I think it is very in line
with the theme of this competition.

465
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,731
Are you considering Dr. Qin?

466
00:24:45,211 --> 00:24:46,152
I just feel

467
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:47,944
it's not good.

468
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,531
After all, it was a gift for Mi Su.

469
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:53,410
But it is also your work.

470
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:54,824
Yes,

471
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,032
but...

472
00:24:57,251 --> 00:24:59,650
Does Dr. Qin know
you are going to compete?

473
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:01,570
Not yet, I didn't have time to tell him.

474
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:10,691
Huixuan, are these
the mangoes you ordered?

475
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,264
Right.

476
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:14,531
These big mangoes are great.

477
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,011
Go and share them with everyone.

478
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,251
Okay, I'll go cut them.

479
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:18,120
Okay.

480
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,251
Aren't they the mangoes from the island?

481
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,931
I found a supplier here.

482
00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:23,931
Really?

483
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:24,904
Very convenient.

484
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:26,570
Send me the seller.

485
00:25:26,856 --> 00:25:27,720
Okay.

486
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:29,211
It's very convenient.

487
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:30,850
They provide delivery upon ordering.

488
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,451
Great!

489
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,650
Dr. Qin loves these mangos.

490
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,130
Dr. Qin again.

491
00:25:39,211 --> 00:25:40,451
The mango is ready.

492
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:41,971
- So soon.
- Thank you.

493
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,560
I'll leave you guys.

494
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:45,800
Here you are.

495
00:25:48,691 --> 00:25:49,544
So sweet.

496
00:25:50,251 --> 00:25:51,211
This mango tastes so good.

497
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:58,190
(Fight Hard to Win)
(I've posted an update.)

498
00:25:58,451 --> 00:26:00,850
(Is it professional enough?)

499
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:02,971
(Scrat)
(The editing is good,)

500
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,691
(and it's very professional.)

501
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,130
(Fight Hard to Win)
(Thank you.)

502
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:20,251
(Scrat)
(You work hard as your name suggests.)

503
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,170
(Why did you choose this name?)

504
00:26:30,211 --> 00:26:31,330
(Fight Hard to Win)
(My name has "Hui".)

505
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,810
(My bestie's name has "Ying".)

506
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,211
(I chose them as a pun.)

507
00:26:37,251 --> 00:26:38,248
Hui.

508
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,168
Ying.

509
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:45,650
Fight Hard to Win.
[*Ai Pin Cai Hui Ying]

510
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:50,011
(Fight Hard to Win)
(I'll recommend super sweet mangoes.)

511
00:27:00,731 --> 00:27:02,370
Who are you chatting with?
You look so happy.

512
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:04,360
Let me tell you.

513
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,051
I recently met
a very interesting person.

514
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:07,691
Who?

515
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:09,570
I have created a video account online.

516
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:11,291
I regularly update it with videos

517
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,691
on home decor.

518
00:27:13,251 --> 00:27:16,211
This person often leaves
comments for me. Look.

519
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,370
Scrat.

520
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,691
And he is very interesting.

521
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:26,971
He always disagrees with me,

522
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:29,130
but he also often provides
constructive ideas.

523
00:27:30,051 --> 00:27:30,952
Most importantly,

524
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,731
his name is Scrat.

525
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:36,211
Do you know? It's a little animal

526
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,304
I like from a cartoon.
What a coincidence!

527
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,570
You were just chatting with him?

528
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,451
Du Huixuan,

529
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,890
you seem to be heading
towards an Internet romance.

530
00:27:50,731 --> 00:27:53,971
How is that possible? I don't even know
if the one is a man or woman.

531
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:56,130
I just find our conversations enjoyable.

532
00:27:56,531 --> 00:27:58,890
You've chatted for so long.
Of course, it's a man.

533
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,448
Which woman would chat
with you for so long besides me?

534
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,528
You're right.

535
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,672
Then,

536
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,368
what do you think?

537
00:28:08,691 --> 00:28:09,570
I...

538
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,330
What are you hesitating about?

539
00:28:12,211 --> 00:28:14,850
You rarely meet someone
who is so in tune with you.

540
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,531
Seize the opportunity, and go for it.

541
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,491
Let me tell you,
love is a game for the brave.

542
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,531
You have to be bold and step forward.

543
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:28,491
For a girl with little experience
in relationships like you,

544
00:28:28,691 --> 00:28:32,570
you have to be a bit bolder and braver.

545
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:36,011
You have to have that kind
of passion of young people, right?

546
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:38,760
Just give it a try. Wait.

547
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:41,410
Then I will...

548
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:42,410
In that case...

549
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:46,824
What's wrong?

550
00:28:47,531 --> 00:28:49,771
I mean, in that case,

551
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,291
you will miss out on many better men.

552
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:56,170
Yes, missing out on many better men.

553
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:58,051
So you can't try carelessly.

554
00:29:00,731 --> 00:29:02,810
Why are you acting weird today?

555
00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:05,650
It's not me acting weird.

556
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,531
I just forgot it.

557
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:09,731
Some time ago,

558
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:11,170
I saw a lot of news

559
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,170
about Internet fraud.

560
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,890
Let me tell you, it's really scary.

561
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,451
They target not only your money
but also you. It's terrifying.

562
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,531
Let me tell you.

563
00:29:19,731 --> 00:29:22,410
It might be a wolf in sheep's clothing.

564
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,130
Is it that terrible?

565
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:28,650
It may be even worse.

566
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,130
It's very likely

567
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,211
that it is someone around you.

568
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:34,691
Let me tell you.

569
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,680
You are in the light,
while he's in the dark.

570
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,251
It's very easy for him to deceive you.

571
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:40,810
So it's really unreliable.

572
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,610
You must be careful.

573
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,330
It reminds me of someone.

574
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,650
Is it probably Mr. Liu?

575
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,360
It's very likely.
It might just be him, right?

576
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,170
You must guard
against such villains, okay?

577
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,931
That's right.

578
00:29:57,931 --> 00:29:58,920
Right?

579
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:01,000
Believe me. I won't lie to you, right?

580
00:30:01,771 --> 00:30:05,890
So the guys you meet in real life
are more reliable. Do you know?

581
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:07,410
Don't chat with him anymore.

582
00:30:07,731 --> 00:30:08,810
I must be careful in the future.

583
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,496
What are you doing?

584
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,531
I've sat for too long,

585
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,890
so I need to do some stretches.

586
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,451

587
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,016
I'll leave you guys.

588

589
00:30:35,731 --> 00:30:37,531
Why do you all seem so weird?

590
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:38,824
Really?

591
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,531
It might be the mango.

592
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,531
Eat it. You just ate a little.

593
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:45,011
Look, you left so much. Eat.

(Meichi International Hospital)

595
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,491
Why are there mangoes

596
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:57,650
in the hospital?

597
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,451
(Premium Mangoes)
Premium mangoes.

598
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:00,810
We can't underestimate them.

599
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,251
Why is everyone afraid of the mangoes?

600
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:04,731
You don't understand.

601
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:05,850
All doctors know this.

602
00:31:06,051 --> 00:31:07,051
"Mango" indicates being busy.

603
00:31:07,251 --> 00:31:09,291
Wherever a mango appears,
it gets incredibly busy.

604
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,931
Isn't this just a pun?

605
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,931
You can see it that way.

606
00:31:11,931 --> 00:31:13,051
Yisen, I beg you.

607
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:14,650
Handle them now.

608
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,491
No, I can't.

609
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:18,531
These were sent by Su Ying to Yunsheng.

610
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:20,130
We can't just get rid of them.

611
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,064
It's not busy now.
[*A pun.]

612
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,810
Is that okay?

613
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,691
Can it work?

614
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:29,370
Why did them get sent here?

615
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,296
Sorry, wrong delivery spot.

616
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:36,691
Take it with you. Do your work.

617
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:42,920
It's a call from the ED. I gotta go.

618
00:31:43,731 --> 00:31:44,712
Hey.

619
00:31:45,211 --> 00:31:46,130
A new patient.

620
00:32:02,764 --> 00:32:04,492
(Su Ying)

621
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:12,392
Hello.

622
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,280
Have you got off work?

623
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,200
Soon.

624
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:17,291
Did you get the mangoes?

625
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:20,168
Yes.

626
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:21,731
Everyone enjoyed them very much.

627
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:23,432
That's good.

628
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:46,971
Sorry, Dr. Qin.

629
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:47,944
It's okay.

630
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,251
Look at this happy man.

631
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,130
There's only one expression left
after returning from island.

632
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:00,570
It's a silly smile.

633
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,491
Really?

634
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:03,720
Look at yourself now.

635
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,570
You had a really good time

636
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:09,224
on the island this time.

637
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:11,491
I'd be happier without your surprise.

638
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,771
So something really happened.

639
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,291
Share it with me now.

640
00:33:16,691 --> 00:33:17,570
If I do it,

641
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,090
won't you post it on your Moments?

642
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,130
Can I? Am I that kind of person?

643
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,011
I'll take that as a yes.

644
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:26,664
Here's a call.

645
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:28,200
Who is it?

646
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,370
Hello.

647
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,170
Hello, Dr. Qin.

648
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,531
How is everything going?

649
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:36,968
It's going smoothly.
I've already started my shift.

650
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,536
So dedicated.

651
00:33:39,011 --> 00:33:39,931
Aren't you the same?

652
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:41,370
Let's have hotpot tonight.

653
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:43,211
Okay, I'll reserve a table.

654
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,011
No need. Come eat at my place.

655
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,024
Okay, see you tonight then.

656
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:55,971
See you tonight then.

657
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,291
Eat yours.

658
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,600
You've arrived.

659
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,592
So many ingredients.

660
00:34:12,411 --> 00:34:13,320
I'm preparing food.

661
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:14,600
Let me help you.

662
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,730
Okay, go wash your hands.

663
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,491
I'll get an apron for you.

664
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,600
Okay.

665
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,451
Dr. Qin.

666
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,576
It's a habit.

667
00:34:38,971 --> 00:34:39,880
Thanks.

668
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:43,770
Let's start the surgery.

669
00:34:44,971 --> 00:34:45,896
Okay.

670
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:12,491
The fish is cooked.

671
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,971
Let's take a look.

672
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,600
- So awesome.
- Is it good?

673
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,570
Do you know how to debone the fish?

674
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,811
I'm going to show it to you.

675
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,040
Look. First of all,

676
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:34,811
remove the head

677
00:35:35,411 --> 00:35:36,411
and the tail.

678
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,088
Then,

679
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,250
let it relax.

680
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:40,610
Relax?

681
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,240
Yes, let the fish relax.

682
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:46,411
Even fish needs massages?

683
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:47,336
Of course.

684
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:56,730
Okay, take its bones out.

685
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:02,130
How is it? Cool, right?

686
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:04,808
Have a look.

687
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:06,971
Okay.

688
00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:08,371
How did you do that?

689
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:10,570
I have many strengths.

690
00:36:21,891 --> 00:36:22,760
It's unraveling.

691
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,531
I'll help you with that.

692
00:36:37,411 --> 00:36:38,280
Dr. Qin,

693
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:41,051
I have some good news to share with you.

694
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:42,184
Okay.

695
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,770
I got an invitation
from the ADA Competition.

696
00:36:47,011 --> 00:36:48,331
You look this happy.

697
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:50,170
Is it a prestigious award?

698
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,136
It's very prestigious.

699
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,851
Which of your works was chosen?

700
00:36:54,051 --> 00:36:55,011
None yet.

701
00:36:55,451 --> 00:36:57,011
They have only invited me so far,

702
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,451
but as for which work
to use as an entry,

703
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:01,250
I have to select one myself
and then report it.

704
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,200
Have you decided yet?

705
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:07,371
Not yet. I had a meeting
to discuss it with them today.

706
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,690
What did they say?

707
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:14,760
Look, there's the KNK building
that you know.

708
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,011
But it may be too commercialized.

709
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,290
It doesn't quite fit the theme

710
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:22,451
which is humanistic care, so...

711
00:37:22,971 --> 00:37:25,210
And the Cloud Corridor.

712
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,770
But it emphasizes returning to nature.

713
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:29,130
It's not suitable, either.

714
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:31,752
And then, the Starlight Music Hall.

715
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,851
But it's highly-designed.

716
00:37:35,051 --> 00:37:37,210
I feel it lacks something.

717
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,491
And...

718
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:39,331
Is the glass house okay?

719
00:37:41,352 --> 00:37:42,250
Yes.

720
00:37:42,491 --> 00:37:43,570
How about choosing it?

721
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,160
It's done. Have a look.

722
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,088
Let me look.

723
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,610
How come you are so good at sewing?

724
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,090
Because it is a basic skill of doctors.

725
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,770
You know how to do everything.

727
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:08,851

(I told Ying about your last visit.)

738
00:39:57,851 --> 00:40:00,130
(She mentioned our firm
had too many cases at the moment,)

739
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,371
(so we will not consider collaborations)

740
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,770
(regarding cases for now.)

741
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,170
(If there's anything that you need me
to communicate with Ying)

742
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,730
(or if you need my help,)

743
00:40:09,891 --> 00:40:10,792

00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,610
I got it wrong last time.
The mangoes were for me.

752
00:41:15,811 --> 00:41:17,491
These are the gifts
Su Ying wanted to give you.

753
00:41:18,411 --> 00:41:19,610
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

754
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,648
Thank you, Dr. Qin.

755
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,210
Dr. Qin, are they candies for good news?

756
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,770
Then you have to give a gift.

757
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:27,811
If you get married now, I'll give you
a big red envelope right away.
