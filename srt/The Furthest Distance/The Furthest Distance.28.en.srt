17
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,536
Mi Bai.

18
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:52,204
Do you remember

19
00:01:53,365 --> 00:01:54,365
the day you confessed

20
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:57,204
to Yunsheng for me under the rainbow?

21
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:04,764
You were confessing for yourself too.

22
00:02:05,764 --> 00:02:06,632
Right?

23
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:15,805
Sorry, I just found out

24
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:19,365
(that you also like Yunsheng.)

25
00:02:22,765 --> 00:02:24,164
(I shouldn't have done this to you.)

26
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:28,925
(I've been
holding onto his love selfishly.)

27
00:02:32,124 --> 00:02:33,064
Yunsheng.

28
00:02:35,048 --> 00:02:36,884
Stay there. I have something to say.

29
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:42,525
There are things I've always

30
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:45,284
meant to tell you.

31
00:02:48,164 --> 00:02:49,124
I like you.

32
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:51,284
I've been into you for a long time.

33
00:02:57,925 --> 00:02:58,765
Actually,

34
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:02,805
I like you too.

35
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,640
Mi Su.

36
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,085
(Su Ying is willing to know)

37
00:03:25,045 --> 00:03:27,045
- about public welfare hospital.
- Really?

38
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:29,604
You prepare the materials.

39
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:31,564
I will bring them to her tonight.

40
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:34,004
There is a lot of materials.

41
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,444
Once I finish them,

42
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,365
I will give them to her.

43
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:39,912
(Yunsheng,)

44
00:03:40,724 --> 00:03:42,965
(you have been having a fallout
with Ying recently, right?)

45
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,564
Could it be

46
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:47,245
because she has seen this video?

47
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:56,765
Yunsheng, have you decided to go abroad?

48
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,844
What's with this video?

49
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:05,485
Did you give it to Su Ying?

50
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:11,604
What else did she say to you?

51
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:14,884
Why did you do this?

52
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:18,568
Yunsheng,

53
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:23,525
can't you feel my feelings
for you at all?

54
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,924
At first, the person
who confessed to you was me,

55
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,085
and the person who first fell
for you was also me.

56
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:34,284
I can give you to my sister,

57
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:36,965
but I'm not willing
to give you to Su Ying.

58
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:39,044
Besides, she doesn't cherish you at all.

59
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:40,724
I've been watching

60
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:42,445
you suffer so much for her.

61
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:44,244
She does not deserve your love at all.

62
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:45,965
Although you confessed to me for Mi Su,

63
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:48,844
at that time the person I liked
and said yes to

64
00:04:49,804 --> 00:04:50,724
was only Mi Su.

65
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:56,284
You two are completely different people.

66
00:04:57,885 --> 00:04:58,824
Mi Bai,

67
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:03,325
you are just a friend

68
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:05,000
and a younger sister.

69
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:08,104
No, that's not true.

70
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:10,724
It's because Su Ying has been around
ever since I came back.

71
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:12,724
But you two have broken up.

72
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:14,284
She doesn't cherish you.

73
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:17,205
You are just a passer-by in her life.

74
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:20,445
Yunsheng, I can always be by your side.

75
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:22,525
I can always be with you,

76
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:24,244
and love you on behalf of my sister.

77
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:25,192
Mi Bai.

78
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:28,284
The breakup is just temporary.

79
00:05:29,484 --> 00:05:30,685
I clearly know my heart.

80
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:32,685
Whether it's now or later,

81
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:35,604
the one I love will only be Su Ying.

82
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:37,685
I hope you understand this.

83
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,445
And don't do such things again.

84
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:53,885
I know.

85
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:55,445
I'm packing things up.

86
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:57,885
Didn't you take everything else
with you?

87
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:15,656
Hello?

88
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:16,776
Where are you?

89
00:06:18,364 --> 00:06:19,272
What's the matter?

90
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:20,724
I'm asking where you are.

91
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:22,376
I'm at home.

92
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:35,325
I just went to Mrs. Zhou's room.

93
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,552
Isn't Su Ying around?

94
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:37,832
She left a while ago.

95
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:39,125
She's home to pack her things.

96
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:40,392
Alright, thank you.

97
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:48,404
Don't you even dare see me?

98
00:06:49,924 --> 00:06:51,044
Can't we talk on the phone?

99
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:52,484
Stop pretending.

100
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:54,885
Don't you know what you have done

101
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:56,804
and said in front of Yunsheng?

102
00:06:56,965 --> 00:06:57,928
What does that mean?

103
00:06:58,205 --> 00:06:59,284
You showed him the video, right?

104
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:00,885
You turned him against me.

105
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:02,120
Are you happy now?

106
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:04,885
So he knows about the video.

107
00:07:05,604 --> 00:07:06,685
And you're angry.

108
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:09,325
I'm simply trying
to win back the person I like.

109
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:11,205
I don't think I did anything wrong.

110
00:07:12,685 --> 00:07:15,924
Su Ying, don't think you have won
just because your pitching succeeded.

111
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:17,924
I won't let you off easily.

112
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:22,724
Also, I have already
confessed my feelings to Yunsheng.

113
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:24,645
I believe he will come back to me.

114
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,244
So, did he come back to you?

115
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:29,284
Self-delusion is a disease.

116
00:07:29,765 --> 00:07:30,844
At least, I truly love him,

117
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:32,136
unlike you.

118
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:34,125
Do you know that Yunsheng

119
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,804
turned the opportunity abroad
down because of you?

120
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,404
You'd rather ruin his future

121
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,164
than let him study abroad.

122
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:41,404
You want to keep him by your side.

123
00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:42,325
Aren't you selfish?

124
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,164
You wouldn't believe Yunsheng
loves you that much, would you?

125
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:48,565
If he loved you, why would he leave you?

126
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:50,440
Listen, Su Ying,

127
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:52,404
Yunsheng and I
had a great time together.

128
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:53,512
It was very pleasant.

129
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:54,404
I think Yunsheng

130
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:56,364
was much happier with me
than when he was with you.

131
00:07:56,885 --> 00:07:57,804
Go away.

132
00:07:57,804 --> 00:07:58,760
What?

133
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:00,525
Are you feeling guilty or scared?

134
00:08:03,364 --> 00:08:04,264
Mi Bai.

135
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:21,044
Su Ying.

136
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:21,565
Yunsheng!

137
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:22,472
Su Ying.

138
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:25,896
Don't go.

139
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:34,085
You have been making it hard for Su Ying
during the pitching.

140
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,944
You had a sprain on purpose.

141
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:38,925
Why did you do that?

142
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:41,480
Yunsheng,

143
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,364
I did all those things
just to be with you.

144
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:45,724
You hurt Su Ying for me?

145
00:08:46,644 --> 00:08:47,965
Do you know how much she sacrificed

146
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:48,965
to fulfill Mi Su's wish?

147
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:51,165
She has always treated
you like a sister.

148
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:53,224
After you came back,

149
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:54,965
she kept telling me
to take good care of you.

150
00:08:55,524 --> 00:08:58,056
She cared about you.
And what did you do?

151
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:01,484
Mi Bai, listen to me carefully.

152
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:03,685
Stop hurting Su Ying.

153
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:06,764
Otherwise, I will never forgive you.

154
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:32,004
Hello, Mingshi,
can you help me find Su Ying?

155
00:09:49,124 --> 00:09:50,205
This place looks good,

156
00:09:50,565 --> 00:09:51,464
and there are few people.

157
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:00,965
Don't be angry.

158
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:03,445
Mingshi did that for you.

159
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:05,685
Who knew Mi Bai would come
to cause trouble?

160
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:08,205
I'm not blaming you.

161
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:10,965
I knew you were trying to defend me.

162
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:13,724
What's wrong with Mi Bai?

163
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:16,685
How dare she come to cause trouble?

164
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:18,244
It's so ridiculous.

165
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:21,325
But that's not the point.

166
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:24,604
Qin Yunsheng heard
what Mi Bai said to me,

167
00:10:24,764 --> 00:10:25,704
but he just let me go.

168
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:28,200
He hasn't sent me
a single message yet. Look.

169
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:30,568
It upsets me.

170
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:33,165
Never mind.
The point of going out is to have fun.

171
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:35,205
Forget all those unhappy things.

172
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:38,644
I'm coming.

173
00:10:38,644 --> 00:10:39,528
Over here.

174
00:10:40,925 --> 00:10:42,085
Dr. Qin, what a coincidence!

175
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:49,096
Right.

176
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:51,045
What's up? Why is he here?

177
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:52,085
I-I don't know.

178
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,364
Maybe he found this place on his own.

179
00:10:53,576 --> 00:10:54,445
Right, Dr. Qin?

180
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,445
Yes, it's a coincidence.

181
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:56,744
I came by chance.

182
00:10:57,205 --> 00:11:00,165
Mingshi, let's tidy up the things
and take a look around.

183
00:11:00,165 --> 00:11:01,205
Okay.

184
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:02,484
Wait, I'll come with you.

185
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:03,944
Bye.

186
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:11,496
What a coincidence, right?

187
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:16,584
Let me carry them for you.

188
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:17,576
No need.

189
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:19,400
Just give them to me.

190
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:23,304
Let's go.

191
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:38,152
- Over here.
- This way.

192
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:49,205
Alright, I'll assign the work.

193
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:51,445
Mingshi and I

194
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:53,965
will prepare the camping gear here.

195
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:56,325
Dr. Qin and Su

196
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,205
need to go to the base camp

197
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:01,165
and bring over the equipment
we need for the BBQ tonight.

198
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:02,764
I agree.

199
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:03,720
Alright.

200
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:05,364
Dr. Qin, go ahead.

201
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:06,724
Hurry up. Go.

202
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:16,644
I hope they can talk
for a little longer.

203
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:19,884
This way,
I can enjoy some time alone with you.

204
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:22,056
Let's tidy up quickly.

205
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:29,480
Su Ying,

206
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:31,304
I want to talk with you.

207
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:35,048
Go ahead.

208
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:41,805
If I hadn't seen the video

209
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:43,565
or heard Mi Bai's words,

210
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:46,524
I wouldn't know
that you've gone through so much.

211
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:50,216
It's alright.

212
00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:53,165
I didn't know

213
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:55,565
Mi Bai did so many outrageous things.

214
00:12:57,045 --> 00:12:58,004
She did those.

215
00:12:58,724 --> 00:12:59,764
It has nothing to do with you.

216
00:13:01,484 --> 00:13:02,925
I have made it clear with Mi Bai.

217
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:05,364
She'll never do anything
to hurt you again.

218
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:12,844
And most importantly, look.

219
00:13:16,484 --> 00:13:17,565
Although they are both apples,

220
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,524
their patterns are different.

221
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:22,280
Moreover,

222
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:25,384
this one is crisper,

223
00:13:28,565 --> 00:13:29,544
and this one is more pulpy.

224
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:30,844
I can tell them apart.

225
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:36,805
I don't like apples.

226
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:39,724
I don't like them either.

227
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:47,685
So, what do you like now?

228
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:50,408
I like durian.

229
00:13:51,884 --> 00:13:52,808
Durian?

230
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:55,925
Then I like durian too.

231
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:02,536
You're not mad anymore?

232
00:14:04,484 --> 00:14:06,685
Why would I be mad?
I'm not that kind of person.

233
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:12,648
What's wrong?

234
00:14:14,165 --> 00:14:15,484
Nothing. It's just a small cut.

235
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:18,792
We still need to disinfect it.

236
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:20,165
It's nothing.

237
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:21,704
It's really nothing.

238
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:25,925
Sit down.

239
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:27,784
What's wrong?

240
00:14:30,764 --> 00:14:31,644
You're bleeding.

241
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:32,805
What happened?

242
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:35,604
I just accidentally had a small cut.

243
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:37,685
It needs to be handled quickly,
or there will be a scar.

244
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:38,632
Right.

245
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:50,445
The wound isn't big, but it's deep.

246
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:52,364
Don't let it get wet later.

247
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:54,165
You and Huixuan wait here.

248
00:14:54,484 --> 00:14:55,364
Mingshi and I will work.

249
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:58,024
Let's go, Mingshi.

250
00:14:58,445 --> 00:14:59,325
Okay.

251
00:14:59,325 --> 00:15:00,424
Then I'm leaving first.

252
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:19,496
What's going on
between you and Dr. Qin?

253
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:22,504
Nothing's going on.

254
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:26,124
I have to say a few words for Dr. Qin.

255
00:15:27,244 --> 00:15:28,764
When Mrs. Zhou was sick,

256
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:30,644
Dr. Qin was really worried

257
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:31,592
and helped you a lot.

258
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:33,928
I know.

259
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:35,272
I appreciate that.

260
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:37,000
So cold?

261
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:40,484
I know

262
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:41,644
the thing about Mi Bai

263
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:43,565
must have been bothering you.

264
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:45,965
So you should take this opportunity

265
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:47,484
and talk it through.

266
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:50,764
I have let go of the matter with Mi Bai.

267
00:15:53,004 --> 00:15:55,524
I'm thinking about the problem
between me and Qin Yunsheng.

268
00:15:57,764 --> 00:15:59,165
I'm not saying he has any problems.

269
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:00,884
He has done nothing wrong.

270
00:16:01,685 --> 00:16:02,824
It's just

271
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:06,484
that I'm pondering the nature of love.

272
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:08,285
What's wrong with love?

273
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:12,325
Didn't I tell you
that he's going to be sent abroad?

274
00:16:13,884 --> 00:16:14,792
Has he decided?

275
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:20,844
They told me
he has been stalling and not signing.

276
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,124
The opportunity is very rare.

277
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:28,045
He is probably stalling because of me.

278
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:29,640
What are you going to do?

279
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:35,205
It's between you two.

280
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:37,644
You should figure it out yourselves.

281
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:42,376
I'll get some drinks.

282
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:50,244
We can use these knives and forks.

283
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:54,884
And then

284
00:16:55,844 --> 00:16:56,764
we should get a chair.

285
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:03,244
Yunsheng, I heard that your hospital
is going to send doctors abroad.

286
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:04,764
You're very well-informed.

287
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:08,264
What do you think?
Are you going abroad?

288
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:10,564
This is indeed a great opportunity.

289
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:13,405
I can learn about

290
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,205
different medical techniques abroad.

291
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:18,645
Also, it's helpful
for future promotions.

292
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:20,524
Many doctors in the hospital want to go.

293
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:24,360
As for me, I am very eager to go too.

294
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,524
Are you really going abroad?

295
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:27,685
What about Su Ying?

296
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:33,405
A long-distance relationship.

297
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:53,484
(This is indeed a great opportunity.)

298
00:17:53,804 --> 00:17:55,524
(I can learn about)

299
00:17:55,804 --> 00:17:57,724
(different medical techniques abroad.)

300
00:17:58,365 --> 00:18:00,205
(Also, it's helpful
for future promotions.)

301
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:02,324
(Many doctors
in the hospital want to go.)

302
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:04,004
(I am very eager to go too.)

303
00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:06,885
(Are you really going abroad?)

304
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:07,816
(What about Ying?)

305
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:11,405
(Do you know that Yunsheng)

306
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:13,244
(turned the opportunity abroad
down because of you?)

307
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:15,645
You'd rather ruin his future

308
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:17,324
than let him study abroad.

309
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:18,645
You want to keep him by your side.

310
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:19,724
Aren't you selfish?

311
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:41,445
Mr. Yang, Miss Tian is looking for you.

312
00:18:47,244 --> 00:18:48,104
Please come in.

313
00:18:53,645 --> 00:18:54,664
Mr. Yang.

314
00:18:55,244 --> 00:18:57,288
Miss Tian, long time no see.

315
00:18:57,685 --> 00:18:59,605
Mr. Yang, I brought you a gift.

316
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:03,925
Thank you.
Sit down and tell me what you need.

317
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:06,952
It's nothing.

318
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,764
I was just passing by

319
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:11,324
and thought I'd pay you a visit.

320
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:13,320
What are you busy with?

321
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:16,360
Nothing particular.

322
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,845
Mr. Yang, you said before
that you would refer me to projects.

323
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:24,965
I've been waiting for your message.

324
00:19:25,484 --> 00:19:28,044
I said,
"If there's the right opportunity".

325
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:31,165
Mr. Yang, the truth is

326
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:33,165
we have worked together before.

327
00:19:33,685 --> 00:19:35,496
As a designer, I'm quite competent.

328
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:36,405
I'm really eager to...

329
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:37,480
Miss Tian.

330
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:39,112
I said,

331
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:42,084
"If there's the right opportunity".

332
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:58,564
Mr. Yang, now everyone knows
that as an employee of SU,

333
00:19:58,685 --> 00:20:00,205
I overtly competed
with my boss for projects.

334
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,804
No firm wants to take me in.

335
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:04,965
And I did everything
to cooperate with your plan.

336
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,764
Are you blaming everything on me?

337
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:09,764
That's not what I mean.

338
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:13,128
I just hope you can
understand my situation and help me.

339
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:15,804
It will be better for us.

340
00:20:20,004 --> 00:20:20,872
Interesting.

341
00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:23,324
I'd like to know

342
00:20:24,205 --> 00:20:26,445
what you can do
to make it difficult for me.

343
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:37,352
I see.

344
00:20:37,685 --> 00:20:41,044
You never intended to help me
from the start.

345
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:44,244
You were just using me all along, right?

346
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:47,484
Miss Tian, we are all adults,

347
00:20:48,524 --> 00:20:50,484
and we make all the choices
by ourselves.

348
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:54,044
Adults need to take responsibility
for their choices.

349
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:57,645
You mean you are innocent?

350
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,564
It has nothing to do with me
in the first place.

351
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:03,845
And I want to remind you

352
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:07,284
to be aware of who you're speaking to.

353
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:13,128
Kevin.

354
00:21:13,992 --> 00:21:14,885
Mr. Yang.

355
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:15,848
See off the guest for me.

356
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:17,096
Okay.

357
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:54,280
Grilled...

358
00:21:56,724 --> 00:21:57,704
You can sit here.

359
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:06,405
Have a taste.

360
00:22:07,365 --> 00:22:08,524
It is really awesome.

361
00:22:08,904 --> 00:22:09,804
Have a taste. How is it?

362
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:11,048
Thank you.

363
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,445
He just wants me to check the seasoning
for you guys first.

364
00:22:22,484 --> 00:22:23,645
Right. Here.

365
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:25,128
You should try it too.

366
00:22:26,084 --> 00:22:27,445
Here, Yunsheng, Ying.

367
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:30,312
How is it?

368
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:34,004
Salty?

369
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:34,365
Salty.

370
00:22:35,405 --> 00:22:36,885
I might have
added too much salt earlier.

371
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,536
Shall we grill some more?

372
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,084
How is it?

373
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:41,992
Huixuan,

374
00:22:42,284 --> 00:22:43,324
I heard from Mrs. Zhou

375
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:46,324
that her friend's son
is looking for a date recently.

376
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:47,752
Let me introduce you.

377
00:22:48,764 --> 00:22:49,640
No need.

378
00:22:49,804 --> 00:22:52,044
He's a good fit
who meets your requirements.

379
00:22:52,365 --> 00:22:54,845
And I've met him before.
He's quite reliable.

380
00:22:59,084 --> 00:23:00,445
I really don't need it, Su.

381
00:23:00,685 --> 00:23:02,445
How about I arrange a date
for you this week?

382
00:23:02,804 --> 00:23:04,365
Huixuan is busy this week.

383
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,564
Really? Next week is also fine.

384
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:08,808
I have his photo on my phone.
Let me show you.

385
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,004
It's a deceptive photo.

386
00:23:10,004 --> 00:23:12,004
He looks pretty decent.

387
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:13,764
He's a good guy.

388
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:15,044
You should see this photo.

389
00:23:15,165 --> 00:23:16,284
Look, he's quite decent.

390
00:23:16,764 --> 00:23:18,845
Just take a look.
He's really a good catch.

391
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:20,232
Alright.

392
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,920
I admit it. I'm dating someone.

393
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:27,880
I'm dating

394
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:31,624
Mingshi.

395
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:33,832
That's right, Ying.

396
00:23:38,165 --> 00:23:39,176
You're willing to tell me.

397
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:41,284
Wait. When did you find it?

398
00:23:41,564 --> 00:23:43,445
Do I even need to find it?

399
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:45,365
You were only
deceiving yourselves, okay?

400
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:47,205
Otherwise, why would you invite him

401
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:48,328
when you camp with me?

402
00:23:49,605 --> 00:23:51,645
Clearly, it's a camping trip
for the two of us.

403
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:53,445
You joined us, okay?

404
00:23:55,445 --> 00:23:57,365
Alright, I'm the third wheel.

405
00:23:57,885 --> 00:23:58,856
I'm the third wheel.

406
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:01,205
Alright, now that you've seen it,

407
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:03,044
Mingshi and I will have some time alone.

408
00:24:03,524 --> 00:24:04,424
Let's go.

409
00:24:04,564 --> 00:24:04,885
Wait.

410
00:24:05,165 --> 00:24:06,044
Where are you two going?

411
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:06,984
By the way,

412
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,484
there's another tent over there.

413
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,560
You two can figure it out, Dr. Qin.

414
00:24:13,804 --> 00:24:16,244
Isn't that inappropriate?
Didn't we agree to share a tent?

415
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:17,640
What's inappropriate?

416
00:24:17,885 --> 00:24:20,645
Is it appropriate
to separate me and Mingshi?

417
00:24:21,004 --> 00:24:23,284
Yeah, Ying,
it's not appropriate to break us apart.

418
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:24,445
I...

419
00:24:24,445 --> 00:24:26,685
Then we'll go first. Enjoy your meal.

420
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:29,724
If you need anything,
go to the butler instead of us. Bye.

421
00:24:29,724 --> 00:24:31,336
- The butler is on duty all day.
- Good night.

422
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,084
I have been a bit confused.

423
00:24:53,564 --> 00:24:55,004
Why did you admit it?

424
00:24:57,324 --> 00:24:59,165
Since Su figured it out,

425
00:24:59,324 --> 00:25:01,244
I thought I should just admit it.

426
00:25:02,284 --> 00:25:03,885
I was worried about when to tell her.

427
00:25:04,165 --> 00:25:05,524
Then the chance presented itself.

428
00:25:05,845 --> 00:25:07,004
Didn't you say that you would wait

429
00:25:07,484 --> 00:25:09,205
for her to be better before telling her?

430
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:11,845
Wouldn't it be a bit rash
to tell her at such a time?

431
00:25:12,365 --> 00:25:14,084
It's because you made it so obvious

432
00:25:14,244 --> 00:25:15,125
and let her figure it out.

433
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,125
I couldn't lie, right?

434
00:25:16,804 --> 00:25:17,704
But we did the right thing.

435
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:20,004
We could help her and Dr. Qin like this.

436
00:25:20,524 --> 00:25:22,645
Let's hope
Dr. Qin can grasp this opportunity.

437
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:26,885
Let's go out and take a look.

438
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,004
Let's go.

439
00:25:29,004 --> 00:25:29,928
Okay.

440
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:43,724
What's going on?
Why is Dr. Qin alone there?

441
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,160
Where is Ying?

442
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,584
Su Ying,

443
00:26:04,685 --> 00:26:06,524
the list for doctors
studying abroad is out.

444
00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:07,685
Yunsheng is on it.

445
00:26:08,084 --> 00:26:11,044
The hospital
requests a written response.

446
00:26:11,645 --> 00:26:12,925
I couldn't get in touch with Yunsheng.

447
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:15,804
A bunch of people
are waiting for his reply.

448
00:26:27,804 --> 00:26:29,205
(This chance must be important to him.)

449
00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:32,524
(So I can't tell him
that I don't want him to leave.)

450
00:26:50,205 --> 00:26:51,804
Su Ying, are you asleep?

451
00:26:54,165 --> 00:26:55,112
Not yet.

452
00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:56,845
Can I talk to you?

453
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:08,552
Come in.

454
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:24,168
Say it.

455
00:27:24,484 --> 00:27:27,048
Why were you avoiding me
during the barbecue just now?

456
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:30,696
I wasn't.

457
00:27:36,044 --> 00:27:37,405
There were a lot of things in the past

458
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:39,405
that I didn't do well.

459
00:27:41,365 --> 00:27:42,965
But I don't want these things

460
00:27:44,044 --> 00:27:45,244
to affect our future.

461
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:46,764
So...

462
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,004
So you're going abroad, right?

463
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:56,584
I came here to talk to you about this.

464
00:27:57,205 --> 00:27:58,088
Here is my thought...

465
00:27:58,088 --> 00:27:58,984
Qin Yunsheng,

466
00:28:01,885 --> 00:28:03,205
thank you for what you did.

467
00:28:04,605 --> 00:28:06,696
I'm really grateful.

468
00:28:11,004 --> 00:28:12,244
But I am just confused.

469
00:28:13,004 --> 00:28:15,044
We both truly mean well for each other.

470
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:18,524
But why is it that we end up like this?

471
00:28:20,885 --> 00:28:22,284
I've pondered over it for a long time,

472
00:28:25,084 --> 00:28:27,044
and the only answer I could come up with

473
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:31,484
is that maybe it's not the best time
for the two of us.

474
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:34,885
Su Ying.

475
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:37,125
Don't you have
a great opportunity for you?

476
00:28:39,004 --> 00:28:39,965
I heard it's a rare one,

477
00:28:40,524 --> 00:28:42,004
the kind
that wouldn't appear again shortly.

478
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:46,365
So I don't want our relationship
to affect your decision-making.

479
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:50,284
You should follow your heart.

480
00:28:55,524 --> 00:28:56,445
But if I leave,

481
00:28:58,084 --> 00:28:59,284
I'll be away for three years.

482
00:29:04,044 --> 00:29:06,365
Love is supposed to bring happiness,
isn't it?

483
00:29:10,044 --> 00:29:12,165
So, good relationship

484
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:14,605
should make both of us better,

485
00:29:15,284 --> 00:29:16,564
not tying each other down.

486
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:21,845
So you think

487
00:29:23,165 --> 00:29:24,125
this is the best choice?

488
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:28,616
Yes.

489
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:31,004
Don't you think
our distance now is just right?

490
00:29:35,044 --> 00:29:37,605
We are both living the way we want,

491
00:29:39,165 --> 00:29:40,445
without having to sacrifice

492
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:42,004
or change for each other.

493
00:29:43,004 --> 00:29:44,405
We don't have so many worries.

494
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:45,764
It's a kind of relief.

495
00:29:55,564 --> 00:29:56,488
Okay.

496
00:29:57,764 --> 00:29:58,728
I understand.

497
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,224
I'm glad you do.

498
00:30:03,445 --> 00:30:04,804
I'm going to bed now. I'm tired today.

499
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:19,324
I'll leave the lamp for you here.

500
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,408
Have a good rest.

501
00:30:39,244 --> 00:30:41,044
What did I say?

502
00:31:14,885 --> 00:31:15,848
Bai,

503
00:31:16,365 --> 00:31:17,288
you drank too much.

504
00:31:18,205 --> 00:31:19,176
Have some water.

505
00:31:21,524 --> 00:31:22,724
Is it wrong

506
00:31:24,484 --> 00:31:25,544
to like someone?

507
00:31:26,324 --> 00:31:28,405
How can it be wrong to like someone?

508
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:31,564
When you get back, take a hot bath

509
00:31:31,885 --> 00:31:33,324
and have a cozy sleep.

510
00:31:34,165 --> 00:31:35,205
Even the saddest things

511
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:37,064
will pass.

512
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,445
What is so good about Su Ying?

513
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:46,605
Why does Yunsheng like her and not me?

514
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:49,004
What's not good about me?

515
00:31:51,885 --> 00:31:52,925
What's not good about me?

516
00:31:53,524 --> 00:31:54,600
Are you okay?

517
00:31:56,764 --> 00:31:58,524
I remember when my sister was alive,

518
00:32:01,885 --> 00:32:03,484
I had been around them all along.

519
00:32:04,685 --> 00:32:05,672
I thought

520
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:08,324
I would always bless them.

521
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:16,004
Actually, I also liked Yunsheng
for a long time.

522
00:32:20,165 --> 00:32:21,128
Later,

523
00:32:21,965 --> 00:32:23,004
my sister was gone.

524
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:28,484
I thought I could replace her

525
00:32:30,445 --> 00:32:31,965
and stay by Yunsheng's side.

526
00:32:33,405 --> 00:32:35,365
I studied the same major as Yunsheng.

527
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,925
And I was abroad for so many years.

528
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:42,484
I thought after I came back,

529
00:32:43,524 --> 00:32:45,925
I could stand proudly by his side

530
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:47,885
to work with him,

531
00:32:49,205 --> 00:32:50,084
and help him.

532
00:32:51,885 --> 00:32:55,125
I thought we would be together forever.

533
00:32:59,365 --> 00:33:01,804
But the appearance of Su Ying
changed everything.

534
00:33:03,044 --> 00:33:05,044
Her appearance changed everything.

535
00:33:16,165 --> 00:33:17,256
Right.

536
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:20,165
After Su Ying appeared,
Yunsheng became more cheerful,

537
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,524
and he opened up.

538
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:24,072
Mi Bai,

539
00:33:24,804 --> 00:33:26,885
everyone was heartbroken
at Mi Su's death.

540
00:33:27,445 --> 00:33:28,445
You had left for six years,

541
00:33:28,645 --> 00:33:30,724
and Yunsheng had guarded
the glass house for six years.

542
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,925
I know very well
what he went through in these six years.

543
00:33:33,405 --> 00:33:34,564
He was like a walking dead.

544
00:33:34,965 --> 00:33:35,925
But then Su Ying appeared,

545
00:33:36,564 --> 00:33:38,244
and Yunsheng's world was lit up.

546
00:33:38,845 --> 00:33:40,804
He came back to life, do you understand?

547
00:33:43,445 --> 00:33:44,685
She took advantage of him.

548
00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:49,284
Since the time
she repaired the glass house,

549
00:33:49,284 --> 00:33:51,240
she has fallen for Yunsheng, hasn't she?

550
00:33:51,885 --> 00:33:53,365
She had so many relationships before.

551
00:33:54,685 --> 00:33:56,845
She was not sincere with Yunsheng.

552
00:33:57,365 --> 00:33:59,365
She was not worthy of Yunsheng at all.

553
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:02,445
Mi Bai, I think
you misunderstood Su Ying too much.

554
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:04,244
I have more contact
with Su Ying than you.

555
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:06,284
She is a straightforward
and kind person.

556
00:34:06,564 --> 00:34:08,325
You really misunderstood her.

557
00:34:17,124 --> 00:34:18,084
You all support her.

558
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:21,524
All of you!

559
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:22,696
Mi Bai.

560
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:27,484
People have to look forward.

561
00:34:28,204 --> 00:34:30,164
You can't always live
with past obsessions.

562
00:34:30,524 --> 00:34:33,004
It won't make
the people around you happy.

563
00:34:34,684 --> 00:34:35,688
Then what is love?

564
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:38,564
Shouldn't love be obsessive?

565
00:34:38,925 --> 00:34:41,084
Shouldn't love make people happy?

566
00:34:43,285 --> 00:34:44,325
If I love a person

567
00:34:44,325 --> 00:34:45,524
and she doesn't love me,

568
00:34:45,805 --> 00:34:47,445
I won't want to have her.

569
00:34:47,604 --> 00:34:48,564
I want her to be blessed.

570
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:50,405
I hope she can find her own happiness.

571
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:55,405
Bai, I wish you happiness.

572
00:34:57,204 --> 00:34:58,684
So, you should also
wish Yunsheng happiness.

573
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:03,765
I believe the misunderstanding
between you and Su Ying will be solved.

574
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:07,684
Just trust me, okay?

575
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:54,885
Have you thought it through?

576
00:35:56,684 --> 00:35:57,576
Yes, I have.

577
00:36:00,405 --> 00:36:01,320
Okay.

578
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:04,805
Then sign this.

579
00:36:15,684 --> 00:36:16,680
Yunsheng,

580
00:36:17,484 --> 00:36:18,604
I am proud of you.

581
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:21,164
I appreciate your help and support.

582
00:36:22,285 --> 00:36:25,405
Alright, I will file this
as soon as possible.

583
00:36:27,524 --> 00:36:28,520
Then, I'm off.

584
00:36:36,285 --> 00:36:38,885
Yunsheng, I want to talk to you
about Mi Bai.

585
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:45,405
I have never seen Mi Bai drink before.

586
00:36:46,524 --> 00:36:48,325
Nor have I ever seen her cry so sadly.

587
00:36:49,965 --> 00:36:51,208
I could feel

588
00:36:54,664 --> 00:36:55,725
that she likes you very much.

589
00:36:58,004 --> 00:36:59,204
I was too anxious yesterday.

590
00:37:01,405 --> 00:37:02,564
I just wanted her to know

591
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:04,845
she shouldn't have done that.

592
00:37:07,004 --> 00:37:09,044
If one loves someone else
too obsessively,

593
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:10,484
they often make mistakes.

594
00:37:11,965 --> 00:37:14,805
But we can't let her continue
on the wrong path.

595
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:17,684
As her seniors, we have to help her.

596
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:20,725
Her misunderstanding of Su Ying
is too deep.

597
00:37:21,965 --> 00:37:23,325
You need to talk to her.

598
00:37:24,604 --> 00:37:25,925
Whoever started it should end it.

599
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:30,760
So, that's a deal?

600
00:37:33,564 --> 00:37:35,464
I will be relieved
if you can persuade her.

601
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:38,285
I remember when we were in school,

602
00:37:38,725 --> 00:37:40,405
Bai followed us around.

603
00:37:40,644 --> 00:37:41,965
We went to the library,

604
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:45,604
went to the lab, and ate together.

605
00:37:46,604 --> 00:37:47,965
I hope we can still do those.

606
00:37:49,004 --> 00:37:49,896
Alright.

607
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:52,044
I'll find time to persuade her.

608
00:37:57,405 --> 00:37:58,965
The project has already completed.

609
00:37:59,484 --> 00:38:00,965
Why do you still want to see me?

610
00:38:01,484 --> 00:38:04,004
I came to give you some advice.

611
00:38:04,845 --> 00:38:06,004
Stay away from Yang Zhengwen.

612
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,684
We are merely his pawns.

613
00:38:09,084 --> 00:38:11,365
Once we are no use to him,
we will be abandoned.

614
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:13,365
It's what happened to me.

615
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:18,405
I cooperated with Yang Zhengwen

616
00:38:19,084 --> 00:38:21,405
only because we both
wanted to win back the people we love.

617
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:24,285
But his way of winning back Su Ying

618
00:38:24,604 --> 00:38:26,405
is to constantly create
difficulties and pain for her

619
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:28,405
and then save her in distress himself.

620
00:38:29,365 --> 00:38:30,684
Is this also your way?

621
00:38:32,725 --> 00:38:35,204
I know you like Dr. Qin.

622
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,445
So you are hostile to Su Ying for that.

623
00:38:38,325 --> 00:38:39,272
But don't you think

624
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,845
Yang Zhengwen intentionally
magnified your hostility towards her?

625
00:38:43,044 --> 00:38:45,484
I hate Su Ying because she has been
playing with Yunsheng's feelings.

626
00:38:47,805 --> 00:38:49,044
Dr. Mi,

627
00:38:49,044 --> 00:38:51,484
although I didn't spend much time
with Su Ying,

628
00:38:51,885 --> 00:38:54,564
I saw their interactions.

629
00:38:55,004 --> 00:38:56,445
I could feel

630
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:00,164
that Su Ying is sincere towards Dr. Qin.

631
00:39:05,004 --> 00:39:05,965
But think about it.

632
00:39:07,204 --> 00:39:09,604
They will be together every day
because of this project,

633
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,765
but they might separate because of it.

634
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:14,248
What do you mean?

635
00:39:14,725 --> 00:39:18,164
There is an old saying,
everything overdone will die early.

636
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:19,564
In a relationship,

637
00:39:19,684 --> 00:39:23,592
when both sides sink into
enough misunderstandings and fatigue,

638
00:39:24,164 --> 00:39:25,805
they will naturally separate.

639
00:39:33,765 --> 00:39:35,725
It seems like I am wrong.

640
00:39:37,725 --> 00:39:39,325
Both of us were used by Yang Zhengwen

641
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,285
for our own selfish needs.

642
00:39:42,564 --> 00:39:45,325
But now, we should stop in time.

643
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:49,164
Dr. Mi, I've said what I needed to say.

644
00:39:49,725 --> 00:39:52,004
I believe
you will make the right judgment.

645
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:57,356
(Garden Road No. 123)

646
00:40:00,604 --> 00:40:02,124
Ying, Mr. Yang is looking for you.

647
00:40:04,484 --> 00:40:05,352
Thank you.

648
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,405
How is your mother's recovery?

649
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:12,725
It's pretty good.
She can be discharged in a few days.

650
00:40:14,285 --> 00:40:16,164
Anyway, if you need my help,
just let me know.

651
00:40:16,604 --> 00:40:18,925
My friend has a nice nursing home
in the suburbs.

652
00:40:19,365 --> 00:40:21,684
If you need it, you can let your mother
rest there for a while.

653
00:40:22,484 --> 00:40:23,496
No need.

654
00:40:24,204 --> 00:40:25,484
I have been bothering you too much

655
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:26,925
during her sickness.

656
00:40:28,124 --> 00:40:30,204
I am still thinking about
how to repay your favor.

657
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:31,285
I can't owe you more.

658
00:40:33,484 --> 00:40:34,564
If you feel a bit stressed

659
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:37,405
about owing me too much,

660
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:38,445
why don't you pay back first?

661
00:40:40,164 --> 00:40:41,004
What do you mean?

662
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:43,725
I happen to have a house
that needs renovation.

663
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:46,604
As for ordinary designers,

664
00:40:47,004 --> 00:40:48,204
I don't trust them.

665
00:40:50,405 --> 00:40:52,524
Will you help?

666
00:40:57,805 --> 00:40:59,765
Didn't you want to pay back my favor?

667
00:41:04,164 --> 00:41:05,405
If it's personal...

668
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:06,344
It's business.

669
00:41:13,564 --> 00:41:15,164
Okay, I'll look at the house first.

670
00:41:15,564 --> 00:41:16,424
Sure, no problem.

671
00:41:17,164 --> 00:41:18,245
Do you have time this afternoon?

672
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:19,564
This afternoon...

673
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:22,325
Okay, no problem.

674
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:24,124
I'll go back to the company.

675
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:25,524
I'll send you the address.
See you later.

676
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,405
Okay, see you.

677
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:29,384
Bye.

678
00:41:40,604 --> 00:41:43,204
(Although I didn't spend much time
with Su Ying,)

679
00:41:43,644 --> 00:41:46,245
(I saw their interactions.)

680
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:48,124
(I could feel)

681
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:51,925
(that Su Ying is sincere with Dr. Qin.)

682
00:42:09,965 --> 00:42:10,925
I heard from Yisen

683
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,320
you were drunk yesterday.

684
00:42:16,644 --> 00:42:17,544
I'm fine.

685
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,084
I shouldn't yell at you yesterday.

686
00:42:24,204 --> 00:42:25,128
I'm sorry.

687
00:42:25,564 --> 00:42:27,644
I know you have done
many wrong things because of me.

688
00:42:28,564 --> 00:42:31,204
But love is not something you can get
by breaking others apart.

689
00:42:32,725 --> 00:42:34,245
But now it's all in the past.

690
00:42:36,925 --> 00:42:38,204
I know I was wrong.

691
00:42:40,405 --> 00:42:42,644
I want to show you a video.

692
00:42:48,644 --> 00:42:50,044
(Actually,)

693
00:42:50,124 --> 00:42:51,845
(House Design)
(I chose glass as the main material)

694
00:42:52,044 --> 00:42:55,004
(of this house
for another important reason.)

695
00:42:56,604 --> 00:43:00,044
(I want to achieve the best effect
in the shortest possible time.)

696
00:43:00,564 --> 00:43:03,644

to fulfill the wish of my client.)
