00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:49,103
Hello, Mingshi.

19
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:51,782
What?

20
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:55,663
Okay, I got it.

21
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,222
Ying,

22
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:01,302
Mingshi called and said

23
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:02,903
the show team was causing
Huixuan trouble

24
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:03,862
for the warehouse matter.

25
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:04,782
What do we do?

26
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:06,142
Why are they targeting Huixuan?

27
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:11,223
What do you mean?

28
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:12,383
I object.

29
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:13,842
(House Design)
I'm afraid it's not up to you.

30
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:15,622
What right do you have to replace her?

31
00:02:16,022 --> 00:02:18,142
Have you seen the actual rainbow glass?

32
00:02:19,343 --> 00:02:20,823
I have spoken with the higher-ups.

33
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,142
Given this situation,

34
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,263
they also agreed to replace Su Ying.

35
00:02:24,702 --> 00:02:27,302
Have you consulted
the property owner first?

36
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,063
Miss Du, don't worry.

37
00:02:29,422 --> 00:02:30,182
That is not the point.

38
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:31,663
We will fulfill all

39
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:32,543
of Dr. Qin's requests.

40
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:34,503
Besides,

41
00:02:35,663 --> 00:02:37,422
I don't care who agrees or disagrees.

42
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:39,702
I'm the executive producer of this show.

43
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:41,582
I absolutely won't allow it to fail.

44
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:43,503
I don't allow my show

45
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:44,663
to be interfered with.

46
00:02:44,902 --> 00:02:46,063
Don't say I didn't warn you.

47
00:02:46,742 --> 00:02:48,022
If it really fails in the end,

48
00:02:48,223 --> 00:02:49,383
you will have to not only resign

49
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:51,142
but also bear all the costs.

50
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,983
Are you joking, Mr. Liu?

51
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:56,902
Miss Su,

52
00:02:57,862 --> 00:02:59,462
has the rainbow glass been produced yet?

53
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:01,862
Mr. Liu,

54
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:03,582
it doesn't matter if it's not.

55
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,063
I'm here to save the day.

56
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:12,862
Mr. Liu, please have a look.

57
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:17,302
The rainbow glass that you see now

58
00:03:17,543 --> 00:03:18,383
will be the main element

59
00:03:18,503 --> 00:03:20,063
in our renovation of the glass house.

60
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:23,022
Whether under natural light

61
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:28,343
or artificial light,

62
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,462
it shows various colors.

63
00:03:48,902 --> 00:03:49,823
As for load bearing

64
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:50,742
and sound insulation,

65
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:52,182
we have made special adjustments.

66
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:54,503
Miss Su,

67
00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:56,302
the sample is beautiful.

68
00:03:56,663 --> 00:03:57,543
But it takes a long time

69
00:03:57,543 --> 00:03:58,702
to frit structural glass.

70
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:00,182
Can you deliver on time?

71
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:05,343
It rained yesterday
and the warehouse leaked,

72
00:04:05,742 --> 00:04:07,422
causing some damage to the materials.

73
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,742
But we replenished
our stocks immediately,

74
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,702
so the progress wouldn't be delayed.

75
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:16,422
Right.

76
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:18,463
Why did the warehouse leak?

77
00:04:19,062 --> 00:04:19,543
Huixuan,

78
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:20,663
what did you do?

79
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:21,663
Mr. Liu,

80
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:22,543
I think you know

81
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:24,062
better than I do.

82
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:25,583
Mr. Su,

83
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:28,382
could you please explain it?

84
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,302
Why did you go
to our No. 3 warehouse yesterday?

85
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,742
I was doing the usual selection

86
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:36,262
of warehouse

87
00:04:36,663 --> 00:04:37,502
after joining the show.

88
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:39,382
Don't slander me, okay?

89
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:41,703
That was quite a coincidence.

90
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:44,223
You can do the sample
however you want,

91
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,622
but what about

92
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:46,742
the actual effect?

93
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:47,742
Right, Mr. Liu?

94
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:48,343
Right.

95
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,262
It's normal for you
to have such a question.

96
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:52,822
Because no one can beat you
when it comes to the difference

97
00:04:52,983 --> 00:04:53,663
between the product

98
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:54,983
and the rendering.

99
00:04:57,783 --> 00:04:59,182
Since the problem has been solved,

100
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,343
we don't need your help, Mr. Su.

101
00:05:04,382 --> 00:05:04,883
Wait.

102
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:09,822
Ziyang.

103
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:11,103
Mr. Su.

104
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:13,302
Ziyang.

105
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:18,262
So, Mr. Liu,

106
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:20,182
do you have

107
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:21,742
any other problems?

108
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:23,543
I don't have any.

109
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:25,822
I'll leave you guys alone.

110
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:30,583
The glass is intriguing.

111
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:45,262
Awesome!

112
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:47,903
You came at the right time.

113
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:49,302
You were shining.

114
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:50,143
Yes.

115
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:51,422
Did you see the terrible looks

116
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,182
on the faces

117
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:53,262
of Su Ziyang and Mr. Liu?

118
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:54,903
You turned the tables.

119
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:56,382
Ying, you are impressive!

120
00:05:56,742 --> 00:05:57,463
Miss Su,

121
00:05:57,742 --> 00:05:58,903
I finally understand

122
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:00,062
what is

123
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:02,903
the cutthroat world of the workplace.

124
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:06,703
Oh, right.

125
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:08,463
My results are out today.

126
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,302
Dr. Xie,

127
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,463
you told me to come back in three days
to pick up the biopsy report.

128
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:19,983
Is it ready yet?

129
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:22,822
You got the timing pretty spot on.

130
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:24,742
But I don't have

131
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:26,302
your report printed out yet.

132
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:28,023
You may use the barcode

133
00:06:28,382 --> 00:06:29,983
to collect it
from the self-service machine.

134
00:06:30,382 --> 00:06:31,502
That works.

135
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:34,703
So, after I get the report,

136
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:36,703
do I need to come back
to you for a review?

137
00:06:37,903 --> 00:06:38,862
In the report,

138
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:39,942
everything is written clearly.

139
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:41,903
If there are indeed parts
you don't understand,

140
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:43,583
you can ask me at any time.

141
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,903
Alright.

142
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:52,422
Doctor,

143
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:54,822
if the existence
of cancer cells isn't certain,

144
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:56,543
then before I receive the report,

145
00:06:56,822 --> 00:06:57,502
is the probability

146
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,502
of me having cancer 50 percent?

147
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:01,862
Logically speaking, yes.

148
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:03,822
You see.

149
00:07:03,983 --> 00:07:05,382
I'm usually quite healthy.

150
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:06,622
Except for the stomachache,

151
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:07,942
I don't have any other issues.

152
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:09,622
Wouldn't this reduce the probability

153
00:07:09,783 --> 00:07:10,862
by half to 25 percent?

154
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:11,903
That's possible.

155
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:14,262
Even if it's in an early stage,

156
00:07:14,663 --> 00:07:16,742
since medical technology
in our country is so advanced,

157
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:18,143
there must be a cure.

158
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:19,622
The probability of me dying from it

159
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:21,502
would be reduced to 10 percent, right?

160
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:23,622
There's no need to worry about that.

161
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,023
Go get the report first.

162
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:27,103
Doctor,

163
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:28,742
I hear the probability of carcinogenesis

164
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:29,382
is not high.

165
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,502
In fact, it is very low.

166
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:32,663
For some organ cells,

167
00:07:32,663 --> 00:07:34,143
the probability is
less than one percent,

168
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,903
which, if rounded off,

169
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:35,942
equals zero.

170
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:37,023
Why are you here?

171
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:38,942
For your report,

172
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:40,463
Dr. Qin

173
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:43,583
has been asking almost every day
these past few days.

174
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:50,903
Go get the report.

175
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:55,622
Thank you, doctor.

176
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:56,983
You're welcome.

177
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,942
I-I-I'm going to use the restroom.

178
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:17,942
You've gone three times.

179
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:27,912
(The report is printing)

180
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:51,103
I told you it'd be no big deal.

181
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:54,022
I was so nervous.

182
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:55,502
Is that so?

183
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:57,463
Someone seems to have said
that once she

184
00:08:57,943 --> 00:08:58,703
had a breakdown,

185
00:08:58,782 --> 00:09:00,382
she would never be nervous again.

186
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:03,223
I'm in a good mood today.

187
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:04,103
I'll give you a pass.

188
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:05,262
Say whatever you want.

189
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:12,902
Hello, Mr. Qin.

190
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:13,902
Tao.

191
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:16,943
Are you hurt again?

192
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,303
No.

193
00:09:18,703 --> 00:09:20,382
I came with my dad.

194
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:21,542
Your father?

195
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:23,862
I hear he's not feeling well
with his heart

196
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:25,502
and that the surgery
is going to be tough.

197
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:26,742
Mr. Qin,

198
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:29,103
could you do the surgery for my dad?

199
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:32,983
Your dad needs cardiac surgery,

200
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:34,463
and I'm an ER doctor.

201
00:09:37,063 --> 00:09:37,862
But it's okay.

202
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:39,502
I believe other doctors

203
00:09:39,742 --> 00:09:40,943
will definitely cure your dad.

204
00:09:41,103 --> 00:09:42,583
I want you to cure my dad.

205
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:44,583
I want you to do it.

206
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,502
Tao,

207
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,423
we should go home.

208
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:47,823
Yes.

209
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,183
You really won't go back?

210
00:10:05,262 --> 00:10:06,983
I can save lives in any department.

211
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:09,063
But the heart can't be deceived.

212
00:10:09,862 --> 00:10:11,943
Don't you miss the excitement

213
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:13,262
and pride?

214
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:19,382
I just want to see you

215
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,063
with that proud look on your face.

216
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:24,583
By the way,

217
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:26,622
the filming begins tomorrow.

218
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:28,063
Next, I'll devote myself entirely

219
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,463
to the making of the glass.

220
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:30,983
Let's make a promise, okay?

221
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:33,742
Go ahead.

222
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:35,742
You just

223
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:36,943
focus on your work for now

224
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,502
and don't come to the glass house.

225
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:40,583
I want to present it to you

226
00:10:40,943 --> 00:10:42,583
in its perfect and most surprising form

227
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:43,622
after it's done.

228
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:47,022
Is this a kind
of obsessive-compulsive behavior

229
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:48,902
of you designers?

230
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:54,022
I'm looking forward to it.

I want the feeling of light coming in.

237
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:22,662
Remember the wound

238
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:25,423

Look at that star.

255
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:09,183
It's so beautiful.

256
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:23,983
Everyone, perk up.

257
00:12:24,183 --> 00:12:25,463
It is the last day of the filming

258
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:27,542
of the glass house.

259
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,943
Okay, let's begin.

260
00:12:30,303 --> 00:12:30,862
Come on.

261
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:33,382
Hello, everyone.

262
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:35,343
Welcome to House Design.

263
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:37,303
And we are from SU Design Firm.

264
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:37,742
Yes.

265
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:39,303
Ye, Chen and Mingshi.

266
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:40,463
What do you think?

267
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:43,022
How would you rate your own work?

268
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:46,262
It depends on how much
the homeowner rates me.

269
00:12:46,262 --> 00:12:47,223
Our goal this time

270
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:48,983
is to repair it and perfect it...

271
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:49,622
Here he is.

272
00:12:49,622 --> 00:12:51,142
So that the owner can feel at home

273
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:53,742
and yet fresh
in his new home in the later years.

274
00:12:54,262 --> 00:12:56,183
Now, let's take a look

275
00:12:56,262 --> 00:12:56,983
at the structure.

276
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,103
Thank you.

277
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:26,862
Thank you for helping Mi Su

278
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:29,382
fulfill her last dream.

279
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:32,703
As a designer,

280
00:13:33,622 --> 00:13:35,142
I have something to say to you now.

281
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,022
In fact, at first,

282
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:41,103
it was like falling into a maze.

283
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,502
I was confused and lost,

284
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:45,542
because I didn't know
what kind of rainbow

285
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:46,542
you wanted the most.

286
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:48,142
Until that day,

287
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:50,902
I inadvertently saw the bucket list left

288
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:51,902
by Mi Su for you.

289
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,888
(Wish List)

290
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:00,744
(Eat all flavors of ice cream)

291
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:05,320
(See the cherry blossoms in the spring)

292
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,262
(Read 100 books)

293
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:08,902
(Read 100 books)
(I found Mi Su's true wish)

294
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:10,902
(Watch 100 in-person talk shows)
(in that list.)

295
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,823
(In fact, the wishes Mi Su made)

296
00:14:18,742 --> 00:14:20,103
were never for herself

297
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,902
but for you.

298
00:14:27,142 --> 00:14:28,103
She wanted to eat ice cream

299
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,902
to let you taste sweetness

300
00:14:31,223 --> 00:14:32,423
every single day.

301
00:14:34,262 --> 00:14:35,823
She wanted a sea of flowers
outside the window

302
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:37,902
so that whenever you opened the window,

303
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:39,622
you would see beautiful scenery.

304
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:41,542
She wanted to read 100 books

305
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:44,223
because she hoped that reading
could accompany you

306
00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:46,103

Mi Su made many wishes,

313
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:26,742
but actually, she only made one wish.

314
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,223
That was to hope you can be happy.

315
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:33,862

♪Happy birthday to you♪

380
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:41,663
Thank you.

381
00:20:42,302 --> 00:20:42,822
Make a wish.

382
00:20:42,863 --> 00:20:43,423
Alright.

383
00:20:44,302 --> 00:20:44,983
Let me make a wish.

384
00:20:56,582 --> 00:20:57,262
Blow it out.

385
00:20:57,582 --> 00:20:58,262
Together then.

386
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:04,062
Happy birthday.

387
00:21:31,703 --> 00:21:33,302
(Mi Su made many wishes,)

388
00:21:34,302 --> 00:21:36,183
(but actually, she only made one wish.)

389
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:39,102
(That was to hope you can be happy.)

390
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:41,623
(Because she believed)

391
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:43,302
(love could make people happy.)

392
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,502
(Whether or not she was by your side,)

393
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:48,223
(she hoped you'd always be happy.)

394
00:22:32,623 --> 00:22:33,143
Hello,

395
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:34,542
Director.

396
00:22:55,703 --> 00:22:56,383
Dr. Qin.

397
00:22:58,342 --> 00:22:59,582
I think

398
00:23:00,943 --> 00:23:02,463
the biggest regret in life

399
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:05,383
is stubbornly sticking to
what you shouldn't

400
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:07,703
and easily giving up
what you shouldn't.

401
00:23:15,223 --> 00:23:16,623
I just want to see you

402
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:18,262
with that proud look on your face.

403
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,022
Why is Dr. Qin

404
00:23:38,102 --> 00:23:39,183
on today's duty roster?

405
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:41,302
Was he transferred back from the ED?

406
00:23:41,782 --> 00:23:42,582
You don't know it?

407
00:23:43,262 --> 00:23:45,062
There's even
a department dinner to celebrate it.

408
00:23:45,983 --> 00:23:47,582
Really?

409
00:23:47,582 --> 00:23:48,223
Yes, really.

410
00:23:48,423 --> 00:23:50,022
Why don't I know anything?

411
00:23:54,235 --> 00:23:56,648
(Cardiac Surgery)

412
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:03,903
Hello, Dr. Qin.

413
00:24:04,062 --> 00:24:04,742
Hello, Dr. Qin.

414
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:09,782
Hello, Dr. Qin.

415
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:25,463
Please come in.

416
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:33,183
Director,

417
00:24:35,623 --> 00:24:36,342
I am back.

418
00:24:40,383 --> 00:24:40,983
Good.

419
00:24:41,502 --> 00:24:42,383
Welcome back to the team.

420
00:24:46,863 --> 00:24:47,623
I'm Qin Yunsheng.

421
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:49,582
I am a cardiothoracic surgeon.

422
00:24:50,143 --> 00:24:52,102
This is my second time
participating in House Design.

423
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:54,703
I am Su Ying.

424
00:24:54,903 --> 00:24:55,782
I am a designer.

425
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:57,663
This is my second time on this show too.

426
00:24:58,502 --> 00:24:59,742
I want to ask you, Dr. Qin.

427
00:25:00,262 --> 00:25:02,022
After participating
in our show this time,

428
00:25:02,342 --> 00:25:03,262
has your wish come true?

429
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:05,582
Yes, it has.

430
00:25:06,262 --> 00:25:08,383
But it's not quite the same
as what I thought.

431
00:25:08,943 --> 00:25:09,623
How is it different?

432
00:25:10,062 --> 00:25:11,943
In addition to seeing the house I like,

433
00:25:12,582 --> 00:25:13,742
I've made

434
00:25:14,183 --> 00:25:14,983
a special friend.

435
00:25:16,342 --> 00:25:16,983
Then

436
00:25:17,623 --> 00:25:18,542
how about you, Miss Su?

437
00:25:21,262 --> 00:25:23,022
I've made a special friend, too.

438
00:25:49,663 --> 00:25:50,383
You are right.

439
00:25:54,143 --> 00:25:55,423
I should have understood earlier

440
00:25:56,502 --> 00:25:57,502
that her biggest wish

441
00:25:58,742 --> 00:26:00,183
was my happiness.

442
00:26:05,903 --> 00:26:06,582
Dr. Qin,

443
00:26:07,143 --> 00:26:08,502
I am happy to see you again.

444
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:10,663
You became my client again.

445
00:26:10,822 --> 00:26:11,903
And you've become my doctor.

446
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:14,983
Thank you

447
00:26:15,383 --> 00:26:16,262
for being my friend.

448
00:26:22,062 --> 00:26:23,022
So,

449
00:26:23,383 --> 00:26:26,062
the next time I see you
is probably at a celebration.

450
00:26:26,262 --> 00:26:26,903
A celebration?

451
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:28,342
Yes, I heard from Huixuan

452
00:26:28,582 --> 00:26:29,822
it'd be the day after tomorrow.

453
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:36,223
I really want to go,

454
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:37,822
but

455
00:26:38,183 --> 00:26:40,863
I'll have a party with colleagues
from the cardiology department.

456
00:26:41,742 --> 00:26:43,383
And the roster has already been set.

457
00:26:43,822 --> 00:26:44,703
I'm afraid

458
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:46,183
it can't be adjusted.

459
00:26:48,582 --> 00:26:49,302
Then,

460
00:26:50,663 --> 00:26:52,342
you will be very busy
in the future, right?

461
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:57,703
I've asked my colleagues

462
00:26:58,302 --> 00:26:59,262
to cover shifts

463
00:26:59,782 --> 00:27:00,703
because of the house,

464
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:02,623
so I need to repay the favor.

465
00:27:03,782 --> 00:27:04,542
I see.

466
00:27:08,022 --> 00:27:08,542
Then...

467
00:27:08,663 --> 00:27:10,223
Let's go and take the wrap photo.

468
00:27:12,822 --> 00:27:13,183
Let's go.

469
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:13,742
Okay.

470
00:27:16,663 --> 00:27:17,542
- Come on.
- Let's do it.

471
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:18,463
Come on.

472
00:27:18,782 --> 00:27:19,742
Look at the camera.

473
00:27:20,423 --> 00:27:21,863
Three, two, one.

474
00:27:31,903 --> 00:27:32,822
Coming.

475
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:34,903
I'm so hungry.

476
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:37,703
I really feel

477
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:39,383
that I could eat a cow right now.

478
00:27:41,183 --> 00:27:42,463
Finally, it's over.

479
00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:43,262
I'm telling you.

480
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:44,943
I really need to rest for a few days.

481
00:27:45,183 --> 00:27:46,342
I'm exhausted, really.

482
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:47,822
You have finished.

483
00:27:48,022 --> 00:27:49,143
I've just started.

484
00:27:49,383 --> 00:27:50,062
What does it mean?

485
00:27:50,423 --> 00:27:51,383
There are other projects?

486
00:27:52,062 --> 00:27:53,863
The glass house project is finished,

487
00:27:53,943 --> 00:27:55,983
but this season has just started.

488
00:27:56,463 --> 00:27:57,302
The next owner

489
00:27:57,582 --> 00:27:59,302
has a small house
but a lot of requirements.

490
00:27:59,703 --> 00:28:00,383
I'm not sure

491
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:01,903
which unfortunate designer

492
00:28:02,102 --> 00:28:04,262
will end up with this tough nut.

493
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:05,542
Indeed.

494
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:06,903
Poor thing. Let me give you a massage.

495
00:28:09,623 --> 00:28:10,183
By the way,

496
00:28:10,903 --> 00:28:13,223
what kind of clients
do you designers want to deal with?

497
00:28:14,863 --> 00:28:17,143
What do you mean
by the kind of clients we like

498
00:28:17,143 --> 00:28:17,903
to deal with?

499
00:28:18,022 --> 00:28:19,463
The client is the boss.

500
00:28:19,663 --> 00:28:21,463
It's not about if we like them.

501
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:22,582
We have to follow

502
00:28:22,623 --> 00:28:23,423
our clients' requests,

503
00:28:23,623 --> 00:28:24,262
whether it is

504
00:28:24,423 --> 00:28:25,703
to change the floor or the tiles.

505
00:28:26,223 --> 00:28:27,262
What if you have to answer?

506
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:28,703
If I had to say.

507
00:28:32,102 --> 00:28:32,863
It depends.

508
00:28:33,342 --> 00:28:34,062
For instance?

509
00:28:35,742 --> 00:28:36,342
Firstly,

510
00:28:36,703 --> 00:28:37,822
they must have a good character.

511
00:28:39,463 --> 00:28:40,903
Having a good character
is very important.

512
00:28:41,463 --> 00:28:42,143
Secondly,

513
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:44,342
they have clear demands.

514
00:28:45,822 --> 00:28:46,943
Clear demands

515
00:28:47,062 --> 00:28:48,822
can reduce a lot of communication time.

516
00:28:49,383 --> 00:28:51,582
But if the demands from the client

517
00:28:51,782 --> 00:28:53,383
are too harsh and difficult to achieve,

518
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:55,262
it will be troublesome.

519
00:28:55,742 --> 00:28:56,423
Thirdly,

520
00:28:57,062 --> 00:28:58,863
they think from your perspective.

521
00:29:01,062 --> 00:29:03,062
This makes it easier for you
to understand each other

522
00:29:03,423 --> 00:29:04,062
and communicate.

523
00:29:04,463 --> 00:29:05,143
Fourthly,

524
00:29:06,502 --> 00:29:08,502
they are extremely gentle and confident.

525
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:15,502
Can they help you cure illnesses too?

526
00:29:17,983 --> 00:29:19,822
Are you talking about a client

527
00:29:19,903 --> 00:29:21,623
or Dr. Qin?

528
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:23,183
It doesn't conflict.

529
00:29:23,903 --> 00:29:25,742
Dr. Qin just happens to

530
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:27,342
be the typical client

531
00:29:27,863 --> 00:29:28,822
we designers love the most.

532
00:29:29,983 --> 00:29:31,143
I advise you to wake up.

533
00:29:31,822 --> 00:29:33,463
The recording of this season
is already finished.

534
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:34,703
You are a designer,

535
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:36,262
and he's a doctor.

536
00:29:36,782 --> 00:29:38,262
You two simply won't

537
00:29:38,463 --> 00:29:39,582
cross paths again.

538
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:40,582
So what?

539
00:29:41,183 --> 00:29:41,782
I can create

540
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,423
the opportunity to see him.

541
00:29:43,903 --> 00:29:44,502
I can go to him,

542
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:45,582
if he doesn't come to me.

543
00:29:46,102 --> 00:29:46,983
Let me tell you.

544
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:50,502
Love can conquer any difficulties,
even mountains and oceans.

545
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:57,022
What's it? You scared me.

546
00:29:57,423 --> 00:29:58,863
Have we booked
a place for our celebration?

547
00:29:59,183 --> 00:30:00,062
Let me recommend you one.

548
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:01,183
Where?

549
00:30:04,863 --> 00:30:05,463
Wait.

550
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:11,342
(Where will your party)

551
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:12,623
(be held?)

552
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:24,863
(Piyixia Restaurant)

553
00:30:24,863 --> 00:30:27,383
Cardiac surgery department's
party location?

554
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:30,262
I'm asking you seriously,

555
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:31,903
and you're gonna take advantage of it?

556
00:30:32,102 --> 00:30:33,262
I'm serious too.

557
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:34,183
You don't understand.

558
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:35,223
Fine, send it to me.

559
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:36,102
Send me the location.

560
00:30:36,223 --> 00:30:36,983
Let's book this place.

561
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:46,143
Take your medicine.

562
00:30:46,183 --> 00:30:46,782
No, I won't.

563
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:47,663
Well...

564
00:30:48,423 --> 00:30:49,782
Not taking your meds again?

565
00:30:50,062 --> 00:30:51,582
How are you going
to follow the treatment?

566
00:30:51,623 --> 00:30:52,183
Persuade him.

567
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:52,863
Director Ruan,

568
00:30:52,903 --> 00:30:53,983
please stop talking.

569
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:55,782
Please discharge me.

570
00:30:55,863 --> 00:30:57,143
I don't want the treatment anymore.

571
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:57,903
Not anymore.

572
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,903
I looked up online.

573
00:31:00,062 --> 00:31:02,542
My disease is simply incurable.

574
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,423
You have me lying here all the time.

575
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:06,423
A waste of time and money.

576
00:31:06,863 --> 00:31:08,342
What are you searching for online?

577
00:31:11,223 --> 00:31:11,863
Director Ruan.

578
00:31:11,863 --> 00:31:12,542
Dr. Qin.

579
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:15,102
The patient in bed three
with atrial myxoma

580
00:31:15,302 --> 00:31:16,022
will be out tomorrow.

581
00:31:16,623 --> 00:31:17,782
You need to sign this.

582
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:19,302
Bed three?

583
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:25,742
Bed three next door.

584
00:31:25,742 --> 00:31:27,143
Yes, he has atrial myxoma too.

585
00:31:27,423 --> 00:31:28,423
Isn't it the same disease?

586
00:31:28,822 --> 00:31:29,383
Yes.

587
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:31,623
He recovered very well.

588
00:31:34,062 --> 00:31:35,062
Did he have the same disease?

589
00:31:35,383 --> 00:31:36,623
D-D-Did he get cured?

590
00:31:36,943 --> 00:31:37,542
It's different.

591
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:39,022
Your symptoms are similar,

592
00:31:39,302 --> 00:31:40,223
but he was a lot sicker.

593
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:42,703
However, after good cooperation
and treatment,

594
00:31:43,143 --> 00:31:43,903
he has recovered well,

595
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,223
and he'll be discharged tomorrow.

596
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:48,183
Yes, judging by this situation,
his recovery has been good.

597
00:31:49,262 --> 00:31:50,223
Even he can be discharged.

598
00:31:50,623 --> 00:31:51,903
Your disease isn't as serious as his.

599
00:31:52,183 --> 00:31:53,542
I just heard you wanna be discharged.

600
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:55,302
I have the time to do it for you.

601
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:56,302
No.

602
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:57,302
I'm considering it.

603
00:31:57,463 --> 00:31:58,223
I'm considering it.

604
00:31:58,782 --> 00:32:00,502
Don't worry about it too much.

605
00:32:00,623 --> 00:32:01,703
Just trust us

606
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:03,342
and cooperate with the treatment.

607
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:04,383
Okay, Director.

608
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:05,143
I will cooperate.

609
00:32:05,302 --> 00:32:05,983
We will cooperate.

610
00:32:06,183 --> 00:32:06,943
I will cooperate.

611
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,183
Take the medicine.

612
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:09,582
Okay, I'll take it now.

613
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:12,463
Thank you, Director, and take care.

614
00:32:14,022 --> 00:32:16,423
Good. "Bed three in the next room".

615
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:17,502
You're quick to learn.

616
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:19,663
I met a patient some time ago

617
00:32:19,943 --> 00:32:21,383
and learned some tricks from her.

618
00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:22,342
Good.

619
00:32:22,663 --> 00:32:23,262
Director,

620
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:24,582
there's something.

621
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:26,262
What is it?

622
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:28,423
Our department
has been so busy recently.

623
00:32:29,062 --> 00:32:30,302
Could we change

624
00:32:30,423 --> 00:32:31,143
the date

625
00:32:31,623 --> 00:32:32,502
for the gathering?

626
00:32:35,342 --> 00:32:37,623
I'm busy next Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday,

627
00:32:37,782 --> 00:32:39,022
and I also have consultations.

628
00:32:39,742 --> 00:32:40,502
I guess I can't.

629
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:42,143
So I was thinking,

630
00:32:42,582 --> 00:32:44,223
why don't we squeeze in a gathering

631
00:32:44,502 --> 00:32:45,502
while all of us

632
00:32:45,742 --> 00:32:46,663
are not very busy?

633
00:32:47,502 --> 00:32:48,143
What is it?

634
00:32:48,903 --> 00:32:50,102
You've got something?

635
00:32:50,863 --> 00:32:51,463
I...

636
00:32:53,143 --> 00:32:53,742
I've got nothing.

637
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:55,062
Nothing?

638
00:32:56,102 --> 00:32:58,502
It seems like
there's something wrong with you.

639
00:32:59,623 --> 00:33:01,582
You look a little off today.

640
00:33:03,863 --> 00:33:04,542
Your hairstyle.

641
00:33:05,302 --> 00:33:07,102
Did you change your hairstyle?

642
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:08,502
Yes.

643
00:33:09,062 --> 00:33:09,582
And...

644
00:33:09,943 --> 00:33:10,502
Let's stop it.

645
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:11,703
I've got work to do.

646
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:17,782
(Piyixia)

647
00:33:17,782 --> 00:33:18,703
- Come on
- Let's drink.

648
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:19,742
- Come on.
- Come on.

649
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:21,623
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

650
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:23,102
Buddies.

651
00:33:24,383 --> 00:33:25,302
Wait.

652
00:33:25,663 --> 00:33:26,703
Let me join you.

653
00:33:26,943 --> 00:33:27,742
- Hai.
- Hai.

654
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:30,623
- Come on.
- Thank you, Hai.

655
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,022
You've worked hard.

656
00:33:32,383 --> 00:33:33,022
You guys drink.

657
00:33:33,143 --> 00:33:33,782
Hai, thanks a lot.

658
00:33:33,782 --> 00:33:34,463
Later.

659
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:37,582
(We're gathering downstairs.)

660
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:38,502
(Everybody, come down.)

661
00:33:38,502 --> 00:33:39,183
(We've arrived.)

662
00:33:39,302 --> 00:33:40,062
(Where are you guys?)

663
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:41,102
(We're on the road.)

664
00:33:41,143 --> 00:33:41,863
(Bad traffic.)

665
00:33:41,863 --> 00:33:42,582
(We might be late.)

666
00:33:42,582 --> 00:33:44,072
Don't get drunk.
We have work tomorrow.

667
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:45,383
Okay. Thank you, Director.

668
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:46,342
Thank you, Director.

669
00:33:46,703 --> 00:33:47,782
You're spending too much.

670
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:49,423
Stop that.

671
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,102
Let's drink.

672
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,143
Which tastes good?

673
00:33:53,143 --> 00:33:53,623
Eat.

674
00:33:53,703 --> 00:33:54,542
Come on, eat.

675
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:55,582
This onion is good.

676
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,824
(See you later.)

677
00:33:59,782 --> 00:34:00,502
Yunsheng,

678
00:34:01,102 --> 00:34:04,022
I'm really happy that you came back.

679
00:34:05,663 --> 00:34:07,703
Your grandfather and your father...

680
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:09,062
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

681
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:10,823
The hospital...

682
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:12,182
Thank you.

683
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:14,622
Anyway, you're back,
and that's good.

684
00:34:15,102 --> 00:34:15,542
Come on.

685
00:34:22,256 --> 00:34:24,444
(See you later. We're here.)

686
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:25,702
Dr. Qin,

687
00:34:26,502 --> 00:34:27,783
let me speak on behalf of the nurses.

688
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:28,823
Welcome back.

689
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:30,102
- Thanks.
- Welcome back.

690
00:34:30,222 --> 00:34:32,983
- Thank you.
- Welcome, Dr. Qin.

691
00:34:34,102 --> 00:34:35,102
Hai, we are here.

692
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:36,263
Hello.

693
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,423
The food can be served.

694
00:34:39,582 --> 00:34:40,343
Dr. Qin.

695
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:41,102
I want this.

696
00:34:41,263 --> 00:34:42,062
You should eat more.

697
00:34:42,423 --> 00:34:43,463
You always eat so little.

698
00:34:43,743 --> 00:34:44,622
I'll pour you another one.

699
00:34:44,823 --> 00:34:45,702
Okay.

700
00:34:55,943 --> 00:34:56,743
It tastes really good.

701
00:34:57,502 --> 00:34:58,102
A buffet, Hai.

702
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:58,943
Serve yourself.

703
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:13,303
Isn't that girl...?

704
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:13,943
Director.

705
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:20,343
(Who is that girl?)

706
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:22,343
(Does anyone know?)

707
00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:22,983
(Tell us.)

708
00:35:23,743 --> 00:35:24,903
(What's their relationship?)

709
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,022
(They seem familiar with each other.)

710
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:27,463
Go there.

711
00:35:27,903 --> 00:35:28,263
Sit there.

712
00:35:29,142 --> 00:35:29,783
Come.

713
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:31,062
I'm coming.

714
00:35:32,142 --> 00:35:32,783
Where is Mingshi?

715
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:34,823
Didn't he say he was in the back?

716
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:47,383
If you're going to gossip,
can you consider

717
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,343
the feelings of the involved one?

718
00:35:49,903 --> 00:35:51,022
You know we're gossiping,

719
00:35:51,102 --> 00:35:52,102
and you're still sitting here?

720
00:35:52,423 --> 00:35:53,022
Go over there.

721
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:55,343
Why should I go to their gathering?

722
00:35:56,383 --> 00:35:56,983
Director.

723
00:36:01,622 --> 00:36:02,823
Yunsheng, here's the thing.

724
00:36:03,502 --> 00:36:04,863
At such a critical time,

725
00:36:05,303 --> 00:36:06,823
you should represent our department

726
00:36:06,943 --> 00:36:07,943
and step up, right?

727
00:36:08,303 --> 00:36:10,622
Go communicate and interact.

728
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:12,582
And there's another thing.

729
00:36:13,622 --> 00:36:14,783
Do some public relations, right?

730
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:15,702
Overcome challenges.

731
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:17,502
- Yes!
- Yes!

732
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:18,702
Dr. Qin,

733
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,182
we're all colleagues.

734
00:36:20,343 --> 00:36:21,662
We see each other every day.

735
00:36:21,702 --> 00:36:22,423
There's no fun here.

736
00:36:22,662 --> 00:36:23,222
You go over

737
00:36:23,463 --> 00:36:24,222
to connect us.

738
00:36:24,343 --> 00:36:25,182
Yunsheng,

739
00:36:26,383 --> 00:36:27,222
back in the days,

740
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:28,783
when your grandfather and your father

741
00:36:28,943 --> 00:36:29,702
entrusted you to me...

742
00:36:29,863 --> 00:36:30,222
Come on.

743
00:36:30,383 --> 00:36:31,303
Let's drink.

744
00:36:31,343 --> 00:36:32,142
Facing this situation,

745
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:33,022
you must rush forward.

746
00:36:33,502 --> 00:36:34,582
Charge to the first place.

747
00:36:35,182 --> 00:36:36,702
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

748
00:36:36,702 --> 00:36:37,383
Dr. Qin,

749
00:36:37,463 --> 00:36:38,702
aren't you not able to come today?

750
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:40,502
We just happen
to be having a party here.

751
00:36:41,622 --> 00:36:42,983
He just missed us, didn't he?

752
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:44,182
Come sit here.

753
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:44,943
Welcome, Dr. Qin.

754
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:45,662
Sit.

755
00:36:45,743 --> 00:36:46,903
Sit beside me.

756
00:36:47,383 --> 00:36:48,102
Sit.

757
00:36:49,182 --> 00:36:50,222
What are the chances?

758
00:36:53,743 --> 00:36:54,383
Ying,

759
00:36:55,182 --> 00:36:56,702
is this seat reserved for me?

760
00:36:57,903 --> 00:36:58,383
Sit.

761
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:00,022
I'll sit.

762
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:01,702
Can you drink this?

763
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:02,142
Sure.

764
00:37:02,142 --> 00:37:02,702
Okay.

765
00:37:03,142 --> 00:37:04,943
Let me propose a toast.

766
00:37:05,502 --> 00:37:06,463
Who would have thought

767
00:37:06,622 --> 00:37:08,062
the rating of this season
would be so high?

768
00:37:08,222 --> 00:37:10,823
As the executive producer,
I won't mention myself.

769
00:37:11,222 --> 00:37:12,102
Each and every one of you

770
00:37:12,303 --> 00:37:13,303
has made a great contribution.

771
00:37:13,463 --> 00:37:14,582
This toast is to you all.

772
00:37:14,863 --> 00:37:15,463
Come on.

773
00:37:15,622 --> 00:37:16,263
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

774
00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:18,062
- Come on.
- Come on.

775
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:18,983
Let's toast to Huixuan.

776
00:37:19,222 --> 00:37:21,463
Thank you, Huixuan.

777
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:24,662
Here are some appetizers.

778
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:25,823
The main dish will be ready soon.

779
00:37:26,303 --> 00:37:27,102
Thank you, Hai.

780
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:33,022
Wait.

781
00:37:33,142 --> 00:37:34,222
You all have worked hard.

782
00:37:34,622 --> 00:37:35,222
Come on.

783
00:37:35,582 --> 00:37:36,662
I'd like a bowl of congee.

784
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:37,303
Sure.

785
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,662
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

786
00:37:38,662 --> 00:37:40,022
- Okay.
- Cheers.

787
00:37:40,582 --> 00:37:40,943
Okay.

788
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:41,783
Okay.

789
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:43,142
Dr. Qin,

790
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:45,423
let me toast to you.

791
00:37:45,983 --> 00:37:47,702
If every owner were like you,

792
00:37:48,062 --> 00:37:49,343
the show would be too easy to produce.

793
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:50,263
No, it was you.

794
00:37:50,383 --> 00:37:51,102
No, I'm flattered.

795
00:37:51,343 --> 00:37:52,182
It's everyone's effort.

796
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:58,783
What's going on with the congee?

797
00:37:59,263 --> 00:38:01,423
It's my treat,
and someone ordered this.

798
00:38:01,662 --> 00:38:02,502
Don't look down on me.

799
00:38:02,943 --> 00:38:03,783
Enjoy yourselves.

800
00:38:04,022 --> 00:38:04,743
Who ordered this?

801
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:07,343
It was me.

802
00:38:09,383 --> 00:38:10,182
A doctor is a doctor.

803
00:38:10,502 --> 00:38:11,022
Did you see it?

804
00:38:11,383 --> 00:38:13,383
It's so good for health, isn't it?

805
00:38:13,662 --> 00:38:14,182
Is this for me?

806
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:15,062
This one.

807
00:38:18,102 --> 00:38:18,622
Thank you.

808
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:25,102
Why don't you interact with him?

809
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:27,743
Look how far away he's seated.

810
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:29,423
How can I interact?

811
00:38:30,582 --> 00:38:32,702
Can you help me figure out a way?

812
00:38:33,823 --> 00:38:34,383
Wait.

813
00:38:35,463 --> 00:38:36,142
Rui,

814
00:38:36,702 --> 00:38:38,502
give me the camera.

815
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:40,783
Haven't we finished shooting?

816
00:38:40,983 --> 00:38:42,622
Let's film some
behind-the-scenes footage now.

817
00:38:42,983 --> 00:38:43,383
BTS?

818
00:38:43,743 --> 00:38:44,943
That is a great idea.

819
00:38:45,743 --> 00:38:47,022
Huixuan, your brain really works fast.

820
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:47,823
Dr. Qin,

821
00:38:48,582 --> 00:38:49,343
you sit here.

822
00:38:49,903 --> 00:38:50,903
Let me film BTS for you.

823
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:52,303
Alright.

824
00:38:52,502 --> 00:38:53,823
You have lots of unique ideas.

825
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:55,142
Come on.

826
00:38:58,263 --> 00:38:59,383
Get closer.

827
00:38:59,582 --> 00:39:00,582
I can't capture both of you.

828
00:39:00,943 --> 00:39:01,702
Don't be shy.

829
00:39:02,142 --> 00:39:02,502
Come on.

830
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:05,983
Dr. Qin,

831
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:08,062
do you have anything

832
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:09,823
to complain about the designer?

833
00:39:15,582 --> 00:39:16,903
Su Ying

834
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:19,702
is a very perfect designer.

835
00:39:20,823 --> 00:39:22,582
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

836
00:39:23,743 --> 00:39:25,743
The only flaw
is that she doesn't follow...

837
00:39:29,343 --> 00:39:29,903
Doctors' orders.

838
00:39:30,263 --> 00:39:31,182
Against the doctor.

839
00:39:31,463 --> 00:39:32,582
She's not a good girl.

840
00:39:33,423 --> 00:39:34,062
Listen to him.

841
00:39:36,182 --> 00:39:37,542
I'd like to ask you, Miss Su.

842
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,502
Do you have anything
you'd like to rebut?

843
00:39:40,062 --> 00:39:41,383
Dr. Qin is great in every aspect,

844
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:42,502
but he has one flaw.

845
00:39:42,622 --> 00:39:43,423
That is,

846
00:39:44,303 --> 00:39:45,383
he doesn't smile enough.

847
00:39:45,943 --> 00:39:46,702
Not enough smiles.

848
00:39:46,743 --> 00:39:51,423
- Smile.
- Smile.

849
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:52,102
Dr. Qin,

850
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:53,102
your smile is quite stiff.

851
00:39:53,343 --> 00:39:54,502
Don't make him do it.

852
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:56,182
Come on.

853
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:56,823
Let's drink.

854
00:39:56,823 --> 00:39:57,383
Mr. Liu,

855
00:39:57,743 --> 00:39:59,062
it's your turn now.

856
00:39:59,622 --> 00:40:00,622
- Even I...
- Who do you think

857
00:40:00,783 --> 00:40:02,263
we should credit primarily

858
00:40:02,423 --> 00:40:03,062
for the big success

859
00:40:03,263 --> 00:40:04,463
of this season?

860
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:05,743
It's definitely Miss Du.

861
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:06,743
It's definitely me.

862
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:09,062
Thanks.

863
00:40:11,263 --> 00:40:11,702
Come on.

864
00:40:11,823 --> 00:40:12,622
Wait.

865
00:40:13,783 --> 00:40:14,423
Let me tell you.

866
00:40:14,743 --> 00:40:15,343
I think

867
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:17,823
I must toast

868
00:40:18,022 --> 00:40:18,903
to Miss Su.

869
00:40:20,062 --> 00:40:21,943
She is the lucky charm of our show.

870
00:40:22,102 --> 00:40:22,662
Look how high

871
00:40:22,743 --> 00:40:24,062
our rating is with you.

872
00:40:24,142 --> 00:40:25,502
I must toast to you.

873
00:40:26,303 --> 00:40:26,903
Thank you.

874
00:40:27,222 --> 00:40:27,702
Stop.

875
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:28,622
What do you mean?

876
00:40:28,783 --> 00:40:29,662
How can you drink water?

877
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:30,542
It must be beer.

878
00:40:30,542 --> 00:40:31,343
It's a celebration.

879
00:40:31,582 --> 00:40:32,263
I am...

880
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:33,463
I'm not feeling well today.

881
00:40:33,863 --> 00:40:35,383
That's an excuse.

882
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:36,383
Mr. Liu,

883
00:40:36,582 --> 00:40:37,743
her stomach is really upset.

884
00:40:37,743 --> 00:40:38,783
She was absent from a meeting.

885
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:39,582
Do you remember it?

886
00:40:39,662 --> 00:40:40,222
I do.

887
00:40:40,662 --> 00:40:42,903
But I don't care about that.
I have three hypers and I drink.

888
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:45,783
-Come on. Switch. Take it.
- I am really... I take medicine.

889
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:47,783
Mr. Liu, I'll toast to you.

890
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:50,622
Thank you for
making my glass house so beautiful.

891
00:40:50,863 --> 00:40:51,702
It's everyone's credit.

892
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:52,662

Okay. Take me over there.
