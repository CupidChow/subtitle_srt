We were just playing a game.

Don't mind it.

38
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,300
We were having so much fun.

39
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:11,341
Your coworkers are really cute.

40
00:03:13,221 --> 00:03:15,277
Yes, they are really cute.

41
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:17,229
You are cute as well.

42
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,420
But I didn't expect

43
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,101
that you came here too.

44
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,709
What a coincidence.

45
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:30,957
Yeah.

46
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:32,237
What a coincidence.

47
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:43,300
How time flies.

48
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:47,661
We finished the program.

49
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,789
Yeah.

50
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:53,229
We finished recording.

51
00:03:57,381 --> 00:03:58,285
In the future...

52
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,101
If there is any problem
with the glass house,

53
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:02,221
you can come to me,
without going through the show team.

54
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,861
Okay.

55
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,900
SU Design Firm
offers you a lifetime warranty.

56
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,181
Thank you.

57
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,901
Why do you thank me again?

58
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,221
- Rock, paper, scissors.

64
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:00,781
Alright. Alright.

65
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:01,661
Du Huixuan.

66
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,661
I will toast you properly.

67
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,620
You are good at everything,

68
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,940
but you are just stubborn.

69
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:12,740
You don't follow instructions.

70
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:14,221
Mr. Liu.

71
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,101
You are the same.

72
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:19,180
The promotional video.

73
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,581
You edited it

74
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:22,981
without my consent

75
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:24,541
and were even going to replace my guest.

76
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:27,021
Nonsense. I did that for the show.

77
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,940
I'm telling you.
If it wasn't for my persistence,

78
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,101
would this season
have been so successful?

79
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,141
Who? Who persisted?

80
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:34,541
Tell me.

81
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,740
- Alright.
- Who was persisting?

82
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,620
Stop arguing.

83
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,141
Listen.

84
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:38,461
Stop talking.

85
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:39,581
Listen to me.

86
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:40,461
Listen to me.

87
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,661
Let's play games like them.

88
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:46,180
- Play games.
- I like playing games.

89
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,260
Okay. I can do it.

90
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,872
I will play with Mr. Liu.

91
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:49,781
Come on.

92
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:51,701
If you lose,
you'll get a slap in the face.

93
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:52,620
Not a big deal.

94
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,260
- Come on.
- It's not certain who will lose.

95
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,240
Mingshi, don't interfere.

96
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,180
No one knows who will lose.

97
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:58,101
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

98
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,701
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

99
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:02,029
This is...

100
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,661
Rock, paper, scissors.

101
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,300
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

102
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:21,741
Mr. Liu,

103
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,221
why am I so dizzy?

104
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:25,645
Me too.

105
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,093
I'm sorry, Mr. Liu.
She is drunk. Please excuse her.

106
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:31,740
Hold on. I have to play the game.

107
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,877
Sorry.

108
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,300
I am sorry.

109
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,141
Let's go.

110
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,781
Did I win the last turn?

111
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,581
It doesn't matter.
Come on. Rock, paper, scissors.

112
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:44,589
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

113
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,605
It's okay.

114
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:48,260
I'm happy today.

115
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:49,701
I drank a couple more glasses.

116
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,500
Do you know why I'm so happy today?

117
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,677
Why?

118
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,940
Because I've been making House Design

119
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,677
for six years.

120
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,701
How much effort
have I put into it these six years?

121
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:06,021
Many people said
we couldn't continue with House Design.

122
00:07:06,461 --> 00:07:08,380
But not only did I make it...

123
00:07:08,581 --> 00:07:09,860
I persisted in doing it.

124
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:12,940
This season, I made it outstanding.

125
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,701
Yes.

126
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:17,781
I think you are the best director
I have ever seen.

127
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,060
Alright. Stop brown-nosing.

128
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,940
Today is about identifying my flaws.

129
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,260
Flaws?

130
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,300
But I don't think you have any flaws.

131
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:30,141
Don't worry.

132
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:32,981
I'm in a good mood today,
so I won't beat you.

133
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,740
I won't hit you.

134
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,789
It hurts.

135
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:39,380
If I have to say,

136
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,781
I think you are too competitive.

137
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,180
And you are a workaholic.

138
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,260
You could try to

139
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,021
date someone.

140
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:48,060
Date?

141
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,341
How many times have you been
in a relationship, you little one?

142
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,740
You teach me how to date?

143
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,333
Me?

144
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,181
Does a crush count?

145
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:00,701
Of course not.

146
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,820
If you like someone,
you should say it out.

147
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,661
Only when you express it,
can it be love.

148
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,173
So, can I say it?

149
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,181
Say it.

150
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,117
Huixuan.

151
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,125
I like you.

152
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,620
I have liked you for a long time.

153
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,069
Mingshi,

154
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,941
you surely are a good employee
Ying has trained.

155
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:43,101
You are a fast learner.

156
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:45,341
That's what you should do.

157
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:48,101
Be brave. I support you.

158
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:50,500
Be more specific.

159
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:52,269
Specific.

160
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,317
I...

161
00:08:58,941 --> 00:08:59,789
I...

162
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:04,653
Huixuan.

163
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,780
I...

164
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,540
Actually,

165
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,540
I've liked you for a long time.

166
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,620
You're awake.

167
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,533
Get out of my bed.

168
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,461
How come you're in my house?
How did you end up in my bed?

169
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,380
You drank too much last night.

170
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:35,740
And then I sent you home.

171
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:36,900
You sent me home?

172
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,509
Then...

173
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:40,461
What about my clothes?

174
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,620
Your clothes got wet last night.

175
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:45,740
So I helped you...

176
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,021
You helped me?

177
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:53,981
Zero.

178
00:10:57,101 --> 00:10:58,101
Eight.

179
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:01,780
Three.

180
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:03,301
The passcode is your birthday.

181
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:05,981
Wait. Why can't I unlock it?

182
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:07,181
I know. I'll unlock it.

183
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:08,540
You don't know.

184
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:10,093
I know.

185
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,421
What?

186
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,357
0823. Your birthday, right?

187
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,701
It's unlocked.

188
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:16,620
There you go.

189
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,581
You really know
the password to my place.

190
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,941
Why do you know
my home's password?

191
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:25,900
Explain this to me clearly.

192
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,421
Xu Mingshi!

193
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,645
It's your birthday. 0823.

194
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,941
Are you thirsty?

195
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,101
I'm so thirsty.

196
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:33,461
No. I must drink water.

197
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,461
Let me pour you some water.
Don't drink this.

198
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,328
You...

199
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,512
What is it?

200
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,669
How to open it?

201
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,549
I'll get you a towel.

202
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,020
So wet.

203
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,500
No. I need to change my clothes.

204
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,813
Huixuan.

205
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:08,109
Huixuan.

206
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:13,965
Huixuan.

207
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,909
Drink some honey water.
Or you'll have a headache.

208
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:21,357
Easy.

209
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,020
Did you say something to me last night?

210
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:32,141
You still remember it?

211
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,660
Yes.

212
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,260
We were at the beach.

213
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,260
Just the two of us.

214
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:40,493
Right.

215
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:42,380
You told me a lot.

216
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,061
It seemed quite important.

217
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:46,285
What was it?

218
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,301
You don't remember what I said?

219
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,500
Never mind. It's okay
if you don't remember.

220
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,740
It's nothing important.

221
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,020
Drink the honey water.

222
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,780
I have things to do, so I'll leave now.

223
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,581
Stay for breakfast?

224
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,860
I'm not hungry. I will pass.

225
00:14:07,341 --> 00:14:08,421
Have a rest.

226
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,573
Bye, Huixuan.

227
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:11,565
Bye.

228
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,061
(Zhang Yisen)
(Every day I wake up with a sore back.)

229
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,500
(Is it because I'm getting old?)

230
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:05,965
(Su Ying)
(Dr. Zhang,)

231
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,900
(is the back and waist pain
due to your mattress?)

232
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,380
(Zhang Yisen)
(Really?)

233
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,780
(Our dormitory has uniform mattresses.)

234
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,301
(No one else complained about it.)

235
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,221
(Su Ying)
(Physical conditions are different.)

236
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,101
(I know many mattress brands.)

237
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,540
(Maybe I can help you with this.)

238
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,620
(Zhang Yisen)
(Great.)

239
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,153
(Su Ying)
(When do you have time off?)

240
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:32,205
(You could go take a look.)

241
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,540
(Zhang Yisen)
(I'll be on duty for two days.)

242
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,540
(I can go the day after that.)

243
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:39,860
(Su Ying)
(Okay. Get in touch then.)

244
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:54,251
(Su Ying)
(Will you be free the day after tomorrow?)

245
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,500
(Zhang Yisen wants to
change his mattress,)

246
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,020
(but he doesn't have the time.)

247
00:15:58,701 --> 00:15:59,981
(How about we go help him look?)

248
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,081
(Qin Yunsheng)
(I can do it tomorrow.)

249
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:21,020
He's been sitting there
for over an hour.

250
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,061
Something's not right with Mingshi.

251
00:16:26,981 --> 00:16:27,821
She totally forgot?

252
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,581
It couldn't be.

253
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,829
She blacked out?

254
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:40,020
I was too impulsive.

255
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,660
Mingshi, are you alright?

256
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:47,421
What if she remembers it later?

257
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,461
Who remembers?

258
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,821
No. I have to figure it out.

259
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:53,900
Otherwise, it will be awkward.

260
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,821
What do you need to figure out?

261
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,140
Mainly, she was in bed...

262
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,421
- In bed?
- In bed?

263
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:01,860
- Who's in bed?
- Who's in bed?

264
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:05,837
None of your business.

265
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,693
Get back to work.

266
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:10,348
(Huixuan)

267
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:11,580
Huixuan.

268
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,820
Where is she? Huixuan?

269
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,500
On the phone, Mingshi.

270
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,589
Here.

271
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:26,829
Hello, Huixuan.

272
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,901
Last night...

273
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,181
Where did I put my bag?

274
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:44,820
I think the bag is near the sofa.
You can take a look.

275
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,621
I didn't see it on the sofa.

276
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:50,413
Weird.

277
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:54,260
It's on the sofa indeed.

278
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:57,141
You were drunk last night.

279
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,340
You might put it casually.

280
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,981
Alright. That's all. Bye.

281
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:02,829
Okay. Bye, Huixuan.

282
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,157
Doesn't remember anything?

283
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:14,701
Right.

284
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:15,941
She probably doesn't remember at all.

285
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,141
What was he saying?

286
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:21,037
I don't know.

287
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:29,580
I really like the mattresses here.
Its quality is very good.

288
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,540
And the materials used
are all the most advanced.

289
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:33,069
You can take a look.

290
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,580
Do you usually prefer a softer mattress

291
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,141
or a harder one?

292
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,221
Either one is okay, I guess.

293
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,661
Okay. I'll help you.

294
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,141
Hello, we'd like to pick a mattress.

295
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,020
This mattress is
neither too hard nor too soft.

296
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:45,020
The resilience is good.

297
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,260
You can sit down and feel it.

298
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,500
Try it.

299
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,485
Okay.

300
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,125
Not bad.

301
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,757
How thick is this one?

302
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:56,717
It's twenty centimeters.

303
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:57,741
Twenty centimeters.

304
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,221
This mattress

305
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,820
uses independent pocket springs.

306
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:01,861
It's comfortable.

307
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:03,340
You could lie down and feel it.

308
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:41,941
It's not bad indeed.

309
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:44,740
I didn't feel you turning over just now.

310
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,965
Really?

311
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:47,821
Well.

312
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:50,925
Do you have pillows?

313
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:51,540
Yes.

314
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,461
We'll check the pillows.

315
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:53,861
Please wait. I will get them for you.

316
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:55,245
Okay. Bring a few models.

317
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:58,421
Pillow also affects sleep quality.

318
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:01,340
Do you usually use
a high pillow or a low one?

319
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:02,941
We'll listen to you.

320
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:05,060
Fine. Follow my advice.

321
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:07,421
I'll send a message to Dr. Zhang.

322
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,869
Okay.

323
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:12,861
His cervical spine is not good,
so I have to choose

324
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,100
a slightly harder mattress for him.

325
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:29,701
Excuse me, are you Mr. Zhang?

326
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,661
To deliver the mattress?

327
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:34,181
Yes.

328
00:20:34,181 --> 00:20:35,060
Miss Su sent you here?

329
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,260
Right.

330
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,221
She's a top designer indeed.

331
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,701
Her work efficiency is fast.

332
00:20:39,976 --> 00:20:40,820
Do I need to sign?

333
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,100
Yes.

334
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,997
Here.

335
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,981
Thank you all.

336
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,901
I only ordered one mattress.

337
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,580
The other is for Mr. Qin Yunsheng.

338
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:51,853
Qin...

339
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:53,901
You ordered a mattress?

340
00:20:53,901 --> 00:20:54,765
I didn't.

341
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:56,181
Look. There are two.

342
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:01,221
You're Mr. Qin Yunsheng, right?

343
00:21:01,621 --> 00:21:02,500
I am.

344
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,813
Miss Su Ying ordered it for you.
Please sign for it.

345
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,060
This new mattress is really comfortable.

346
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,780
Yunsheng, Miss Su is really nice.

347
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:18,421
She loves life and is considerate.

348
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,580
This is the pillow you ordered.

349
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:31,740
These are the pillows
ordered by Mr. Qin.

350
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:33,837
Thank you.

351
00:21:36,181 --> 00:21:37,133
Goodbye.

352
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:38,413
Thank you.

353
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:40,941
Look. Miss Su is so thoughtful.

354
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,157
She thinks so thoroughly.

355
00:21:49,381 --> 00:21:50,621
Why do you have two pillows?

356
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,461
That's a natural thing.

357
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,221
Then why do I only have one?

358
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:55,981
Maybe she thought you didn't need two.

359
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,485
Then you need two?

360
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:00,973
I sleep on one and lean on the other.

361
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,060
You're really carefree, aren't you?

362
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,181
Listen, when a girl
sends you these things,

363
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:06,317
you have to be careful.

364
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:07,621
You understand again.

365
00:22:07,621 --> 00:22:08,981
Of course, I get it.

366
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,941
New mattress and new pillows.

367
00:22:12,661 --> 00:22:15,020
It takes 100 years of good prayers
to share the same boat.

368
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,141
It takes 1,000 years to?

369
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,381
To share a pillow.

370
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:18,820
See? So obvious.

371
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,701
I think Miss Su is quite nice.

372
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:21,805
You might as well accept it.

373
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:22,893
Are you overthinking?

374
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:26,797
Buy two, get one free.

375
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:29,421
On pillows?

376
00:22:29,701 --> 00:22:30,740
I should have bought two.

377
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,156
(Gift)

378
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:36,580
Gift?

379
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,941
So, I'm the "one"?

380
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:40,060
So, I'm the two, then?

381
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:43,901
I've become a gift
and you still bully me.

382
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:45,461
I'll send a message to my Bai.

383
00:22:46,621 --> 00:22:48,589
Is she up? Did you forget
the time difference?

384
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,213
My love knows no time difference.

385
00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:56,461
Bai, Qin Yunsheng is really...

386
00:22:58,381 --> 00:22:59,500
I am so pissed off.

387
00:23:22,956 --> 00:23:25,708
(Qin Yunsheng: Pillows
and mattress arrived. Thank you.)

388
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,820
(Pillows and mattress arrived.)

389
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,437
(Thank you.)

390
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,300
Who's it? Makes you so elated?

391
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:52,685
Nothing.

392
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:01,740
What's wrong with you?
Not feeling well?

393
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,381
Perhaps I drank too much that day.

394
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:06,100
I've had a headache till now.

395
00:24:10,141 --> 00:24:12,580
Do you know what I did

396
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,780
after I drank too much that day?

397
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,500
Don't you remember?

398
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,701
You don't remember at all?

399
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,500
You did a lot of things that night.

400
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:25,389
What did I do?

401
00:24:25,661 --> 00:24:26,740
Ye told me everything.

402
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,701
You played games.

403
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,605
Games.

404
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,293
What games did I play?

405
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:42,100
I'm done for. I have to rush back
to the company immediately.

406
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:43,861
I'm in trouble!

407
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:51,309
Take a look.

408
00:24:51,701 --> 00:24:53,461
Take a careful look.
What do you think?

409
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:55,981
A first-line sea-view apartment.

410
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:57,421
Very catchy.

411
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:01,981
Mr. Liu, if you don't want me to come,

412
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,060
you can tell me directly.

413
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,421
There's no need
to give me such a project.

414
00:25:06,701 --> 00:25:08,020
Two kilometers from the coastline.

415
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:09,500
And two compounds in between.

416
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:11,260
But he wants to see first-line sea view.

417
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:13,340
What you are looking for is a magician,

418
00:25:13,861 --> 00:25:14,981
not a designer.

419
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,540
Mr. Su, I think this case is...

420
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:24,461
You don't get it. The audience rating

421
00:25:24,861 --> 00:25:25,861
is directly proportional

422
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:28,181
to the owner's absurdity.

423
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:31,885
The harder the project,
the more the audience loves to watch.

424
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,941
Also, you should mull it over.

425
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:38,901
So many people
are lining up to join my projects.

426
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:41,325
I'm keeping the opportunity to help you.

427
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,100
Mr. Liu, are you having a meeting?

428
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,709
Am I late?

429
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,957
Why are you here?

430
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,981
I wanted to check if there's anything

431
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:58,300
I can help with.

432
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,525
No, thanks.

433
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,621
Mr. Su,

434
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:05,381
I think I've given you
all the necessary information.

435
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:06,941
If you have any questions,

436
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,981
we can contact online. Okay?

437
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:12,020
Think about what I just told you.

438
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,317
Okay. I'll consider it.

439
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:15,309
Okay, then.

440
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:17,901
Let's go.

441
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:18,797
Okay.

442
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,701
Are you bothered by
the sea-view apartment case?

443
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:36,421
If you have a new house,

444
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:37,981
I'll change the sea-view one now.

445
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:41,381
What about Su Ziyang?

446
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,445
Isn't he your friend?

447
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:44,141
Don't always count on me.

448
00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:46,580
You have many friends too.

449
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:51,421
Su Ying is not bad.

450
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,285
After the glass house case was aired,

451
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:55,661
the reaction was good.

452
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,661
There were even sponsors
who specifically asked her to continue.

453
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:00,701
Su Ying can't do it, Mr. Liu.

454
00:27:00,981 --> 00:27:02,421
Su Ying only agreed to
record one episode.

455
00:27:06,981 --> 00:27:07,861
These days,

456
00:27:08,381 --> 00:27:10,701
the left side of my cheeks was painful.

457
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:13,141
I can't even bite food.

458
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:15,381
I don't know if it will affect

459
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:16,461
my life in the future.

460
00:27:17,661 --> 00:27:18,661
Even drinking water is hard.

461
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,540
Then, I'll go talk to her.

462
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,029
That's great.

463
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,861
I'll leave now.

464
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,981
What? Record House Design again?

465
00:27:44,421 --> 00:27:45,901
Impossible. No way.

466
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:47,221
No. No.

467
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,461
Just have a meeting with the owner.

468
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:50,901
Just act out a meeting.

469
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:52,661
If the owner doesn't like you,

470
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:53,861
Mr. Liu can't do anything.

471
00:27:56,901 --> 00:27:57,861
(Did she)

472
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,300
(remember the confession?)

473
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,500
No way.

474
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,981
Please, don't mess with me. No.

475
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:09,069
Please. Please. I beg you.

476
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,245
Just a meeting.

477
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:13,421
Just act out a meeting.

478
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,461
I don't want you
to take over that project.

479
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:25,293
Excuse me.

480
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,381
I have to talk to you.

481
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,260
To whom?

482
00:28:30,941 --> 00:28:31,853
You.

483
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:35,085
I...

484
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,061
I like...

485
00:28:42,461 --> 00:28:43,981
I-I want to say...

486
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,500
You've been chatting for so long.
You must be hungry.

487
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:49,340
Are you hungry, Huixuan?

488
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,053
H-Have an apple.

489
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,885
No.

490
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,221
T-This side.

491
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,229
I have other work to do.
I will leave you.

492
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:20,780
What is going on here?

493
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,389
Where is the house owner?

494
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,300
What's the time?

495
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,141
Look at the time.

496
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:46,765
How did you inform him?

497
00:29:46,941 --> 00:29:49,020
The owner comes from Donglin.
It's a long journey.

498
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,701
The long-distance bus
broke down on the way,

499
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,069
which caused some delay.

500
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,221
Long-distance bus.

501
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,861
I remember he has a car.

502
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:57,233
And no car restrictions today.

503
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:00,540
He wanted to save some fuel costs.

504
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,552
(Meticulously planned, Mr. Wang)

505
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:06,461
We all are waiting for him.

506
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,037
Look.

507
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:11,381
You are wasting everyone's time.

508
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,181
I can't control if the bus breaks down.

509
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,260
My apologies. I'm sorry.

510
00:30:20,421 --> 00:30:21,421
- Mr. Wang.
- Come on in.

511
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,701
I'm sorry I'm late.

512
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,909
It doesn't matter at all.

513
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,580
You must have had a hard journey.

514
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,861
This is the house owner.

515
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,421
Mr. Wang Zili.

516
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,820
Please sit down.

517
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:33,837
I will introduce the two designers to you.

518
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:36,589
This one here is Miss Su Ying.

519
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:38,285
Nice to meet you.

520
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,540
You too.

521
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:39,861
Sorry.

522
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,181
And this is Mr. Su Ziyang.

523
00:30:42,181 --> 00:30:43,981
He is an outstanding designer,

524
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,421
who is able to meet
all the needs of the house owners.

525
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:48,589
Nice to meet you.

526
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,981
Mr. Liu, he doesn't talk much, does he?

527
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,300
He's competent,
boasting ideas and a sharp eye.

528
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,300
So today, actually...

529
00:30:58,461 --> 00:30:59,981
Today is our first meeting.

530
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:02,024
The two designers

531
00:31:02,024 --> 00:31:04,141
will elaborate their plans to you.

532
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,141
And then you compare their plans.

533
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:08,100
Choose the one you like,

534
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,901
and make a deal.

535
00:31:10,141 --> 00:31:11,021
Mr. Liu.

536
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,540
Two designers?

537
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,941
Do you have any concerns?

538
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:17,661
Let's put it this way.
Am I paying for one job,

539
00:31:17,901 --> 00:31:18,797
or am I paying for two?

540
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:20,813
You can rest assured.

541
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:22,181
In the end, you will select one

542
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,381
from the two designers.

543
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,933
A choice between the two.

544
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:26,661
Right.

545
00:31:26,661 --> 00:31:27,740
Choose the best one.

546
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:28,780
You don't have to worry.

547
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:30,580
Then I understand. Thank you.

548
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,780
(Stingy)
Next, we can start.

549
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,685
Mr. Su, you go first.

550
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,965
Alright.

551
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,861
We are very interested in your house,

552
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:44,421
so we have carefully prepared
detailed introduction materials.

553
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:45,837
Mei.

554
00:31:49,181 --> 00:31:50,141
Mr. Wang,

555
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,901
I'll give you a brief introduction.

556
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,461
Yangfan Studio

557
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:55,421
is a top design team in the country.

558
00:31:55,701 --> 00:31:58,181
We are committed to creating
unique interior environments.

559
00:31:58,941 --> 00:32:00,861
These are some of
our past residential cases.

560
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,141
You can take a look.

561
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,100
Like this one. 182 square meters.

562
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,381
Luxury residence in heavy metal style.

563
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,421
And this one.

564
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,701
This one is a large apartment.

565
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:13,820
We chose a post-modern
and light luxury style.

566
00:32:14,421 --> 00:32:15,621
Now, this kind of style

567
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:17,181
is very popular among young people.

568
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,020
Of course, not only

569
00:32:19,181 --> 00:32:20,580
the diversity of styles,

570
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,141
we are also better
at the use of materials.

571
00:32:23,381 --> 00:32:25,141
For your first-line sea-view apartment,

572
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,861
our preliminary design idea

573
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:28,580
is to use new metal,

574
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:30,901
the latest technology, nano materials.

575
00:32:31,381 --> 00:32:32,301
New technology.

576
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,740
This is its effect.

577
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,941
Mr. Wang, how do you feel?
Are you satisfied?

578
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:43,277
Good. I think it's really good.

579
00:32:43,277 --> 00:32:44,181
Really?

580
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:46,792
But it might be an expensive project.

581
00:32:47,752 --> 00:32:48,100
Well.

582
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,941
How about this?

583
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,421
I'd like to hear
the other designer's thoughts.

584
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:52,845
No problem.

585
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,093
You'll be satisfied.

586
00:32:54,421 --> 00:32:55,780
All right then.

587
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:58,221
Next, let's welcome Miss Su.

588
00:33:01,901 --> 00:33:02,797
Mr. Wang.

589
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:07,621
My greatest strength

590
00:33:12,221 --> 00:33:13,165
is low price.

591
00:33:14,381 --> 00:33:15,300
House Design is in S6 now.

592
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:17,773
The changes to the glass house
I refitted were small.

593
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:19,381
But the result is good
and the cost is low.

594
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:22,701
It spent the lowest cost
in the history of House Design.

595
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,340
What do you think, Mr. Wang?

596
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,901
That's a good idea.

597
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:29,020
This is Miss Su?

598
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,461
Right.

599
00:33:29,461 --> 00:33:30,349
Miss Su.

600
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,661
I agree with your idea.

601
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,820
High performance but affordable.

602
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,272
I like it.

603
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:36,300
Both effective and cheap.

604
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:37,581
Why refuse it?

605
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:39,861
As long as you are satisfied, Mr. Wang.

606
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,661
I am satisfied.

607
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:42,661
Satisfied. Thank you.

608
00:33:42,861 --> 00:33:44,060
Please have a seat.

609
00:33:46,661 --> 00:33:48,381
By the way, Mr. Liu.

610
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:50,661
I have something to say to you.

611
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:51,701
No problem. Go ahead.

612
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,389
Well.

613
00:33:58,284 --> 00:33:59,901
(Travel expense receipt)

614
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:01,320
This is the travel expense.

615
00:34:01,661 --> 00:34:03,901
Can you reimburse it?

616
00:34:11,461 --> 00:34:12,341
My dear girl.

617
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,941
I only asked you
to play along, didn't I?

618
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,341
You were taking it so seriously.

619
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
You wanted me to watch
Peter Liu and Su Ziyang

620
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,060
bullying you like that.

621
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,220
If I weren't on this show,

622
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:24,020
you wouldn't be meaningful.

623
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:27,437
Since I was able to build
a glass house for Qin Yunsheng,

624
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,941
I can build you a sea-view apartment.

625
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,981
You have no idea
what "first-line view" means

626
00:34:33,301 --> 00:34:34,901
in this case.

627
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,973
What do you mean?

628
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,821
The "view" you're talking about

629
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,620
is a vertical one, not horizontal?

630
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,989
Exactly.

631
00:34:56,741 --> 00:34:58,100
What does the owner want again?

632
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:00,220
He wants

633
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,580
to turn the vertical "sea view"

634
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,381
into a horizontal one.

635
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:09,700
Wang Zili put forward the request?

636
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,781
It's something he would do.

637
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,660
So I asked you to act along.

638
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,405
So, I...

639
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,557
A complete bomb.

640
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,989
A bomb?

641
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:25,301
What do we do now?

642
00:35:25,301 --> 00:35:26,700
Now the homeowner prefers you.

643
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:28,580
You must carry on filming for this show.

644
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,861
You now have only two options.

645
00:35:30,301 --> 00:35:31,580
Either at the proposal meeting,

646
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:33,700
you lose to Su Ziyang
and get eliminated.

647
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,540
Or you beat him
and continue to stay on the show.

648
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:37,861
But if you can't complete

649
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:40,060
this ridiculous project later,

650
00:35:40,941 --> 00:35:41,901
you will be mocked.

651
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,100
The opening could be a little shorter.

652
00:35:57,941 --> 00:35:58,797
Alright.

653
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,365
Wait. Rewind a bit.

654
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,605
Did you shoot this?

655
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,525
Well done.

656
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:14,189
Zoom in

657
00:36:14,981 --> 00:36:15,885
and make it the opening.

658
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,421
Are you sure, Mr. Liu?

659
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,580
Am I sure?

660
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:21,941
Do you know what I saw?

661
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:25,100
I saw the rating soaring.

662
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:37,357
You alright?

663
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:39,140
No.

664
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:42,301
I've severely warned
the show team already.

665
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,741
They are not allowed to
spread your kissing video.

666
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:46,261
Kissing video?

667
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,885
What kissing video?

668
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,461
Did something good happen?

669
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:55,060
So you were not mad about this just now?

670
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,660
I'm angry about the plan Chen made.

671
00:36:58,941 --> 00:37:00,861
The sea-view apartment case
is really hard.

672
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:02,421
Where is the video?

673
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,861
In the homeowners' group chat.

674
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,781
At the celebration the other day,

675
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,500
you were playing a game
with Qin Yunsheng.

676
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:08,781
Someone recorded it.

677
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,140
But I don't know who sent it
to the homeowners' group chat.

678
00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:13,620
So boring.

679
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,981
Let me check.

680
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:25,781
Are you alright?

681
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,180
Why would anyone
shoot me from this angle?

682
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:30,020
My face is distorted.

683
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,781
I didn't look like that.

684
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:37,861
Excuse me.

685
00:37:38,741 --> 00:37:39,741
Aren't you afraid

686
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,161
after the next homeowner

687
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:42,261
sees a video like that,

688
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,941
he will question your professionalism?

689
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:46,700
Why would I?

690
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:51,140
I am a designer
who devotes my life to my work.

691
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,981
I put so much effort into designing.

692
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:54,421
Once clients see my work,

693
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,700
they will shut their mouths.

694
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:59,620
Furthermore, Mr. Wang
doesn't really care about these things.

695
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:01,500
He only cares about the budget.

696
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,901
As long as that's what you think.

697
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,180
I was worried it might affect your mood.

698
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,429
What's the matter again?

699
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,421
This video was sent to
the homeowners' group chat.

700
00:38:17,781 --> 00:38:19,261
It means he saw it as well.

701
00:38:20,301 --> 00:38:21,261
He...

702
00:38:21,981 --> 00:38:24,397
Should have seen it.

703
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,844
(Qin Yunsheng)
(The new mattress improved your sleep?)

704
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,501
That's not right.

705
00:38:37,261 --> 00:38:38,981
He would have a response
if he had seen the video.

706
00:38:39,381 --> 00:38:40,741
Why didn't he reply to my messages?

707
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,117
Why?

708
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:45,261
Why didn't he reply to my messages?

709
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,741
He must have checked his phone.

710
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,317
He can't leave
his phone alone for so long.

711
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,140
Do you have signals?

712
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,981
- Yes.
- Yes.

713
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,020
Can you receive messages?

714
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:13,645
- Yes.
- Yes.

715
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,981
I'm getting a fake signal?

716
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:19,261
Why didn't he reply to my messages?

717
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:24,660
The budget for Mr. Wang's
sea-view apartment is ready.

718
00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:25,901
Do you want to take a look?

719
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:30,020
Control the budget.

720
00:39:30,821 --> 00:39:32,700
The glass factory
sent the glass specification.

721
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:33,933
Do you want to take a look?

722
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,020
I'll check it later.

723
00:39:37,821 --> 00:39:39,060
There's something wrong with WeChat.

724
00:39:39,981 --> 00:39:42,180
Meichi Hospital called.

725
00:39:42,261 --> 00:39:43,700
They wanted you
for a stomach recheck.

726
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,540
Are you going?

727
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,477
No, I'm not going.

728
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,861
I'll tell the hospital.

729
00:39:49,861 --> 00:39:50,733
Wait a minute.

730
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:52,301
Meichi Hospital?

731
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,592
I'll go.

732
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:58,421
Rechecking is a serious matter.
I have to go in person.

733
00:39:58,821 --> 00:40:00,381
I should heed the doctor's advice.

734
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:01,869
- Yes.
- Yes.

735
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,700
Chen, control the budget.

736
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:08,077
What's most important? Affordability.

737
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:09,869
The plan is good.

738
00:40:10,861 --> 00:40:11,725
You.

739
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:13,381
Well done.

740
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,981
Me. Well done.

741
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,152
Me too.

742
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:20,301
- You. Keep it up.
- You. Keep it up.

743
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,061
Dr. Zhang.

744
00:40:35,861 --> 00:40:38,060
Miss Su, you can call me Yisen.

745
00:40:38,421 --> 00:40:39,309
What brings you here?

746
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,261
I came for a recheck on my stomach.

747
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,781
Yunsheng won't go with you?

748
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,100
He's too busy.
I didn't want to bother him.

749
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,180
It's okay. I just saw him
chatting with the director.

750
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,180
Do you want me to call him?

751
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,661
Don't bother.

752
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:53,229
How about this?

753
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,821
I have a document here.

754
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,421
Can you help me hand it over to him?

755
00:40:56,941 --> 00:40:57,805
Is it bothering you?

756
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,861
Not at all. We are friends.

757
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,020
I'm heading to the gastroenterology.

758
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:04,060
Is it this way?

759
00:41:04,941 --> 00:41:06,600
It is over there.

760
00:41:07,941 --> 00:41:08,845
Over there?

761
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:11,620
Gastroenterology.

762
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:14,821
Gastroenterology.

763
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,301
This patient's situation is complex.

764
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:19,981
Not just heart issues.

765
00:41:20,301 --> 00:41:22,349
It also requires
a consultation with gastroenterology.

766
00:41:22,821 --> 00:41:23,725
Director.

767
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,005
Yunsheng.

768
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:26,580
Dr. Zhang, you're looking for me?

769
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,981
I'm looking for Yunsheng.

770
00:41:28,341 --> 00:41:30,100
Miss Su's here and asked me
to hand this over to you.

771
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:31,741
Su Ying is here?

772
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:32,616
You didn't know?

773
00:41:33,421 --> 00:41:34,941
Why didn't you bring Su Ying here?

774
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:37,341
She went for a check-up.
Why would I bring her here?

775
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:43,341
Alright then. I'll leave you.

776
00:41:43,981 --> 00:41:46,381
I'm going to inform
gastroenterology about the consultation.

777
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,608
Director, leave it to me.

778
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:52,840
You'll go?

779
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:54,824
I'll accompany you.

780
00:41:57,512 --> 00:41:58,700
Alright. You go.

781
00:42:07,261 --> 00:42:08,200
Miss Su.

782
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,456
Miss Su?

783
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,981
(Please keep quiet)

784
00:42:13,981 --> 00:42:15,461
You are done with your consultation.

785
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,180
No worries. Go ahead.

786
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:20,341
I won't eavesdrop.

787
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,580
Miss Su.

788
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:26,540
Really, it's fine. Dr. Xie.

789
00:42:26,741 --> 00:42:28,861
Just treat me as if I'm not here.

790
00:42:40,421 --> 00:42:41,981
Go ahead, Dr. Xie.

791
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:49,821
Dr. Qin?

792
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,180
