17
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,608
Dr. Qin.

18
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,112
Mr. Yang.

19
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:53,064
I'm here for a checkup.

20
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,941
You should go to the checkup department.

21
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:57,581
But I have trouble with my heart.

22
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,700
Aren't you an expert in this field?

23
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:02,301
I think only you
can cure my heart disease.

24
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,264
Blood pressure is normal,
and so is your heart.

25
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,700
Why do I always
feel shortness of breath?

26
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,140
Anything on your mind?

27
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,501
Just have a good rest.

28
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,820
That makes sense.

29
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:31,700
I always feel like there's a thorn

30
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,901
stuck in my heart,
making me uncomfortable.

31
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,740
I'll refer you to a psychologist.

32
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,341
But the thorn

33
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:43,341
might be in my eye.

34
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:45,661
You should see an eye doctor.

35
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:50,920
Dr. Qin.

36
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,501
Before I came here,
I looked up some information about you.

37
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,980
I admire you a lot.

38
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,860
You are so affectionate,

39
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,181
single-minded,

40
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,260
and nostalgic.

41
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,860
So I have a question for you.

42
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:06,820
Mi Su is so important in your heart.

43
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,020
Can you fall in love with Su Ying?

44
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,260
It's none of your business.

45
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,221
If you just see Su Ying as a substitute,

46
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:21,416
leave her as early as you can.

47
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:24,061
After all,
you are just a passerby in her life.

48
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:28,260
Now the passerby is you, not me.

49
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,381
Dr. Qin, don't be childish.

50
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,941
We both know
that your tricks work on young girls.

51
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:45,181
But they don't work
on women like Su Ying.

52
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,740
You and I are both adults.

53
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,061
Your so-called gentleness is cheap.

54
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:51,661
It's worthless.

55
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:53,832
Have you finished?

56
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,341
Do you know the biggest difference
between you and me now?

57
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:04,140
You're ordered around by others at work.

58
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:06,101
But I am completely different from you.

59
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:08,621
Only I tell people what to do.

60
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,020
No one can tell me what I should do.

61
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:15,980
Good. Let's start the next examination.

62
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:21,064
Open your mouth.

63
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:24,552
Open your mouth.

64
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:29,288
Stick your tongue out.

65
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:39,720
Wider.

66
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:44,901
Your tonsils are inflamed.

67
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,860
Talk less.

68
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,141
Have you decided
on your work for competition?

69
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,384
Not yet.

70
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:08,141
How about hearing my suggestion?

71
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,832
Go ahead.

72
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,152
The glass house.

73
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:19,620
I didn't know much
about this competition before.

74
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,740
So, I did some research online.

75
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:24,300
And I found out that it is remarkable.

76
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,461
I studied its preferences and style.

77
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:31,661
I think glass house accords with it.

78
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:34,581
But...

79
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:37,740
Moreover, it is an art appraisal award.

80
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,901
The glass house is not only your work,

81
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,112
but also your wish.

82
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:46,380
Didn't you mention your story

83
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,060
with the glass in the interview?

84
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:53,500
So, from any aspect,

85
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:55,380
the glass house is the best.

86
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,380
I just think...

87
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,672
Listen to me.

88
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,776
(Conference Room)
I announce

89
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:18,461
that I've decided

90
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,620
to use the glass house
as the entry for the ADA Competition.

91
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:29,980
Everyone can start preparing materials.

92
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,420
We must compete at our best.

93
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:33,544
No worries, Ying.

94
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:34,141
Right.

95
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:34,661
Go for it.

96
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,620
- Go for it.
- Come on.

97
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,584
Go for it.

98
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:52,880
According to the one-month investigation

99
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,420
by engineers and the survey team,

100
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,380
this sea area
has obvious development advantages.

101
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,740
According to the overall assessment,
they're marked in red and green.

102
00:07:02,101 --> 00:07:03,380
Red represents the highest score.

103
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:04,940
So this area

104
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:06,568
got high scores.

105
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,940
Yes, the bay, as a natural barrier,

106
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:10,221
has a large beach area.

107
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,620
It is suitable
to develop the Seaview Garden project.

108
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,581
Well, let's locate
the Seaview Garden here.

109
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:18,740
But in that case,

110
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,261
the glass house Miss Su designed

111
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,500
has to be demolished.

112
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:34,781
If you just see Su Ying as a substitute,

113
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:37,021
leave her as early as you can.

114
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:40,540
After all,
you are just a passerby in her life.

115
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,021
Now the passerby is you, not me.

116
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,581
Qin Yunsheng made this glass house
for his ex-girlfriend.

117
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:54,408
It's important for him.

118
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:57,620
For humans,
the hardest thing is making choices.

119
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,940
I want to see how he chooses

120
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:03,060
between the present and the past.

121
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,380
I see. I'm on it.

122
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,380
(I'd like to see)

123
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:15,581
(how deep your love is.)

124
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:38,344
Hey.

125
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,821
Why are you here?

126
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,101
You don't want to see me?

127
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:46,376
Yes, I do.

128
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,101
This glass house
is my competition entry.

129
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:50,660
I need you to sign some paperwork.

130
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,221
You don't have to come for this.

131
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,581
Well, I want to see you.

132
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,496
Okay.

133
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,096
Sign it.

134
00:08:58,181 --> 00:08:59,112
Here.

135
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:09,020
(Authorization Agreement)
What a good handwriting.

136
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,660
I can stay for 30 minutes.

137
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,461
I'll take a break

138
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:18,824
and get you some water.

139
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,181

The day after tomorrow
we'll go to glass house

163
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:29,821
to take photos
and videos for the competition.

164
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,660
The video is quite important.

165
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,140
It can give judges a good impression.

166
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,301
Right, so I asked Huixuan
for help in shooting.

167
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,461
If so, we'll have nothing
to worry about.

168

the pre-preparation materials.

170
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:44,780
Ying, it's all here.

171
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:46,821
It's all printed out.

172
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:48,396
Take a look.

173
00:11:48,396 --> 00:11:50,221
(Are you working on something?)

174
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:51,860
The introduction needs to be adjusted.

175
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,840
Why does she not reply to me?

176
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:56,260
Has she blocked me?

177
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,400
Qin.

00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,500

179
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,701
Oh, my.

00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:09,260
Your house becomes so beautiful.

181
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:10,421
Thank you.

182
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,624
It's really good.

183
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:12,701
Wait. I'll get you water.

184
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:14,260
No, I'm fine.

185
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:15,660
I have something to say to you.

186
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:17,660
This area is planned

187
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:21,740
to be developed into the Seaview Garden.

188
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:23,421
Developers have already come.

189
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,900
I'm looking for property owners

190
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,500
to sign the house relocation agreements.

191
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,776
Relocation?

192
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,061
Take a look.

193
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:32,380
There is no problem with the money.

194
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,900
(House Relocation Agreement)
This company is well financed.

195
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,701
Homeowners can benefit from his plan.

196
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:42,664
Mr. Li.

197
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,500
I cannot move.

198
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,780
Don't worry. It's a big company.

199
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,496
The demolition compensation
will satisfy you.

200
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:52,980
It's not a compensation issue.

201
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:55,341
Well, tell me

202
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,061
what else do you require?

203
00:12:57,181 --> 00:12:58,380
I'll pass your message on to them.

204
00:12:58,941 --> 00:12:59,860
My requirement is

205
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:01,512
I won't move.

206
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,380
Qin, people often

207
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,061
regret what they have decided.

208
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,416
Do you know why?

209
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,101
You made your decision too soon.

210
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:12,221
I have made my point.

211
00:13:12,301 --> 00:13:13,380
No, no rush.

212
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,581
How about this?

213
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,101
I'll give you more time
to think about it.

214
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:19,461
Don't rush to make a decision.

215
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:23,461
Think about it. I'm leaving.

216
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:25,301
Think twice about it.

217
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:28,541
So beautiful.

218
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:41,900
(Piyixia)

219
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,860
I have inquired about the development
of the Seaview Garden.

220
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,880
What's going on?

221
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:53,221
It has been going on.

222
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,980
But they considered
another sea area before.

223
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:58,860
Suddenly, they switched to this area.

224
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,701
Really?

225
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,264
Besides,

226
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:05,660
here's one more important thing.

227
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,980
I think it's necessary to tell you.

228
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,421
The developer of the Seaview Garden

229
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:11,620
is Tiandi Corp.

230
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:13,384
Tiandi Corp?

231
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:15,780
Yang Zhengwen's company?

232
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:18,020
It's him.

233
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,020
He gave you a hard time?

234
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:25,221
He'll demolish the glass house.

235
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:28,900
I knew it.

236
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:30,860
It's obviously intentional.

237
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,821
It's an extensive relocation.

238
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:36,936
Who knows what will happen?

239
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:38,301
An extensive demolition?

240
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:40,260
How much will they give?

241
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,660
Is this a matter of money?

242
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,672
No.

243
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,701
This is also a work by Su Ying.

244
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,181
She will use the glass house
as her competition entry.

245
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:56,740
So I can't let them
tear down the glass house.

246
00:14:58,061 --> 00:14:59,221
Does Su Ying know about this?

247
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:01,941
She does not know yet.

248
00:15:03,461 --> 00:15:05,380
She is already busy preparing
for the competition.

249
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,941
I can't distract her.

250
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:09,541
Anyway,

251
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:12,328
I can handle it myself.

252
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,472
Good guy.

253
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,464
Anyway, no matter what happens,
we got your back.

254
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,800
Right.

255
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,860
Mr. Yang, except for Qin Yunsheng,

256
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,980
other property owners have agreed.

257
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:39,080
Just as I thought.

258
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,380
No problem. We can wait

259
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:42,821
until he acts.

260
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,221
Mr. Yang, Qin Yunsheng is here
to see you.

261
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:53,544
He is on the move.

262
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,500
Let him in.

263
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,456
Yes, Mr. Yang.

264
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,448
Please.

265
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,140
Dr. Qin, what brought you here?

266
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,020
Let's sit and talk.

267
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:04,264
Save your false courtesies.

268
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:07,101
Are you in charge
of the demolition project?

269
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,020
Yes, is there any problem?

270
00:16:09,421 --> 00:16:11,620
I'll not let you tear down
the glass house.

271
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:16,500
I'm sorry, but no offense.

272
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,541
Usually, when we
go through a demolition,

273
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,341
the property owners

274
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,541
who want more compensation
will say the same thing as you.

275
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,620
Do you think
I'm here to negotiate with you?

276
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:29,541
No, I mean, that is your right.

277
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,860
You should negotiate.

278
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,900
That's alright. Just name your price.

279
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:37,461
Is it a matter of money?

280
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,500
Dr. Qin, I understand

281
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:44,980
that you don't want to seem material.

282
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
But unfortunately,

283
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:48,780
we're living in the material world.

284
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,701
Everything has its value, and it should.

285
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,980
So does the priceless stuff

286
00:16:57,581 --> 00:17:00,421
under specific conditions.

287
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,140
So, it's okay. Don't be shy.

288
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,744
Make an offer.

289
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,860
I will not demolish the glass house.

290
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,584
Dr. Qin.

291
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:15,620
I'm kindly reminding you

292
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:18,900
that the Seaview Garden project will

293
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:20,261
take at least two years.

294
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:22,900
In this process, your house will be
on a construction site.

295
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,180
Water pollution, air pollution,
noise pollution, and light pollution.

296
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,541
Are you sure you can handle it?

297
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,140
I have already told you

298
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,620
what I wanted to say.

299
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,420
Mr. Yang, why bother talking so much
with him?

300
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,581
The land of the glass house is not his.

301
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:46,024
He only has a right to use.

302
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,040
Just for fun.

303
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,900
It's okay, no need to mind him.

304
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,541
Let's talk to the rental party.

305
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,136
Okay.

306
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,981
What if I shoot the video

307
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:08,341
with the Inception's style?

308
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:12,420
The cool shots will be eye-catching.

309
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:15,261
Inception?

310
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,140
Or,

311
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,101
like the Matrix's style,

312
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:22,821
full of Sci-fi feeling.

313
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:29,261
Or maybe the Butterfly Effect.

314
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,741
Looks mysterious.

315
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,460
Xuan, I think

316
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:38,660
it's too rational, rigid, and cold.

317
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,940
No emotions.

318
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,900
Too rational?

319
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,581
Because the glass house

320
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,741
seems aesthetic and artistic,

321
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,781
full of life.

322
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,501
Make a people-oriented video,
starting with emotions.

323
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,821
When you're in the house,

324
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:58,541
you feel like you're dreaming,
but it's real.

325
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:00,341
You understand?

326
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:04,140
Well, the feeling of love.

327
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:08,541
Just like you get a feeling of love
upon seeing the glass house.

328
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:11,140
The feeling of love?

329
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:12,900
Have you ever heard

330
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:15,940
that love is the best source
of inspiration?

331
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,821
What is the feeling of love?

332
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,420
You haven't been in love for too long.

333
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,021
That's all.
I'm going to have dinner with Dr. Qin.

334
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,620
Remember, the feeling of love.

335
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,261
You are leaving now?

336
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,101
Relax a bit.

337
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:43,620
The feeling of love?

338
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:15,880
What's wrong, Huixuan? Feeling down?

339
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,180
I'm thinking over the plan
for the glass house.

340
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,301
I believe you can do it.

341
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,021
By the way, have you not been
checking your phone much recently?

342
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,660
Yes. You were looking for me?

343
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,220
No, just asking.

344
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:40,021
Stop thinking about it. I will take you
to eat something delicious.

345
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,341
I'm not going.

346
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,940
I should go back
and think about this shooting.

347
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,860
The feeling of love.

348
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:53,032
I'm leaving.

349
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:58,420
The feeling of love?

350
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:03,940
Recently, everyone has been busy
with the competition.

351
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:05,501
Even Huixuan came to help.

352
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,581
You must feel happy, right?

353
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,021
You also come to pick me up from work.

354
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,101
How was your day?

355
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,264
It was quite good.

356
00:21:16,981 --> 00:21:19,541
We're going to the glass house
for shooting the day after tomorrow.

357
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:20,620
Are you okay with that?

358
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,541
Yes, I'm totally okay.

359
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,420
My video is too rational?

360
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,940
It's not aesthetic or artistic?

361
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,741
(Your new video broke the record
for likes. Congratulations.)

362
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,140
(I found a really good source material.)

363
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:00,741
(I want to send it to you.)

364
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,408
(Are you busy now?)

365
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,420
(Sorry, I've been busy
working on a case recently.)

366
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,860
(I'm fretting over finding inspiration.)

367
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,140
You finally replied to me.

368
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:36,220
(Scrat)
Alright. You have been working hard.

369
00:22:40,341 --> 00:22:42,581
(Fight Hard to Win)
(Do you think my video is too rational?)

370
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:45,501
(Scrat)
It's a bit.

371
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,061
But that's not a disadvantage.

372
00:22:49,741 --> 00:22:53,220
I think making the video
you like is the most important.

373
00:22:56,061 --> 00:22:57,021
(Fight Hard to Win)
(Thanks.)

374
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,860
(Scrat)
Trust me. You'll get better.

375
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:11,581
And remember I'm your loyal fan
when you succeed.

376
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:14,940
(Fight Hard to Win)
(Gotta go.)

377
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,460
(Scrat)
Alright, but don't overwork.

378
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,541
A great author once said

379
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,981
there are three secrets
for staying happy,

380
00:23:30,981 --> 00:23:33,981
namely, food, sleep...

381
00:23:34,261 --> 00:23:35,180
I have food.

382
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,104
And love.

383
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:38,261
I have enough sleep.

384
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:41,821
So all I need is sweet love now.

385
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:50,821
(Scrat)
I also feel the same way.

386
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,061
I hope

387
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,581
we can have sweet love.

388
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,741
(Fight Hard to Win)
Let's go for it.

389
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,781
Go for it.

390
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,101
Let's go for it?

391
00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:26,301
What did she mean?

392
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,552
What?

393
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,088
A blind date?

394
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,741
Didn't you tell me yesterday

395
00:24:33,821 --> 00:24:36,101
that love is a source of inspiration?

396
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,420
I have thought about it carefully.

397
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:42,380
I should start trying
to have a relationship.

398
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,101
Why blind date?

399
00:24:47,021 --> 00:24:48,380
I searched it online.

400
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:50,341
A blind date is efficient.

401
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:53,420
What have you done?

402
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:56,380
I have found some men on the internet.

403
00:24:56,581 --> 00:24:57,981
You can also introduce some to me.

404
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,460
Look, I made a form.

405
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,220
I wrote all my requirements on it.

406
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,940
Du Huixuan, you're not preparing
for a show recording.

407
00:25:10,261 --> 00:25:13,061
Love is about feeling, not efficiency.

408
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:15,700
It has to be efficient.

409
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:19,420
If I decide to love,
I have to consider it for the long term.

410
00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:22,581
I refuse ineffective love,
so I need a blind date.

411
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,821
Blind date?

412
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:26,664
Huixuan.

413
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,501
Go on a blind date?

414
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,301
Why?

415
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,180
Do you have any requirements
for your date?

416
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,380
He shall be 1.8 meters tall,
kind-hearted, with stable job.

417
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:40,040
That's okay.

418
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:42,220
Common interests and hobbies,

419
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,021
such as collecting action figures,

420
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:46,061
loving home design,

421
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,460
loving watching football.
She prefers a fan of Manchester United.

422
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,660
That's good.

423
00:25:52,061 --> 00:25:53,032
This is very important.

424
00:25:55,564 --> 00:25:56,660
(Reject younger men.)

425
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,576
Reject younger men.

426
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,464
Why?

427
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,700
Because younger men are not okay.

428
00:26:02,821 --> 00:26:03,816
Why?

429
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:07,700
My requirements are realistic.

430
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,220
Otherwise, how could I

431
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,981
have chosen a few candidates
among so many people?

432
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:12,104
A few candidates?

433
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,341
I'll meet them this afternoon.

434
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:16,380
Don't. You meet them today?

435
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,420
I've chosen the location.

436
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,101
I'll meet them at a coffee shop.

437
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:22,261
I can meet them all at once.

438
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,101
Is there a time limit
for your blind date?

439
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,620
It's a consequence of my work.

440
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:30,440
Listen, Huixuan.

441
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,940
You don't even know these men.

442
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,860
I can go with you.

443
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:38,660
I can also protect you
and be your bodyguard.

444
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,821
Yes, that's a good idea.

445
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,981
He can help you discern other men

446
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,341
from a man's perspective.

447
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:48,261
Right, that's true.

448
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,061
You don't have to.

449
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:53,860
I've interacted
with so many people at work.

450
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,140
I can deal with it.

451
00:26:57,021 --> 00:26:59,620
I'm leaving. See you tomorrow.

452
00:27:02,741 --> 00:27:03,620
Give it to me.

453
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,424
Thank you.

454
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,180
Ying, I...

455
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,200
I get it.

456
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:17,704
Go ahead.

457
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:19,688
Thank you, Ying.

458
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:28,940
Miss Du, I heard that you resigned.

459
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:32,420
Being a general director is not easy.

460
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,460
Quitting is an impulsive decision.

461
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,501
I was not on good terms
with the producer.

462
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:41,660
Given your appearance,

463
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,420
you look emotional at work.

464
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:47,061
You have to ask yourself

465
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:49,940
why the producer couldn't get along
with you.

466
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,940
He has a fan? How old is he?

467
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:57,061
So, you're saying it's my fault?

468
00:27:57,981 --> 00:28:01,101
Yes, it's no big deal
to change your temper.

469
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:03,420
As you know, in this society,

470
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,741
it's hard to survive without a job.

471
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,741
Fortunately, you met me today.

472
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:10,741
I'll read your fortune for you.

473
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,781
Let's see how your luck is today.

474
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:15,620
Fortune telling?

475
00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:22,101
You'll meet a kind person today.

476
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,341
Here is my business card.

477
00:28:27,261 --> 00:28:28,700
Come to me
for a luck prediction next time.

478
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,460
I'll give you a 20% discount.

479
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,620
It's good to resign.

480
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,781
You can be a housewife.

481
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,821
In fact...

482
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:42,581
Wait, let me finish.

483
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:45,301
Women shouldn't go to work.

484
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,700
It's great to be a full-time homemaker.

485
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:48,860
Actually, I...

486
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,301
Hold on, I have to take this call.

487
00:28:58,261 --> 00:28:59,341
(Interpreter of All)
So arrogant.

488
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,741
Fine, I get it now.

489
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:03,460
Sorry, I'm a bit busy.

490
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,224
Here is my business card.

491
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:07,821
I am very interested in you. Call me.

492
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,420
He's not good for you.

493
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:19,781
You'll look for a job, right?

494
00:29:20,456 --> 00:29:21,341
Yeah.

495
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:22,581
Good.

496
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:25,380
After all, we both can't live
without jobs.

497
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,501
You're unemployed?

498
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:31,688
My job involves fitness, exercise and...

499
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:33,672
Do you like it?

500
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,900
I like a girl

501
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,781
who loves sports.

502
00:29:51,781 --> 00:29:52,781
He's not good,

503
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:54,261
not a match.

504
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,781
Hello, are you Miss Huixuan?

505
00:29:58,581 --> 00:29:59,981
Give me your business card.

506
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,660
Nice to meet you.

507
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:09,741
Please have a seat.

508
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,920
Thank you.

509
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,940
You're too kind,
even bringing me flowers.

510
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,301
No, I just saw an elderly man

511
00:30:16,821 --> 00:30:20,301
and a child selling flowers
by the roadside.

512
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,900
It instantly sparked my sympathy.

513
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,220
So, I spontaneously decided
to buy a bouquet for you.

514
00:30:25,821 --> 00:30:26,792
So considerate.

515
00:30:27,821 --> 00:30:28,741
Do you like it?

516
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:29,501
Yes, beautiful.

517
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:31,700
Miss Huixuan, according to your profile,

518
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,301
I know you love to play football.

519
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,101
I don't like to play it.

520
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,541
I enjoy watching football.

521
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,420
I also like it.

522
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,808
Really?

523
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:42,101
Which team do you like?

524
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,741
Manchester United.

525
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,061
So do I.

526
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,460
No way.

527
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,781
What a fateful coincidence.

528
00:30:49,261 --> 00:30:51,301
Messi is a good player.

529
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:53,781
His skill of dribbling...

530
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:55,180
Messi is

531
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,320
in Paris Saint-Germain.

532
00:30:57,581 --> 00:31:01,541
Sir, please sit properly.

533
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,741
It's a bit dangerous.

534
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,560
Well,

535
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:10,581
let's go watch a football match
together next week.

536
00:31:11,261 --> 00:31:12,136
Great.

537
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,620
Ye, do you know where Mingshi has gone?

538
00:31:15,781 --> 00:31:16,860
He doesn't reply to my messages.

539
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,860
Yes, I have a document he needs to sign.

540
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,981
He might have gone to the organizer.

541
00:31:23,101 --> 00:31:24,101
I don't know either.

542
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:24,968
Good afternoon.

543
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,380
Dr. Qin.

544
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,560
It's all yours.

545
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,220
Dr. Qin brought something delicious.

546
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,261
Cookies.

547
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:31,140
Thank you, Dr. Qin.

548
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,741
You always get us something.

549
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:35,821
This is your hot chocolate.

550
00:31:37,301 --> 00:31:38,184
I'll get fat.

551
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,781
Dr. Qin is so considerate.

552
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:43,620
He knew Ying couldn't drink coffee
and specially brought her hot chocolate.

553
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,581
Exactly, Ying, we also want
to drink hot chocolate.

554
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,301
He'll buy some for you next time.

555
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,501
- Thank you, brother-in-law.
- Thank you, brother-in-law.

556
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,860
You're welcome.

557
00:31:52,261 --> 00:31:53,192
Brother-in-law.

558
00:31:53,821 --> 00:31:55,101
This is for Mingshi and Huixuan.

559
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:58,312
- Huixuan is not here.
- Didn't she come to help?

560
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,301
She went on a blind date.

561
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:03,464
Really?

562
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,301
Let's go. I'll get my bag.

563
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:07,176
Okay.

564
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,101
It's yours now.

565
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,821
Thank you, Dr. Qin. Thanks.

566
00:32:11,061 --> 00:32:11,944
It's so sweet, Dr. Qin.

567
00:32:13,581 --> 00:32:15,380
Today's date is perfect.

568
00:32:15,781 --> 00:32:17,140
She's rich and has no dating experience.

569
00:32:17,581 --> 00:32:19,541
You will know how I use tricks

570
00:32:19,741 --> 00:32:20,981
to win her over in three days.

571
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:37,741
Sorry for the wait.

572
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:39,048
No.

573
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,741
Where were we in our conversation?

574
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,781
Football.

575
00:32:43,781 --> 00:32:44,660
Right.

576
00:32:45,341 --> 00:32:46,741
There's a quote that I really like.

577
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:49,021
Plato once said

578
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,460
humans were originally born
with four hands and four feet.

579
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:55,420
But after we were born,
we were split in half

580
00:32:55,821 --> 00:32:58,581
and became the way we are now,
with two hands and two feet.

581
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,501
So, we spend our entire life

582
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,061
trying to find the other half.

583
00:33:06,341 --> 00:33:07,304
I see.

584
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,380
Miss Huixuan, can you give me your hand?

585
00:33:14,021 --> 00:33:15,101
I want to check your palm lines

586
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,581
to see if you're the other half
I'm searching for.

587
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,061
Sure.

588
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:23,016
Take your hand off her.

589
00:33:23,821 --> 00:33:25,140
Don't touch her, you bad guy.

590
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,104
Why are you here?

591
00:33:28,261 --> 00:33:29,128
I'm here to protect you.

592
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,821
I'm afraid you'll meet bad men.

593
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:31,981
He's one of them.

594
00:33:31,981 --> 00:33:33,660
He's not.

595
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:35,741
Mind your language.

596
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,781
Seriously?

597
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:38,140
Let's hear what you said.

598
00:33:39,212 --> 00:33:40,456
(You will know)

599
00:33:40,456 --> 00:33:42,781
(how I use tricks
to win her over in three days.)

600
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:43,848
You...

601
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:45,704
What about me?

602
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,380
Miss Huixuan, it's a misunderstanding.

603
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,460
Really? You're a bad man.

604
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,680
Let's go, Huixuan.

605
00:33:52,981 --> 00:33:54,220
Wait, my purse.

606
00:33:57,581 --> 00:33:58,501
What's all the fuss?

607
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:05,736
Thank you.

608
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:06,981
Are you okay?

609
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:07,880
I'm fine.

610
00:34:08,101 --> 00:34:09,981
Without you, I would have been conned.

611
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:13,700
The blind date is so unreliable.

612
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,300
Their resumes are decent.

613
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:18,340
But none of them is suitable.

614
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:21,861
Actually, there are many ways
to be in love.

615
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,780
Sometimes online dating is reliable.

616
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:27,981
At least, I don't need
to drink coffee online.

617
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,941
I've drunk too much coffee

618
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,700
this afternoon.

619
00:34:31,981 --> 00:34:33,501
Well...

620
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,941
How unreliable these blind dates are.

621
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:44,620
For the ones online, you can chat first
and then meet them.

622
00:34:45,461 --> 00:34:47,381
Forget it. It's bad luck.

623
00:34:47,381 --> 00:34:49,260
I'll help Ying with her things first.

624
00:34:50,461 --> 00:34:51,368
Let's go.

625
00:35:02,021 --> 00:35:04,541
How did your blind date go?

626
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,220
I don't want to talk about it.

627
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,300
You failed
to find the right one for you?

628
00:35:11,581 --> 00:35:13,101
I originally wanted
to find a sweetheart.

629
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:15,381
But I haven't even met a decent man.

630
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,861
Luckily, Mingshi appeared in time.

631
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,140
Otherwise, I'd be cheated.

632
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:23,541
Mingshi?

633
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,260
Then you should really thank him.

634
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,220
Or he could be your boyfriend.

635
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:30,981
Be serious, please.

636
00:35:31,981 --> 00:35:33,981
I've been in bad luck.

637
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,180
So I failed.

638
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,861
I could set you up with someone.

639
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:38,984
Okay.

640
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,061
But I'll think about it later.

641
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:43,700
By then, my bad luck could disappear.

642
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,780
Okay.

643
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,180
I underestimated Mingshi.

644
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,160
Mingshi is reliable. He's a good guy.

645
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,541
They would be a perfect match
if they got together.

646
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:01,384
I know.

647
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:03,368
Wait.

648
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:06,820
How did you know
I would set her up with Mingshi?

649
00:36:10,061 --> 00:36:12,421
Did I tell you that he likes Du Huixuan?

650
00:36:13,061 --> 00:36:13,928
No, you didn't.

651
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:14,984
Then how did you know?

652
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,901
You can't hide when you're in love.

653
00:36:18,581 --> 00:36:19,780
Even if you cover your mouth,

654
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:22,140
it will show through your eyes.

655
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,200
So,

656
00:36:28,581 --> 00:36:30,700
only Du Huixuan is unaware now.

657
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,101
What a fool.

658
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:41,461
Welcome!

659
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,381
Feel free to look around.

660
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,680
Okay, thank you.

661
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,584
What is this?

662
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,700
This is eryngo.

663
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:53,340
It symbolizes strength.

664
00:36:53,941 --> 00:36:54,792
Cute.

665
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:57,901
Look over here.

666
00:37:06,501 --> 00:37:09,340
Sunflowers represent the pursuit
of happiness.

667
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,264
It looks as radiant as me.

668
00:37:13,128 --> 00:37:14,440
Your smile looks more brilliant.

669
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,780
You're a smooth talker.

670
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,120
Just like you.

671
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,300
Will you buy sunflowers?

672
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,264
Sure.

673
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:42,856
Is this pretty?

674
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:45,780
Pretty.

675
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,901
Are you taking a photo of me?

676
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:49,260
Let me see if you made me look ugly.

677
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:56,492
(Mr. Li)

678
00:37:57,501 --> 00:37:58,344
There's a phone call.

679
00:38:00,101 --> 00:38:01,032
Let me take it.

680
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,080
Hello, Mr. Li?

681
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:12,424
Qin.

682
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:15,820
Since you only have a land use right,

683
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:17,581
the lessor

684
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:19,901
explicitly requested
an early repossession.

685
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,260
An early repossession?

686
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,184
Yes.

687
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,660
I just received the notice.

688
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,220
Moreover, the lessor is adamant
about it.

689
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,061
He needs you to move out immediately.

690
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:32,981
Mr. Li, I'm busy.

691
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:34,344
I'll come find you later.

692
00:38:35,061 --> 00:38:36,340
I haven't finished speaking.

693
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,101
I want daisies, violets,

694
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,461
and the eryngo over there.

695
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,720
That's all, thank you.

696
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:48,776
Okay.

697
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:50,300
You can pay by scanning the QR code.

698
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:55,048
What happened?

699
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,581
My phone ran out of battery
after the call.

700
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,680
Let me pay.

701
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,501
It's done.

702
00:39:12,501 --> 00:39:13,820
Okay, we'll contact you.

703
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,592
Good, thanks a lot.

704
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,340
Goodbye.

705
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:16,700
Let's go.

706
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:46,820
Mr. Li.

707
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,101
What happened?

708
00:39:50,061 --> 00:39:52,220
Finally, you're here.

709
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:55,180
Come on. Don't get angry.

710
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:57,780
Take a seat and let me explain.

711
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:01,901
Listen to me.

712
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:03,560
About this matter,

713
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,021
it's not my fault.

714
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:07,061
Among all the owners in the community,

715
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,620
you're the only one
who rejects the demolition.

716
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,820
So, many owners come here
to make a fuss.

717
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,981
They're afraid the project will fail
and they won't get compensated.

718
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,140
They can't damage my house.

719
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:20,941
Yes, there are so many owners.

720
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:23,260
You never know who might be ill-mannered

721
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,260
and capable of anything.

722
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,340
Let's not talk about the paint now.

723
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,981
There's another urgent matter.

724
00:40:32,101 --> 00:40:33,101
The lessor contacted me.

725
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:35,541
He's going
to reclaim the land use right.

726
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,021
He won't rent it to you anymore.

727
00:40:37,581 --> 00:40:38,861
My contract hasn't expired yet.

728
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:43,260
They said they could compensate you
for the breach of contract.

729
00:40:43,981 --> 00:40:48,541
All the owners here have agreed
and signed,

730
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,180
except for you.

731
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,340
Qin, to be honest,

732
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,021
if you don't give up,

733
00:40:55,381 --> 00:40:58,421
it will baffle me.

734
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,981
Well, I'm pleading with you.

735
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,021
Please do me a favor.

736
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,981
Do me a favor.

737
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:08,552
Mr. Li.

738
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,501
Can I ask for your help?

739
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,620
Okay, go ahead.

740
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:16,424
For one month.

741
00:41:17,061 --> 00:41:18,660
Please protect the glass house for me.

742
00:41:19,381 --> 00:41:21,704
I will move out after a month.

743
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:23,300
Alright.

744
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,461
I will pass your message
on to the leaders.

745
00:41:26,101 --> 00:41:30,660
But it's hard to say if they agree.

746
00:41:31,101 --> 00:41:32,740
So, please, Qin.

747
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:36,101
Think well about it, okay?

748
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,140
Mr. Yang, Qin Yunsheng said
he wanted us to give him one month.

749
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,421
Is he tempted
by the conditions you proposed?

750
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,180
I don't think so.

751
00:41:53,381 --> 00:41:54,740
He just wants to buy more time.

752
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:57,000
Let's proceed.

753
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,824
Got it.

754
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:04,381
Go to the glass house.

755
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,300
Dr. Qin. You are busy.

756
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,700
Are you here to help
or to check the damage?

757
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,541
Come on.

758
00:42:33,941 --> 00:42:36,300
This house is Su Ying's work.

759
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,541
Your trick won't work for me.

760
00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:44,488
What brought you here?

761
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,140
Actually, I came here a few days ago.

762
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,660
When I saw this house,

763
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,901
I started
to understand your persistence.

764
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,740

765
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,901
