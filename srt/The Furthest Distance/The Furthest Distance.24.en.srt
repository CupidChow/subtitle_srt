17
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:54,536
Hello, Dr. Mi.

18
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:56,451
Is Su Ying's mother's surname Zhou?

19
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:58,091
Yeah. What's the matter?

20
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,290
I ran into her at the hospital.

21
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,352
Mrs. Zhou.

22
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,250
You don't remember me?
I'm Zhengwen.

23
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,104
Zhengwen.

24
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,090
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

25
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,208
Indeed.

26
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,770
You've changed quite a bit.

27
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:45,930
I didn't recognize you.

28
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,411
True, it's been many years.

29
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:50,291
You haven't changed.
You're still so young.

30
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,171
Is there something wrong with you
that you had to come to the hospital?

31
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:02,056
Nothing. I just came for a check-up
and to get some medication.

32
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,051
I'm getting old.

33
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,250
My blood pressure
is inevitably unstable.

34
00:03:06,891 --> 00:03:07,816
As long as you're okay.

35
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:10,696
Why did you come to the hospital?

36
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,370
I came to discuss a charity project

37
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,370
with this hospital.

38
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,011
The project is designed by Su Ying.

39
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:17,096
Don't you know?

40
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,504
Really?

41
00:03:19,051 --> 00:03:21,810
Look, she designed it
and I am in charge of the construction.

42
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:23,611
It's fate, isn't it?

43
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:27,930
I haven't told you that.

44
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:29,411
Now I work in Qingyu

45
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:30,824
for Tiandi Building Materials Corp.

46
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,051
This is my business card.
Please take it.

(Yang Zhengwen, GM
of Tiandi Building Materials Corp)

48
00:03:36,411 --> 00:03:37,770
Group General Manager.

49
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,171
Zhengwen, you're really good!

50
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:44,690
Don't say that.
I am just a kid in front of you.

51
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,291
May I invite you to have a meal with me?

52
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,490
No need.

53
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:50,851
You've got your business
at the hospital.

54
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,451
I have something else to deal with.

55
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:53,611
I have to go now.

56
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:55,210
I'll come visit you another day.

57
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,571
Alright, I'm leaving.

58
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,496
Okay.

59
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:05,970
Mr. Yang, do we still schedule a meeting
to discuss the project with Dr. Mi?

60
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,171
No. Let's return.

61
00:04:10,732 --> 00:04:12,770
(Garden Road No. 123)

62
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,370
So what was the original name
of macarons?

63
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,011
What's it?

64
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:15,370
What's it?

65
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,456
Macaroni.

66
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:20,450
How come you're so humorous?
I've never noticed it before.

67
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:22,771
Weiwei, Mingshi
is a very interesting guy.

68
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:24,010
You will get to know more later.

69
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:26,611
By the way, Mingming,
this is a small cactus for you.

70
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:28,810
It can purify the air in the office.

71
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,531
Weiwei, you're too nice.

72
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,091
You always give me a little gift.

73
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,091
Don't bring them anymore.

74
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:34,091
I'm really embarrassed.

75
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,171
Just a small gift.

76
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:37,448
Everyone's here.

77
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:38,696
Huixuan.

78
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,872
Miss Du.

79
00:04:40,971 --> 00:04:41,896
Weiwei, you're here too.

80
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:45,256
What? Here to discuss cooperation?

81
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,411
No, I'm just here to see Mingming.

82
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:49,130
And I brought some snacks for everyone.

83
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:54,531
Huixuan, you're here to see Ying, right?

84
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:56,411
She went to Legal.
She won't be back soon.

85
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,971
It's okay. The advertiser
of my video channel sent me some snacks.

86
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:01,130
I brought them over for you,

87
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,051
as you've been working hard
for the competition lately.

88
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,971
We don't need snacks.

89
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,370
Weiwei brought us
a lot of delicious food.

90
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:08,851
We're almost full.

91
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,330
I haven't eaten this yet. Try it.

92
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,531
No, thank you.

93
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,490
Since you've all had some,

94
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,040
I'll take these snacks back.

95
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:22,792
Don't take them back.
I love eating them.

96
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:25,928
This is my favorite. Here.

97
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:29,731
Oh, right, Mingming,

98
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,250
I really loved the orchid
you gave me last time.

99
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,490
I want to buy another one.

100
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:34,570
Could you come with me?

101
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:36,091
That orchid...

102
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,490
Just come with me.

103
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:39,330
I don't know the way
or where the store is.

104
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:40,771
It's just that today...

105
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,130
Weiwei, how about I go with you?

106
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,411
I'm free today.

107
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,611
Wasn't it me
who broke that orchid last time?

108
00:05:48,651 --> 00:05:49,810
Why are you coughing?

109
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:51,930
I told you not to eat these bad things.

110
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,490
Sit down and drink some water.

111
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,051
Drink. Smooth it down.

112
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:03,810
I'll leave you guys and your client.

113
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,130
I've got other things.
I have to go now.

114
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:07,171
Bye, Huixuan.

115
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:08,040
Watch your step.

116
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,570
You stay with Weiwei.

117
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:10,810
I'll walk out Huixuan.

118
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:16,680
Why are you leaving?

119
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:19,611
Didn't I just say I got other things?

120
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,248
Jealous?

121
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,851
No. Why should I be jealous?

122
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:29,490
She is just a client of mine,
an old friend.

123
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,010
Why would you be jealous of her?

124
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,330
Not jealous?
Can you give me a smile then?

125
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,731
Take good care of your old friend.

126
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:45,544
I'll make something delicious
for you at my place tonight.

127
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,171
Okay, wait for me.

128
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:49,672
Bye.

129
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,890
What did you call me over to eat today?

130
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,456
Dumplings.

131
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,250
Dumplings, great! My favorite.

132
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,128
What's the filling?

133
00:07:01,531 --> 00:07:02,450
Cactus filling.

134
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:05,490
C-C-Cactus filling?

135
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:09,690
Cactus filling is good.

136
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,330
I love cactus filling the most.

137
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,712
Wait a moment.

138
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,632
Wait a little longer.

139
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:22,411
What? I'll eat it raw?

140
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,411
Don't you like cacti?

141
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,930
I bought all the cacti
from a flower shop.

142
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,531
If any of them dies,

143
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,211
I'll bury you in the soil.

144
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,531
They won't.

145
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,490
But I feel like these are about to die.

146
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:40,930
No, the owner wouldn't do this to me.

147
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,611
No, I'm joking with you.

148
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:47,411
Look how vibrant the flowers are.

149
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,851
As bright as you.

150
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,531
They look like they will live to be 100.

151
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,930
And even if I had to be buried,
I wouldn't be buried in the soil.

152
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,771
I'd be buried in your heart.

153
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,291
Not even in the soil yet.

154
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:04,731
You're already earthy.

155
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:07,690
Aren't we dating underground?

156
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,171
It's normal to be related to soil.

157
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,291
And why do I feel the air today

158
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,690
has a strong smell of jealousy?

159
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:26,930
That's the smell of the vinegar I bought
to go with these dumplings.

160
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:29,096
Really?

161
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:32,371
Then I have to

162
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,824
taste it.

163
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,416
Indeed, it's sour enough.

164
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,291
It's enough. Eat your dumplings.

165
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:48,371
It's good. Try a cactus one, too.

166
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,544
Why are you here?

167
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:13,131
I came to accompany
my girlfriend to work overtime.

168
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:18,984
Drinking coffee again.

169
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:21,450
Your stomach can't handle it.

170
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:24,371
Just these few days.
It's a special time after all.

171
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,090
I have to perk up.

172
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:32,570
Okay, rest for a bit.
Don't work for now.

173
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,610
Let's have dinner

174
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,032
together.

175
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,784
Taste it.

176
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:57,930
You are being so caring.

177
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,810
Are you feeling guilty about something?

178
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:02,651
I'm always like this towards you.

179
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:05,411
Plus, you are competing now.

180
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:08,011
I need to make sure
you are well nourished.

181
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:18,984
Is it tasty?

182
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,970
Great, there's more.

183
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,912
All of this is for you.

184
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,090
Aren't you eating?

185
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:30,210
I ate already.

186
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,536
Right.

187
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:36,450
Let me tell you.

188
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:40,330
About the hospital plan...

189
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,956
(Mi Bai: I've discussed it with my dad.)

190
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,090
It's okay. Continue.

191
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:50,970
The hospital plan issue is actually...

192
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,232
(Mi Bai)

193
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:56,040
I need to take the call.

194
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:06,090
Mi Bai.

195
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,531
My dad just now told me

196
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,491
Chief Zhao was known to be stubborn.

197
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:13,891
Luckily, after a lot of persuasion,

198
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,330
he finally agreed to meet us.

199
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,610
The willingness to meet
indicates there's an opportunity.

200
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:21,171
Yes. Right.

201
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:22,171
But my dad also said

202
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,330
the operation was indeed difficult.

203
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,970
The success rate would be the highest
if Chief Zhao performs it.

204
00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:30,810
And he indeed is the best choice.

205
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,168
Yes.

206
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:33,491
You do your matters.

207
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,011
I'll contact Chief Zhao
to schedule an appointment.

208
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,171
Okay, that would be great.

209
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,330
Tell me if there's any news
at the earliest.

210
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,810
Don't worry, Yunsheng.

211
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,752
You finished eating?

212
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,730
Whose call was that?

213
00:12:00,171 --> 00:12:01,491
A patient's call.

214
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:09,570
What you said earlier
about the hospital was...

215
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:14,056
It's nothing.

216
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:16,330
I ate it up. Let's clean up.

217
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,651
Okay, let's start cleaning it up.

218
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,850
Oh, right, I'm busy these days.

219
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,610
If my mom wants to eat something
or go somewhere for fun, can you..?

220
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:40,072
(Mi Bai: Chief Zhao said
to respond tomorrow. When will...?)

221
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,072
Where does Mrs. Zhou want to go?

222
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:55,531
Nothing. Start driving.

223
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,450
(Here's the food.)

224
00:13:18,051 --> 00:13:19,251
(Heat it up before eating.)

225
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,651
(The soup is in the pot.)

226
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,291
(Remember to have a bowl.)

227
00:13:23,371 --> 00:13:24,450
I'll heat the soup.

228
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,600
No need.

229
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:29,096
I'm tired. I'll go rest.

230
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,184
You follow the dietary restrictions,

231
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,371
but I don't know

232
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,131
if you've been taking
your medicine on time.

233
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,316
(Mi Bai: I've discussed it with my dad.)

234
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:24,680
(Mi Bai)

235
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:31,690
Whose call was that?

236
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,330
A patient's call.

237
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,488
Ying,

238
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:18,531
Mr. Jiang is here.

239
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,330
He said the workers
painting the walls got the color wrong,

240
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:22,771
but he couldn't contact Tian Mei,

241
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:23,784
so he had to come to you.

242
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,251
Did you call Tian Mei? What happened?

243
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:27,810
I did, but she didn't answer.

244
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,771
Alright, I'll handle it.

245
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:32,680
Okay.

246
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,330
Mr. Jiang, I'm sorry.
You could have called us over.

247
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,280
Don't call me Mr. Jiang.

248
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:47,944
I'm not worthy.

249
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:49,570
Just call me Jiang.

250
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,531
I'm just like a contractor now.

251
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:53,930
I couldn't even contact
your designer in charge of the project.

252
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,531
How could I bother you?

253
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,210
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,730
I didn't expect it to happen.

255
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,570
I'll take care of it for you, okay?

256
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,570
You? How?

257
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,450
Repainting will delay us
for several days, won't it?

258
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,450
Last time it was the bricks,
and this time it's the paint.

259
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,850
I'll stop mentioning the details.

260
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,011
We can't be making such basic mistakes.

261
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,450
Yes. I'll reschedule it

262
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:18,930
to make up for the lost time.

263
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:20,570
I make sure it'll be done on time, okay?

264
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,930
If you rush the schedule,
won't the work be shoddy?

265
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,930
What about quality?

266
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:26,011
It's impossible. If that's the case,

267
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,090
you'll lose the money
spent on a house's decoration,

268
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,771
but what I'll lose is the reputation
I've built up over the years.

269
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:32,531
I won't ruin my own reputation.

270
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,112
Miss Su,

271
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,011
you knew it'd ruin your reputation?

272
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,011
I've seen the posts
on the forum recently.

273
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:41,576
Honestly,

274
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,930
I've been considering
canceling the contract.

275
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:49,090
Mr. Jiang,
please give me one last chance.

276
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,131
I promise to excellently
complete the task, okay?

277
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,730
Alright, I'll trust you one more time.

278
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:55,944
No such a thing again.

279
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:57,730
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

280
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,040
Don't let me down.

281
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:02,330
I'll walk you out.

282
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,304
No need.

283
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:10,691
Thank you, Mr. Jiang. Take care.

284
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,104
All right, go back.

285
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:13,096
Alright.

286
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:19,130
Ying, Tian Mei has texted me back.

287
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:22,330
She said she was sick
and needed to take a leave.

288
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:25,090
Sick? Is it serious?

289
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,330
She didn't mention the exact reason.

290
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:28,570
Only that she's been unwell
for several days and needs

291
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:29,610
a few days of rest.

292
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,291
Alright then,
health comes first if she's sick.

293
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,810
I'll cover her tasks.

294
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:37,650
But you're already so busy lately.

295
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,712
With her tasks added to your load,
you'll be exhausted.

296
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,731
I can take care of Tian Mei's tasks.

297
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,650
No, we can't afford any oversight
with Jiang Dong's project.

298
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:46,771
I have to do it myself.

299
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:48,170
That's settled then.

300
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,064
Okay.

301
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:56,211
Miss Tian, your studio is ready.

302
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:58,731
Congratulations, from now on,

303
00:17:58,971 --> 00:18:01,570
you are a designer
with your own studio.

304
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,296
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

305
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,650
I prepared a little gift.

306
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,344
Consider it a congratulatory gift.

307
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,192
What's this?

308
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,136
Open it.

309
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,971
Isn't this too costly?

310
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,771
Don't worry, Mr. Yang.
I will not let you down.

311
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,531
How's your preparation going?

312
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:36,370
It's probably fine
based on the current situation.

313
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:37,896
Probably?

314
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,451
Aren't you confident?

315
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,610
I will do my best.

316
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,090
Miss Tian, as long as you
defeat Su Ying this time,

317
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,731
you'll surely make a name
for yourself in the industry.

318
00:18:53,451 --> 00:18:56,330
And from now on,
no one will be able to hold you back.

319
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,531
But she is Su Ying after all.

320
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,211
You don't sound confident.

321
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:05,570
No, that's not it.

322
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,211
I have great confidence in my ability.

323
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:10,130
But her reputation
and experience in the industry

324
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:12,051
are what I need time to catch up with.

325
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,211
Haven't you contributed to
the hospital project she is in?

326
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:19,731
How come only she can use it as an entry

327
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,352
but you can't?

328
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,776
Or you're willing

329
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:28,370
to be her stepping stone forever?

330
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,810
Give a clear explanation.

331
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:00,810
- Okay.
- Okay.

332
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,090
You have worked hard.

333
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,130
- Mrs. Zhou.
- Mrs. Zhou.

334
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:05,130
I made congee for you.

335
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:06,691
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

336
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:08,330
We are very fortunate
to have the congee

337
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:09,570
made by you.

338
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,330
Don't overeat. It causes bloating
and is bad for your stomach.

339
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,051
You still take good care
of your health, Mrs. Zhou.

340
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,410
Not at all.

341
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,011
Mrs. Zhou, I'm Chen.

342
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,211
He's new to our studio.

343
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,288
Really?

344
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:22,890
You're very handsome.

345
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:23,971
Thank you.

346
00:20:24,531 --> 00:20:25,531
Are you here to see Ying?

347
00:20:27,531 --> 00:20:28,691
Isn't she very busy recently?

348
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,771
Yes, particularly busy.

349
00:20:31,011 --> 00:20:32,531
Because we are about to compete.

350
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,691
She should pay attention to her health.

351
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,410
I'll go in.

352
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,051
Okay, Mrs. Zhou.

353
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:38,410
Okay.

354
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:45,051
Didn't I tell you
to knock before entering?

355
00:20:48,051 --> 00:20:48,904
Mom.

356
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,570
Okay, that's enough.

357
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,216
Okay.

358
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,330
Work is tiring, isn't it?

359
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,370
Not really.

360
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,130
I've just been busy because of
an upcoming competition.

361
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:11,531
I have a lot of rest time usually.

362
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:13,610
Apart from work,

363
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:15,570
do you have any other problems?

364
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:17,448
Talk to me.

365
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,011
There's nothing else.

366
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:21,650
It's just some work.

367
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,251
It is all handled. Don't worry.

368
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:28,810
After I'm finished,

369
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,130
I'll go shopping with you.

370
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,211
Don't you like flower shops?

371
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,328
I'll go with you.

372
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,011
No need.

373
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,291
I've arranged
to meet Mrs. Li this afternoon.

374
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,650
I have plenty of people to accompany me.

375
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,771
Alright, you're good.

376
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:42,931
Do you want more?

377
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:43,976
No more.

378
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,130
Then I will take it away.

379
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:48,011
Where are you taking it?

380
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:50,170
I'm taking it to Qin. It will get cold.

381
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:52,491
Didn't you make plans with Mrs. Li?

382
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,650
There's enough time.

383
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,011
I'll call a taxi for you.

384
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,370
No need. There's nothing
I can't do at my age.

385
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,451
I don't need you.

386
00:21:59,011 --> 00:21:59,890
Okay.

387
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,491
Be safe.

388
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,731
If anything happens, call me.

389
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:03,931
I know.

390
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,211
Eat up the congee.

391
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,370
I will.

392
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:07,971
I'll walk you out.

393
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,691
No need for that.

394
00:22:10,251 --> 00:22:11,176
Mom,

395
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:12,771
your bag.

396
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,712
I'm leaving.

397
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,451
Be careful.

398
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,810
The situation isn't very optimistic.

399
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,491
The lesion isn't big,
but it's in a dangerous position.

400
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:33,370
The surgical plan
needs careful consideration.

401
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:37,731
Director, I have
an unreasonable request.

402
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,691
I hope you'll perform it.

403
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:44,211
After all, you are the most experienced
in this sort of surgery.

404
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,531
If it's about the surgical plan,

405
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:49,570
I can help you.

406
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,810
But as for performing
the surgery, I can't.

407
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:53,130
I'm retiring next week.

408
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:59,051
Mr. Zhao, can you stay a bit longer?

409
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,330
My dad said

410
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,850
he wanted to invite you back
for a couple more years.

411
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:05,691
Mi Bai, I really couldn't
refuse your dad,

412
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,610
so I agreed to meet you

413
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,771
just to make this clear face to face.

414
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:12,650
I'm retiring.
I won't take surgeries anymore.

415
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,051
Director, I know it's difficult for you,

416
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:18,610
but the patient
is really important to me.

417
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,410
Could you make an exception?

418
00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:21,832
Qin,

419
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,931
this has nothing to do
with whether or not I make an exception.

420
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,330
We are all doctors.

421
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,211
We know the world never lacks patients.

422
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:32,291
You finish one, then another comes.

423
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,170
The point is that I promised
my wife to take her traveling.

424
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:38,691
It's been postponed for decades

425
00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:39,912
until now.

426
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:41,650
I can't delay it any longer.

427
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:46,051
Mr. Zhao, could you break
the rules just one more time?

428
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,531
The last time.

429
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:50,531
If everyone says the same to me,

430
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:51,971
what shall I do then?

431
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,896
Right?

432
00:23:54,691 --> 00:23:56,291
Okay, I'm off work.

433
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,170
I'll meet some friends
to play badminton.

434
00:23:59,531 --> 00:24:02,491
I can't break a promise, right?

435
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,011
Mr. Zhao.

436
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:14,024
Mi Bai.

437
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,130
Yunsheng,

438
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,291
why did you stop me
from persuading Chief Zhao just now?

439
00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:30,570
He had other plans later.

440
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,731
It was not very appropriate to go on.

441
00:24:34,051 --> 00:24:35,451
I'm in a hurry,

442
00:24:36,691 --> 00:24:38,090
but haste makes waste, right?

443
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,731
Let's think of other ideas.

444
00:24:42,211 --> 00:24:43,144
Sure.

445
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,216
What's it?

446
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,491
Su Ying's mom came to the hospital.
I'll go accompany her.

447
00:24:54,011 --> 00:24:55,370
You go ahead.

448
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,810
I'll try to think of other ways.

449
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,090
Okay, thank you.

450
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,376
Mrs. Zhou.

451
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,392
Look at me.

452
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,650
I napped when waiting for you.

453
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,051
I just came here
to bring congee for you,

454
00:25:27,211 --> 00:25:28,771
and you even went
to get medicine for me.

455
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,451
I really bothered you.

456
00:25:31,491 --> 00:25:32,771
I didn't affect your work, did I?

457
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:35,048
No, it's lunch break.

458
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,352
Look here.

459
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,691
The instructions
are written very clearly.

460
00:25:39,931 --> 00:25:42,370
Some are to be taken
before meals, some after meals.

461
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:43,931
Follow these instructions

462
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:46,771
and pay attention to your diet.

463
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,650
Alright, I got it.

464
00:25:50,251 --> 00:25:51,570
Eat this congee while it's hot.

465
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,130
You doctors can't eat regularly.

466
00:25:54,691 --> 00:25:55,531
Alright, don't worry.

467
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,531
I'll eat it later.

468
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,691
Okay. You can leave me.

469
00:26:00,451 --> 00:26:02,760
I've got other things.
I have to go now.

470
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:03,944
Okay.

471
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,648
Mrs. Zhou.

472
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,176
Mrs. Zhou.

473
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:26,370
Hello, Mrs. Li.

474
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,090
Su, did your mom leave already?

475
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,650
Why hasn't she arrived yet?

476
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,296
Has she not arrived?

477
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,130
She left at noon.

478
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,451
She should have arrived.

479
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:38,451
No, there's no answer on her phone.

480
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:39,650
We are all waiting for her.

481
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,291
Could it be that she got lost

482
00:26:43,931 --> 00:26:45,731
and couldn't find her way
so she went home by herself?

483
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,810
Mrs. Li, I'll check
with her for you, okay?

484
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,392
Alright, I'll contact you later. Bye.

485
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:17,011
Dr. Qin, according to
the preliminary check-up,

486
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:18,211
her dizziness

487
00:27:18,531 --> 00:27:20,251
is primarily caused
by high blood pressure.

488
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,011
But it might also be a sign
of an impending aneurysm.

489
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,570
Please come to me
when the detailed report comes out.

490
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,931
Have plenty of rest.

491
00:27:26,931 --> 00:27:27,370
Thank you.

492
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:27,688
Thanks.

493
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,890
Mrs. Zhou, you heard all of that.

494
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,251
I need to call Su Ying to tell her.

495
00:27:37,011 --> 00:27:38,211
Don't call her.

496
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:40,810
I know my condition best.

497
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,771
I don't want her to worry.

498
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:46,051
It's just an old affliction.
I'm really fine.

499
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,090
I understand you don't
want Su Ying to worry,

500
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,931
but this is not a small issue.

501
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:54,451
I will tell her.

502
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:58,216
Okay.

503
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,850
Mrs. Zhou, what are you doing?

504
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,011
Qin, if it's usual, let it be.

505
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,410
But now it's Su's
critical moment of her competition.

506
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,771
She's already working very hard.

507
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,610
I don't want to distract her.

508
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,211
Moreover, I'll be fine
once the IV is finished.

509
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:27,176
Just

510
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,691
help me one more time, okay?

511
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,330
I'll go get your medications.

512
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,211
My card is here.

513
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:43,080
Alright.

514
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:46,410
Give me back the phone.

515
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,051
I'll give it to you
when you come back.

516
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:55,130
Okay, have a good rest.

517
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:09,160
Mom.

518
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,304
Mom.

519
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:22,696
Mom.

520
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:26,728
Mom.

521
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,330
Then I will take it away.

522
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,064
Where are you taking it?

523
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,650
I'm taking it to Qin.

524
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,090
It will get cold.

525
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,552
Thank you.

526
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,456
Thank you.

527
00:30:11,372 --> 00:30:13,516
(Pharmacy)

528
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:27,491
Sorry. The number you dialed
is temporarily unanswered.

529
00:30:27,931 --> 00:30:28,904
Please...

530
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,832
Dr. Zhang,

531
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,011
I just went to his office
and didn't find him.

532
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,330
Do you know where he went?

533
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:52,090
That can't be.
We just had lunch together.

534
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,170
Did you see an old lady

535
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,170
send congee for him at noon?

536
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,610
No, we ate in the canteen,

537
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,890
and he didn't have anything else.

538
00:31:00,744 --> 00:31:01,650
What's the matter?

539
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,504
How could it be?

540
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,971
My mother came over
to bring him congee,

541
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,211
and now I can't find her.

542
00:31:06,451 --> 00:31:08,051
I called Dr. Qin and he didn't answer.

543
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:09,931
It's okay. Don't worry.

544
00:31:10,771 --> 00:31:11,771
He might be in surgery.

545
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,370
Let's go ask Ms. Han.

546
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:14,731
Let's go.

547
00:31:14,731 --> 00:31:15,752
Alright.

548
00:31:16,051 --> 00:31:18,810
I checked and Dr. Qin
is not scheduled for surgery today.

549
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:22,090
Could it be added at the last minute?

550
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,731
That's not possible. If there was,
there would be a record here.

551
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,291
Now, for the patient,

552
00:31:28,531 --> 00:31:30,650
the aneurysm
is like a ticking time bomb.

553
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,650
She's in urgent need of surgery.

554
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,531
I hear it requires
interventional surgery.

555
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,090
Yes, the location
of her aneurysm is a bit off,

556
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:42,971
which requires a very high standard
for the chief surgeon.

557
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:45,731
Chief Zhao
is the most experienced in this aspect.

558
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:49,011
Yes, I am trying to get his help.

559
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,330
Okay, you must hurry up.

560
00:31:51,691 --> 00:31:52,971
The patient's condition is not stable.

561
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,971
I suggest keeping her
hospitalized for observation.

562
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,480
I'll prepare for it right away.

563
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,410
All right.

564
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:58,931
Thank you.

565
00:31:58,931 --> 00:31:59,912
Okay.

566
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:01,890
Dr. Li.

567
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,856
Dr. Mi.

568
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:06,451
Were you discussing a patient
with Dr. Qin just now?

569
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:09,251
Right. Maybe it's a friend of his,

570
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,810
planning hospitalization.

571
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,330
Thanks.

572
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,216
You're welcome.

573
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:21,531
Don't worry. I'll help you look for him.

574
00:32:21,931 --> 00:32:23,570
Yunsheng wouldn't just wander off.

575
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:35,211
Mrs. Zhou, where are you?

576
00:32:35,731 --> 00:32:36,648
I'm okay.

577
00:32:37,451 --> 00:32:38,610
I'm shopping.

578
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,691
Shopping?

579
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,090
Then why didn't you answer your phone?

580
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,890
Shouldn't you be with Mrs. Li?

581
00:32:44,971 --> 00:32:46,691
I saw a pretty flower garden,

582
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,130
so I went for a visit

583
00:32:48,691 --> 00:32:50,931
and accidentally lost track of time.

584
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,370
Where's the flower garden?
I'll come pick you up.

585
00:32:54,491 --> 00:32:55,650
Don't come over.

586
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:59,531
I'm already on the way back in a taxi.

587
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,251
Then where are you now?

588
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:03,610
How about this?
You take a picture for me.

589
00:33:03,971 --> 00:33:05,650
Make sure the driver
doesn't drive the wrong way.

590
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,691
I'm not a child.

591
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,291
You go about your business.

592
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,810
Okay. Just let me know
when you get home.

593
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,531
Alright, I am hanging up now. Bye.

594
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:22,472
Your mom is found?

595
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:24,008
Yes.

596
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,731
Thank you for today, Dr. Zhang.

597
00:33:27,051 --> 00:33:28,008
It's okay.

598
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,130
You can go back to work.

599
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,251
Call me if you're in need.

600
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:32,610
Okay, thank you.

601
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:32,971
Take care.

602
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:33,896
Okay, bye.

603
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,592
Yunsheng.

604
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,192
Mi Bai.

605
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:46,291
You are here too.

606
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,251
Yes, you are too.

607
00:33:48,971 --> 00:33:50,771
You are buying stuff
for Mrs. Zhou's hospital stay?

608
00:33:51,016 --> 00:33:51,880
Yes.

609
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,936
I will help you pick.

610
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,971
No, thanks.
I've bought almost everything.

611
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,691
By the way,
there's something I need to tell you.

612
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:01,771
I know Mrs. Zhou's hospital stay
can't be put off anymore.

613
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:04,011
But I had my dad ask Chief Zhao,

614
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,370
and he flatly refused.

615
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,048
It's okay. I have other methods.

616
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:12,264
What methods?

617
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,851
I failed in a businesslike manner.

618
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,730
I know he likes to play badminton.

619
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,090
I can invite him to play.

620
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,730
That's a good solution.

621
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:23,610
Playing some games
to build rapport is a good idea.

622
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,650
I'll help you make
an appointment with him.

623
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:29,971
Okay, then please arrange it
as soon as possible.

624
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,096
Sure, no problem. Let's go.

625
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,704
Yunsheng, I have made
an appointment with Chief Zhao.

626
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:11,690
Really? When?

627
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,371
He has a game tomorrow morning.

628
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:14,451
Can you make it?

629
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:16,411
Tomorrow morning.

630
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,130
Do you have any other plans?

631
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:23,130
Su Ying will have a competition.
I'm going to accompany her.

632
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,250
If it's inconvenient,

633
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,730
I'll see if I can reschedule it.

634
00:35:31,891 --> 00:35:33,331
No need. Let's stick to tomorrow.

635
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,210
The sooner the surgery, the better.

636
00:35:36,531 --> 00:35:39,891
By the way, I wanted to send
a message to Su Ying to cheer her up.

637
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,851
But I am the person
in charge of the project.

638
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:43,851
She's a bidder.

639
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,250
It doesn't seem appropriate
to send messages in private.

640
00:35:46,931 --> 00:35:47,944
I understand.

641
00:35:48,531 --> 00:35:50,650
Could you pass on my encouragement?

642
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,051
Okay, I will definitely convey it.

643
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,610
Mrs. Zhou, I brought you some daily...

644
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,472
Dr. Qin.

645
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,250
Where's she?

646
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,570
She just left.

647
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:03,451
She left?

648
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:05,544
Yeah, she said she was going home
and asked you not to worry.

649
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,610
She asked me
to return this phone to you.

650
00:36:11,756 --> 00:36:13,708
(WeChat messages from Su Ying,
Missed calls from Su Ying)

651
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,610
Hello?

652
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,570
You were looking for me?

653
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:41,288
I couldn't find my mom just now,
but now I've found her.

654
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,051
That's good.

655
00:36:44,931 --> 00:36:46,011
Is she at home?

656
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,331
I just called you.

657
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,011
Why didn't you pick it up?

658
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,090
I was performing surgery just now.

659
00:36:55,811 --> 00:36:56,776
I couldn't check the phone.

660
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,491
Did you have surgery today?

661
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,451
Yes, it was sudden.

662
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,210
You seem busy today.

663
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,170
You sound tired.

664
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:13,170
Are you very busy today?

665
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:16,392
It's okay.

666
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:18,971
You take good care of your patients.

Mrs. Zhou, why did you come back?
Get back to the hospital.

677
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:28,610
I'm really fine.

678
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:32,331
You're not in a stable condition.
You must stay in hospital.

679
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,891
I can't stand the smell of the hospital.

680
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,531
Wearing a patient's uniform all day.

681
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,011
Needles and drips.

682
00:38:38,331 --> 00:38:39,851
I really can't take it.

683
00:38:40,971 --> 00:38:42,170
Mrs. Zhou, tell me the truth.

684
00:38:42,411 --> 00:38:43,531
Are you afraid of the surgery?

685
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,090
Avoidance can't solve anything.

686
00:38:47,331 --> 00:38:49,371
And the sooner you have surgery
with your condition,

687
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,570
the higher the success rate.

688
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,851
Qin, I promise

689
00:38:54,451 --> 00:38:55,811
I'll go back with you for treatment.

690
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,170
But Su will compete tomorrow.

691
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,090
If I let her know about
my illness at this time,

692
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,051
she will definitely be in a mess.

693
00:39:13,371 --> 00:39:16,011
Don't worry. Once Su finishes
the competition tomorrow,

694
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,371
I will go back with you.

695
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:20,210
I'm begging you.

696
00:39:24,891 --> 00:39:25,851
Don't tell her.

697
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,411
Su is back.

698
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:30,770
- Mom.
- Wash your hands and eat.

699
00:39:31,491 --> 00:39:32,371
I'll put away my bag.

700
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,811
You have worked hard.

701
00:39:40,971 --> 00:39:42,451
Eat soup.

702
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,570
Thank you, Mom.

703
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,650
Give me, Qin.

704
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,608
Thank you, Mrs. Zhou.

705
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:47,851
The competition is tomorrow?

706
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,011
Feeling nervous?

707
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:57,491
Take it easy. My daughter is the best.

708
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:01,491
How's the plan preparation?

709
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:03,368
It's fine.

710
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,931
I couldn't contact you today.

711
00:40:08,331 --> 00:40:10,051
Were you in surgery with someone?

712
00:40:17,011 --> 00:40:20,872
Yes, who else could it be
besides Director Ruan?

713
00:40:24,331 --> 00:40:25,411
It was all my fault today.

714
00:40:25,811 --> 00:40:27,451
I lost track of time while shopping.

715
00:40:27,811 --> 00:40:30,931
I'll watch my phone at all times.

716
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:33,811
Ying, eat a lot.

717
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,051
Not having an appetite?

718
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:49,448
I'm okay.

719
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,250
If you don't have an appetite,

720
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,411
let's go out to eat
after the competition tomorrow.

721
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,008
Okay.

722
00:40:57,451 --> 00:40:58,371
Let's talk tomorrow.

723
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:01,384
Alright.

724
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,290
By the way, Mi Bai
asked me to cheer you on.

725
00:41:11,811 --> 00:41:12,770
Cheering me on?

726
00:41:14,971 --> 00:41:16,770
Why did she let you say it to me?

727
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,891
She didn't mean anything else.

728
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,931
She said your relationship was subtle
and that private contact

729
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,491
wasn't suitable.

730
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:27,432
Yes, it's quite subtle.

731
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,531
After all, it's a good intention.

732
00:41:35,531 --> 00:41:36,552
I'm not eating,

733
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,272
I'm going to the studio.
There's plan modification work.

734
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:40,491
Eat more.

735
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:41,704
No.

736
00:41:44,011 --> 00:41:47,051
What's wrong with Su?
She doesn't seem to be in a good mood.

737
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,811
Don't worry. Go to bed early
after you finish eating.

738
00:41:51,451 --> 00:41:52,584
I will go keep her company.

739
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,672
Okay.

740
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:58,290
Haven't you contributed to
the hospital project she is in?

741
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,811
How come only she can use it
as an entry

742
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,120
but you can't?

743
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:04,371
Or you're willing

744
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,331
to be her stepping stone forever?

745
00:43:12,531 --> 00:43:13,451
Are you sure

746
00:43:14,051 --> 00:43:15,851
that Tian Mei's plan
will win over SU's tomorrow?

747
00:43:16,331 --> 00:43:18,610
Don't worry. I chose to use Tian Mei,

748
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:20,931
because she definitely
has unique advantages.

749
00:43:22,344 --> 00:43:24,130
Alright, then I feel relieved.

750
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,411
The other designer is on her way.

751
00:43:46,531 --> 00:43:47,496
She will be here soon.

752
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:03,784
Here is the other designer, Tian Mei.

753
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:07,496
