=Episode 27=

17
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:47,932
You've been working hard.

18
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:49,772
I've looked over the plan.
It is not too bad.

19
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:52,531
But let's optimize it a bit today.

20
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,492
This is what we have accomplished
after our research at the hospital.

21
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:56,456
Take a look.

22
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:02,412
Well...

23
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:09,051
I remember
the hospital's review committee saying

24
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:12,132
that the most important thing
this time is to present humanistic care.

25
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:14,451
So, that is the key point
of the second round.

26
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:17,651
Our plan this time,
although quite complete,

27
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:18,812
I think,

28
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:20,731
it's not good enough.

29
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:21,992
Let's think about it again.

30
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:23,572
Yunsheng is sick.

31
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:24,931
I came to help him ask for leave.

32
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:27,171
Could you tell the director for me?

33
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:28,232
Yisen,

34
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:29,852
did you see Yunsheng?

35
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:30,812
I need to talk to him.

36
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:32,012
He's sick,

37
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:33,572
so I'm here to ask for leave for him.

38
00:02:33,852 --> 00:02:34,792
He's sick?

39
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:35,891
Nothing serious.

40
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:36,931
Just a decline in immunity.

41
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:38,771
Oh, right, I got some medicine.

42
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,132
I'll bring this to the glass house.

43
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:42,692
He moved back there?

44
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:46,292
I didn't know
until I sent him there yesterday.

45
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:50,491
How about I bring the medicine to him?

46
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:52,451
I want to talk to him
about something anyway.

47
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:55,532
Alright, then you bring it to him.

48
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:57,731
Don't forget to remind him
to take a good rest.

49
00:02:58,132 --> 00:02:58,984
Rest assured.

50
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:00,051
I'm leaving.

51
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:00,904
Okay.

52
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:11,572
Did you gain anything
from your research at the hospital?

53
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,412
I'll go first.

54
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:15,771
I think the most humane thing
is the self-service machine.

55
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:18,331
It saves time and eliminates
the need for queuing.

56
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:19,611
I think public hospitals

57
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:22,611
should incorporate
these features of convenience.

58
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:25,000
It's not innovative enough.

59
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,012
Self-service platforms
are now very common.

60
00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:28,771
I think it's better

61
00:03:29,012 --> 00:03:32,532
to emphasize slow living
in the overall layout.

62
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:34,171
It is a strong feature

63
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:36,451
that public welfare hospitals
can demonstrate.

64
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:39,931
The idea is great,

65
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,171
but we can't possibly

66
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:43,651
turn a public welfare hospital
into a paradise.

67
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:44,776
No, we can't.

68
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:46,132
Ying,

69
00:03:46,532 --> 00:03:49,812
the theme of humanistic care
is a bit too broad.

70
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:52,812
Do you have any good suggestions?

71
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:58,651
To tell you the truth,

72
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:00,771
after my mother fell ill this time,

73
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:02,451
I thought a lot.

74
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:05,852
I think since we want to do it,

75
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:09,252
we'd better

76
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:11,931
truly consider some issues
from the perspective

77
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:13,412
of patients or their families.

78
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:56,424
Mi Bai.

79
00:04:57,932 --> 00:04:59,451
Yunsheng, you're awake.

80
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,172
I heard you were ill,

81
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,492
so I specially came to cook
and bought some medicine

82
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:04,692
for you.

83
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:07,451
After you finish your meal,
take the medicine,

84
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:08,812
then you will get better soon.

85
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:11,272
It's okay. I'm much better.

86
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:13,411
You must be too tired these days.

87
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:15,531
If you need help in the future,

88
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:16,572
don't hesitate to tell me.

89
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:19,052
Mi Bai, you've had a busy day.

90
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:20,572
Go back and rest early.

91
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:22,536
I'm okay.

92
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:24,612
And it has been a long time

93
00:05:24,812 --> 00:05:26,531
since anyone lived here.

94
00:05:26,732 --> 00:05:27,732
I'll help you clean it up.

95
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:30,760
Mi Bai.

96
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:33,608
You really don't have to.

97
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:36,531
In fact, I came this time

98
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:38,451
also to bring a piece
of good news to you.

99
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:39,891
Su Ying's mother woke up?

100
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:41,672
No.

101
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:44,531
The list
of the dispatched personnel is out.

102
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:47,132
You're on it.
It will be announced tomorrow.

103
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:51,944
Yunsheng,

104
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,651
you should know this opportunity

105
00:05:53,732 --> 00:05:56,052
is very important for your career.

106
00:05:58,612 --> 00:05:59,496
I know that.

107
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,448
But now, I don't want

108
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:02,891
to think about it.

109
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:05,291
Is it because of Su Ying?

110
00:06:10,172 --> 00:06:12,291
To sacrifice your career

111
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,411
for a relationship
that has already ended

112
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:16,612
is not worth it.

113
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:19,052
We are just temporarily separated.

114
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:21,091
After Mrs. Zhou wakes up,

115
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:22,651
we will make up.

116
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:25,132
You still want to win her back?

117
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:28,132
It was she who wanted to break up.

118
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:29,971
But I haven't agreed yet.

119
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:37,851
Alright, it's quite late now.

120
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:39,172
You have to officiate tomorrow.

121
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:40,492
Go back and rest.

122
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:42,052
As for the posting...

123
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,252
Now I only want Mrs. Zhou to wake up.

124
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:46,760
I don't have the energy

125
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:48,572
to think about other things.

126
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,891
Let me know when you're ready.

127
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:56,651
Get home safe.

128
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:01,132
Remember to take your medicine.

129
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,052
Hello, Dad.

130
00:07:53,612 --> 00:07:55,132
Can we move up
the date for the dispatch?

131
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:02,451
Yes, the sooner, the better.

132
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:08,771
This is from your favorite restaurant.

133
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:10,252
But I don't know if the taste

134
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:12,012
is the same when it's taken out.

135
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:14,696
Try it.

136
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:25,192
How is it?

137
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:26,331
Still the same taste.

138
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:28,552
Right.

139
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:32,691
Here's some information
I got from the designer

140
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:33,531
of the Tongji Hospital.

141
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:35,411
It's about the hospital's design.

142
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:36,531
See if it can help you.

143
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:40,852
I'm going to take care of Mrs. Zhou.

144
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:42,931
You focus on preparing for the pitching.

145
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,212
Don't worry. I'm around.

146
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:46,492
You're always good to me.

147
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:50,252
Slow down.

148
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:52,811
Have you been skipping
meals again recently?

149
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:56,171
Time waits for no one.

150
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:58,691
Tian Mei is an opportunist.

151
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:00,132
She will give it her all.

152
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,571
There's no way I will lose to her.

153
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,252
We always say parents

154
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:09,732
are the most important people to us.

155
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:12,811
But we often put off spending time

156
00:09:12,972 --> 00:09:14,972
with them for other things.

157
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:18,732
We always feel like we will have
the opportunity after we're done.

158
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:21,012
Life is short.

159
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:22,972
If it's occupied by other things,

160
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:24,452
there won't be time left for them.

161
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:27,291
In this way, time slips away.

162
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:35,252
Don't worry.
Mrs. Zhou will definitely be fine.

163
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:37,864
Yes, she will.

164
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,811
How's it going with Dr. Qin?
Still the same?

165
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:47,051
Have you ever made
some time to have a talk?

166
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:53,672
No.

167
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:58,012
There's no time for that.

168
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:00,492
Let me finish the task at hand first.

169
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:03,560
So he doesn't know
Mi Bai once gave you a hard time?

170
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:05,448
It doesn't matter anymore.

171
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:07,931
But I think you should let him know.

172
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:11,411
After all, he's the reason you got
involved in the hospital project.

173
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:12,972
It's not all for him.

174
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:14,891
If I finish the project well,

175
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:17,771
that would be a pretty meaningful thing.

176
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:28,616
I'm done eating.

177
00:10:29,051 --> 00:10:30,171
I'll go back to prepare.

178
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:31,976
Wait a moment.

179
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,332
I've prepared something
for liver protection for you.

180
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:36,012
Remember to take it every day.

181
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:38,171
If there's anything, don't hold it in

182
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:39,291
and remember to call me.

183
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:41,416
Okay, I got it.

184
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:02,568
Dr. Qin.

185
00:11:02,771 --> 00:11:03,651
Huixuan.

186
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:05,372
Su is not here.
She went back to the studio.

187
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:08,972
I just came to visit Mrs. Zhou.

188
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:10,411
How is her recovery?

189
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:12,291
She's pretty stable,

190
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:14,252
except that she hasn't woken up yet.

191
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:17,411
It's okay. She just had surgery.

192
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:19,212
There's a recovery period.

193
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:20,771
She'll be all right.

194
00:11:23,811 --> 00:11:27,411
Can you please pass this on
to Su Ying for me?

195
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:28,852
(Rehabilitation Manual)

196
00:11:28,852 --> 00:11:30,771
There's a lot you need
to care about after her surgery.

197
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:32,012
It's all written in it.

198
00:11:32,612 --> 00:11:33,811
I hope it can be helpful.

199
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:36,252
Why don't you give it to her yourself?

200
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:39,496
I...

201
00:11:42,132 --> 00:11:45,332
Fine. I don't want
to meddle in your business.

202
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:48,291
But just from the thickness
of this notebook you have written,

203
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:49,531
I can tell

204
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:51,811
that you still care about Su a lot.

205
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,931
Since you both have
each other in your hearts,

206
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,732
why not open up and speak your mind?

207
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:57,411
Too many things have happened lately.

208
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,411
Su Ying's been preoccupied
with her mother's condition.

209
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,291
Let's wait until all this is over.

210
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:03,811
I'll have a good talk with Su Ying.

211
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,771
Fine, if you need help

212
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:08,931
during the time, just let me know.

213
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:10,452
I'll send this to her for you.

214
00:12:10,612 --> 00:12:11,592
Thank you.

215
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:16,296
You look a little pale too.
Remember to rest.

216
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,792
Don't worry. I'm leaving now.

217
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:28,372
Based on our previous discussions,
in this plan,

218
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,531
I greatly reduce the surface area
of the glass walls and windows.

219
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:33,864
In the remaining few glass partitions,

220
00:12:33,864 --> 00:12:36,891
I integrate the built-in blinds
that can be opened and closed freely

221
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:39,931
to maximize our respect
for patient privacy.

222
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:46,252
What our hospital
is most concerned about in this bid

223
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:47,891
is the humanistic care for patients.

224
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,012
I wonder what you
think of this, Miss Tian.

225
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:54,771
I intend to, on the existing basis,

226
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:57,252
add a heartbeat phone booth.

227
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:00,252
A heartbeat phone booth?

228
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,600
Everyone, please look.

229
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:06,332
This is a separate rest room
for patients.

230
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:07,732
We all know

231
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:10,732
that patients can't leave
the hospital in most cases.

232
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:15,171
This heartbeat booth is a place
for them to relax their mind.

233
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:16,771
That's a good idea.

234
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:19,051
We've collected hundreds

235
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:20,952
of public audio materials
from various channels.

236
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:22,452
Patients pick up the handset

237
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:25,132
and then they can hear
different heartbeats

238
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,651
such as a child's heartbeat,

239
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,571
the heartbeat during sleep,

240
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,252
the heartbeat when kissing,

241
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:32,452
the heartbeat when running,

242
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,732
and even the heartbeats
of some small animals.

243
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:38,372
I believe that such energetic sounds

244
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,811
can give them strength.

245
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:43,571
This idea is quite novel.

246
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:44,212
Yes.

247
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:46,332
And it has
a certain scientific significance.

248
00:13:46,972 --> 00:13:47,976
Thank you, Miss Tian.

249
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,512
Thank you.

250
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:53,864
Miss Su, it's your turn.

251
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:17,931
The heartbeat booth mentioned
in Tian Mei's plan just now

252
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,252
deeply impressed me.

253
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:22,092
When I was designing
for the KNK Building before,

254
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:23,972
I designed a white noise booth.

255
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:26,732
The purpose was to let urban workers

256
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:28,452
be able to hear the sounds of nature.

257
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:30,691
Although, at that time,

258
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:34,252
many people, including me,
thought it was very remarkable,

259
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:35,571
judging by the follow-ups

260
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:37,691
a few years later,

261
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,171
I have to admit

262
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:42,651
such space in a functional building

263
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:44,612
is actually quite superfluous.

264
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:49,576
Miss Su,

265
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,092
it's easy to negate others,

266
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,171
but at least I made
an effort in humanistic care.

267
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:57,012
I wonder what kind of design

268
00:14:57,332 --> 00:15:00,771
you think is considered to take care
of patients' emotional needs.

269
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:07,372
The biggest uniqueness
of a public welfare hospital

270
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:10,252
is that its medical resources
are extremely valuable.

271
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:12,811
Instead of building a gorgeous space,

272
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:14,452
it's more practical to add an extra ward

273
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:16,571
or another bed.

274
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:18,452
The premise of my plan is

275
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:20,811
not to occupy the wards.

276
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:25,571
My design is more about using the walls
of the hospital to reflect this concept,

277
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:27,811
such as those of a stairwell.

278
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:35,452
This is the rendering
of a stairwell in my plan.

279
00:15:36,132 --> 00:15:38,171
At first glance,
it seems ordinary, doesn't it?

280
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:40,252
Okay, let's look at it again.

281
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:43,368
(Design rendering)
(Hospital staircase)

282
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:48,328
This is interesting.

283
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,448
This is good.

284
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:58,372
When patients have a mental breakdown
in the hospital,

285
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,771
(they generally want
to find a quiet place)

286
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:02,811
(to calm their emotions.)

287
00:16:03,332 --> 00:16:06,212
(Stairwells are actually
the best choice.)

288
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,212
(My idea of healing)

289
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:11,212
(is not just about the body,)

290
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:13,171
(but also about emotional wellness.)

291
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:17,691
We can create a graffiti wall
in the space where patients often go

292
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:19,372
when they are mentally collapsing

293
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:21,492
so that they can write
words of encouragement or comfort

294
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:23,372
for themselves or for each other.

295
00:16:24,212 --> 00:16:25,972
While they're releasing their emotions,

296
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:28,771
the messages from the patients
can transform into strength

297
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:32,651
and become each other's faith
and courage through time.

298
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:34,891
I think this is feasible.

299
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:36,372
Yes. This is good.

300
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:37,452
Right.

301
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:38,312
Dr. Mi,

302
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:40,811
you must have seen patients
or their families zoning out

303
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:42,571
in a stairwell, haven't you?

304
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,412
(Thank you for listening.)

305
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:18,492
That's all for me. Thank you.

306
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:21,331
Miss Su's design is more practical.

307
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:23,012
Let's vote now.

308
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:24,811
Yes.

309
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:27,892
We have also been pondering
how to make patients

310
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,331
accept the fact that they are ill.

311
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:32,776
I vote for Miss Su.

312
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:34,892
Me too.

313
00:17:40,012 --> 00:17:42,012
I vote for the SU Design Firm.

314
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:49,576
So,

315
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:52,571
the design proposal
for the public welfare hospital project

316
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,492
will be done by the SU Design Firm.

317
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:05,732
Thank you all for your approval.

318
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:08,412
I will definitely live up to your trust

319
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:11,012
and perfectly implement this design.

320
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:20,012
It seems we are destined
to work together.

321
00:18:20,771 --> 00:18:22,012
I said I would not lose.

322
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:37,068
(Mingshi: Ying won the pitching.)

323
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:50,291
Watch out!

324
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,208
I...

325
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:52,328
Mingshi.

326
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:54,376
- How is it?
- How is it?

327
00:18:57,972 --> 00:18:58,856
We lost?

328
00:19:00,652 --> 00:19:03,371
We really didn't pass?

329
00:19:06,051 --> 00:19:07,252
- How could it happen?
- It's okay.

330
00:19:07,652 --> 00:19:09,091
We have worked so hard for so long.

331
00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:11,771
It's okay. We've tried our best, right?

332
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:15,692
Because we are so strong,

333
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:17,892
we won in the end.

334
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:20,811
You scared us to death!

335
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:21,851
You scared us to death!

336
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:23,172
Let's celebrate.

337
00:19:25,252 --> 00:19:26,212
I was worried sick.

338
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:27,732
I knew that Ying was invincible.

339
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:30,131
Tian Mei must admit
her defeat this time.

340
00:19:31,252 --> 00:19:32,200
So

341
00:19:32,892 --> 00:19:34,611
all of our efforts are worth it.

342
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:38,091
Now we can focus on
the hospital project.

343
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:41,371
Yes, we will do better
this time for sure.

344
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:45,172
Ying said you two
have worked hard during this period

345
00:19:45,492 --> 00:19:47,091
and asked me to treat you two

346
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,291
to a good meal.

347
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:50,972
But it's such a happy thing.

348
00:19:51,131 --> 00:19:52,531
Doesn't Ying want to eat with us?

349
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,412
Are you stupid?
Ying's mother is still sick.

350
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,611
She definitely doesn't
have the mood now.

351
00:19:58,056 --> 00:20:01,652
She went back to take care of Mrs. Zhou
as soon as the pitching ended.

352
00:20:04,692 --> 00:20:05,640
Then

353
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,492
we're...

354
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:08,771
Going for something delicious!

355
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:14,172
How is it? Has my mother woken up?

356
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,692
You won the pitching?

357
00:20:27,771 --> 00:20:28,648
Yes.

358
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:32,732
I knew Tian Mei
definitely couldn't beat you.

359
00:20:35,252 --> 00:20:36,531
Okay, it's all done.

360
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:37,692
Go back and rest now.

361
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:38,600
You've had hard days.

362
00:20:39,811 --> 00:20:41,652
I think I should stay and accompany you.

363
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,932
It's really not necessary.
Go back to sleep.

364
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:47,051
I might have to call you
to cover for me sometime later.

365
00:20:47,051 --> 00:20:49,131
I'm not being polite to you. Go back.

366
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:50,056
Go back home now.

367
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:51,368
Okay.

368
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:54,344
This is what Dr. Qin asked me

369
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:57,131
to give you.

370
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:03,180
(Rehabilitation Manual)

371
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:08,252
I feel he is quite concerned about you.

372
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:12,552
I'm leaving now.

373
00:21:20,264 --> 00:21:21,228
(Rehabilitation Manual)

374
00:21:21,228 --> 00:21:24,780
(2. Rehabilitation training)
(3. Hygiene care)

375
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:48,040
Mom,

376
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:50,531
I have good news for you.

377
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:54,012
I won the pitching today.

378
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:56,851
I'm especially happy

379
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:59,571
because it is
for a public welfare hospital

380
00:22:00,012 --> 00:22:01,811
and can help so many people.

381
00:22:03,051 --> 00:22:04,732
Wake up soon,

382
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:06,131
so we can celebrate together.

383
00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:17,331
You've seldom praised me to my face,

384
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:21,172
but I know you're actually
very proud of me inside.

385
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:22,888
Aren't you?

386
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,091
You always criticized me,

387
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,091
but I got my temper from you.

388
00:22:30,972 --> 00:22:32,771
Your genes are really strong.

389
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,264
Mom.

390
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:39,331
Mom, are you awake?

391
00:22:43,972 --> 00:22:44,872
Mom.

392
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:49,252
That's great.

393
00:22:57,012 --> 00:22:57,928
You lost.

394
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:03,492
I lost in one segment.

395
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:07,771
But still, you lost.

396
00:23:08,131 --> 00:23:10,212
Mr. Yang, please give me another chance.

397
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:11,692
I can turn things around.

398
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:13,932
I can prove I'm superior to Su Ying.

399
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:17,771
A chance? There's a premise for me
to give you a chance.

400
00:23:19,252 --> 00:23:20,611
That is, you must win.

401
00:23:21,412 --> 00:23:23,880
But now, you have lost.

402
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,571
What right do you have

403
00:23:26,452 --> 00:23:27,492
to ask me for another chance?

404
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:30,664
Mr. Yang,

405
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:33,012
you can't kick down the ladder, can you?

406
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,892
It was you who encouraged me
to leave SU and start my own business.

407
00:23:35,972 --> 00:23:38,131
Miss Tian, watch your tongue.

408
00:23:38,692 --> 00:23:41,091
Leaving the SU Design Firm
was your own decision.

409
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:42,331
It had nothing to do with me.

410
00:23:46,811 --> 00:23:49,452
Forget it. It's not a disgrace
to lose to Su Ying.

411
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:50,972
You're smart.

412
00:23:51,452 --> 00:23:52,652
There'll be chances in the future.

413
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:01,732
Thank you, Mr. Yang.
I'll wait for further notice.

414
00:24:07,972 --> 00:24:10,892
This is what I want.
Thank you, Miss Du.

415
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,416
The people recommended
by Mingming are always right.

416
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,371
I serve at your pleasure.

417
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:19,012
Here's the coconut milk, Weiwei.
Ice-free and sugar-free.

418
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:22,131
Thanks, Mingming.
You always remember my preferences.

419
00:24:22,932 --> 00:24:24,012
- So thoughtful.
- Yours.

420
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,771
By the way,
what are you going to do tonight?

421
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:28,652
Would you like to go camping with me?

422
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:32,932
C-C-Camping.

423
00:24:34,088 --> 00:24:36,412
I-I-I don't think
it's suitable for me to go.

424
00:24:38,492 --> 00:24:39,771
How about having dinner together?

425
00:24:41,131 --> 00:24:43,272
N-N-No, thanks.

426
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:44,488
I can't.

427
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:46,452
I know there's a new restaurant nearby.

428
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:49,371
I'll go and order something
for you guys to eat.

429
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,452
I'll leave you to chat.

430
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:54,452
He's shy.

431
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:57,851
I like such innocent boys.

432
00:24:58,131 --> 00:24:59,611
Are you sure he is shy?

433
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:02,771
But I hear he has a girlfriend.

434
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:04,811
A girlfriend?

435
00:25:05,452 --> 00:25:06,412
Since when?

436
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:07,851
I didn't hear him mention it.

437
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:10,932
It seems that they just
started dating not long ago.

438
00:25:12,492 --> 00:25:14,536
Maybe they don't want
to be too high profile.

439
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:16,571
You're not lying to me, are you?

440
00:25:17,492 --> 00:25:20,531
What kind of girl deserves
Mingming besides me?

441
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:23,892
But I hear

442
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:26,172
his girlfriend is a super beautiful girl

443
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:29,371
with taste, depth and style.

444
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:33,091
Anyway, she is
the perfect girlfriend type.

445
00:25:33,452 --> 00:25:34,371
Really?

446
00:25:34,732 --> 00:25:35,592
And I hear

447
00:25:36,131 --> 00:25:38,091
before he got together with that girl,

448
00:25:38,252 --> 00:25:39,692
he had been single for a long time.

449
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,160
Why?

450
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:44,811
He seemed to have been secretly
in love with her,

451
00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:46,811
but he was too shy to confess.

452
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:48,652
Finally, he plucked up the courage

453
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:49,972
but got rejected.

454
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:51,972
But he never gave it up.

455
00:25:52,452 --> 00:25:54,331
I didn't expect Mingming
to be so infatuated.

456
00:25:54,811 --> 00:25:56,172
The girl is his unattainable love?

457
00:25:57,012 --> 00:25:58,091
I guess so.

458
00:25:58,972 --> 00:26:01,692
He had a crush on her
for four or five years anyway.

459
00:26:04,012 --> 00:26:06,412
Why are all the good men someone else's?

460
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:09,531
After hearing what you said,
I really want to meet that girl.

461
00:26:10,811 --> 00:26:12,611
- What a coincidence.
- Here comes the food!

462
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:13,800
What were you talking about?

463
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:17,992
Give me your hand.

464
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:23,912
You two.

465
00:26:24,811 --> 00:26:27,091
Yes, I am his girlfriend.

466
00:26:30,012 --> 00:26:32,291
If you're satisfied with the video,

467
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:34,331
I'll go on a date with my boyfriend.

468
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:37,531
Okay, you guys go ahead.

469
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:39,172
Let's go.

470
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:40,136
Bye, Weiwei.

471
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,252
What were you talking
to Weiwei about just now?

472
00:26:51,531 --> 00:26:53,452
You were ready
to make our relationship public?

473
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:57,331
It's nothing,
just appropriately using my identity

474
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:59,291
to help you avoid a bad wooer.

475
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:01,544
I see now.

476
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:05,131
Are you trying to attract other women?

477
00:27:05,452 --> 00:27:08,972
Are you jealous?

478
00:27:10,571 --> 00:27:11,624
No, I'm not.

479
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:14,811
Don't worry. I won't and I don't dare.

480
00:27:16,131 --> 00:27:17,172
That's more like it.

481
00:27:19,892 --> 00:27:21,851
How about going camping tomorrow?

482
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:23,048
Camping.

483
00:27:24,452 --> 00:27:26,531
Alright, whatever you want to do,
I'll accompany you.

484
00:27:27,051 --> 00:27:28,091
As long as I can be with you.

485
00:27:35,811 --> 00:27:36,936
Hello, check, please.

486
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:39,880
140, scan here please.

487
00:27:41,832 --> 00:27:42,692
Done.

488
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:43,592
Hello.

489
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,291
Let me introduce myself.
I'm the owner here.

490
00:27:47,652 --> 00:27:48,771
They all call me Hai.

491
00:27:49,571 --> 00:27:50,571
Hello.

492
00:27:50,571 --> 00:27:52,771
Is our food not to your taste?

493
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:55,732
How about I give you a little gift

494
00:27:55,972 --> 00:27:56,932
to express my apologies?

495
00:27:57,652 --> 00:27:58,972
No need. It's personal.

496
00:27:59,252 --> 00:28:00,168
Just take it.

497
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:01,992
Yeah.

498
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:03,771
When you're feeling down,

499
00:28:04,091 --> 00:28:05,692
listening to the sound
in a conch is healing.

500
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:07,016
Try it.

501
00:28:07,331 --> 00:28:08,296
Really?

502
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:16,371
There really is a sound.

503
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:17,672
I didn't lie to you, did I?

504
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:19,131
The sound of the sea breeze.

505
00:28:20,692 --> 00:28:21,972
You're giving it to me?

506
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:23,304
Yes, it's yours.

507
00:28:23,732 --> 00:28:24,611
Well, thank you.

508
00:28:24,932 --> 00:28:27,172
Can I buy you another drink?

509
00:28:27,752 --> 00:28:28,732
Alright.

510
00:28:28,732 --> 00:28:30,531
I'll go get the beer.

511
00:28:30,972 --> 00:28:32,492
Your hand is unlike any other
I've ever seen.

512
00:28:32,932 --> 00:28:34,172
Do you know why? Let me tell you.

513
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:35,452
Look at this character.

514
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:37,091
That's why they call you Hai.

515
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:37,732
Yes.

516
00:28:37,892 --> 00:28:40,012
Look at you now at this little beach

517
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,012
and running this little barbecue stall.

518
00:28:42,152 --> 00:28:43,051
Am I right?

519
00:28:43,252 --> 00:28:44,851
Yes, I'm thinking about
buying an apartment.

520
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:46,172
I didn't notice it, Hai.

521
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:48,291
Look at your big earlobes.
They signify wealth.

522
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:50,792
And the watch. This big ring.

523
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:52,051
You are really something.

524
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:55,172
- Right?
- Yes. Where is your house exactly?

525
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:57,172
Hold on for a few more days.

526
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:58,811
You can't eat yet.

527
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:01,012
Once you're better,
I will treat you to a big meal.

528
00:29:07,172 --> 00:29:08,104
Su,

529
00:29:09,892 --> 00:29:10,811
you've had

530
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:12,811
hard days.

531
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:15,692
Mom, what are you
talking about? It's not hard.

532
00:29:18,412 --> 00:29:19,368
Where is Qin?

533
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:25,611
Did you have a fight?

534
00:29:27,051 --> 00:29:29,371
It's nothing. Mom, you just woke up.

535
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:31,252
You need to conserve
your strength and not talk.

536
00:29:35,811 --> 00:29:36,732
Don't blame him.

537
00:29:37,851 --> 00:29:40,131
It was I who didn't let him tell you.

538
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,531
Su, you misunderstood Qin.

539
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:57,972
Qin, if it were any other time,
I'd be okay with it.

540
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:00,291
But now it's Su's critical moment
of her competition.

541
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,732
She's already working very hard.

542
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:05,652
I don't want to distract her.

543
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,452
I couldn't reach you all day today.

544
00:30:09,012 --> 00:30:10,611
Were you in surgery with someone?

545
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:18,696
Yes.

546
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:21,704
Who else could it be? Director Ruan.

547
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:25,800
You woke up.

548
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:27,652
Hello, Chief Zhao.

549
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:29,864
Not bad.

550
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:31,212
Hello.

551
00:30:32,892 --> 00:30:34,811
The patient woke up on schedule.

552
00:30:35,012 --> 00:30:36,652
Her blood pressure
and EKG are all normal.

553
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:38,531
That's great.

554
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:40,732
Then our surgery
was completely successful.

555
00:30:41,452 --> 00:30:44,172
Now you just need
to get better and eat well.

556
00:30:44,652 --> 00:30:46,172
Yes. Thank you, Chief Zhao.

557
00:30:46,172 --> 00:30:47,048
You're welcome.

558
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,252
I wanted to give you

559
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:54,851
some notes during recovery.

560
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:57,932
There's no need. Look.

561
00:30:58,611 --> 00:30:59,732
It's all written thoroughly here.

562
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:02,291
Is it from Dr. Qin?

563
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:04,264
Yes.

564
00:31:05,172 --> 00:31:06,120
If I may say,

565
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:08,692
the person you should thank isn't me,

566
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:11,331
but Dr. Qin.

567
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:13,412
Without his sincerity,

568
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:15,212
I'd have retired and not performed it.

569
00:31:15,851 --> 00:31:18,531
Furthermore, on the day of the surgery,
he was in the operating room all along.

570
00:31:18,932 --> 00:31:19,892
He is really dedicated.

571
00:31:20,452 --> 00:31:22,632
Okay, come to me if you need anything.

572
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,652
Alright, thank you, Chief Zhao.

573
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:25,960
Take care.

574
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:34,652
You heard it.

575
00:31:35,452 --> 00:31:37,291
You're blaming Qin wrongly.

576
00:32:05,371 --> 00:32:06,376
Su Ying.

577
00:32:06,732 --> 00:32:09,512
Dr. Zhang, you came here for Dr. Qin?

578
00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:10,732
I brought some medicine.

579
00:32:11,571 --> 00:32:14,024
Medicine? What happened to him?

580
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:16,264
He'd been taking care of you
since you fainted a few days ago.

581
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:17,531
And Mrs. Zhou had surgery.

582
00:32:17,851 --> 00:32:19,144
He was so worried that he fell ill.

583
00:32:20,331 --> 00:32:21,331
Where is he now?

584
00:32:23,611 --> 00:32:24,488
He's not here?

585
00:32:25,732 --> 00:32:26,771
Then I wouldn't know.

586
00:32:31,371 --> 00:32:34,571
The hospital has recently promoted
a talent cultivation plan.

587
00:32:35,212 --> 00:32:37,291
We want to choose
some excellent young doctors

588
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:39,692
to go abroad for further education.

589
00:32:40,212 --> 00:32:41,131
You know about it, right?

590
00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:42,920
I do.

591
00:32:45,252 --> 00:32:46,216
Look,

592
00:32:47,452 --> 00:32:48,492
you're in it.

593
00:32:50,771 --> 00:32:51,611
Mi Bai told me.

594
00:32:52,091 --> 00:32:52,968
Really?

595
00:32:54,492 --> 00:32:57,692
Makes sense. She wouldn't be able
to keep such good news to herself.

596
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:00,291
People were all fighting

597
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:02,412
for the quota.

598
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:06,172
But you are indeed
the most suitable candidate.

599
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,771
Director, I think

600
00:33:10,652 --> 00:33:11,892
the overseas study plan

601
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:13,571
may not be suitable for me.

602
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:16,392
Why?

603
00:33:16,652 --> 00:33:20,652
The exchange isn't something
you've always wanted to do?

604
00:33:25,652 --> 00:33:28,771
Is it because it will take quite long

605
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:29,811
and you can't leave Su?

606
00:33:31,172 --> 00:33:32,291
But you must know this.

607
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:34,371
This opportunity is really rare.

608
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:37,412
Those are all first-class talents
in the world.

609
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:40,571
Think about it. After you come back
from further education,

610
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:43,051
whether it's for your specialty

611
00:33:43,531 --> 00:33:45,172
or for your future title evaluation,

612
00:33:45,452 --> 00:33:47,492
it will be of great use.

613
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,664
I know.

614
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:54,091
Well,

615
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:56,331
don't rush to answer me.

616
00:33:57,851 --> 00:34:00,412
Go back and think about it.
Is that alright?

617
00:34:01,932 --> 00:34:03,080
Alright.

618
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:06,088
I'm leaving now.

619
00:34:49,611 --> 00:34:50,568
Hey.

620
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:53,892
You're sick?

621
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:55,656
I'm already better now.

622
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:57,892
How are you and your mother?

623
00:34:59,211 --> 00:35:00,171
She has woken up.

624
00:35:01,012 --> 00:35:01,992
Where are you?

625
00:35:02,372 --> 00:35:03,571
I'm entering the operating room.

626
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:07,012
What are you calling me for?

627
00:35:07,852 --> 00:35:09,091
She has already told me.

628
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:12,332
She stopped you
from telling me she was sick.

629
00:35:13,852 --> 00:35:15,492
Yes, she didn't want you to be worried.

630
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:20,012
I thought I could
take good care of her for you,

631
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:22,051
but I ended up making you worry.

632
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:25,332
I'm sorry.

633
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,852
You've done a lot for me these days,

634
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:30,852
including persuading Chief Zhao.

635
00:35:32,372 --> 00:35:33,416
Thank you.

636
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,932
It's okay. You had been having trouble
eating and sleeping

637
00:35:37,372 --> 00:35:38,611
because of her illness.

638
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,412
I just wanted to take some
of the pressure off you.

639
00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:44,651
I was wrong before.

640
00:35:45,531 --> 00:35:46,452
I apologize to you.

641
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:49,864
It's okay.

642
00:35:51,412 --> 00:35:53,171
Hearing you say that
makes me very happy.

643
00:35:56,412 --> 00:35:58,091
Dr. Qin, the surgery is about to start.

644
00:35:59,272 --> 00:36:00,251
Okay.

645
00:36:00,251 --> 00:36:01,211
You go ahead.

646
00:36:01,211 --> 00:36:02,251
I'm going to look after my mom.

647
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:05,812
Okay. Once I'm done,
I'll go to see you and your mother.

648
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:07,176
Okay.

649
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:25,864
Director Ruan.

650
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:30,440
Su, how is your mother?
Has she woken up?

651
00:36:30,812 --> 00:36:32,412
Yes, the surgery was very successful.

652
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:35,892
That's great. Oh, right.
About the overseas education,

653
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:38,332
could you please help persuade
Yunsheng when you get back?

654
00:36:38,932 --> 00:36:40,852
I think this is
a really rare opportunity.

655
00:36:42,531 --> 00:36:43,432
Overseas education?

656
00:36:43,812 --> 00:36:46,332
The hospital plans to send
some outstanding young doctors abroad

657
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:47,492
for exchange.

658
00:36:47,932 --> 00:36:50,452
In other words, it's a training program.

659
00:36:52,772 --> 00:36:54,452
Hasn't Yunsheng told you

660
00:36:55,452 --> 00:36:56,972
such good news?

661
00:36:58,852 --> 00:36:59,784
No, he hasn't.

662
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:03,852
Director Ruan, is this opportunity
very important for Yunsheng?

663
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:06,972
Of course, everyone is fighting for it.

664
00:37:07,731 --> 00:37:10,852
After the exchange,
the hospital will definitely value them.

665
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:14,211
Besides, it will contribute to
the improvement of medical skills

666
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:16,372
and promotion opportunities
in the future.

667
00:37:16,932 --> 00:37:18,972
How long will it take?

668
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:21,611
Probably three years.

669
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:24,531
That's why Yunsheng is a bit hesitant.

670
00:37:24,892 --> 00:37:25,972
I can understand that.

671
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:28,492
You guys are in love after all.

672
00:37:29,012 --> 00:37:32,452
But I think it would be a pity
to miss the opportunity.

673
00:37:32,812 --> 00:37:35,691
You'd better have a discussion about it.

674
00:37:36,852 --> 00:37:38,292
Alright, Director. I understand.

675
00:37:38,932 --> 00:37:40,211
I'm going back to my work.

676
00:37:40,372 --> 00:37:41,892
Thank you, Director.

677
00:37:55,571 --> 00:37:56,932
Just leave it there. I'll do it later.

678
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:00,892
It's already late.
Why don't we pack it up tomorrow?

679
00:38:01,051 --> 00:38:02,211
We have time tomorrow anyway.

680
00:38:03,131 --> 00:38:04,611
Don't worry. I'll finish it soon.

681
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:06,051
Then we can sleep longer tomorrow.

682
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:09,372
Are you sleepy?

683
00:38:11,131 --> 00:38:12,731
You go to sleep first.

684
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,772
I'm going to bed?

685
00:38:15,012 --> 00:38:16,072
Sleep well.

686
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:17,251
I'm going to bed.

687
00:38:17,892 --> 00:38:20,091
I'm really going to sleep.

688
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:23,531
You're really going to sleep?
You're not going to keep me company?

689
00:38:23,531 --> 00:38:25,251
I'm very obedient.

690
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:27,752
Then give me a kiss.

691
00:38:31,772 --> 00:38:32,744
Who is it?

692
00:38:33,292 --> 00:38:34,492
Me.

693
00:38:35,892 --> 00:38:36,812
Su.

694
00:38:36,812 --> 00:38:37,672
Ying?

695
00:38:37,892 --> 00:38:39,012
Why is she here?

696
00:38:39,332 --> 00:38:40,812
W-W-What should we do?

697
00:38:40,812 --> 00:38:42,852
Don't worry. Hold steady.
You go talk to her.

698
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:44,012
I'll hide in the kitchen.

699
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:45,131
Go hide! Go!

700
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:48,892
Don't make a sound.

701
00:38:48,892 --> 00:38:51,492
Huixuan, hurry up.

702
00:38:52,892 --> 00:38:53,896
I'm coming!

703
00:38:55,611 --> 00:38:56,731
Close it!

704
00:39:00,812 --> 00:39:03,332
Why did you come so late?
Why didn't you call me?

705
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:05,051
I'm so annoyed.

706
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:06,344
What's wrong?

707
00:39:06,892 --> 00:39:09,051
Hasn't Mrs. Zhou already passed
the critical period?

708
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,372
It's not about my mom.

709
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:13,412
It's about Dr. Qin.

710
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:15,560
What's wrong with Dr. Qin?

711
00:39:16,131 --> 00:39:17,292
I heard from the hospital

712
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:20,012
he was selected for dispatch exchange.

713
00:39:20,171 --> 00:39:21,372
Ask him to stay!

714
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,131
Are you really letting him go?

715
00:39:23,772 --> 00:39:25,691
Of course, I want him to stay.

716
00:39:26,852 --> 00:39:28,892
But I also don't want
to hinder his career.

717
00:39:29,611 --> 00:39:31,251
Besides, I already broke up with him.

718
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:33,251
I don't know what he's thinking.

719
00:39:35,852 --> 00:39:36,852
What are you going to do now?

720
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:40,812
What else can I do?

721
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,412
Wait for him to decide.

722
00:39:43,412 --> 00:39:44,852
Only after he makes a decision

723
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:47,932
can I consider the future
between him and me.

724
00:39:52,372 --> 00:39:53,492
That's the only way.

725
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:05,972
It's pretty late. So sleepy.

726
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:07,452
I'm exhausted.

727
00:40:09,531 --> 00:40:10,531
I won't go home today.

728
00:40:10,932 --> 00:40:12,852
I'll sleep here. I don't want to return.

729
00:40:12,852 --> 00:40:13,864
No way!

730
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:15,412
Why not?

731
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:19,372
Mrs. Zhou just passed
the dangerous period.

732
00:40:19,611 --> 00:40:21,012
You should spend more time with her.

733
00:40:23,332 --> 00:40:24,328
That's true.

734
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:27,852
I'm indeed a bit worried about
leaving mom alone in the hospital.

735
00:40:28,932 --> 00:40:29,972
Okay, I'll go back.

736
00:40:36,091 --> 00:40:37,211
You bought a tent?

737
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:38,772
Are you going camping?

738
00:40:40,292 --> 00:40:41,211
Yes.

739
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:43,171
When are you going?
Bring me along.

740
00:40:43,452 --> 00:40:44,531
I want to distract myself.

741
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,640
No.

742
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:47,176
Why not?

743
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:48,492
I'm saying

744
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:50,571
you should go with me.

745
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:53,091
You're the best.

746
00:40:54,691 --> 00:40:55,688
I'm leaving.

747
00:40:57,972 --> 00:40:58,892
Take care of Mrs. Zhou.

748
00:40:58,892 --> 00:40:59,848
Tell me when you get there.

749
00:41:07,496 --> 00:41:08,452
She left?

750
00:41:09,332 --> 00:41:10,344
It's too hot here.

751
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:11,816
I was scared to death.

752
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:13,131
I feel sorry for you.

753
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:14,492
No need to say that.

754
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:16,292
I promised.

755
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:19,051
You can announce our relationship
whenever you want to.

756
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:22,892
Give me some more time.

757
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:26,372
After all, the relationship
between Su and Dr. Qin

758
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:28,492
and things happening in her family...

759
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:31,332
I will tell her later.

760
00:41:31,852 --> 00:41:33,131
Okay, I'll listen to you.

761
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:35,731
I'll listen to you.

762
00:41:43,492 --> 00:41:45,332
How do we manage
this project without Ying?

763
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:49,012
Yes, it's like being headless.

764
00:41:51,412 --> 00:41:52,571
I'm still here, right?

765
00:41:52,892 --> 00:41:53,972
I'll assign tasks for you.

766
00:41:54,772 --> 00:41:58,091
Ye, you help me draw
a perspective and an aerial view.

767
00:41:58,292 --> 00:41:59,292
Try to get it done by 3 PM.

768
00:41:59,492 --> 00:42:00,091
Okay.

769
00:42:00,091 --> 00:42:02,531
Chen, please help me prepare
a cost book for the project.

770
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:04,932
It's mainly about the consumption
of the unit.

771
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:08,452
I will help Ying sort out
all the data of this project.

772
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,571
If you need anything,
you can come to me at any time.

773
00:42:10,772 --> 00:42:11,091
Okay.

774
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:11,531
Go.

775
00:42:11,731 --> 00:42:12,648
Go.

776
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:41,160
(Mi Bai,)

777
00:42:43,651 --> 00:42:44,812
(do you still remember the day)

778
00:42:46,091 --> 00:42:47,091
(when you confessed)

779
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,211
(to Yunsheng for me under the rainbow?)

780
00:42:55,571 --> 00:42:59,432
(Actually, you were confessing
for yourself too, right?)

781
00:43:06,812 --> 00:43:08,611
(I'm sorry I didn't know)

782
00:43:09,972 --> 00:43:11,611
