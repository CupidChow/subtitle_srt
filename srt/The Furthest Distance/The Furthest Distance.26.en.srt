- Hello, I'm Mrs. Zhou's daughter.
- Hello.

18
00:02:30,988 --> 00:02:34,148
Is Chief Zhao from neurosurgery
on duty today?

19
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:35,988
No, Chief Zhao is about to retire.

20
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:37,188
He doesn't have shifts lately.

21
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:41,908
Then, how can I get in touch with him?

22
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:44,908
Are you trying to contact Chief Zhao
for surgery?

23
00:02:45,188 --> 00:02:46,120
Yes.

24
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:47,227
It might be difficult.

25
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:49,708
Chief Zhao has stopped
performing surgery.

26
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:53,507
Thank you.

27
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,376
You're welcome.

28
00:03:01,988 --> 00:03:03,227
You are...

29
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:05,188
This is Chief Zhao.

30
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,908
He is also the main doctor
for this patient.

31
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:08,136
Hello.

32
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,764
(Zhao Xudong, Chief of Neurosurgery)

33
00:03:11,588 --> 00:03:12,588
Are you Chief Zhao?

34
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,908
Did you agree
to perform the surgery on my mom?

35
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:16,936
Yes.

36
00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:19,028
You should thank your friend.

37
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:20,268
He put in a lot of effort

38
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,547
to get me to help.

39
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:26,387
Don't worry about your mother.

40
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:27,507
I have inquired.

41
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:30,227
Chief Zhao at Meichi
is an expert in this field.

42
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:32,428
I will have him cure your mother.

43
00:03:35,227 --> 00:03:37,908
I'll thank him.
Thank you, Chief Zhao. Then...

44
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:41,107
How likely is my mother's surgery
to succeed?

45
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,028
Her condition is quite unique.

46
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:46,268
This surgery carries the highest risk.

47
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:48,588
And there may be complications
after the surgery.

48
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:49,787
As for the success rate...

49
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:51,667
I can't guarantee it.

50
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:57,347
What can be done
to wake her up earlier?

51
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:00,547
At the moment,
there are no special measures.

52
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:02,908
I'll have a consultation first.

53
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:06,308
Okay. Thank you, Chief Zhao.

54
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:12,028
Thank you, Chief. Take care.

55
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:12,968
See you.

56
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:17,867
Mom, mom, did you hear that?

57
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:19,708
Chief Zhao agreed
to perform the surgery.

58
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:21,427
You will definitely get better, mom.

59
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:24,808
Zhengwen.

60
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:26,347
I came to see your mother.

61
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:30,504
She is still not awake?

62
00:04:32,547 --> 00:04:33,588
Let's talk outside.

63
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:34,568
We shouldn't disturb her.

64
00:04:47,148 --> 00:04:48,712
Thank you for contacting Chief Zhao.

65
00:04:49,148 --> 00:04:50,307
He agreed to operate on my mom.

66
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,688
Really?

67
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:54,184
That's great.

68
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:56,867
I don't know what method you used.

69
00:04:57,828 --> 00:04:58,787
But still, thank you.

70
00:05:00,787 --> 00:05:01,908
You are welcome.

71
00:05:02,388 --> 00:05:04,427
I'm glad it can help your mother
recover her health.

72
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,508
But Chief Zhao also said

73
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,347
my mom's condition is very complex.

74
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,187
Even he

75
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:13,187
isn't entirely sure.

76
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:17,708
Yes, he's about to retire, after all.

77
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:20,187
This operation is complex.

78
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,388
He's not sure if he can withstand it.

79
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:27,268
So it's quite normal
that he can't give guarantees.

80
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:30,028
If only I had cared more earlier,

81
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:31,987
my mom's health
wouldn't be like this now.

82
00:05:32,828 --> 00:05:33,864
She will be fine.

83
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:35,496
How about this?

84
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:37,508
The dean of Jingping Hospital
is my friend.

85
00:05:38,107 --> 00:05:39,667
He's an authority in this field
in our country

86
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:42,107
and has performed multiple surgeries
like your mother's.

87
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,068
So, if you need it,

88
00:05:44,347 --> 00:05:46,347
I could contact him
to transfer your mother.

89
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:48,040
I...

90
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:18,388
Yunsheng, you've woken up.

91
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:20,840
Mi Bai.

92
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:22,388
I saw you sleeping just now.

93
00:06:22,787 --> 00:06:24,787
Do you want to sleep in the restroom?

94
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:27,028
It must be uncomfortable sleeping here.

95
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,616
No need.

96
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:30,867
Is your foot okay?

97
00:06:32,747 --> 00:06:34,708
It's alright now.
Thank you for your concern.

98
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:36,168
It's okay.

99
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:39,588
Didn't you sleep well last night?

100
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:42,908
No, I was looking up information
for Su Ying's mother all night.

101
00:06:43,908 --> 00:06:45,347
Can I help with anything?

102
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:49,347
No need.
I'm going to see Su Ying's mother now.

103
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:52,648
I'm leaving.

104
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:59,987
I was thinking that
if even Chief Zhao can't guarantee it,

105
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:03,028
we should look for better resources
as soon as possible.

106
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:05,948
Jingping Hospital is top-notch
in all aspects.

107
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:11,787
It's okay. You can think it over.

108
00:07:12,107 --> 00:07:13,547
Just tell me if you need any help.

109
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:14,867
I can arrange it anytime.

110
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,867
Okay, I'll think it over. Thanks.

111
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:19,912
You are welcome.

112
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:21,588
I'll leave first.

113
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:22,984
All right.

114
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:34,568
Su Ying,

115
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:37,987
I've prepared
some relevant materials for you.

116
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:40,148
You'll need to stay in the hospital,

117
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:42,388
so I've also brought you
some necessities.

118
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:54,408
Thanks.

119
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:07,508
She's not been in a good mood lately.

120
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:10,628
If you truly care about her,
please stop disturbing her.

121
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:14,468
I've never seen her
look so haggard before.

122
00:08:15,107 --> 00:08:17,028
Is this the happiness
you promised to give her?

123
00:08:17,908 --> 00:08:18,828
What are you trying to say?

124
00:08:19,307 --> 00:08:21,347
Nothing. Just like I said,
you are not from the same world.

125
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:22,468
You'll part ways sooner or later.

126
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:24,227
Mrs. Zhou hasn't woken up.

127
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:25,347
I don't want to waste time here.

128
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:26,667
I'm preparing to transfer Mrs. Zhou.

129
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,187
I just contacted Jingping Hospital.

130
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:31,667
They have better medical conditions.

131
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:33,352
Transfer?

132
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:35,787
We have the most experienced doctors.

133
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:36,947
Mrs. Zhou should stay here.

134
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:38,667
Can you make the decision?

135
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:41,947

(Doctor's Dormitory)

149
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:16,552
Dr. Mi,

150
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:21,028
I heard that you sprained your ankle.
How is it now?

151
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:22,888
Much better.

152
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,748
You didn't come here
just to inquire about my ankle, did you?

153
00:10:28,707 --> 00:10:29,667
Actually, I want to know

154
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:32,467
why Chief Zhao suddenly agreed
to operate on Su Ying's mother.

155
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:35,176
He agreed?

156
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:36,648
That's what Su Ying said.

157
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:39,827
It must be because of Yunsheng.

158
00:10:42,988 --> 00:10:44,388
So Qin Yunsheng helped.

159
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:47,388
What? Is it pressuring you?

160
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:48,827
What pressure could I have?

161
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:51,228
But I do have some good news for you.

162
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:52,827
They have broken up.

163
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,008
Really?

164
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:57,988
What you do next is up to you.

165
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:04,827
Hello, dad.

166
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:07,787
Do you remember that when I came back,

167
00:11:07,787 --> 00:11:09,508
you gave me a special task?

168
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:14,388
Yes, it's about selecting
suitable young talents from Meichi

169
00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:16,067
to be sent abroad for further study.

170
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:18,187
I think it can be put on the agenda now.

171
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:22,028
I already have someone suitable
to recommend.

172
00:11:28,707 --> 00:11:29,587
You've all come.

173
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,628
I brought you some clothes for changing.

174
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:34,827
Hasn't your mother woken up?

175
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,056
How could it become so serious
all of a sudden?

176
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:38,952
What did the doctor say?

177
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:42,467
The doctor said
they would continue to observe.

178
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:45,960
Only when there are no further signs
of worsening can surgery be considered.

179
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:47,388
So passive.

180
00:11:48,587 --> 00:11:49,508
I'm also anxious.

181
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:52,028
Yang Zhengwen said he would introduce us

182
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:54,067
to the best neurosurgeon in Jingping.

183
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:56,908
I looked it up. The doctor's reputation
is indeed very good.

184
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:59,587
And the medical conditions
in that hospital are the best.

185
00:12:00,228 --> 00:12:01,224
I am wondering

186
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:02,628
if I should transfer mom.

187
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,228
If the conditions there
are better than here,

188
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:06,587
I think it's worth considering.

189
00:12:07,748 --> 00:12:09,508
But Dr. Qin is here. If you stay,

190
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:11,028
wouldn't it be more convenient?

191
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:17,947
I'll reconsider it.

192
00:12:21,628 --> 00:12:22,600
Don't worry.

193
00:12:28,587 --> 00:12:30,632
Two bags. One bag has daily necessities.

194
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:32,264
And the other has medicines

195
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:34,440
for treating gastric ulcers
and repairing the gastric mucosa.

196
00:12:34,827 --> 00:12:37,427
You must remind her to take them on time
and have regular meals.

197
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:38,344
Wait, wait.

198
00:12:39,148 --> 00:12:40,200
Dr. Qin,

199
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:41,908
you quarreled with Su Ying.

200
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:43,827
You should deliver these.

201
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:45,307
You can also persuade her.

202
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:47,988
She might not accept them from me.

203
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:49,508
Tell her they're from you.

204
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:51,067
She is so mad at you?

205
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:54,307
We

206
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:57,288
have temporarily separated.

207
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:01,032
You've broken up?

208
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:02,984
No. We have just temporarily separated.

209
00:13:02,984 --> 00:13:03,848
Alright.

210
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:07,827
Now she is determined
to break up with you.

211
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,064
What will you do?

212
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:11,467
I will try to win her back.

213
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:12,868
You are great.

214
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:14,988
Alright, go now.

215
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:17,832
Don't forget to remind her.

216
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,908
Alright, leave it to me.
I'll take care of it.

217
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:27,400
Come in.

218
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,504
Yunsheng.

219
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:32,264
Mi Bai.

220
00:13:35,187 --> 00:13:37,187
There's something
I'd like your help with.

221
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:39,388
Why are you being so formal with me?

222
00:13:39,707 --> 00:13:40,628
Sit down and tell me.

223
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:42,152
No need.

224
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,787
Well,

225
00:13:44,947 --> 00:13:46,187
the truth is,

226
00:13:46,628 --> 00:13:48,268
Su Ying is busy
taking care of her mother

227
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,787
while also preparing
for the second round of pitching.

228
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:54,187
Her time and energy

229
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:56,072
are both very limited.

230
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:57,416
So...

231
00:13:58,348 --> 00:13:59,667
So?

232
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:01,827
So I hope

233
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,268
the second round of pitching
can be postponed.

234
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:10,947
Although the rural hospital
is still in the planning phase,

235
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:12,787
the time is not so urgent.

236
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:16,108
If we give designers a few more days,

237
00:14:16,427 --> 00:14:18,268
I believe they can come up
with better work.

238
00:14:21,268 --> 00:14:22,248
Yunsheng,

239
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:23,827
I will seriously consider

240
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:26,108
your suggestion.

241
00:14:26,988 --> 00:14:31,348
But I also have to discuss it
with the experts on the panel.

242
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:34,108
I can't make the decision alone
on this matter after all.

243
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,228
Okay, thank you.

244
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:40,808
By the way, Yunsheng,

245
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:42,947
I also have something to tell you.

246
00:14:43,307 --> 00:14:44,232
What's it?

247
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:47,827
Our hospital has recently implemented
a talent development program

248
00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:51,148
that will select
one or two young doctors

249
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,427
to be sent abroad for training.

250
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:54,268
That's a good thing.

251
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:57,748
You have a good chance
of winning this opportunity.

252
00:14:57,947 --> 00:14:59,028
You should take it seriously.

253
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:07,228
Right now, my focus is on Mrs. Zhou.

254
00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:09,348
I hope her surgery can be successful.

255
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:12,787
So, let's talk about other things later.

256
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:29,992
Su Ying.

257
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:30,988
Dr. Zhang.

258
00:15:30,988 --> 00:15:31,868
Where are you going?

259
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:33,988
I'm going home to get something.

260
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:37,628
By the way, I have something to ask you.

261
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:39,667
Given my mom's condition,

262
00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:41,628
if I want to transfer her
to another hospital,

263
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:43,628
what kind of procedures
do I need to go through?

264
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:46,947
You need to find her attending
to fill out a transfer application form.

265
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,427
Are you transferring her?

266
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:53,192
Maybe.

267
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:55,304
Do you need anything?

268
00:15:56,228 --> 00:15:57,388
Right, Yunsheng...

269
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:00,148
Yunsheng told me that your mom was sick.

270
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:01,628
So I rushed over to check on you.

271
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:03,268
These are just daily necessities.

272
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,552
These are stomach medicines.

273
00:16:04,908 --> 00:16:06,067
Don't you have a stomach problem?

274
00:16:06,228 --> 00:16:07,908
Some stomach medicines
must be taken during meals,

275
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:10,547
and some should be taken before meals
to protect the stomach mucosa.

276
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:13,348
And you must eat regularly each day.

277
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,467
You bought these for me?

278
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:20,467
Well, I just went to...

279
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:22,108
It was Yunsheng who asked me...

280
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:26,348
Never mind. It was Yunsheng
who bought these for you.

281
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:28,467
Your mother is sick these days.

282
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:29,427
He is particularly worried.

283
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:31,348
He can't eat or sleep well.

284
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:32,547
He's worried about you.

285
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:34,427
Like I've always said,

286
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:35,947
if Yunsheng has wronged you,

287
00:16:36,307 --> 00:16:39,388
just tell me and Hai,
and we will deal with him.

288
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,947
But if there is a misunderstanding,

289
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:42,427
both of you

290
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:43,988
should sit down and have a chat.

291
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:45,868
There are no problems
that can't be solved.

292
00:16:48,264 --> 00:16:49,187
I know.

293
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:50,467
I'm leaving if nothing's up.

294
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:51,908
Thank you.

295
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:52,988
Take your medicine on time.

296
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:01,108
I completed the task with honor.

297
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:03,388
You didn't tell, right?

298
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:04,788
I didn't say anything.

299
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:08,296
But she figured out they were from you.

300
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,707
Fine, it's okay
as long as she accepts them.

301
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,840
Did she say anything?

302
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:19,427
She asked about transferring.

303
00:17:20,427 --> 00:17:21,388
Transferring?

304
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:22,548
She said she was considering it.

305
00:17:23,068 --> 00:17:25,096
Mrs. Zhou's condition
isn't suitable for transferring.

306
00:17:26,507 --> 00:17:27,348
I have to talk to her.

307
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:30,467
She is not in the patient room.

308
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:32,424
She went home for something.

309
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:33,864
Got it.

310
00:17:57,348 --> 00:18:00,828
I heard that you're asking
about your mom's transfer.

311
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:06,856
I don't know which hospital
you plan to transfer her to.

312
00:18:07,507 --> 00:18:08,507
But I think

313
00:18:09,108 --> 00:18:11,348
staying at Meichi for the surgery
is the best option for her.

314
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:13,928
One reason

315
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:16,348
is that transferring will torment her,

316
00:18:16,868 --> 00:18:18,187
and she is still unconscious.

317
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:21,588
The other reason is that,
although Chief Zhao is straightforward

318
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,467
and he won't say only the good parts

319
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:25,148
when introducing the condition,

320
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:26,548
making you burdened,

321
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:28,667
his medical skills are good.

322
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:30,348
You can rest assured of that.

323
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:39,308
I know you are still mad at me.

324
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:41,388
But I hope you could consider

325
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,548
the matter of your mother carefully.

326
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:45,667
Don't let our relationship
affect your judgment.

327
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:47,908
This is also why I came back

328
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:49,868
to talk to you.

329
00:18:58,747 --> 00:19:00,908
All right, let's talk then.

330
00:19:03,027 --> 00:19:04,108
I consider transferring my mom

331
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,027
just to give her
better medical conditions.

332
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:07,667
It has nothing to do with you.

333
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:09,416
Moreover,

334
00:19:09,947 --> 00:19:10,920
the doctor said

335
00:19:11,427 --> 00:19:14,187
my mom fell ill
because she ate the wrong thing.

336
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:17,667
So, what she went through this time
could have been avoided.

337
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:19,148
She ate the wrong thing?

338
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:22,108
But I told her
about the dietary restrictions.

339
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:23,828
Then why didn't you tell me?

340
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:26,108
If Mi Bai knows about her illness,

341
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:27,667
why can't I know?

342
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:31,368
I'm sorry.

343
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:34,548
It is my fault
for not taking good care of her.

344
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:38,467
But you've misunderstood this
about Mi Bai.

345
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:40,548
- She's helping...
- So you think she can handle it and I can't?

346
00:19:43,987 --> 00:19:44,936
Qin Yunsheng,

347
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:48,467
in your heart,
is Mi Bai really just a co-worker?

348
00:19:50,187 --> 00:19:51,080
Do you know

349
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:54,027
that you make me feel very ridiculous?

350
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:58,888
All right.

351
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:00,947
I don't want to argue with you.

352
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:03,108
If you really want to help me,

353
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:05,667
just leave me alone, please.

354
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:39,816
Hello, Dr. Mi.

355
00:20:40,227 --> 00:20:43,267
Qin Yunsheng came to me to postpone
Su Ying's second round of pitching.

356
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:45,667
What is your decision?

357
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,908
Her mom is ill.

358
00:20:49,308 --> 00:20:51,308
It's understandable
to postpone the competition.

359
00:20:52,308 --> 00:20:54,267
But I don't want her to put this favor

360
00:20:54,707 --> 00:20:56,108
on Qin Yunsheng.

361
00:20:57,628 --> 00:20:58,588
Thank you, Dr. Mi.

362
00:21:02,788 --> 00:21:04,628
Mr. Yang, the car
to Meichi Hospital is ready.

363
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:05,864
Shall we leave now?

364
00:21:07,227 --> 00:21:08,227
Go to the SU Design Firm.

365
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:14,707
Ye, how's everything on your side?

366
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:15,628
Is there any progress?

367
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:19,707
The deadline we agreed on
with the hospital is getting closer,

368
00:21:19,707 --> 00:21:22,027
but we still can't decide
on the materials.

369
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:24,148
I still have a lot of unclear areas.

370
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:25,667
What about you?

371
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,348
I have questions
about the water and electricity.

372
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:29,588
But Ying has no time.

373
00:21:30,828 --> 00:21:33,187
We can't disturb her anymore,
no matter what.

374
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:35,667
We have already promised her
that we will not let her worry again.

375
00:21:35,788 --> 00:21:37,308
So we must handle this ourselves.

376
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:38,664
Mr. Yang.

377
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:39,788
Mr. Yang.

378
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:41,427
Are you here to see Ying?

379
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:42,788
Actually, I came to see you.

380
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,027
Us?

381
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:45,908
Time is precious.
So I'll get straight to the point.

382
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:48,707
First, I've had someone take down
the negative post about you guys online.

383
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,628
And the related negative comments
have been controlled.

384
00:21:51,908 --> 00:21:52,788
What a relief!

385
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,507
Second, about the deadline
for the pitching,

386
00:21:55,507 --> 00:21:57,828
I will try my best to talk
with the panel of Meichi Hospital

387
00:21:57,908 --> 00:21:59,108
to postpone it for a few days.

388
00:21:59,227 --> 00:22:00,987
This would allow Ying
to have time with her mom.

389
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:03,108
- Thank you, Mr. Yang.
- It's really kind of you.

390
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,584
And, third,

391
00:22:04,947 --> 00:22:06,068
all building materials

392
00:22:06,348 --> 00:22:08,628
for your hospital project
will be fully sponsored by our company.

393
00:22:09,747 --> 00:22:11,108
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

394
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:12,467
It's a public welfare project.

395
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,467
Consider it our bit of effort.

396
00:22:14,987 --> 00:22:16,987
With the support from you and your corp,

397
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:19,027
we are more confident
about this hospital project.

398
00:22:19,148 --> 00:22:21,388
Mr. Yang, you are really a lifesaver.

399
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,507
Ying will be moved to know this.

400
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:25,908
It's alright. Keep going.

401
00:22:26,187 --> 00:22:27,112

Yunsheng bought these for you.

00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:28,707
Your mother is sick these days.

408
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,187
He is particularly worried.

409
00:23:30,747 --> 00:23:32,308
He can't eat or sleep well.

410
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:33,788
He's worried about you.

(If you really want to help me,)

422
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:33,908
(just leave me alone, please.)

423
00:24:53,507 --> 00:24:54,408
Come in.

424
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:56,744
Chief Zhao.

425
00:24:57,227 --> 00:24:59,400
Su Ying, come in and have a seat.

426
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,148
I've been wanting to talk to you.

427
00:25:03,027 --> 00:25:04,667
This is your mom's surgery plan.

428
00:25:07,828 --> 00:25:09,348
I've scheduled the surgery for tomorrow.

429
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:11,908
Tomorrow?

430
00:25:11,908 --> 00:25:14,027
Yes, based on our observations,

431
00:25:14,027 --> 00:25:16,467
her current condition
is relatively stable.

432
00:25:16,588 --> 00:25:17,608
She is ready for surgery.

433
00:25:18,588 --> 00:25:20,308
But my mom is still unconscious.

434
00:25:20,548 --> 00:25:21,747
Wouldn't that affect the surgery?

435
00:25:22,308 --> 00:25:25,388
We were afraid her blood pressure
might fluctuate when she woke up.

436
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:27,868
So we gave her a bit of a sedative.

437
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:31,427
She is asleep rather than unconscious.

438
00:25:33,507 --> 00:25:34,507
I see.

439
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,348
I was worried that she...

440
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:37,348
Might never wake up?

441
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:38,908
Yes.

442
00:25:38,908 --> 00:25:41,187
That won't happen.
Have a look at the plan first.

443
00:25:41,427 --> 00:25:42,408
Okay.

444
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:47,144
The location of her aneurysm
is quite special.

445
00:25:47,987 --> 00:25:49,388
The best choice is to use a stent graft.

446
00:25:52,308 --> 00:25:53,352
Chief Zhao,

447
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:55,108
thank you

448
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:57,148
for such a carefully devised plan.

449
00:25:57,427 --> 00:25:58,628
That's my job.

450
00:25:59,068 --> 00:26:00,947
I am confident in the plan.

451
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:03,548
However, the surgery

452
00:26:04,108 --> 00:26:05,308
will certainly have some risks.

453
00:26:05,908 --> 00:26:07,667
To say that there is no risk
would be a lie.

454
00:26:09,588 --> 00:26:10,472
I understand.

455
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:12,267
Also,

456
00:26:13,148 --> 00:26:14,788
as the patient's family,

457
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:18,267
you need to
sign this surgical consent form.

458
00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:26,924
(The patient and their family have fully
understood the surgery and agreed to do it.)

459
00:26:28,872 --> 00:26:29,788
It's tomorrow.

460
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,068
Yes, tomorrow.

461
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:37,288
Okay.

462
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:41,388
Chief.

463
00:26:41,388 --> 00:26:42,312
Dr. Qin.

464
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,707
I've collected some more information
on brain tumors.

465
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:49,828
Su Ying just came to me.

466
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:52,427
Do you want to talk to her?

467
00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:56,947
No. What did she
come to you to talk about?

468
00:26:58,308 --> 00:27:00,868
We talked and scheduled
her mother's surgery for tomorrow.

469
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:02,984
Really?

470
00:27:04,828 --> 00:27:05,707
That's great.

471
00:27:08,108 --> 00:27:09,507
Can I apply to

472
00:27:10,148 --> 00:27:12,072
scrub in for the surgery tomorrow?

473
00:27:13,427 --> 00:27:14,408
Of course.

474
00:27:14,628 --> 00:27:17,348
Su Ying's mother has hypertension,
and her situation is complex.

475
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:19,947
With the support of you, a cardiologist,

476
00:27:20,148 --> 00:27:21,548
we can also avoid risks.

477
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:23,308
Thank you, Chief.

478
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,388
By the way,
the surgery is tomorrow at 3:00 pm.

479
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:39,852
(Meichi International Hospital)

480
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:15,080
Chief, thank you.

481
00:28:48,172 --> 00:28:49,132
(Operation)

482
00:29:25,828 --> 00:29:27,908
Rest assured,
your mother will be alright.

483
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:37,507
Mr. Yang.

484
00:29:37,507 --> 00:29:38,667
How is Mrs. Zhou?

485
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:40,548
She just entered the OR.

486
00:29:42,187 --> 00:29:44,267
No worries.
I've informed the Jingping Hospital.

487
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:46,440
If anything happens,
we'll transfer her immediately.

488
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:48,296
Thank you.

489
00:30:36,108 --> 00:30:37,260
(Operation)

490
00:30:46,987 --> 00:30:47,944
Chief?

491
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:50,440
The surgery went well. Don't worry.

492
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:53,227
Just relax.

493
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:55,507
Thank you, Chief. Thank you.

494
00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:56,348
It's our job.

495
00:30:56,628 --> 00:30:57,628
Because of the medication,

496
00:30:57,908 --> 00:31:01,187
your mother will need
about a day to wake up.

497
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:03,348
By then, I'll come over to check on her.

498
00:31:03,507 --> 00:31:04,424
Okay.

499
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:23,427
Her current vitals are all stable.

500
00:31:23,427 --> 00:31:24,947
Once she regains consciousness,

501
00:31:25,027 --> 00:31:26,308
please inform us.

502
00:31:27,027 --> 00:31:28,348
Okay, thank you.

503
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:30,024
Thank you.

504
00:31:35,308 --> 00:31:39,176
Zhengwen, why don't you go back first?

505
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:40,588
The surgery went well.

506
00:31:40,828 --> 00:31:41,747
I can stay here with her.

507
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,588
Alright, I will leave you alone.

508
00:31:45,348 --> 00:31:46,588
Just call me if you need anything.

509
00:31:58,227 --> 00:31:59,176
Mr. Yang?

510
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:00,648
What brings you here?

511
00:32:01,427 --> 00:32:03,588
The pitch's deadline is extended.
I came to get some files.

512
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,148
And I heard Su Ying's mom was sick,

513
00:32:05,148 --> 00:32:06,427
so I wanted to pay her a visit.

514
00:32:07,308 --> 00:32:08,908
Mr. Yang, about my plan
for the second round...

515
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:10,148
Let's talk on the phone later.

516
00:32:11,108 --> 00:32:12,168
Mr. Yang?

517
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:18,088
Tian Mei, what brings you here?

518
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:22,588
I heard that Su Ying's mother was sick,

519
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:23,828
so I wanted to visit her.

520
00:32:24,427 --> 00:32:26,628
I want to be kind,
even though we are competitors.

521
00:32:27,507 --> 00:32:29,747
Don't you think Su Ying is busy enough?

522
00:32:31,148 --> 00:32:34,068
You pretend to be harmless
on the surface,

523
00:32:34,507 --> 00:32:36,388
but you do these underhanded things.

524
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:37,908
And you call it 'being kind'?

525
00:32:38,947 --> 00:32:39,816
Just leave.

526
00:32:40,108 --> 00:32:42,187
Su Ying doesn't need your concern.

527
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:44,348
Who knows
whether you came here to be nice

528
00:32:44,348 --> 00:32:45,548
or to sniff out information?

529
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:47,227
There's no need to be so harsh.

530
00:32:47,427 --> 00:32:48,308
Let me tell you.

531
00:32:48,747 --> 00:32:50,707
Though Su Ying's mother is now sick,

532
00:32:51,148 --> 00:32:53,348
don't think you can take the chance.

533
00:32:54,187 --> 00:32:56,227
Su Ying is better than you in every way.

534
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,628
Isn't the competition coming up?

535
00:32:58,108 --> 00:32:59,048
Go back and get ready.

536
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,588
Be careful not to lose too badly.

537
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:11,308
Guess who I just ran into.

538
00:33:12,068 --> 00:33:12,968
Who?

539
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:14,427
Tian Mei.

540
00:33:16,987 --> 00:33:17,868
What does she want?

541
00:33:18,947 --> 00:33:20,467
She said she wanted to come and see you.

542
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,427
Who knows what she has in mind?

543
00:33:22,828 --> 00:33:24,588
I told her to leave.

544
00:33:28,588 --> 00:33:31,108
I just saw her talking to Yang Zhengwen.

545
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,828
Don't know what they were talking about.

546
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:34,440
Do they know each other well?

547
00:33:34,828 --> 00:33:37,768
They had a meeting before,
so they know each other.

548
00:33:48,868 --> 00:33:50,696
Su! Su!

549
00:33:52,148 --> 00:33:53,068
Nurse!

550
00:33:58,308 --> 00:33:59,267
Hello?

551
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:01,348
Yunsheng, where are you?

552
00:34:01,348 --> 00:34:03,148
Su Ying fainted.
Come to the emergency room quickly.

553
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:04,712
What?

554
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:06,108
Just come over quickly.

555
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:09,324
(Meichi International Hospital)

556
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:27,547
Huixuan brought her over.

557
00:34:27,908 --> 00:34:29,027
She is taking care of Mrs. Zhou.

558
00:34:29,308 --> 00:34:30,467
She asked me to watch over her.

559
00:34:31,107 --> 00:34:32,067
How could this happen?

560
00:34:33,107 --> 00:34:35,308
Maybe it's because her nerves
have been on edge these days.

561
00:34:35,627 --> 00:34:36,668
Once the surgery succeeded,

562
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:40,136
she totally relaxed and fell ill.

563
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:44,748
Go ahead. I will stay with her.

564
00:34:45,228 --> 00:34:46,188
Don't worry.

565
00:35:23,027 --> 00:35:24,348
You must be exhausted these days.

566
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:30,440
I'm sorry.

567
00:35:34,188 --> 00:35:35,627
I failed to take good care of you.

568
00:36:02,388 --> 00:36:03,336
How is she doing?

569
00:36:04,388 --> 00:36:06,547
She's too tired,
and her immunity is weakened.

570
00:36:09,908 --> 00:36:11,308
Your face doesn't look right either.

571
00:36:14,587 --> 00:36:15,464
You are having a fever.

572
00:36:17,027 --> 00:36:17,908
I don't think so.

573
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:19,868
My hand is a thermometer.
I can't be wrong.

574
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:21,308
You can't stay up late anymore.

575
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:22,587
I'll take you back to rest now.

576
00:36:22,587 --> 00:36:23,147
Let's go.

577
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:23,627
But Su Ying...

578
00:36:23,627 --> 00:36:24,488
Stop.

579
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:37,547
You should take care of yourself

580
00:36:37,627 --> 00:36:39,427
before taking care of others.

581
00:36:40,627 --> 00:36:43,388
Hurry up and take the medicine.

582
00:36:44,587 --> 00:36:47,272
Then keep yourself warm
and have a good sleep.

583
00:36:47,987 --> 00:36:49,788
You've moved back to the glass house.

584
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,947
You must have had a huge fight
with Su Ying.

585
00:36:54,748 --> 00:36:57,268
In my opinion,
you two should reconcile soon.

586
00:36:57,427 --> 00:36:59,547
I feel awkward just watching you.

587
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:01,748
I'll ask a leave for you tomorrow.

588
00:37:02,947 --> 00:37:04,748
Just stay at home
and rest for a couple of days.

589
00:37:05,868 --> 00:37:07,388
I'll keep an eye on Su Ying for you.

590
00:37:08,107 --> 00:37:09,128
Don't worry.

591
00:37:09,308 --> 00:37:11,228
I've taken the medicine.

592
00:37:11,627 --> 00:37:12,748
Just go back and rest early.

593
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:16,908
Are you sure you're okay?

594
00:37:17,828 --> 00:37:18,728
I'm fine.

595
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,788
Do you want me
to call Hai over to take care of you?

596
00:37:21,388 --> 00:37:24,200
Don't do that.
Let me rest quietly for a while.

597
00:37:24,668 --> 00:37:27,400
Alright, then call me
if you need anything. Have a good rest.

598
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:29,107
If anything happens to Su Ying,
let me know.

599
00:37:30,427 --> 00:37:33,147
I know. Take care of yourself first.

600
00:37:35,027 --> 00:37:36,348
I'll come see you after work tomorrow.

601
00:37:37,668 --> 00:37:38,664
Take care.

602
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:39,987
Get some rest.

(1 Post-operative Diet)

604

(Meichi International Hospital)

605
00:38:48,987 --> 00:38:50,107
Ying.

606
00:38:50,107 --> 00:38:51,348
Ying, you are awake.

607
00:38:51,507 --> 00:38:52,392
You are awake.

608
00:38:56,908 --> 00:38:57,947
Why are you all here?

609
00:38:58,308 --> 00:38:59,188
You are finally awake.

610
00:38:59,788 --> 00:39:00,788
I told them.

611
00:39:01,388 --> 00:39:02,427
They were worried about you.

612
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,947
I'm fine. You didn't have to come over.

613
00:39:07,228 --> 00:39:08,388
The pitching matters the most now.

614
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:10,348
Ying, the pitching is important,

615
00:39:10,627 --> 00:39:11,868
but your health is more important.

616
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:14,308
And we also came to the hospital
for work.

617
00:39:14,507 --> 00:39:16,027
Right, we are working on a plan.

618
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,228
We need to talk to the doctors
and gather some information.

619
00:39:18,507 --> 00:39:21,388
And we need to take some photos
of the hospital as structural reference.

620
00:39:21,748 --> 00:39:23,147
Yes, you should rest well.

621
00:39:23,547 --> 00:39:24,547
Didn't you always tell us

622
00:39:24,627 --> 00:39:26,348
that sometimes a plan
is not written by hand

623
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:27,308
but run out by the feet?

624
00:39:27,388 --> 00:39:28,328
Exactly.

625
00:39:30,587 --> 00:39:32,668
I'm fine now. I'll go with you.

626
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:34,908
- No, no.
- No, no.

627
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:35,947
Lie down. You just woke up.

628
00:39:35,947 --> 00:39:38,107
Listen, drink this porridge,

629
00:39:38,268 --> 00:39:39,828
and I'll do your work for you.

630
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:41,708
Mingshi, Chen, and Ye,
let's get to work.

631
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:42,027
Let's go.

632
00:39:42,107 --> 00:39:42,947
Goodbye, Ying.

633
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:43,868
See you.

634
00:39:43,868 --> 00:39:44,808
I... I...

635
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:55,748
Congenital heart disease

636
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:58,748
is one of the most common birth defects
at present.

637
00:39:59,228 --> 00:40:03,027
It's also the main cause of death
in newborns and infants.

638
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,748
Gosh, this is too terrifying.

639
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:09,067
We are doing the rural charity hospital

640
00:40:09,547 --> 00:40:11,228
because we hope these sick children

641
00:40:11,348 --> 00:40:13,228
can be diagnosed and treated early

642
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:14,708
to improve their lives

643
00:40:14,947 --> 00:40:16,467
and increase their quality of life.

644
00:40:16,908 --> 00:40:17,908
Your words

645
00:40:18,147 --> 00:40:19,868
make me feel like the responsibility

646
00:40:20,027 --> 00:40:22,067
of renovating the hospital
this time is even bigger.

647
00:40:22,188 --> 00:40:24,868
Well, pressure is good.

648
00:40:25,268 --> 00:40:28,268
I hope you can design a better hospital.

649
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:29,427
Don't worry, Chief.

650
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,312
Rest assured.

651
00:40:30,312 --> 00:40:32,268
Alright, I'll give you a tour.

652
00:40:32,348 --> 00:40:34,067
If you have any questions, just ask.

653
00:40:34,427 --> 00:40:35,336
Okay.

654
00:41:12,467 --> 00:41:13,352
How do I look?

655
00:41:16,868 --> 00:41:17,992
Are you taking pictures of me?

656
00:41:19,048 --> 00:41:19,947
Let me check your phone.

657
00:41:19,947 --> 00:41:20,427
No.

658
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:21,507
Let me take a look.

659
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:23,708
I'm angry.

660
00:41:27,668 --> 00:41:28,584
You are pretty.

661
00:41:31,348 --> 00:41:34,308
You made me look so ugly in the picture.

662
00:41:34,908 --> 00:41:36,392
Maybe the picture was not taken well.

663
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:38,600
But in my heart, you're pretty.

664
00:41:42,308 --> 00:41:45,388
Why is there also a picture
of the sea-view apartment?

665
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:48,936
You've been secretly
taking pictures of me ever since?

666
00:41:49,788 --> 00:41:51,547
I didn't take
the picture of you 'secretly'.

667
00:41:51,788 --> 00:41:54,147
I just thought the view was beautiful,
and so were you.

668
00:41:54,668 --> 00:41:55,868
So I wanted to capture that moment.

669
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:57,947
Really?

670
00:42:00,627 --> 00:42:01,627
Come here.

671
00:42:01,627 --> 00:42:02,228
What's up?

672
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,268
Come here.

673
00:42:12,388 --> 00:42:14,268
All right, we're even now.

674
00:42:14,587 --> 00:42:17,868
From now on, we will
look good or bad together.

675
00:42:20,228 --> 00:42:21,348
How is it?

676
00:42:22,308 --> 00:42:23,587
All the indicators are normal,

677
00:42:23,748 --> 00:42:25,027
and the vitals are also stable.

678
00:42:25,228 --> 00:42:26,507
You don't need to worry too much.

679
00:42:26,987 --> 00:42:28,147
Okay, thank you.

680
00:42:33,987 --> 00:42:34,952
How is it?

681
00:42:36,268 --> 00:42:38,348
Is your mother recovering well?

682
00:42:41,067 --> 00:42:41,960
That's good.

683
00:42:45,348 --> 00:42:46,748
Isn't the pitch tomorrow?

684
00:42:46,947 --> 00:42:47,987
You can go back and prepare,

685
00:42:48,147 --> 00:42:48,987
and leave it to me.

686
00:42:51,147 --> 00:42:53,668
