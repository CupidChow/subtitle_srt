17
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:48,168
What's going on?

18
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:49,860
The patient had
heart bypass surgery before.

19
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,461
He says it's recurring.

20
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:53,181
Okay, I see.

21
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,261
I don't care.

22
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:56,381
You must give me

23
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:57,261
a satisfactory answer.

24
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:58,300
Or else I will post an article

25
00:01:58,381 --> 00:01:59,580
about this matter online.

26
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,661
Sir, rest assured.

27
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:03,580
We will try our best
to meet your requirements.

28
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,101
You thought the medical conditions
in Donglin City were poor

29
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:07,500
and wanted to switch

30
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,140
to this international hospital.

31
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:12,300
Look. Didn't we arrange it
for you right away?

32
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,580
I had heart bypass surgery.

33
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,821
If something happens to me,

34
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:17,541
can you afford the responsibility?

35
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,760
Huixuan?

36
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:20,661
Dr. Qin.

37
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:23,140
Dr. Qin.

38
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,072
You...

39
00:02:24,072 --> 00:02:25,061
(Healthy Habits)

40
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,580
Aren't you the owner of the glass house?

41
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:28,261
Yes, I am.

42
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:29,221
Let me tell you.

43
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,860
You have to be careful with your house.

44
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:32,941
The show team is not reliable at all.

45
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:34,700
They renovated our house,

46
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:36,381
and the glass just exploded.

47
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,821
I had heart bypass surgery.

48
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:39,941
It recurred right away.

49
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,101
What on earth is going on?

50
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:47,860
Mr. Wang, are you okay?

51
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:49,341
You have the nerve to ask?

52
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,740
It's your lousy plan

53
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,061
that sent me here.

54
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,541
- Mr. Wang,
- I'm sorry.

55
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,781
the accident
is still under investigation.

56
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:56,821
We shouldn't speculate.

57
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,061
Listen again.
I don't care about anything.

58
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:02,180
You must solve this problem for me.

59
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,496
Or,

60
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,061
I will ruin your reputation.

61
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,632
I will bankrupt you.

62
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,752
Please don't.

63
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:10,856
How about this?

64
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:11,976
You go out

65
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,140
and leave it to me.

66
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:17,256
Let's leave.

67
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,624
Let's leave.

68
00:03:26,781 --> 00:03:27,821
Would you please tell me

69
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:29,800
where you're feeling off?

70
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:31,061
I feel uncomfortable all over.

71
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:32,420
Everything below my neck feels off.

72
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,900
Can it be more specific?

73
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:36,300
Sometimes it feels like a needle prick.

74
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,320
Sometimes,

75
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:38,580
it feels like a knife stab.

76
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,981
They are two different kinds of pain.

77
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,856
A prick on the left.
A stab on the right.

78
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:46,120
In that case,

79
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:47,941
I'll arrange a full body check for you.

80
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:49,640
Okay.

81
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:51,381
Did you hear it just now?

82
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,288
Did you hear it?

83
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:55,020
If this continues,

84
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,020
I...

85
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,501
This is a hospital.
Please lower your voice.

86
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:58,728
Sorry.

87
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:00,900
If it keeps up,

88
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:02,120
our show

89
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:03,541
will not have a next season.

90
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,981
And you, Su Ying,

91
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:08,781
the plans you suggest
are always fanciful

92
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,020
but impractical.

93
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:11,101
What should we do now?

94
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,328
Mr. Liu,

95
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,300
Su Ziyang's team is
in charge of execution.

96
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,420
Is it good to jump to conclusions
without even knowing

97
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,581
what the situation is right now?

98
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:19,461
You ought to keep
your mouth shut, Du Huixuan.

99
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:21,021
I'm giving you one day.

100
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:22,860
Maybe we can't air this episode.

101
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:24,581
Think of a solution for me...

102
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:26,060
Lower your voice.

103
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,952
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:28,740
Think of a solution.

105
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,416
See?

106
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:34,901
This is the sponsor calling to ask.

107
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,180
They must be furious.

108
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,448
You...

109
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:39,528
Fine.

110
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:41,608
Hello.

111
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,981
Yes, it's true.

112
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,500
Let me explain it to you.

113
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:48,661
Don't mind it.

114
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:51,101
He's just in a flap and he talks nasty.

115
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:52,552
It's fine.

116
00:04:53,221 --> 00:04:54,541
But before the plan was handed out,

117
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,141
I had checked it many times.

118
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:57,620
There can't be any problems.

119
00:04:58,781 --> 00:04:59,624
Are you okay?

120
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,981
How is Wang Zili?

121
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,740
I've arranged a check-up for him.

122
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,968
It's being done now.

123
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:06,920
I feel

124
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:08,461
that he is just faking it.

125
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,260
Once the result is out,

126
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,581
I will tell you guys immediately.

127
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,712
No matter what,

128
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:19,101
this episode must be aired on schedule.

129
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:20,860
I'll think of a new plan.

130
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,701
But you've said
there's no problem with your plan.

131
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,300
The plan has no problem,

132
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:27,860
but he has had heart surgery.

133
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,221
It is not good enough for him.

134
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,940
I'll make a better one.

135
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:33,461
What are you two doing?

136
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,860
Having a chat?

137
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,341
The sponsor is very angry.

138
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,901
Go to apologize with me now.

139
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,192
Hurry up.

140
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,701
Well,

141
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,820
Dr. Qin, we're leaving.

142
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:55,981
Mr. Yang, Mr. Liu
of House Design came to apologize

143
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:57,860
with Miss Du and the designer.

144
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,392
Let them in.

145
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:01,576
Alright.

146
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
No need. We're all on the same team.

147
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,992
Come on in.

148
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,480
Mr. Yang,

149
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,180
I'm really sorry.

150
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,581
We caused you trouble.

151
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:20,500
But we will handle it. As you can see,

152
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:21,981
I came with sincerity.

153
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,180
Yes, Mr. Yang.

154
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,661
We will definitely do our best

155
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:25,981
to protect your company's reputation.

156
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,620
I'll think of a new replacement plan.

157
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,901
I'm sure it'll be safer.

158
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,420
See.

159
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,940
We will definitely handle it well.

160
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,500
Can you forgive us and not sue?

161
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,420
What did the homeowner say?

162
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,420
It's a little tricky,

163
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,180
but I will smooth it out.

164
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:44,648
Don't worry.

165
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:45,901
Yes.

166
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:46,860
Actually, the homeowner

167
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:48,141
is not targeting the team.

168
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,300
It is mainly

169
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,216
because of

170
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,740
the flaw in the design.

171
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:56,461
So I will have the designer

172
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,420
personally apologize to the owner

173
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,101
to make sure he won't blow it up.

174
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:01,544
Rest assured.

175
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:04,221
This is your solution?

176
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,661
Pushing someone out as a scapegoat

177
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,420
when encountering an issue.

178
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:13,180
If your team is so irresponsible,

179
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,180
I really need to consider

180
00:07:14,341 --> 00:07:15,740
whether or not
to continue sponsoring you.

181
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,300
Please don't, Mr. Yang.

182
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,461
Responsibility is my motto.

183
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:21,896
Really?

184
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:23,740
We'll definitely handle it well.

185
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:28,781
The client is not difficult
to deal with.

186
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:31,180
Negotiate terms, right?

187
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,701
If they make reasonable demands,

188
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,380
we'll satisfy them.

189
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,380
If not, we'll go through
legal procedures.

190
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,448
It's not that complex.

191
00:07:39,701 --> 00:07:41,781
Are you saying

192
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:43,901
you'll bear all the losses this time?

193
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,461
I mean we should

194
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,260
try to minimize the reputational damage

195
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,981
to all of us in this incident.

196
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,180
Thank you very much.

197
00:07:58,661 --> 00:07:59,624
Let go.

198
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,744
Thank you.

199
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,232
Miss Su,

200
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:10,940
feel free to let us know

201
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,021
if there's anything you need
for your alternative plan.

202
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,581
Our corporation will fully back you.

203
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:22,504
Thank you.

204
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,981
Who allowed you to change
the glass specifications?

205
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,541
If I hadn't noticed in time,

206
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,421
my reputation

207
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,020
would have been completely ruined.

208
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,941
What on earth is going on?

209
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:50,024
I'm sorry.

210
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:20,232
Hello,

211
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:21,864
Property Management?

212
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:25,288
I'm sorry, Mr. Su.

213
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,421
I just wanted to make the effect better.

214
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,140
Don't worry.
It's my fault. I won't shirk it.

215
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,528
Your fault?

216
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,221
Isn't it Yangfan Studio's fault?

217
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,540
I didn't think about that.

218
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,936
Don't worry.

219
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,101
The team won't hold you responsible.

220
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,581
After all, you are doing it
according to Su Ying's drawings.

221
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,140
Right?

222
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,701
But it has nothing to do with them.

223
00:09:50,061 --> 00:09:50,941
I can't say that.

224
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:52,740
So you want
to take the responsibility alone?

225
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:54,740
Can you handle it?

226
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:02,061
You should know very well
what kind of show

227
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,540
House Design is.

228
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,660
It can glorify a designer

229
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:11,020
but also can block
a young person's path.

230
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:13,821
Do you think you are Su Ying?

231
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,260
Compared to others,

232
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:18,140
she is the one
who is least afraid of being affected.

233
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:20,840
But...

234
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,900
I'm trying to help you

235
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,181
and give you a chance.

236
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:26,120
Think about it.

237
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,341
It's either you or Su Ying.

238
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,341
Who will bear the responsibility?

239
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,864
I'm sorry, Mr. Su.

240
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:39,421
I really can't do this.

241
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,168
Tian Mei,

242
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,620
listen to me.

243
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:46,984
It was the flaw

244
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:49,020
in Su Ying's design that caused it.

245
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,380
Do you understand?

246
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:03,981
Yes, I need a whole wall of glass.

247
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,181
Ye, if this matter gets blown up,

248
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,221
will it have a great impact on Miss Su?

249
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,821
Can you just shut up?

250
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:16,380
There can't be a problem
with her design.

251
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,660
If there is, it must be Su Ziyang.

252
00:11:19,181 --> 00:11:21,020
Yes. Within such a short time,

253
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:22,341
Ying can come up with a better plan.

254
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,912
That's her capability.

255
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,224
Of course.

256
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:26,421
That's Miss Su.

257
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,061
But her new plan

258
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:31,020
needs switchable glass,
a special kind of glass

259
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:32,301
that seems to be rare.

260
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:34,821
Isn't Tiandi Building Materials Corp
the sponsor?

261
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,860
She has asked them already, okay?

262
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:39,780
That type of glass is special,
and the size she wants is big.

263
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,181
It's hard to find.

264
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,656
Give me that.

265
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,020
Be mindful of your words.

266
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:15,272
Mingshi,

267
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:16,392
why are you here?

268
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:17,981
Ying asked me to come over

269
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:19,581
to see what I can do to help you.

270
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:22,581
She's in her crazy work mode again?

271
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,552
Yes.

272
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,421
But now she's got a new plan.

273
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:27,941
We're just looking for the materials.

274
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,221
She's really worked hard.

275
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:32,780
What about you? Is the pressure great?

276
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:34,020
Is Mr. Liu tough on you?

277
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,181
I want to find out

278
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:38,101
what went wrong as soon as possible.

279
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,168
Have you found anything?

280
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:52,968
How about this, Huixuan?

281
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:55,301
Why don't you have some rest?
I'll handle this.

282
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:57,341
I'll also check the details
of the construction.

283
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:00,712
That sounds good.

284
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:02,540
You're more professional
than I am anyway.

285
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,232
Go to rest.

286
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,660
15 minutes.

287
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:07,140
Wake me up in 15 minutes.

288
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:08,296
Okay.

289
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:31,592
Huixuan,

290
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:32,616
look.

291
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:20,968
Huixuan,

292
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,020
why are you here?

293
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,780
This is yours, right?

294
00:14:27,421 --> 00:14:29,581
I threw it away.
I don't want it anymore.

295
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:32,168
What happened?

296
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,221
You were shot down by Ying?

297
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,421
She said I was only suited
for managerial work.

298
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,776
So what?

299
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,020
You're giving up?

300
00:14:45,981 --> 00:14:47,701
When I started,

301
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:50,740
a senior told me
I wasn't fit to be a director.

302
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,260
He told me I didn't have talent,

303
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,341
I couldn't be tactful,

304
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:58,860
and that I was stubborn with my logic.

305
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,140
Anyway, he tried to belittle me.

306
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,061
So what then?

307
00:15:03,341 --> 00:15:04,260
What did you do?

308
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:07,301
So I worked harder.

309
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,140
The more he put me down,
the more I wanted

310
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,701
to show him some achievements.

311
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,981
Sometimes, persistence itself
is meaningless.

312
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,301
But during the process of it,

313
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:18,540
improving yourself

314
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,752
and creating value

315
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:20,968
is the meaningful part.

316
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:24,181
Besides, life is long.

317
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,421
Who's never been rejected

318
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,461
or criticized?

319
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,181
Others, like Tang Monk, had protectors,

320
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:31,020
yet they had to go through
a lot of difficulties.

321
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:32,540
You're just facing a small obstacle,

322
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,864
aren't you?

323
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,101
So, don't be unhappy anymore.

324
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,221
Just stick to your choice.

325
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:42,061
Alright, Huixuan, I'll listen to you.

326
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:53,196
(Meichi International Hospital)

327
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,701
You have a good appetite today.

328
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:16,701
My heart's bothering me.

329
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,701
I'm uncomfortable all over.

330
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,181
Your test results have come out.

331
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,061
All indicators are normal.

332
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,380
You can be discharged.

333
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,664
Discharged?

334
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:28,380
What a lousy hospital!

335
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,821
I'm uncomfortable,
but you're telling me to leave?

336
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,821
Could it be a psychological problem?

337
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:36,101
A lot of our patients

338
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:38,061
got better once they adjusted
their state of mind.

339
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:41,221
It sounds easy, but how do I adjust it?

340
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,000
Mr. Wang,

341
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:47,660
why would you ask me that?

342
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,701
You seem like a man of great wisdom

343
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,421
who is sensible and rational.

344
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,581
Look at your face.

345
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,900
Your forehead is full and the lower part
of your face is round.

346
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,020
You look kind.

347
00:17:00,341 --> 00:17:01,421
You won't be an ordinary man.

348
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,941
Stop talking nonsense.

349
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,461
In short, I won't leave
the hospital easily.

350
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,500
My heart's feeling uncomfortable again.

351
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,300
I'm telling you.
It's because my heart stent is broken.

352
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:13,461
I need to change it.

353
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:17,421
If you want to change it,

354
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:18,740
the cost won't be low.

355
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,260
The show team would cover it.

356
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:32,300
Mr. Wang, do you trust me?

357
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:34,221
Yes, I do.

358
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,540
That's good.

359
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,941
It's not necessarily better

360
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:42,020
if the heart stent
is replaced with a new one.

361
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,981
If you insist on
changing it to a new one,

362
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,740
it is very likely to cause side effects.

363
00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:47,340
What are the side effects?

364
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:49,661
The light symptoms are wound infections,

365
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,981
pain at the incision,

366
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:52,500
irregular heartbeat

367
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,701
and lower limb swelling.

368
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:57,461
If it's serious,

369
00:17:57,981 --> 00:17:59,421
it can easily cause severe bleeding,

370
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:01,820
myocardial infarction
and even cerebral infarction.

371
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,100
You are not doing
this surgery for the first time.

372
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,540
You should know it clearly.

373
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,260
Would it be that serious?

374
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,701
It's a conservative guess.

375
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:14,888
Dr. Qin,

376
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:16,181
I've asked about it.

377
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,300
You are very professional

378
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,861
in performing this surgery.

379
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,861
Could you personally perform
the surgery for me?

380
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:24,540
No problem.

381
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,820
Although I was just
transferred back here,

382
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,740
I haven't performed
surgery for six years,

383
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,221
and my operation is a bit rusty.

384
00:18:30,381 --> 00:18:31,780
With your trust in me,

385
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,820
I promise to complete this task.

386
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:39,260
6 years.

387
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,740
Really rusty.

388
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:45,300
It's okay. I'll practice.

389
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:47,780
Mr. Wang, it seems like
you don't believe in me.

390
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:49,820
I quite believed in you just now,

391
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,141
but now I don't.

392
00:18:53,861 --> 00:18:54,760
It's okay.

393
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,260
Think about it.

394
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:58,221
Once you've decided,

395
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,221
let me know.

396
00:19:05,141 --> 00:19:06,300
Still in half a month?

397
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:08,901
It might be too late then.

398
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,901
Fine, forget it.

399
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,360
Thanks.

400
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,060
Miss Su, you have a guest.

401
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,576
Thank you.

402
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:24,701
Why do you look so worried?

403
00:19:24,941 --> 00:19:25,861
Is this a bad time?

404
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,984
Not at all.

405
00:19:27,221 --> 00:19:28,168
You want me for something?

406
00:19:30,221 --> 00:19:31,981
I just happened
to have a meeting nearby.

407
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,661
On my way past your office,

408
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:35,661
I suddenly remembered
what my assistant told me.

409
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,381
You are looking for
a piece of switchable glass,

410
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,540
but it's not in stock.

411
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:40,780
Yes, it's hard to find.

412
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,080
Let me help you.

413
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:44,661
I happened to see it yesterday.

414
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:55,368
Hello.

415
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,141
Please wait a bit.

416
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:00,020
Look. Is that what you want?

417
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:04,381
That's it. Where did you find it?

418
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,260
My friend just happened to be renovating
their villa and ordered a piece.

419
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,661
I reserved it for you.

420
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:10,100
It'll arrive at 3 p.m. tomorrow.

421
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,141
Great.

422
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:13,060
It'd help me a lot.

423
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:14,901
Why are you being so polite to me?

424
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,780
It's okay. Just focus on your design.

425
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,300
If you need anything, just tell me.

426
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,141
I'll handle it for you.

427
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,280
I'm sorry.

428
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,661
Your delivery is here.
I'll leave you to it.

429
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:33,181
I'll tell you once it arrives.

430
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:34,141
Thank you. Take care.

431
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:44,488
So

432
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,141
are you saying
Wang Zili is pretending to be sick?

433
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:51,272
The man

434
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:53,540
is really after money.

435
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:57,340
Probably he is trying to get
more compensation from the show team.

436
00:20:58,381 --> 00:20:59,500
But since we know he's fine,

437
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:01,020
you shouldn't stress too much.

438
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:06,740
With your figure,

439
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,820
you're a model or a dancer?

440
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:09,544
Guess.

441
00:21:09,544 --> 00:21:10,856
Judging by your palm, your husband

442
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:12,100
will definitely be a chubby guy.

443
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,580
Is that so?

444
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,568
He wears glasses
and has a figure similar to mine.

445
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:15,464
What a coincidence!

446
00:21:15,464 --> 00:21:16,360
What's your zodiac sign?

447
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,384
Guess.

448
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,421
I guess you belong to me.

449
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,912
What are you doing?

450
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:26,340
Just post a few and that's enough.

451
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:28,500
This is what Yunsheng
has been busy with recently.

452
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:29,780
You must support him.

453
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,941
Sell fewer bottles of beer

454
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,500
and donate more.

455
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:34,100
Isn't this also a way
of doing good deeds?

456
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,580
Haven't I been supportive enough?

457
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:37,580
Do you have to post it there?

458
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,941
What's the meaning
of posting it on my QR code?

459
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,141
My apologies.

460
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:44,181
I was mistaken.

461
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,472
Hurry and rip it off.

462
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:48,820
Let me change the place.

463
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,704
Clean it up.

464
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,592
Hey.

465
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,221
Yunsheng is back.

466
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:56,776
Let me see.

467
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,141
Didn't you go
to deliver your love dinner?

468
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,461
Why are you back so soon?

469
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:10,381
Is Su Ying particularly moved?

470
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,941
Of course, she is. Let me see.

471
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,941
It's eaten up. She must be moved.

472
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,141
Su Ying is making another design.

473
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,820
Skipping meals and then overeating.

474
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,100
He is worrying about Su Ying's health.

475
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,300
Let me tell you. A girl like her

476
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,941
who is both talented
and beautiful is rare.

477
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:28,904
You must cherish her.

478
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:30,536
I do.

479
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:32,421
Why don't you confess your love then?

480
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,500
It is not the time.

481
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:38,461
Then when is the time?

482
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:40,584
Something tricky

483
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,941
has come up to her recently.

484
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:44,540
Let her finish it first.

485
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:46,381
Then I will find an opportunity.

486
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:48,264
Yunsheng,

487
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:50,381
Yisen is right.

488
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:52,540
A girl like Su Ying

489
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,820
never lacks handsome guys following her.

490
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,500
If you lose her someday,

491
00:22:57,701 --> 00:22:59,944
there's no turning back
and you can only cry.

492
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,701
I'll give the T-shirts to you.

493
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:05,580
(Meichi International Hospital)

494
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,701
Mr. Wang, in the latest plan,

495
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:09,500
switchable glass is used.

496
00:23:09,981 --> 00:23:12,701
This kind of glass
is stronger and more beautiful.

497
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,340
Most importantly,

498
00:23:14,421 --> 00:23:16,580
it's the best material
for holographic projection.

499
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:17,621
As soon as you turn it on,

500
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:20,701
your whole window
will turn into an ocean.

501
00:23:47,381 --> 00:23:48,360
Not just the ocean.

502
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
The desert or the stars.

503
00:23:49,621 --> 00:23:50,780
Any scenery you like.

504
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,060
You can switch at will.

505
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,981
It's not going to increase
the budget, right?

506
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:00,580
The new plan is indeed more expensive,

507
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,300
but to express our apology,

508
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,141
we won't charge you any additional fees.

509
00:24:05,221 --> 00:24:06,120
That's right.

510
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,432
Mr. Wang,

511
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:09,340
the amount of compensation

512
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:10,981
is all written in the agreement.

513
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,941
I could say it's a very large number.

514
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,780
And even all the cost
of your hospital stay

515
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,580
is covered by our team.

516
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,981
But this time my heart was damaged.

517
00:24:23,221 --> 00:24:25,901
What if there are any post-effects
or hidden dangers later?

518
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:26,780
Do I know it?

519
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,661
Who knows if I might end up
disabled in the future?

520
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,960
Right?

521
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:31,740
And I haven't worked for so many days.

522
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,381
You must compensate me.

523
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,981
So I can't sleep at night...

524
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:35,880
Mr. Wang,

525
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:38,321
this is all the checks you have done

526
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:39,661
since you were hospitalized.

527
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:42,141
It's clear in every respect
that your heart

528
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:43,432
doesn't have any problems

529
00:24:43,661 --> 00:24:44,540
or any after-effects.

530
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:46,540
If the show team needs it,

531
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,461
our hospital can provide the paperwork.

532
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,020
I can also testify.

533
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,861
Going legal won't help you.

534
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:00,616
Mr. Wang.

535
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,340
You see, today,

536
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:04,580
both Mr. Su and Miss Su

537
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,861
came to apologize in person.

538
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:08,500
So you...

539
00:25:08,661 --> 00:25:10,941
Mr. Wang, we are truly sorry.

540
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:15,272
What do you think?

541
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:17,260
Alright.

542
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,632
Where should I sign?

543
00:25:27,181 --> 00:25:29,981
The cost of my food delivery
these few days in the hospital.

544
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,861
Shouldn't your team cover it?

545
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:41,340
Ying, I'll go back and follow up

546
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,941
about the holographic projection.

547
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:43,381
Miss Su.

548
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:44,232
Alright, then...

549
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:45,736
Tian Mei.

550
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,141
I just heard about your new plan.

551
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,384
It's very good.

552
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:51,304
Thank you.

553
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,221
Actually,

554
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,901
your last plan was...

555
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:55,820
What are you talking about?

556
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:01,300
Didn't you see the message
Mr. Liu sent to the group chat?

557
00:26:02,141 --> 00:26:03,540
We are all going to the team meeting.

558
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:05,100
This accident has caused
such a big fuss.

559
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:07,060
Someone is to blame, right?

560
00:26:09,181 --> 00:26:10,221
The one who messed it up

561
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,861
is really going to be in hot water.

562
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,936
Let's go.

563
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,616
I'll go ahead.

564
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:23,580
I wonder who made the mess.

565
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,168
What are you doing?

566
00:26:28,268 --> 00:26:29,780
(House Design)

567
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,901
Making such a big mess.

568
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,181
Although the client has been pacified,

569
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,421
the issue must
be investigated thoroughly.

570
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:37,060
Which part went wrong?

571
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,901
Who exactly is responsible?

572
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,632
Speak up.

573
00:26:47,861 --> 00:26:49,020
I don't think anyone wants

574
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:51,421
to see such a thing happen.

575
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,740
But as you all know,

576
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:56,540
I am the executor of this project,

577
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,580
but the plan was provided by Su Ying.

578
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,780
You mean

579
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,221
there's a problem with the plan?

580
00:27:05,661 --> 00:27:06,981
We have simulated it before.

581
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,104
There are no problems.

582
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,480
No problems.

583
00:27:10,701 --> 00:27:12,181
It is, after all, just a simulation.

584
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,500
You didn't take into account
the factors at the site.

585
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,712
Mr. Su,

586
00:27:17,181 --> 00:27:19,181
you must be very clear
that besides the proposal,

587
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:20,780
improper construction or materials

588
00:27:20,861 --> 00:27:22,580
could totally cause an accident.

589
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,540
We have cameras filming
at the construction site.

590
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,861
You can check anything you want.

591
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:30,740
As for the material,

592
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,540
you can also inspect it.

593
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,181
Okay, speaking of that,
I want to ask you.

594
00:27:35,381 --> 00:27:37,500
Why wasn't there any glass
at the site after the accident?

595
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,621
Haven't you already inspected it?

596
00:27:39,861 --> 00:27:41,181
Property Management cleaned it up.

597
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:44,540
You're not going to
blame your plan's mistake

598
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,861
on me, are you?

599
00:27:49,221 --> 00:27:51,221
Mr. Liu, if there's no problem
with the construction,

600
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,381
what could be the cause

601
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:53,300
other than her design?

602
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,780
It must be her design.

603
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,701
Quite a heated discussion.

604
00:27:58,141 --> 00:27:59,080
Mr. Yang, you're here.

605
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,661
Is there any result yet?

606
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,221
Not yet, but we will have one soon.

607
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,448
Mr. Liu,

608
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,100
please understand

609
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,100
that we're your sponsor,

610
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:09,580
and this matter

611
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,500
has caused a loss
to our group's reputation.

612
00:28:11,861 --> 00:28:12,744
We understand completely.

613
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,221
We will definitely give you

614
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:16,461
a satisfactory answer.

615
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,100
Mr. Yang, the conclusion
is actually quite clear.

616
00:28:19,661 --> 00:28:21,381
Miss Su, after all, is still young,

617
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:22,861
so making mistakes is natural.

618
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,260
As long as she admits it.

619
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:27,752
Mr. Su,

620
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,221
don't jump to conclusions so early.

621
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,864
We've pulled up

622
00:28:33,864 --> 00:28:36,221
the actual delivery records
from the building material market

623
00:28:36,941 --> 00:28:38,701
and discovered the real product
Yangfan Studio took

624
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,020
is a completely different size of glass.

625
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,200
Please review.

00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:54,060
(Glass Delivery Record
of Tiandi Building Materials Corp)

627
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,621
Mr. Yang, I think
there's some misunderstanding.

628
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:07,861
Your confidence is good,

629
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,981
but it would be better if you could be
more meticulous in your work.

630
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,176
It's clear whose problem it is now.

631
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,224
Mr. Liu.

632
00:29:21,941 --> 00:29:23,300
It must be a problem with the material.

633
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:26,340
Do we even need to ask?
How could Miss Su make a mistake?

634
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,421
Right, Miss Su?

635
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:13,384
Thank you.

My business card.

637
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,300
But if you still hold grudges

638
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,901
and can't let things go,

639
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,300
you can choose not to take it.

640
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,300
Who uses business cards now?

641
00:30:38,981 --> 00:30:40,020
Right, that makes sense.

642
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,904
People use WeChat now.

643
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Add me on WeChat.

00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:40,500
today I came here

650
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,461
because I want to tell you something.

651
00:31:45,661 --> 00:31:46,901
I have something to say to you, too.

652
00:31:48,621 --> 00:31:49,461
You go first.

653
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,381
Well,

654
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,260
didn't you bump
into someone in my studio that day?

655
00:32:06,901 --> 00:32:08,020
He is my ex-boyfriend.

- Yes.
- Yes.

660

The holographic sea view

661
00:32:27,141 --> 00:32:28,100
was absolutely fantastic.

662
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,580
It exceeded expectations.

663
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,260
The contrast before and after
was too strong.

664
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,661
- And those bullet comments.
- Yes.

665
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:34,901
I was worried sick when she said

666
00:32:34,901 --> 00:32:36,100
she wanted to change the plan.

in the face of danger.

talented.

670
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:42,621
That's why she had the confidence.

right now?

674
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:48,221
She is working hard.

675
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:49,861
She's still so dedicated.

676
00:32:50,381 --> 00:32:51,580
How can she be so calm in the face

677
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:52,780
of such a good response?

678
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,141
What big scenes hasn't she seen before?

What honor hasn't she received?

680
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,221
Would she even care about
netizens' comments about her?

681
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:00,392
- No.
- No.

So,

683
00:33:01,621 --> 00:33:02,780
is it this spirit

- Yes.
- Yes.

686
00:33:05,221 --> 00:33:06,421
So should we

687
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,861
work even harder?

688

- Yes.
- Yes.

- Working.

It is my goal but your honor.

744
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,060
Can they be the same?

745
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,660
Yeah, show us.

746
00:34:58,861 --> 00:35:00,461
Yes, Yunsheng, consider it
a way to inspire us.

747
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,781
Bring it out.

748
00:35:01,781 --> 00:35:02,728
Right away.

749
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,584
Let me take a look.

750
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:13,100
(Qin Yunsheng)
(Congrats, you finished your project.)

751
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:14,461
(Are you free tonight?)

752
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:16,660
(Let's celebrate it at Piyixia?)

753
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,060
(Su Ying)
(Okay, but I'll be busy tomorrow.)

754
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,220
So you almost
confessed successfully last time?

755
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,861
Why didn't you make it?

756
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:25,160
Did you lose your nerve?

757
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:26,696
No.

758
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,301
Something unexpected happened,

759
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,461
and we got interrupted.

760
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,901
So you asked Su Ying out today to...?

761
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,100
Give that T-shirt to her.

762
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,500
T-That T-shirt?

763
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,580
That is good.

764
00:35:39,981 --> 00:35:41,341
We will cheer you on.

765
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,741
Cheer on who?

766
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,341
You're here.

767
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:45,320
Well.

768
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:47,580
Isn't Yunsheng organizing
a charity event?

769
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,341
We are giving him a pep talk.

770
00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:52,821
Miss Su,

771
00:35:52,821 --> 00:35:55,140
I don't usually watch that kind of show.

772
00:35:55,341 --> 00:35:56,421
I watched it all for you.

773
00:35:57,381 --> 00:35:59,220
Your holographic glass is really cool.

774
00:35:59,381 --> 00:36:00,861
I even want to get one for my place.

775
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,381
No problem. Friends
of Dr. Qin get a discount.

776
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:05,800
Yunsheng,

777
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,700
don't you have a gift for Miss Su?

778
00:36:12,261 --> 00:36:13,192
Yes.

779
00:36:13,901 --> 00:36:15,941
I invited you over today
because I have something for you.

780
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:19,301
What is it?
You're sounding so mysterious.

781
00:36:19,301 --> 00:36:20,461
It's a T-shirt.

782
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:22,180
Exactly the same one.

783
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:23,301
One for you and one for him.

784
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,096
Have a look.

785
00:36:30,861 --> 00:36:31,784
This...

786
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:35,100
Isn't this the one I picked?

787
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,620
Isn't this the T-shirt
for that charity event?

788
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:39,861
It's exactly the same.

789
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,100
After you picked this,

790
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,000
everyone loved it.

791
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,620
So I thought I would give you one.

792
00:36:47,981 --> 00:36:48,968
Thank you.

793
00:36:50,184 --> 00:36:51,140
I'll try it on.

794
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,072
Okay.

795
00:36:55,821 --> 00:36:57,020
Why did you give that as a gift?

796
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:58,620
That was what I was supposed to gift.

797
00:36:58,941 --> 00:37:00,421
Shouldn't you give her a couple's shirt?

798
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:01,700
Bro, go get one.

799
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:03,400
Stop fooling around.

800
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:06,220
Every gift Su Ying gave me
was very thoughtful.

801
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:08,220
And this is a confession.

802
00:37:08,741 --> 00:37:10,580
I can't be reckless.
I need to make preparations.

803
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,040
It makes sense.

804
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,421
Giving a gift is all about sincerity.

805
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:14,741
Don't let it fail.

806
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:16,620
What's it to you?

807
00:37:16,808 --> 00:37:17,741
I...

808
00:37:17,741 --> 00:37:18,620
I was wrong.

809
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,020
What Yunsheng said makes sense.

810
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,100
Prepare meticulously.

811
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,861
Yes, I must prepare well.

812
00:37:23,301 --> 00:37:24,168
Prepare for what?

813
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:27,540
The fit is so perfect.

814
00:37:29,821 --> 00:37:32,020
P-Prepare for the charity event.

815
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,381
We need to meticulously prepare.

816
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,461
Yes.

817
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,540
- We need to prepare well.
- For the charity event.

What do you think?

825
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,341
The topics are very innovative,
and I really like them.

826
00:38:11,341 --> 00:38:13,781
But I am more concerned
about your thoughts on designers.

827
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:15,741
Don't worry about that at all.

828
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:16,981
We have specifically selected

829
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:19,020
some up-and-coming, talented designers.

830
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,341
I believe the result

831
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:21,660
will be absolutely stunning.

832
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:22,632
Where's Miss Su?

833
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,976
Su Ying?

834
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,261
She clearly stated
that she had other work arrangements.

835
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,660
Maybe it's because our show
is so popular now,

836
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,821
and she's got a lot of big cases.

837
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,220
No, that's not it.

838
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:33,620
Miss Su's focus recently

839
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,020
has been on a charity event,

840
00:38:35,341 --> 00:38:37,301
so she won't be joining us for now.

841
00:38:41,341 --> 00:38:42,381
So...

842
00:38:43,741 --> 00:38:45,461
The success of the first two seasons

843
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,421
of House Design
is inseparable from the designers.

844
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:50,180
Our group's sponsorship
is based on that.

845
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:52,140
If you are changing the designer now,

846
00:38:52,261 --> 00:38:53,500
we will have

847
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,140
to reassess your show.

848
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:00,020
Understood. I'll arrange it right away.

849
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:03,981

We don't accept cash.

850
00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:07,461
And it's so hot. You don't have to
come here personally.

851
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,060
Just tell me what you want to donate.

852
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,580
I'll pick it up
from your house after work.

853
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:12,781
Okay, thank you, Dr. Qin.

854
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,960
You can leave.

855
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,912
Be careful.

856
00:39:19,461 --> 00:39:20,341
You're here.

857
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:21,256
I'm here.

858
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,440
What's this?

859
00:39:23,301 --> 00:39:24,220
It's a charity event.

860
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:25,381
How can I not donate some?

861
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,952
Give it to me.

862
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:32,680
You've been busy all day?

863
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,341
Yes. It's a public welfare event,

864
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,620
and everyone is enthusiastic.

865
00:39:36,901 --> 00:39:37,832
I'll help you.

866
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:39,880
It's so beautiful.

867
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,580

Ms. Han.

869
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:45,660
Why did you bring so much?

870
00:39:46,981 --> 00:39:47,981
It's so pretty.

871
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,140
This is so special.

872
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:52,461
Did you design it?

873
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:55,660
It's really beautiful.

874
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,901
- You're here.
- Miss Su.

00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,981
Dr. Zhang.

876
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:59,461
You even wear our event shirt.

877
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:00,781
Ms. Han, look.

878
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:02,020
They're like wearing couple's shirts,

879
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,461
while we're like wearing uniforms.

880
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,616
Yes, look.

881
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,381
Their jeans are the same color.

882
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,261
Look, I told you.

883
00:40:08,461 --> 00:40:09,941
They are such a perfect match, right?

884
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,861
- Yes.
- They're such a perfect match.

885
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,580
Get to work. There's a lot to do.

886
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,104
It's okay, Yunsheng. We're not busy.

887
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,741
Learn to read the room.

888
00:40:18,261 --> 00:40:19,261
We'll get back to work.

889
00:40:19,261 --> 00:40:20,168
I'll leave you two.

890
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:21,928
We'll leave you two.

891
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:28,328

892
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,620
for coming to help.

00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:48,648
Why are you here?

897
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,020
I saw the announcement from your studio.

898
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,341
I've got something to do nearby,

899
00:40:52,461 --> 00:40:53,781
so I came by to have a look.

(Kind Action for Children Charity Sale)
Play with it for a while.

901
00:41:04,741 --> 00:41:05,700
All made by yourself, right?

902
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:08,861
Your skills are still as good as before.

903
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,941

904
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,261
You're donating this too?

905

Kevin, give those to them.

906

This is my little contribution.

Thank you, Mr. Yang, for your support
of our hospital's event.

908
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:38,781

909
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:40,901
