(Su Ying)
(Okay, the bricks are faulty.)

19

(Please check for me.)

20
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,309
I acknowledge
Su Ying's professional skills.

21
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:14,788
If it's indeed an accident,

22
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:16,708
aren't we a bit irrational

23
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:19,848
and radical to replace her so soon?

24
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:23,508
Here's my suggestion.

25
00:02:24,589 --> 00:02:27,749
Let's invite another designer

26
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:30,469
to pitch against SU.

27
00:02:31,508 --> 00:02:32,548
What do you think?

28
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:36,508
That will work.

29
00:02:36,508 --> 00:02:37,384
Yeah.

30
00:02:38,149 --> 00:02:39,144
That's good.

31
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:41,629
I think it's fair.

32
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:43,708
Yeah, we agree.

33
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:47,720
What do you guys think?

34
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,508
Judging from the situation,

35
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,708
a pitching is needed
to show authenticity.

36
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:55,668
Director, I agree with you.

37
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:57,029
And you, Yunsheng?

38
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:02,029
I believe Su Ying

39
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:03,912
can win

40
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,548
any contest.

41
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:11,708
Okay, then let's proceed
with the director's plan.

42
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:13,988
Okay, that's it.

43
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:15,708
Okay.

44
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:20,776
Hello, Zhengwen.

45
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:22,548
Miss Su, sorry.

46
00:03:22,948 --> 00:03:24,228
I've been busy lately.

47
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:25,988
Sorry to bother you.

48
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:29,469
It's okay. I've asked around

49
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:30,708
about the bricks.

50
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:32,708
The client changed his mind.

51
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:33,800
What?

52
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:37,548
But it's okay. I negotiated.

53
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:40,469
Then he eventually agreed
to give up some bricks

54
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,388
with some additional terms.

55
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:45,668
But there's nothing unacceptable.

56
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:47,368
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

57
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,668
We will bear the extra cost.

58
00:03:50,228 --> 00:03:52,668
Okay, business is business.
I'll let you cover the cost.

59
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:54,440
Again.

60
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:56,629
Tell me whenever you need anything.

61
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:58,504
Alright.

62
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:07,909
Mr. Jiang, we've
solved the problem with the bricks.

63
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:09,149
We won't be delayed.

64
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:13,268
Okay, no more problems, right?

65
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:16,268
Absolutely no.
We will stick to the schedule.

66
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:19,309
I'll let you handle the rest.

67
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:22,789
Sorry about the trouble.

68
00:04:28,549 --> 00:04:29,549
Ying, I'm sorry.

69
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:31,869
I didn't expect Tiandi Corp
to make such a mistake.

70
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:38,189
Tian Mei, you're
in charge of the project.

71
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:39,749
You can't shift the blame

72
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:41,429
whenever something goes wrong.

73
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:42,948
You have to supervise it.

74
00:04:43,109 --> 00:04:44,588
Just check the delivery list.

75
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,749
You could have found out

76
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:47,348
about this issue.

77
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,989
And do you know how it all started?

78
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:54,508
You changed the plan behind my back
and went for rare materials.

79
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,429
Ying, as you said,

80
00:04:57,908 --> 00:04:59,468
I'm in charge of this project.

81
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:02,148
I just wanted to present
something different.

82
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:04,268
Was I wrong to be innovative?

83
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:06,069
It's good to be innovative.

84
00:05:06,468 --> 00:05:08,429
But you can't be unrealistic.

85
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:09,669
Any plan you present

86
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:11,629
to the clients must be carried out.

87
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,669
Or it's a fraud, right?

88
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:18,600
Okay, I see.

89
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:23,588
Alright, let's head back to the firm.

90
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:31,720
Hello, Mi Bai.

91
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:33,268
There is a mistake in your plan.

92
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:34,629
Please come over.

93
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:37,268
What? A mistake?

94
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:44,232
Mi Bai,

95
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:46,869
is there some kind of misunderstanding?

96
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:49,348
There's nothing like that.
It's a mistake.

97
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:50,588
Take a look.

98
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:51,880
No way.

99
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:53,948
For general hospitals,

100
00:05:54,549 --> 00:05:57,109
the net height should not be
less than 2.6 meters

101
00:05:57,348 --> 00:05:59,708
(Design Overview)
for consultation rooms and 2.8 meters

102
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:02,109
for hospital wards
under conditions of natural ventilation.

103
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:04,348
But your plan obviously

104
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:06,588
didn't abide by this regulation.

105
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:09,429
My design has been checked many times.

106
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,488
There can't be
such an elementary mistake. How...

107
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:17,629
Are you suspecting that I did something?

108
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:21,468
I've double-checked the data many times.

109
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:22,588
It wasn't like this.

110
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:24,189
You got it and it went wrong?

111
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:26,588
You know very well what you did.

112
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:29,629
Why would I do that?

113
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:32,309
You never wanted me on the project.

114
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:33,352
Did you?

115
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:36,388
I don't care what you think.

116
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:39,240
But I asked you here
to solve this problem.

117
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:41,669
I'm sorry that your plan

118
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:43,189
has a major mistake.

119
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:44,588
I also have to explain to others.

120
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:48,148
Okay, what do you want?

121
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,588
We can't just let you run this project.

122
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:53,828
We want a pitching.

123
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:54,749
A pitching?

124
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:56,989
That's right.

125
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:59,989
I guess a famous designer like you
finds it humiliating

126
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,268
to do a pitching, right?

127
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:05,869
I will accept it if it's my mistake.

128
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:07,348
But I won't take the blame

129
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:09,429
for something I didn't do wrong.

130
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:10,789
I can do a pitching,

131
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:13,828
but I don't accept that it's based on
an alleged mistake of mine.

132
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,148
If you can't accept it, just quit.

133
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:21,148
Just say that SU Design Firm
can't take on the task.

134
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:23,789
You think you can set me up?

135
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:26,309
SU Design Firm
has been running for years

136
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,588
based on capability instead of schemes.

137
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:31,549
Alright, I'll look forward to it.

138
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:33,160
I won't let you down.

139
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:34,600
Wait.

140
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,189
There's something else you should know.

141
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:40,869
Yunsheng approved of pitching.

142
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,869
He stood by my decision.

143
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:05,512
How did it go?

144
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:10,989
I'm sure you'll win the pitching.

145
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:13,948
So you knew.

146
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:17,629
Why did you agree to the pitching?

147
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:21,588
Because the professionals
pointed out a mistake.

148
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:23,508
And it's a joint decision.

149
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:24,989
I don't get to say no.

150
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,429
There can't be a problem with my design.

151
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:29,549
I double-checked it many times.

152
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,229
Isn't it weird that it became

153
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:32,509
faulty in her hands?

154
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,868
Mingshi handed it over to me.

155
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,509
I printed it out in person.

156
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:42,348
I don't think Mi Bai had access to it.

157
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:45,868
She couldn't have changed the data.

158
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:54,069
I've talked to her about us.

159
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:56,069
She wouldn't target it.

160
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,608
Don't overthink.

161
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:00,029
Overthink?

162
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,828
Dr. Qin, do you really know her?

163
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:06,909
I've drafted so many plans

164
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:08,909
without a single mistake.

165
00:09:09,468 --> 00:09:10,948
And you'd rather believe in her?

166
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:12,988
No, you got me wrong.

167
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:16,789
Let's try to think

168
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:18,828
if something else went wrong.

169
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,228
Dr. Qin, someone's looking for you.

170
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:25,128
Go back to work.

171
00:09:25,468 --> 00:09:26,376
I'm heading back.

172
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:28,232
Talk at night.

173
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:33,448
Let's go.

174
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,549
Xuan, I've booked the KTV room.

175
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,828
Let's head over together
once you're here.

176
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:42,549
Almost there. Just a second.

177
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:47,309
Okay, I'll sing with you tonight...

178
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:49,828
Mingshi, you're going to a KTV?

179
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:50,948
- Let us join you.
- Right.

180
00:09:51,228 --> 00:09:52,069
No...

181
00:09:52,748 --> 00:09:56,029
I-I'm singing online with a friend.

182
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:57,608
It's an app.

183
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,348
So boring.

184
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,200
Right.

185
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:01,069
Let's go.

186
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:02,149
Will you come with us?

187
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:06,108
I think I left something at the firm.

188
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,144
Go ahead.

189
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,069
Okay, see you around.

190
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:10,348
- Bye.
- Bye.

191
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:11,309
Bye.

192
00:10:13,348 --> 00:10:14,280
Bye.

193
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:31,708
Get in.

194
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:33,348
Get in.

195
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:34,189
Coming.

196
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:37,736
That was cool, right?

197
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:40,520
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

198
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:45,512
Who is it?

199
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:47,816
It's Su.

200
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:52,069
Hello, Su.

201
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:55,108
Hello, Xuan, what's up?

202
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:56,909
Drink with me tonight.

203
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:02,216
I'm going to a KTV with someone.

204
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:03,752
KTV?

205
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:05,669
That will do.

206
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:07,348
Who is it? Someone I know?

207
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,549
He's a client.
I don't think you know him.

208
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:16,029
I will get to know him at the KTV.

209
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,468
It's a tough day. Keep me company.

210
00:11:21,628 --> 00:11:24,029
Fine, I'll cancel that appointment

211
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,228
just for you.

212
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,149
You're the best.

213
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:30,909
Should I get Mingshi and the others?

214
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,149
The more, the merrier.

215
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:34,748
Fine, I'll text them in the group chat.

216
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:37,029
Okay, see you at the usual place.

217
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:38,248
Bye.

218
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:39,336
Bye.

219
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,748
Our first date.

220
00:11:46,568 --> 00:11:47,429
Let's go.

221
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:48,360
Let's go.

222
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:15,828
(Su Ying)
(I'll go to KTV with Huixuan.)

223
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:17,189
(We will eat out.)

224
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:23,528
(Qin Yunsheng)
(When should I pick you up?)

225
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:27,368
(Su Ying)
(No need.)

226
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:38,732
♪Hey, lover♪

227
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,149
I think

228
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:45,868
Mi Bai is highly suspicious.

229
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:48,789
She's been giving you a hard time.

230
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:51,029
I bet she has something to do with this.

231
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:54,628
But Qin Yunsheng trusts her over me.

232
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:59,309
He's just too kind.

233
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:02,468
Don't worry. A fraud is a fraud.

234
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:04,828
I don't mind the pitching.

235
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:07,029
But I want him to vouch for me

236
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:08,708
when everyone is questioning me.

237
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:09,948
Can he do that?

238
00:13:09,948 --> 00:13:10,909
Yeah, he can.

239
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:12,108
Come on, let's drink.

240
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:13,509
Don't be upset.

241
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:17,269
Ying, don't be upset.

242
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:19,389
Our plan is solid.

243
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:21,628
Someone is trying to set us up.

244
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:23,549
Yeah, we're out having fun.

245
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:24,789
Let's forget about it.

246
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:26,088
I know.

247
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:28,708
We've worked so hard for it

248
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,389
and someone found fault in it.

249
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,868
That's why I'm upset.

250
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,509
But we're out to enjoy a little.

251
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:37,108
And everyone's keeping you company.

252
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,189
Yeah.

253
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:39,309
Exactly, Ying.

254
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:40,468
Besides, who are we?

255
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:42,228
True blue will never strain.

256
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:44,149
Even if there is a pitching,

257
00:13:44,468 --> 00:13:45,868
we can't possibly lose.

258
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:46,828
Yeah.

259
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:50,789
And you're always our best designer.

260
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:52,988
SU Design Firm is undefeatable.

261
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:54,309
We stand by you.

262
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:55,149
Stand by you.

263
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:56,069
Yeah.

264
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,828
SU Design Firm is undefeatable.

265
00:13:58,189 --> 00:13:59,069
Thanks for being here.

266
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:00,840
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

267
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:02,792
Slow down.

268
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:07,080
Ying, which song would you like to sing?

269
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:09,029
I'll do it myself.

270
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,069
Alright.

271
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:11,269
I'll go on then.

272
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:19,389
Love is so much trouble.

273
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:23,432
Is it?

274
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:26,108
I think we're just fine.

275
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:30,228
They will notice.

276
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,669
You know this song.

277
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:35,272
I won't sing.

278
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:36,872
It's a love song.

279
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:38,429
I'll only sing with you.

280
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,648
What?

281
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:43,189
I said I'd only
sing love songs with you.

282
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:45,288
What?

283
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:50,389
Well…

284
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,429
You said you'd only battle with me
on love songs.

285
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:55,429
Yeah, Huixuan said

286
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:58,149
she could sing love songs
better than me. No way.

287
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,029
Give me the mic.

288
00:14:59,029 --> 00:14:59,948
Battle...

289
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:01,000
Come on, battle.

290
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:02,789
Which song do you want?

291
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:04,909
Let's go for

292
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,208
"I Only Care About You".

293
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,909
Okay. "I Only Care About You".

294
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:18,504
Welcome home.

295
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:24,029
Who are you?

296
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:26,029
Why are you in my daughter's house?

297
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,672
Sit down.

298
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:44,296
Okay.

299
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,628
Are you Qin Yunsheng?

300
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:54,152
Yes.

301
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:55,628
A doctor?

302
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:56,776
Yes.

303
00:15:56,776 --> 00:15:57,800
Cardiac surgery department?

304
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:00,789
Yes, Su Ying told you about me?

305
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,789
I saw you on TV.

306
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:05,628
I watched House Design.

307
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:08,029
I watched everything she was in.

308
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:14,108
It's so late.

309
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,669
Why are you at my daughter's place?

310
00:16:17,588 --> 00:16:18,568
Auntie.

311
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:20,828
Su Ying and I

312
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:22,760
are dating.

313
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:26,069
You're dating?

314
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:28,456
Yes.

315
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:34,536
So where is she?

316
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:36,789
She went to KTV with her friends.

317
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:38,792
And you...

318
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:42,856
I'm making soup for her
to not get a hangover.

319
00:16:44,748 --> 00:16:45,736
Soup?

320
00:16:46,628 --> 00:16:47,509
You're making a soup?

321
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:49,544
Yes.

322
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:54,149
You know how to make soup?

323
00:16:54,628 --> 00:16:55,560
Just a bit.

324
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:57,064
So...

325
00:16:59,348 --> 00:17:00,309
what else can you do?

326
00:17:00,748 --> 00:17:01,588
I can...

327
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:04,749
I'm still learning many things.

328
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,229
Where did she go for drinking?

329
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:14,188
It's already so late.

330
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,789
It hurts internal organs

331
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:19,628
to sleep after 11 PM.

332
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:21,428
She rarely drinks.

333
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,789
I think it's a special case today.

334
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:27,789
Call her and get her home.

335
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:29,576
Now?

336
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:33,388
Okay, I'll call her.

337
00:17:36,844 --> 00:17:40,716
♪I want to chase happiness,
start an adventure♪

338
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:44,628

339

Su.

341
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,469
Su, your phone.

Are you almost done?
Let me pick you up.

347
00:18:01,469 --> 00:18:03,229
Dr. Qin, come and sing.

00:18:06,348 --> 00:18:08,989
Su, it's so late.
When are you coming home?

350
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:11,949
That's...

351
00:18:11,949 --> 00:18:13,029
Mrs. Zhou!

352
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:15,469
Say hello to Mrs. Zhou!

353
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:16,908
- Hello, Auntie.
- Hello, Auntie.

354
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,108
Let me tell you.

355
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:21,269
Mrs. Zhou sings
"A Spray of Peach Blossoms" so well.

356
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,108
Get her to sing for us.

357
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:24,069
Get her the song.

358
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,069
Hurry up, Mrs. Zhou.

359
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:27,108
You're totally wasted.

360
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:28,628
Come home now.

361
00:18:29,188 --> 00:18:30,388
I will have Qin pick you up.

362
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:33,069
No, I don't want him.

363
00:18:33,668 --> 00:18:35,229
I will keep singing. Bye.

364
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:36,200
Careful.

365
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:45,288
I'll pick her up now.
Don't worry, Auntie.

366
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:47,188
Hurry up.

367
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:48,789
Don't worry. I'm going now.

368
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:58,069
Leave me alone.

369
00:18:58,709 --> 00:18:59,752
Leave me alone.

370
00:19:00,188 --> 00:19:01,108
You're back.

371
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:05,229
Mrs. Zhou, I miss you so much.

372
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:07,628
How much did you drink?

373
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:10,148

374
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:16,668

375
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:18,184
Okay.

376
00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:27,668
How can she drink so much?
It's bad for health.

377
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:29,828
She rarely drinks.

378
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,188
Maybe she's happy today.

379
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:34,069

380
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:38,312

It's okay.

382

383
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:12,549
I've drafted so many plans

384
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:14,509
without a single mistake.

385
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:16,509
And you'd rather believe in her?

386
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:32,296
It's hot.

387
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:35,112
Are you thirsty?

388
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,148
You only sing with me

389
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:45,789
and drink my coconut juice?

390
00:20:46,868 --> 00:20:47,908
Of course.

391
00:20:47,908 --> 00:20:49,949
I will share everything with you.

Aren't we discreet?

395
00:21:01,148 --> 00:21:02,469
I think I am very discreet.

396
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:03,868
You are discreet?

397
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:05,509
With what you did at the KTV,

398
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:07,188
I was afraid Su might notice it.

399
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:08,789
We're alone now.

400
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:10,989
Shouldn't we focus on the date?

401
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:14,229
Want some?

402
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,069
No, absolutely no.

403
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,448

404
00:21:19,188 --> 00:21:20,552

the weird things if it weren't for you.

406
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:25,828
That's why you have to date me.

407
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:29,388
Then I get to take you
to try all the food in the world.

408
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:32,904
So what will we do after dinner?

409

as you predicted.

It's probably a hangover.

to cancel the project too.

00:29:29,828 --> 00:29:31,628
Mother, you're sneaky.

563
00:29:37,388 --> 00:29:38,229
Tell me.

564
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,628
Why did you fight?

565
00:29:47,148 --> 00:29:49,908
Su, there are all kinds of issues

566
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,069
in every relationship.

567
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:54,388
Since you love him

568
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:58,549
and you know he didn't
cause the conflict,

569
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:00,309
then you should tolerate,

570
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:01,828
understand, and trust him.

571
00:30:02,428 --> 00:30:03,989
It's the most important thing.

572
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:07,749
I see.

573
00:30:10,348 --> 00:30:11,304
That's good.

574
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:12,744
Time for bed.

575
00:30:32,628 --> 00:30:34,628
(I double-checked it many times.)

576
00:30:34,828 --> 00:30:36,309
(Isn't it weird that it became)

577
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:37,549
(faulty in her hands?)

578
00:30:37,908 --> 00:30:39,388
Mingshi handed it over to me.

579
00:30:39,908 --> 00:30:41,549
I printed it out in person.

580
00:30:42,148 --> 00:30:42,989
I don't think

581
00:30:43,668 --> 00:30:45,469
Mi Bai had access to it.

582
00:30:46,588 --> 00:30:47,428
Let's try to think

583
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:49,549
if something else went wrong.

584
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,868
(SU Interior Design Firm)

585
00:30:57,868 --> 00:30:59,628
Mingshi, think hard.

586
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:01,348
After I gave you the plan,

587
00:31:01,588 --> 00:31:03,309
did anyone have access to it

588
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,989
before you gave it to Dr. Qin?

589
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:08,989
No, I didn't give it to anyone.

590
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:11,269
I handed it to Yunsheng in person.

591
00:31:12,588 --> 00:31:15,828
But we don't know
if anyone had access to it

592
00:31:16,229 --> 00:31:17,348
after he took it.

593
00:31:18,388 --> 00:31:19,428
That's what I thought.

594
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:20,949
He said no.

595
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:22,069
That's why I'm asking you.

596
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:23,989
Think harder.

597
00:31:27,188 --> 00:31:28,749
Come to think of it,

598
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:32,828
Tian Mei offered

599
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:35,229
to print it out for me.

600
00:31:36,108 --> 00:31:37,069
Tian Mei?

601
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:39,628
But I told her specifically

602
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:42,828
that it is very important
and she shouldn't make a mistake.

603
00:31:42,828 --> 00:31:44,029
What could have gone wrong?

604
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:48,789
Get Tian Mei here.

605
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:50,120
Okay.

606
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:00,428
Yes, Ying?

607
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:04,392
Tian Mei.

608
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:07,388
You printed the project plan
for Meichi, didn't you?

609
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:09,160
Yeah.

610
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:11,269
Why didn't the data
match the one on the PC?

611
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:12,388
Why did 2.85

612
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:13,628
become 2.6?

613
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:17,989
I'm sorry, Ying.

614
00:32:17,989 --> 00:32:19,908
Mingshi said the bricks were wrong,

615
00:32:19,989 --> 00:32:21,348
so I might have been distracted.

616
00:32:21,348 --> 00:32:22,868
Don't find excuses.

617
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:24,949
You're not a newbie.

618
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:26,668
How can you make such a rookie mistake?

619
00:32:26,908 --> 00:32:28,269
Yeah, I won't find excuses.

620
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,229
What should we do?

621
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:33,108
They're obviously
making something out of it.

622
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,108
I said we shouldn't have
taken on this project.

623
00:32:36,108 --> 00:32:37,029
It's a thankless job.

624
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:38,588
You're shifting the blame?

625
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:40,069
No, I don't mean that.

626
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:42,388
Ying, how do I make up for it now?

627
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:43,709
You can cut my wage.

628
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:46,824
Tian Mei.

629
00:32:47,069 --> 00:32:49,868
I've seen great potential in you
ever since you joined us.

630
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,749
But I'm also starting
to see your shortcomings.

631
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:54,428
Fine, you just joined us.

632
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:56,989
I can offer you
greater patience and trust.

633
00:32:57,148 --> 00:32:58,628
But you have to learn the lesson.

634
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:01,108
Don't make
the same mistakes again, understand?

635
00:33:01,668 --> 00:33:02,536
Yes, I understand.

636
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:04,828
I promise it won't happen again.

637
00:33:06,749 --> 00:33:08,108
Fine, you can go.

638
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:39,188
Auntie, are you okay?

639
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:40,469
I'm fine.

640
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:42,280
Sit down. Slowly.

641
00:33:42,628 --> 00:33:45,828
I didn't have breakfast.
Maybe it's just low blood sugar.

642
00:33:46,348 --> 00:33:48,428
I'm just a bit dizzy.

643
00:33:49,949 --> 00:33:50,888
Low blood sugar?

644
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:53,388
Has it happened before?

645
00:33:54,229 --> 00:33:55,188
No.

646
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:57,469
Here.

647
00:33:58,749 --> 00:33:59,656
How about this?

648
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:01,428
Come with me for a checkup.

649
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:07,188
I'm okay. Go to work.

650
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,120
Go to work. I'm fine.

651
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:11,748
But you're sweating.

652
00:34:16,268 --> 00:34:17,628
I was walking.

653
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:18,788
That's normal.

654
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:20,708
Go to work.

655
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:25,544
Alright then.

656
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:27,708
Call me if you need me.

657
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:28,776
Okay.

658
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:30,469
Go to work.

659
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:31,869
Rest well.

660
00:34:35,268 --> 00:34:36,200
Wipe your sweat.

661
00:34:36,648 --> 00:34:37,588
Go to work.

662
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:38,504
Okay.

663
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:42,248
I'll leave now.

664
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:44,349
Go ahead.

665
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:01,932
(Appointment made. Neurosurgery No. 62)

666
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:10,389
Ying, Tian Mei looked upset

667
00:35:10,588 --> 00:35:11,748
and just walked out.

668
00:35:12,429 --> 00:35:13,588
What did you talk about?

669
00:35:14,108 --> 00:35:15,080
I figured it out.

670
00:35:15,628 --> 00:35:17,069
It was our problem.

671
00:35:18,788 --> 00:35:20,069
Tian Mei printed it wrong?

672
00:35:25,509 --> 00:35:26,549
We must learn from it

673
00:35:27,188 --> 00:35:29,829
and do our jobs in person from now on.

674
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:31,429
I'm sorry, Ying.

675
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,429
It's my fault this time.

676
00:35:34,148 --> 00:35:36,588
I'll reflect on myself.

677
00:35:36,744 --> 00:35:37,628
That's enough.

678
00:35:37,628 --> 00:35:38,568
Ying.

679
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:41,069
The post against us isn't under control.

680
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:42,909
It was even pinned to the top.

681
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:46,668
Not only that, our statement
got deleted for no reason.

682
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:49,349
Yeah, another partner called

683
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:50,668
to cancel a project...

684
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,989
Those posts are malicious.

685
00:35:53,308 --> 00:35:54,869
I think someone's manipulating it.

686
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,549
I swear I'd tear them apart.

687
00:35:56,748 --> 00:35:57,800
Exactly.

688
00:35:59,948 --> 00:36:01,836
(Garden Road No. 123)

689
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:03,944
(Yang Zhengwen)
(Let's meet tomorrow.)

690
00:36:07,588 --> 00:36:09,549
Sorry, we'll get back to you soon.

691
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:10,588
I'm sorry.

692
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:12,360
Sorry.

693
00:36:13,949 --> 00:36:14,920
M-Mingshi.

694
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:16,904
Tian Mei.

695
00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:22,949
Don't be so upset.

696
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:25,108
It's also my fault.

697
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:26,949
I didn't check it in the end.

698
00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:29,349
Let's just be careful next time.

699
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:31,909
Don't you know Ying?

700
00:36:32,308 --> 00:36:33,268
She only sounds harsh.

701
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:34,824
Don't take it to heart.

702
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,549
Yeah, Tian Mei. It's okay.

703
00:36:36,788 --> 00:36:38,869
Once we win the pitching,

704
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:41,628
they'll finally get to see
how awesome we are.

705
00:36:41,788 --> 00:36:45,108
Yeah, the mastermind
behind this is the one to blame.

706
00:36:45,509 --> 00:36:46,429
I'll teach him a lesson

707
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:47,869
if I find out who he is!

708
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:48,989
Why doesn't he come out

709
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:51,148
and fight us face-to-face?

710
00:36:51,148 --> 00:36:52,829
Yeah, if I find out who he is,

711
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:55,029
I-I swear I'll strangle him!

712
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:56,228
It wasn't me.

713
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:59,389
Why are you fighting each other?

714
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:01,509
Ying is already under so much pressure.

715
00:37:02,029 --> 00:37:02,909
Can you behave?

716
00:37:03,108 --> 00:37:04,040
Sure.

717
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,549
I'll find out who's behind all this.

718
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:08,104
Get to work.

719
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:21,549
Yunsheng, I checked the plan.

720
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:23,432
It's okay to adopt this technique.

721
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:26,469
I'll sort out a report on this.

722
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:29,864
Auntie.

723
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:32,909
What are you doing here?

724
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:40,509
I-I'm here to visit a friend.

725
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:42,188
Which department?

726
00:37:45,748 --> 00:37:46,588
Zhou Huimin.

727
00:37:47,272 --> 00:37:49,148
Zhou Huimin, your CT report.

728
00:37:54,029 --> 00:37:55,228
You did a body checkup?

729
00:37:55,909 --> 00:37:56,872
Let me take a look.

730
00:38:07,308 --> 00:38:08,812
(Diagnosis of aneurysm)

731
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:17,708
Auntie, this is

732
00:38:18,148 --> 00:38:20,188
not a minor issue.

733
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:43,496
Qin,

734
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:46,268
could you do me a favor?

735
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:49,188
Don't tell Su, okay?

736
00:38:50,148 --> 00:38:52,188
But you can't hide it from her.

737
00:38:52,628 --> 00:38:53,576
I know.

738
00:38:54,108 --> 00:38:56,308
I'm trying to get treatment.

739
00:38:56,788 --> 00:38:58,148
I'll tell her once I figure

740
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:00,268
everything out.

741
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:04,708
It will only take a day or two.
Rest assured.

742
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:05,576
I will

743
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:07,656
tell her

744
00:39:09,148 --> 00:39:10,668
in person.

745
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:13,832
Listen, Auntie.

746
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:17,429
I'll take you to an expert on this

747
00:39:18,228 --> 00:39:20,069
and ask for an opinion.

748
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:22,184
I'll be back.

749
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:23,429
Okay.

750
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:24,392
Let's go, Auntie.

751
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:31,069
Su?

752
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:41,869
The aneurysm is quite tricky.

753
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:43,588
Surgery is needed.

754
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:48,588
Chief Zhao of Neurosurgery
is the best at this.

755
00:39:51,788 --> 00:39:52,869
But...

756
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:55,560
But what?

757
00:39:55,909 --> 00:39:57,188
He's about to be retired

758
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:58,989
in a week or two.

759
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:00,776
No more surgeries?

760
00:40:01,429 --> 00:40:02,344
Yeah.

761
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:07,708
Still, I have to give it a try.

762
00:40:08,228 --> 00:40:09,148
Save it.

763
00:40:09,628 --> 00:40:10,949
He's not here today.

764
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:12,469
He rarely comes

765
00:40:13,148 --> 00:40:15,069
because he's going to retire soon.

766
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:25,928
Auntie.

767
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:30,984
How did it go?

768
00:40:31,588 --> 00:40:32,469
We have

769
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:35,429
a highly experienced surgeon for this.

770
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:38,440
I'll set up a surgery for you.
Rest assured.

771
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,096
Okay.

772
00:40:42,308 --> 00:40:45,549
Also, you must
stay carefree and positive.

773
00:40:46,108 --> 00:40:48,349
Avoid all the spicy food.

774
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:51,949
Do not consume any alcohol or caffeine.

775
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:54,344
I see.

776
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:55,869
I'll head back now

777
00:40:56,268 --> 00:40:57,549
and leave you to work.

778
00:40:58,108 --> 00:40:58,989
Rest well.

779
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:01,228
I'll set up the surgery.

780
00:41:02,308 --> 00:41:03,208
Okay.

781
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:05,869
Don't forget what you promised me.

782
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:07,549
Don't tell Su.

783
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:12,188
Then you must do as I say

784
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:13,588
with the medication and diet.

785
00:41:14,788 --> 00:41:15,668
No problem.

786
00:41:16,549 --> 00:41:17,429
I'm leaving now.

787
00:41:17,788 --> 00:41:18,469
I'll walk you out.

788
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:19,708
No need. Go back to work.

789
00:41:20,232 --> 00:41:21,228
Go ahead.

790
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:21,949
Be careful, Auntie.

791
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:22,984
Okay.

792
00:41:24,188 --> 00:41:25,188
Yunsheng.

793
00:41:25,188 --> 00:41:28,429
Were you referring to Chief Zhao
from the Neurosurgery Department?

794
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:29,672
Yeah.

795
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:32,509
But he's getting retired.

796
00:41:33,029 --> 00:41:34,069
He may not operate.

797
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:36,389
I can ask my father to help.

798
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:39,628
He was close friends
with Chief Zhao back in college.

799
00:41:39,628 --> 00:41:40,949
If he talks to him,

800
00:41:41,108 --> 00:41:42,989
I don't think Chief Zhao will say no.

801
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:45,949
Really? Thank you so much.

802
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:47,656
No problem.

803
00:41:48,228 --> 00:41:50,389
My father wanted to
rehire him after retirement.

804
00:41:50,628 --> 00:41:51,624
How about this?

805
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,188
I'll talk to Chief Zhao

806
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:56,349
and get back to you
once he answers.

807
00:41:57,069 --> 00:41:58,056
Sure.

808
00:41:58,509 --> 00:41:59,560
That's great.

809
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:04,108
Yunsheng, are you sure
you won't tell Su Ying?

810
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:08,389
I'll do as Auntie says first

811
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:10,668
and tell her
once we have a surgery plan.

812
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:15,308
Yeah, I bet she's under pressure
for the pitching.

813
00:42:16,029 --> 00:42:17,389
And after what has happened,

814
00:42:17,509 --> 00:42:19,588
she has to present something

815
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:21,389
with a huge breakthrough.

816
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:24,308
If she needs help with anything,

817
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:25,949
tell her to call me.

818
00:42:27,268 --> 00:42:28,328
Thank you so much.

819
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,788
Don't mention it.
I'm in charge of it.

820
00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:32,228
I'd love to do it right.

821
00:42:32,588 --> 00:42:34,509
Take care of Auntie.

822
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:37,708
Let me talk to Chief Zhao.

823
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:40,328
Thank you.

824
00:42:40,588 --> 00:42:41,512
No problem.

825
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:46,628
Qin is working the night shift today.

826
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:49,989
We have all the time we want to talk.

827
00:42:50,549 --> 00:42:52,552
Okay, thanks.

828
00:42:53,748 --> 00:42:56,549
How's your work going?

829
00:42:57,668 --> 00:43:00,148
All good. Don't focus on me.
Let's talk about you.

830
00:43:00,268 --> 00:43:01,224
Did you go out for fun?

831
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:05,989
Of course, how can I possibly
stay at home?

832
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:08,469
Let me tell you.

833
00:43:08,668 --> 00:43:10,869
There's a new supermarket nearby.

834
00:43:11,108 --> 00:43:12,188
It's quite nice.

835
00:43:12,188 --> 00:43:14,228
They have fresh vegetables.

836
00:43:16,188 --> 00:43:17,069
Don't brush me off.

837
00:43:17,069 --> 00:43:18,349
I got all these vegetables

838
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:19,469
in that supermarket.

839
00:43:19,788 --> 00:43:22,829
Also, cook more often.

840
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:24,308
Don't get takeout food all the time.

841
00:43:24,509 --> 00:43:26,429
We don't know what ingredients

842
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:28,108
they use, right?

843
00:43:28,549 --> 00:43:29,829
I don't often get takeout food.

844
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:32,748
And don't drink out alone.

845
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:34,268
It's so dangerous.

846
00:43:34,509 --> 00:43:35,668
You make me worried.

847
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:37,668
I don't even drink often.

848
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:39,069
You don't?

849
00:43:39,308 --> 00:43:40,349
Who came home

850
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:41,909
totally wasted,

851
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:43,509
singing "A Spray of Plum Blossoms"?

852
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:44,708
Wasn't that you?

853
00:43:45,628 --> 00:43:46,989
Who was it? I have no idea.

854
00:43:47,308 --> 00:43:48,168
And your stomach

855
00:43:48,349 --> 00:43:50,108
doesn't take cold water.

856
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:52,788
You should also avoid coffee.

857
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:53,628
Alright. Alright.

858
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:54,989
That's enough. Hurry up.

859
00:43:55,228 --> 00:43:57,588
Enjoy the dishes you made.

860
00:43:58,429 --> 00:43:59,349
Come on.

861
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:01,788
You never listen to me.

862
00:44:01,949 --> 00:44:04,108
Of course, I do. I'm listening to you.

863
00:44:04,588 --> 00:44:06,188
But you don't hear me.

864
00:44:06,588 --> 00:44:07,592
Fine.

865
00:44:09,588 --> 00:44:10,748
