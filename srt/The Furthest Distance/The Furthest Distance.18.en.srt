Bai, I'm leaving it here.

18
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,467
Okay.

19
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:57,348
The dorm is nice, right?

20
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:58,412
It's well-decorated.

21
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,988
Yunsheng and I live across the hall.

22
00:02:02,428 --> 00:02:04,827
Call us if you need anything.

23
00:02:05,428 --> 00:02:06,412
Okay.

24
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:09,868
May I visit your rooms?

25
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:11,916
No problem.

26
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,707
Let's start with

27
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:15,756
Yunsheng's room.

28
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:16,987
What a good plan.

29
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:17,964
Alright?

30
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:18,948
Sure, let's go.

31
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:19,587
Let's go.

32
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:20,492
Yeah, let's go.

33
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:22,188
Right, Yunsheng.

34
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:25,547
I have fragile items in these boxes.

35
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:27,348
Can you keep them for some days?

36
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:28,748
No problem. Let me help.

37
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:32,908
Where should I put it?

38
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,068
Look around. Isn't it neat?

39
00:02:39,587 --> 00:02:41,267
It's surely neater than yours.

40
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,948
Yunsheng, you also like toys?

41
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:52,808
It's from Su Ying. It's tough.
I've been trying it for long.

42
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:54,267
I've told you about it.

43
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:57,788
Are these your notes?

44
00:02:58,107 --> 00:02:59,028
Yeah, from the classes.

45
00:02:59,468 --> 00:03:00,387
You haven't changed.

46
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:10,068
This is the glass house.

47
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:13,508
Yeah, that's right. It's customized.

48
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:15,788
Su Ying made this for Yunsheng.

49
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:24,188
And she got him
the mattress and pillows.

50
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,188
It was buying one get one free.

51
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:28,584
No.

52
00:03:28,827 --> 00:03:31,068
It was buying two get one free.
He has the free one.

53
00:03:32,468 --> 00:03:33,448
I have the free one.

54
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:38,547
Great, I was in a rush
and forgot to get a pillow.

55
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:41,147
Yunsheng, may I borrow this one?

56
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:42,587
You don't have to ask.

57
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:44,987
It's just a pillow. Take it.

58
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:46,984
Thank you, Yunsheng. I'll take it.

59
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:52,308
That's from Su Ying.

60
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:54,508
I'm trying to impress her.
Just do me a favor.

61
00:03:56,308 --> 00:03:57,228
I'm here to help.

62
00:03:57,348 --> 00:03:58,248
Hey.

63
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:00,948
Aren't you helping Mi Bai?

64
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:02,312
We're taking a break.

65
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:03,987
Thanks.

66
00:04:03,987 --> 00:04:04,904
Come on, Dr. Zhang.

67
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:06,107
Thank you.

68
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:07,048
How's it going?

69
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:08,808
All good.

70
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,028
Hello, Su Ying.

71
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:12,387
Mi Bai, how's it going?

72
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:13,748
All good.

73
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:16,068
Yunsheng and Yisen helped a lot.

74
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:17,256
Have some coffee.

75
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:18,376
Thanks.

76
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:23,467
Su Ying, I heard you're a designer.

77
00:04:23,628 --> 00:04:27,227
I know nothing about room decoration.

78
00:04:27,587 --> 00:04:29,467
Could you please help me out?

79
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:31,587
Of course.

80
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:34,088
Let's go.

81
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:35,707
Hold it for me.

82
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:40,188
I'm sorry. It's still a mess.

83
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:42,188
It's okay. You just moved here.

84
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:44,068
You have plenty of things.

85
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:46,267
So many books.

86
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:58,428
You have a great view here.

87
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:00,628
It's quite humid here.

88
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,707
I'd suggest you buy furniture
made of solid wood

89
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:05,428
for moisture and mold resistance.

90
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:07,267
Buy a dehumidifier.

91
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:09,188
And put some desiccant in the closet.

92
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:11,907
Do you prefer any bedding?

93
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:14,347
Nothing specific.

94
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:19,988
Right, I heard that you got Yunsheng
and Yisen new mattresses.

95
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:24,628
Yeah, Dr. Zhang said
that they didn't sleep well.

96
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:27,988
So I got them new mattresses

97
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:29,128
and pillows.

98
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:30,308
I'll get you a set too.

99
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:31,976
Thank you so much.

100
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:32,928
No problem.

101
00:05:32,928 --> 00:05:34,824
But I already have a pillow.

102
00:05:39,068 --> 00:05:41,147
I'm afraid I'll keep bothering you.

103
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:44,787
No problem.

104
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:46,988
Let's check on them.

105
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:48,387
Alright.

106
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:48,988
Let's go.

107
00:05:48,988 --> 00:05:49,864
Let's go.

108
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:53,548
(Garden Road No. 123)

109
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:05,707
The meat bun I had this morning
is amazing. I'll get one for you.

110
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:06,668
When are you going to

111
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:07,784
bring me the bubble tea?

112
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,768
Morning, Mingshi.

113
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:10,907
Morning.

114
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:11,308
Hey.

115
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:12,168
Morning.

116
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:13,387
Why are you so early today?

117
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:14,267
Yeah.

118
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:16,027
I came early to prepare

119
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,707
for the proposal meeting.

120
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:20,027
I'll do some printing.

121
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:21,512
It's done.

122
00:06:21,907 --> 00:06:23,188
Then I'll get some cups.

123
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:24,227
All set.

124
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:25,320
I'll get you some water.

125
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:26,504
Get to work.

126
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:32,467
He...

127
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:33,548
A man of mystery.

128
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:37,508
We've received many proposals
after we won the award.

129
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:39,827
So let's go through them

130
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:41,896
to find promising proposals.

131
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:43,464
Who goes first?

132
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:46,184
Let me. Please take a look.

133
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:50,707
I propose this villa renovation project.

134
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:52,628
The client is the author Jiang Dong.

135
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:55,787
I know him.

136
00:06:55,787 --> 00:06:57,748
He's the most popular
detective novelist right now.

137
00:06:57,748 --> 00:06:58,696
That's right.

138
00:06:58,696 --> 00:07:00,508
My schoolmates are reading his novels.

139
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:03,368
The selling point?

140
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:05,868
We're quite experienced

141
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:06,868
in villa renovation.

142
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:10,068
I'm sure the client
will be happy about our work.

143
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:13,147
And the villa belongs to a known figure,
which makes it

144
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:14,508
an advertisement.

145
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,308
If we manage this project well,

146
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:19,868
we'll attract even greater attention.

147
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:22,707
Ying, I'd like to propose a case.

148
00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:25,308
It's a library renovation project.

149
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:27,308
The library is huge.

150
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:30,868
The client is seeking
a high-tech and futuristic vibe.

151
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,787
The villa may be known,

152
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:37,628
but we just won the design award.

153
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:41,068
Shouldn't we go for
something challenging at the moment?

154
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:49,032
Let me think about it.

155
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:59,267
Ying, I've sorted out some other cases.

156
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:01,188
Please take a look.

157
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:09,640
Are you okay?

158
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,347
Me? I'm fine.

159
00:08:12,308 --> 00:08:14,227
They've consolidated me that day.

160
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:16,628
Don't worry, I'll get over it.

161
00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:21,267
Don't be so upset.

162
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:24,948
Huixuan is slow
when it comes to romantic relationships.

163
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:26,948
Take your time. Don't rush.

164
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:29,387
She turned you down.

165
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,108
But that doesn't mean anything.

166
00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:34,148
It's just that
she hasn't figured it all out.

167
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:37,544
I know.

168
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:40,808
In fact,

169
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:43,028
she cares about you

170
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:44,948
and values you as a friend.

171
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:47,720
She told you that?

172
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:53,028
Give her some time
and let her figure things out.

173
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:54,747
You must make her realize

174
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:57,668
her feelings for you.

175
00:08:58,548 --> 00:09:01,627
Help me out, Ying. What should I do?

176
00:09:05,148 --> 00:09:08,424
I think you should let it be for now.

177
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:09,480
Let it be?

178
00:09:09,788 --> 00:09:10,987
Yeah.

179
00:09:12,627 --> 00:09:14,668
You're overwhelming her with affection.

180
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:16,908
It's a bit too much for her, right?

181
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:20,148
You know Du Huixuan.

182
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:21,347
She's so innocent

183
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:22,707
in terms of relationships.

184
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:24,296
Listen.

185
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:27,548
You were going after her

186
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:29,827
like a beast.

187
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:31,148
Stop what you're doing

188
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:35,507
and she may be confused.

189
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:38,388
She may start wondering.

190
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:40,104
What's going on?

191
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:41,388
Why did he stop coming?

192
00:09:41,987 --> 00:09:44,548
You know what matters
the most in a relationship?

193
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,128
The tempo and vibe.

194
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,347
Once you get those right...

195
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,008
Got it.

196
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:58,668
That's what Yunsheng said the other day.

197
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:00,456
What did he say?

198
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:02,388
He said you are awesome.

199
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:05,608
That's more like it.

200
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:11,048
Well.

201
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:13,347
If you need some days off,

202
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:15,028
I'll ask Chen and Ye to cover you.

203
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:16,627
Don't worry, Ying.

204
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,148
I won't let it hinder me.

205
00:10:18,707 --> 00:10:19,688
I have to go now.

206
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:20,936
Okay, go ahead.

207
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:22,428
Call me if you need me.

208
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:23,496
Okay.

209
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,188
(Qin Yunsheng)
I'll treat Mi Bai to dinner later.

210
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:43,388
(Su Ying)
Okay, I'll join you once I'm done.

211
00:10:47,788 --> 00:10:49,308
(Qin Yunsheng)
Okay. Don't take too long.

212
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,908
Here's all the information.

213
00:10:58,268 --> 00:10:59,908
I hope we can collaborate.

214
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:04,827
Miss Du, it would be great if we could

215
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:07,188
get you on our show.

216
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:12,548
What a pity. We have no vacancies.

217
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:15,624
Maybe you should ask around.

218
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,908
Okay, maybe next time.

219
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:34,227
She's picky.

220
00:11:35,347 --> 00:11:36,987
She even beats up her superior.

221
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:39,428
The entire business knows that.

222
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:41,068
Nobody will hire her.

223
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:42,632
That's right.

224
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:44,707
What a pity. She's talented.

225
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:47,028
What's the point?

226
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:54,747
Huixuan, it's good that
you have great content.

227
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:56,827
But a self-media without exposure

228
00:11:57,148 --> 00:11:58,627
is like chocolate without wrapping.

229
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:00,227
It melts fast

230
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:01,668
in the sun.

231
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:03,624
So take my advice.

232
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:05,227
Learn to make advertisements

233
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:07,428
before you make yourself a self-media.

234
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:11,816
Thank you.

235
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:16,668
Jie, I just set up a video channel.

236
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:19,347
How's yours doing?

237
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:20,867
It's going well.

238
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:25,188
That's great. Shall we work together?

239
00:12:25,668 --> 00:12:29,096
Sorry, I work on my own.
No collaborations, bye.

240
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:30,788
Alright, bye.

241
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,107
Mr. Chen, I just set up a video channel.

242
00:12:40,264 --> 00:12:41,188
Really?

243
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:44,107
Yeah, it features interior decoration.

244
00:12:44,627 --> 00:12:47,068
Sorry, I'm not interested in it.

245
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:51,107
You don't need a promotion anymore?

246
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:53,028
That's right.

247
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:57,707
Okay, maybe next time.

248
00:12:58,188 --> 00:12:59,208
Sorry.

249
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:19,116
(Chat with Scrat)

250
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:29,384
Du Huixuan, you got this. Hang in there.

251
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:33,288
Let me introduce you.

252
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:36,584
This is Hai, the owner of Piyixia.

253
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:38,587
This is Mi Bai.

254
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:40,188
Our new Medical Director.

255
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:41,668
She graduated abroad.

256
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:43,268
Hai is our friend.

257
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:44,747
He makes friends with everyone.

258
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:48,188
Hello, Hai, nice to meet you.

259
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:49,800
I'm Wang Haisheng.

260
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:51,268
What a pretty girl.

261
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:54,467
That's why Yisen keeps mentioning you.

262
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:55,707
May I read your palm?

263
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:56,867
You can do that?

264
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:57,864
Try mine.

265
00:13:58,028 --> 00:13:59,227
What does it have to do with you?

266
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:02,188
Sorry, I'm late.

267
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:04,428
Hello, Ying.

268
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,268
Hey.

269
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:06,152
Come on, sit here.

270
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:07,016
Sit here.

271
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,388
Let me get a few more dishes for Mi Bai.

272
00:14:09,388 --> 00:14:09,800
Alright.

273
00:14:09,948 --> 00:14:10,867
Thanks, Hai.

274
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:11,816
Thanks, Hai.

275
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,256
Alright.

276
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:15,336
Everybody's here.

277
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:17,576
I propose a toast.

278
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:20,268
Let's welcome Mi Bai back home.

279
00:14:20,268 --> 00:14:21,188
Cheers.

280
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:22,107
Welcome.

281
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:23,048
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

282
00:14:23,587 --> 00:14:24,520
Thank you, guys.

283
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:31,148
Director, Mi Bai and Yunsheng

284
00:14:31,347 --> 00:14:32,867
will be your reliable helpers.

285
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:34,152
That's right.

286
00:14:34,388 --> 00:14:37,467
Mi Bai brought us
advanced medical technology,

287
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:40,107
which benefited our hospital greatly.

288
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:42,148
Director, I'm flattered.

289
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:44,268
I've always looked up to Yunsheng

290
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:46,268
as my role model back at school.

291
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:49,948
I'm really happy to work with him

292
00:14:50,308 --> 00:14:51,148
and Yisen now.

293
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:52,507
Yeah.

294
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:53,480
Director, Ms. Han.

295
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:58,428
Bai followed Yunsheng and me
everywhere during the school years.

296
00:14:58,948 --> 00:14:59,788
Right, Yunsheng?

297
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:00,068
Yeah.

298
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:01,448
She was a kid following you.

299
00:15:04,347 --> 00:15:06,827
Right, I'm new to the hospital.

300
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:09,347
I'd need your help on many things.

301
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:11,432
Thank you in advance.

302
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:12,347
Don't mention it.

303
00:15:12,347 --> 00:15:13,288
Thank you so much.

304
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,272
Alright, best wishes.

305
00:15:17,827 --> 00:15:19,627
Try the shrimp. They're fresh.

306
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:22,467
That's enough. I can peel them myself.

307
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:25,668
Come on, keep it down.
There are people here.

308
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:27,188
Why do you care?

309
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:28,707
Mind your own business.

310
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:36,068
Bai, I remember you liked

311
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:37,188
orangeade, right?

312
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:38,587
I'll get one for you.

313
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:39,496
Dig in.

314
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,388
Sure, my sister and I loved it.

315
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:45,068
Do you remember that, Yunsheng?

316
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,107
I do. I'll go get it.

317
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:53,987
Thank you.

318
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:54,952
No problem.

319
00:15:58,347 --> 00:16:00,107
So much alike.

320
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,908
My sister and me?

321
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:04,268
Yeah.

322
00:16:04,268 --> 00:16:05,668
Yeah, that's what everybody says.

323
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,668
Here's your orangeade.

324
00:16:15,668 --> 00:16:16,648
Thank you.

325
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:17,704
So fast.

326
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:20,107
Yunsheng used to get that
for my sister all the time.

327
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:24,707
Yunsheng,
they also have the same taste, right?

328
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:33,224
Yeah, let me propose a toast.

329
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:36,028
Let's welcome Mi Bai back to China

330
00:16:36,148 --> 00:16:38,227
and bring us honor.

331
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:39,467
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

332
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:40,788
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

333
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:43,388
Wait, I got you two extra dishes

334
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:44,552
for the new guest.

335
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:45,788
Come on.

336
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:46,788
I got two more dishes.

337
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:47,987
- Thank you, Hai.
- Thank you, Hai.

338
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:48,872
Excuse me.

339
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:50,388
- Thanks, Hai.
- Join us.

340
00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:51,467
Come on. Let's drink.

341
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:51,867
Cheers.

342
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:52,747
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

343
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:53,707
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

344
00:16:53,987 --> 00:16:54,827
Thanks, Hai.

345
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:55,707
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

346
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:56,627
- Cheers.
- Welcome.

347
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:01,987
Dig in.

348
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:03,624
This is not bad.

349
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,467
Yunsheng, cheers.

350
00:17:58,108 --> 00:17:59,148
Were you upset

351
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:01,828
during the dinner?

352
00:18:04,588 --> 00:18:05,576
Not really.

353
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:09,828
If it was about the food,

354
00:18:10,948 --> 00:18:12,267
I'd tell Hai to do better.

355
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:13,747
If it was about something else,

356
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:16,588
I would do better.

357
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:24,747
Mi Bai looks exactly like Mi Su.

358
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:27,188
And she's around me all day.

359
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:29,787
I bet you're upset.

360
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:37,067
The twins look identical. I understand.

361
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:40,628
And I understand
she came back for work. It's just...

362
00:18:42,948 --> 00:18:45,428
I just don't think
she's keeping enough distance.

363
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:47,148
And that disturbs me.

364
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,348
For example...

365
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:51,368
For example?

366
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,027
For example, when they mentioned

367
00:18:55,148 --> 00:18:57,507
that she looks like Mi Su,

368
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:01,148
you were able to tell
that I wasn't comfortable with it.

369
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:03,144
But I felt that

370
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:04,948
she wanted to

371
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:07,148
delve into that on purpose.

372
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:08,987
Maybe I was too sensitive.

373
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,344
Yeah.

374
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:14,856
And tell me.

375
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:17,108
Why would she have the pillow I got you?

376
00:19:17,707 --> 00:19:19,668
You have to hear me out on that.

377
00:19:22,188 --> 00:19:23,828
Here's the thing.

378
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:27,400
Mi Bai needed a pillow
because she just moved in.

379
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:30,388
Zhang Yisen offered that to her.

380
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,520
And

381
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,108
I've placed an order online.

382
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:37,512
Look.

383
00:19:37,964 --> 00:19:39,348
(Qin Yunsheng, Order for a pillow)

384
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:40,296
I'll get it soon.

385
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:46,868
I'm not saying something.

386
00:19:47,828 --> 00:19:48,712
It's just that

387
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:52,108
I gave it to you.

388
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:54,824
I know.

389
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:57,747
I've always seen Mi Bai

390
00:19:58,348 --> 00:19:59,307
as my little sister.

391
00:19:59,828 --> 00:20:00,744
Rest assured.

392
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:02,948
I'll keep a distance.

393
00:20:08,227 --> 00:20:09,428
Am I being petty?

394
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:10,696
Not at all.

395
00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:11,987
I bet you find me petty.

396
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:13,160
No way.

397
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,027
I find you very cute.

398
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:16,547
Promise?

399
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:17,480
I promise.

400
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:21,267
Then keep massaging me.

401
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:23,908
Where should I continue?

402
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:27,528
Here.

403
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:32,628
Okay, it's time
to show you my real technique.

404
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,388
I got you these. What do you think?

405
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,507
So many things? What are these?

406
00:20:48,828 --> 00:20:50,948
Just some daily necessities.

407
00:20:51,547 --> 00:20:54,108
This is a dehumidifier.

408
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:55,227
We're by the sea,

409
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,227
so it's quite humid.

410
00:20:57,628 --> 00:20:59,188
Turn it on and keep it running.

411
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:02,348
It will lower your body's humidity.

412
00:21:03,148 --> 00:21:04,828
It works better than some food remedies.

413
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:07,787
What about this?

414
00:21:07,787 --> 00:21:08,707
Well...

415
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:10,668
It's an aroma diffuser.

416
00:21:11,507 --> 00:21:12,868
Add a few drops of oil essence

417
00:21:13,027 --> 00:21:14,588
and it generates

418
00:21:14,987 --> 00:21:16,507
fragrant air

419
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:18,547
that makes the room smell nice

420
00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:20,547
just like you.

421
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:24,188
How much are those? I'll pay.

422
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:26,948
No, no need. Don't bother.

423
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:29,588
This is a robot vacuum.

424
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:31,267
It's really handy.

425
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,668
Turn it on

426
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:33,948
before you leave.

427
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:37,096
Leave it on the ground and it will

428
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:38,628
clean the floor.

429
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:41,987
Yisen, how much
do you know about Su Ying?

430
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:45,467
Not much. We only met a few times.

431
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:47,828
She is a famous designer,

432
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,507
but she's very easygoing.

433
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,747
She donated many things

434
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:53,148
during our charity event.

435
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:54,747
Everybody likes her

436
00:21:56,267 --> 00:21:57,428
and I like...

437
00:21:58,307 --> 00:21:59,272
What?

438
00:22:02,828 --> 00:22:05,067
T-This. I like this.

439
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:08,707
Put it on your bedside table
and listen to...

440
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:10,987
So how did they get together?

441
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:14,188
I think they got together during
the renovation of the glass house.

442
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,348
I don't know about the details,

443
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:18,388
but I can tell that

444
00:22:18,747 --> 00:22:20,547
Su Ying really likes Yunsheng.

445
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:22,027
How do you know?

446
00:22:23,348 --> 00:22:25,588
Her ex-boyfriend is the boss

447
00:22:25,948 --> 00:22:27,428
of Tiandi Building Materials Corp.

448
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:30,707
He donated
a few hundred thousand yuan last time.

449
00:22:31,188 --> 00:22:32,507
Tiandi Building Materials Corp?

450
00:22:32,828 --> 00:22:36,307
Yeah, I looked him up online.
His name is Yang Zhengwen.

451
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,588
But it doesn't matter. He's annoying.

452
00:22:39,027 --> 00:22:40,428
He wanted Su Ying back.

453
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:41,868
But she didn't want him.

454
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:45,348
Put it on your bedside table.

455
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:47,628
Music helps you release stress.

456
00:22:47,628 --> 00:22:50,067
It's okay, Yisen.
I'll read the instructions.

457
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:54,787
Right.

458
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:57,256
Well...

459
00:22:58,307 --> 00:23:00,787
Are you free tomorrow?

460
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,547
Yeah.

461
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,388
Would you like to

462
00:23:06,707 --> 00:23:08,747
get some more groceries with me?

463
00:23:10,027 --> 00:23:11,148
More groceries?

464
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:13,027
These may not be enough.

465
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:15,428
These are totally enough.

466
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:16,747
Thank you, Yisen.

467
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:18,467
Rest well.

468
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:19,668
You too.

469
00:23:21,428 --> 00:23:22,388
Thank you, Yisen.

470
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:23,348
N-No problem.

471
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:25,868
Call me if you need me.

472
00:23:29,227 --> 00:23:30,120
Anytime.

473
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:40,236
(Signs)

474
00:23:41,828 --> 00:23:45,267
Yunsheng,
this new patient came yesterday.

475
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:50,124
(Medical History of Wang Lele)

476
00:23:51,307 --> 00:23:52,296
Wang Lele?

477
00:23:54,348 --> 00:23:55,547
You know her?

478
00:24:02,628 --> 00:24:04,868
Your hair has grown.
Why wouldn't you let me cut it?

479
00:24:08,227 --> 00:24:09,192
Please come in.

480
00:24:10,588 --> 00:24:12,987
Dr. Qin, it's you!

481
00:24:13,747 --> 00:24:15,628
Are you getting
used to cardiac surgery department?

482
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:17,160
Yeah.

483
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,628
Do you remember me, Lele?

484
00:24:18,868 --> 00:24:19,908
Of course.

485
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:21,588
You're Dr. Qin, Mi Su's boyfriend.

486
00:24:22,148 --> 00:24:23,987
You often visited her when we shared

487
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:25,192
the same ward.

488
00:24:26,428 --> 00:24:28,348
Lele adores Mi Su.

489
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:30,747
She was highly dependent on her

490
00:24:31,188 --> 00:24:33,868
and often wanted to hang out with her
after she was discharged.

491
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:36,108
It's been so many years.

492
00:24:36,428 --> 00:24:38,868
I still have their photos on my phone.

493
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:41,388
Dr. Qin, where is she?

494
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,027
When can I see her again?

495
00:24:45,868 --> 00:24:46,747
Rest well and recover.

496
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:49,736
I'll take you to her once you recover.

497
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:51,948
Don't worry.

498
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,828
All the indicators are fine.

499
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,388
Thank you.
I feel so reassured when you're here.

500
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:02,148
Yunsheng, you're here.

501
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:04,424
Mi Su.

502
00:25:15,668 --> 00:25:17,267
She shared a ward with your sister.

503
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,707
Sister, do you remember me? I'm Lele.

504
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,148
We shared the ward
and took photos together.

505
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:30,628
Of course, I remember you.

506
00:25:31,307 --> 00:25:32,787
Sister, have you recovered?

507
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,227
I've fully recovered.

508
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:40,027
I'm a doctor now.

509
00:25:40,428 --> 00:25:41,948
So you must take your medicine

510
00:25:42,428 --> 00:25:44,267
and do what Dr. Qin tells you to do.

511
00:25:45,307 --> 00:25:47,227
I believe you'll recover soon.

512
00:25:47,828 --> 00:25:48,776
I'll try my best.

513
00:25:49,227 --> 00:25:51,108
So can I get to see you

514
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:52,388
and Dr. Qin every day?

515
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:54,408
Of course.

516
00:25:54,628 --> 00:25:55,624
That's great.

517
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,547
It's awesome to have you around me.

518
00:26:00,027 --> 00:26:01,428
Mother, I'm so happy.

519
00:26:03,108 --> 00:26:04,428
Me too.

520
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:11,828
Mi Su shared a ward with Lele.

521
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:13,987
They had the same disease.

522
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:18,787
Dr. Qin was quite nice
to Mi Su and Lele.

523
00:26:19,227 --> 00:26:21,747
Lele really liked Mi Su.

524
00:26:22,787 --> 00:26:25,148
Lele is a lovely girl.

525
00:26:26,428 --> 00:26:27,304
She's been

526
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:30,388
talking about Mi Su all these years.

527
00:26:30,668 --> 00:26:32,547
I lied to keep her inspired.

528
00:26:32,987 --> 00:26:35,588
I said Mi Su had recovered.

529
00:26:37,148 --> 00:26:39,148
Thank you for what you did.

530
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:41,096
It's okay.

531
00:26:41,428 --> 00:26:42,668
I'll leave you to work.

532
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:43,787
Lele needs me.

533
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,348
Call me anytime.

534
00:26:46,428 --> 00:26:47,747
Thank you.

535
00:26:50,908 --> 00:26:53,348
Yunsheng, please don't mind that.

536
00:26:54,307 --> 00:26:56,948
It's okay. You did it only to help Lele.

537
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:00,707
Why did you go there?

538
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,707
I came to check on the new patient

539
00:27:04,148 --> 00:27:07,016
because I've been studying
artificial hearts.

540
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,096
And you are here.

541
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,668
The director told us to meet him later.

542
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,828
Let's go.

543
00:27:11,828 --> 00:27:12,712
Okay.

544
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:16,787
How's it going
with Lele's operation plan?

545
00:27:17,948 --> 00:27:19,507
It's a special case.

546
00:27:19,908 --> 00:27:21,908
Plan A is the anastomosis
of the right pulmonary artery

547
00:27:22,148 --> 00:27:23,388
and superior vena cava.

548
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:27,148
But I don't find it perfect, either.

549
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:31,828
I know you want it perfect.

550
00:27:32,707 --> 00:27:34,948
It may have
impressive short-term outcomes.

551
00:27:35,108 --> 00:27:37,388
But it's not so great in the long term.

552
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:41,108
Some patients die
from arrhythmia after surgery.

553
00:27:41,948 --> 00:27:44,307
Yeah, so Mi Bai offered me

554
00:27:44,787 --> 00:27:46,628
some advice on this.

555
00:27:48,948 --> 00:27:49,928
What do you think?

556
00:27:51,027 --> 00:27:53,868
I checked Lele's medical history.

557
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,227
In her case,

558
00:27:56,547 --> 00:27:58,388
apart from the traditional measures,

559
00:27:58,908 --> 00:28:00,520
we can adopt a new technology

560
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,747
called Cone.

561
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,707
Here's the report. Please take a look.

562
00:28:05,787 --> 00:28:08,547
Lele has tricuspid valve deformity.

563
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:10,787
But if this technology

564
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:12,428
applies to her,

565
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:14,908
it can boost
self-repairment in her body.

566
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:18,507
And it lowers the need
for a prosthetic valve.

567
00:28:19,348 --> 00:28:22,148
This technology
helps improve the recovery.

568
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:24,948
So I think it's our best choice.

569
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:30,707
What do you think, Yunsheng?

570
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,488
It's feasible.

571
00:28:37,388 --> 00:28:40,027
But it requires more discussion.

572
00:28:45,612 --> 00:28:47,108
(Conference Room)

573
00:28:47,108 --> 00:28:48,868
I checked out the recent proposals.

574
00:28:49,108 --> 00:28:52,547
Tian Mei's library project
looks the most challenging.

575
00:28:52,787 --> 00:28:55,507
So let's go with that.

576
00:28:56,707 --> 00:28:59,108
Tian Mei, you're in charge
of the preliminary work.

577
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:00,428
No problem, Ying.

578
00:29:00,428 --> 00:29:02,188
Mr. Wang, this is the best offer.

579
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:04,227
Yeah, you're our regular client.

580
00:29:05,027 --> 00:29:08,027
You know our reputation in this sector.

581
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:09,192
Come here.

582
00:29:10,188 --> 00:29:13,348
You know our projects very well.

583
00:29:13,348 --> 00:29:14,216
Yeah.

584
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:16,108
Keep in touch.

585
00:29:16,707 --> 00:29:17,640
Okay.

586
00:29:18,547 --> 00:29:20,348
Doesn't he look different these days?

587
00:29:21,908 --> 00:29:23,987
Mr. Chen, I sent you the email.

588
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:26,888
Let's sign if you think

589
00:29:26,987 --> 00:29:27,868
the procedure is fine.

590
00:29:28,828 --> 00:29:29,704
Okay.

591
00:29:30,828 --> 00:29:32,712
Mingshi, sit.

592
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:34,504
Have some fruit.

593
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:36,588
No, thanks. I have work to do.

594
00:29:37,908 --> 00:29:39,067
Something's off.

595
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:40,507
You're not stealing our snacks.

596
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:42,148
And you became a workaholic.

597
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:44,348
You don't even chat with us.
What happened?

598
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:45,864
Really?

599
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:48,027
We just won an award.

600
00:29:48,707 --> 00:29:49,547
I must work hard

601
00:29:50,027 --> 00:29:52,828
to live up to the honor, right?

602
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:55,016
I'm enlightened.

603
00:29:55,547 --> 00:29:56,424
You are mature.

604
00:29:58,828 --> 00:30:01,588
Fight Hard to Win
just uploaded something. Did you see it?

605
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:04,547
Yeah, and her videos kept going better.

606
00:30:04,828 --> 00:30:06,108
She keeps improving.

607
00:30:06,747 --> 00:30:10,344
But her statistics are just mediocre.

608
00:30:10,987 --> 00:30:12,707
In such fierce competition,

609
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:17,467
she can't make it
with this level of popularity.

610
00:30:18,027 --> 00:30:22,027
And her hardcore fan Scrat
stopped commenting.

611
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:25,267
His comments were always insightful.

612
00:30:26,108 --> 00:30:27,908
I've always waited to see his comments.

613
00:30:28,987 --> 00:30:30,747
He was the biggest fan.

614
00:30:31,227 --> 00:30:33,547
Now I'm so curious.

615
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:35,628
Did he quit being a fan?

616
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:41,948
If you don't have enough work to do,

617
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:43,747
I'll get you some.

618
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:48,148
I-I think I have a case to work on.

619
00:30:48,668 --> 00:30:49,608
Go on with your phone call.

620
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:03,596
(Where are you now?)

621
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:23,400
Li, long time no see. How are you doing?

622
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:24,808
What's wrong, Xu?

623
00:31:25,307 --> 00:31:28,467
Could you please do me a favor?

624
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:32,267
I noticed your video channel
called Baozou Coconut.

625
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:37,992
Su Ying.

626
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:39,148
Ms. Han.

627
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,108
You're here for Dr. Qin?

628
00:31:40,348 --> 00:31:41,547
Yeah, we're going for food.

629
00:31:42,547 --> 00:31:43,868
Go ahead. He's in a great mood.

630
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:45,736
Why?

631
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,108
Dr. Bai introduced a new technology

632
00:31:48,428 --> 00:31:50,108
that helps Lele a lot.

633
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:52,360
Really?

634
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:54,024
That's great.

635
00:31:54,828 --> 00:31:56,467
He's doing rounds in Room 2. Go ahead.

636
00:31:57,868 --> 00:31:59,067
Okay, thanks, Ms. Han.

637
00:32:03,108 --> 00:32:04,908
Lele, what are you reading?

638
00:32:05,428 --> 00:32:06,344
Jiang Dong's novels.

639
00:32:06,948 --> 00:32:08,027
He's my favorite writer.

640
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:12,027
Alright, Lele,
you can't keep reading for so long.

641
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:14,027
Take a break and chat with them.

642
00:32:14,987 --> 00:32:15,987
Have you taken pills on time?

643
00:32:16,388 --> 00:32:17,747
Yeah, always.

644
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:21,388
Have you experienced
any palpitations or chest pain?

645
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:22,728
No.

646
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,428
That's good. Stay well for the surgery.

647
00:32:25,787 --> 00:32:27,188
That's how we fight together.

648
00:32:28,908 --> 00:32:30,547
You recovered so well.

649
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:32,547
You look even better than before.

650
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:35,948
You'll be very pretty
once you recover too.

651
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:38,467
Thank you for your encouragement.

652
00:32:38,628 --> 00:32:39,588
I'll stay positive like you.

653
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:41,960
You are great.

654
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,868
You once said that

655
00:32:45,027 --> 00:32:47,747
you'd marry Dr. Qin
in the prettiest wedding dress

656
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:49,388
once you recover.

657
00:32:50,027 --> 00:32:52,747
So are you married now?

658
00:33:06,547 --> 00:33:07,588
We're talking about it.

659
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:09,908
So I have the chance to see the wedding.

660
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,828
Of course, you can dress up

661
00:33:14,188 --> 00:33:16,348
and come to our wedding

662
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,547
once you recover.

663
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:19,912
That's great.

664
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,388
That's how

665
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:40,348
it turned
from a mistake into a white lie.

666
00:33:40,828 --> 00:33:43,747
We wanted Lele to believe
that Mi Su had recovered

667
00:33:44,067 --> 00:33:46,868
so that she had the confidence
for the surgeries.

668
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:48,668
So...

669
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:52,840
Are you done?

670
00:33:56,108 --> 00:33:57,064
Aren't you mad?

671
00:33:58,148 --> 00:33:59,080
You're scared?

672
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:07,348
That means you care about me.

673
00:34:07,987 --> 00:34:10,187
How do we go on dating each other

674
00:34:10,587 --> 00:34:11,507
without any trust?

675
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:15,308
Lele is having her surgery soon.

676
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:17,428
Her feelings come first.

677
00:34:20,107 --> 00:34:21,348
Thank you for your understanding.

678
00:34:24,348 --> 00:34:26,388
Don't worry. I'll keep my distance.

679
00:34:26,987 --> 00:34:27,912
I'm not worried.

680
00:34:29,627 --> 00:34:31,467
So would you like to meet Lele

681
00:34:32,147 --> 00:34:33,868
and join me for lunch?

682
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:35,868
Sure.

683
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:36,808
Let's go.

684
00:34:37,748 --> 00:34:39,627
I was so ugly seven years ago.

685
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,748
No way. You were adorable, okay?

686
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,944
Lele, you have a visitor.

687
00:34:44,828 --> 00:34:46,627
This is Su Ying, my friend.

688
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:48,268
She wants to see you.

689
00:34:48,268 --> 00:34:49,160
Hello.

690
00:34:49,428 --> 00:34:50,408
Hello, Lele.

691
00:34:50,627 --> 00:34:52,308
Lele is doing extremely well.

692
00:34:52,428 --> 00:34:54,187
Yeah, she's been in a great mood

693
00:34:54,627 --> 00:34:56,107
ever since she met Mi Su.

694
00:34:56,308 --> 00:34:58,187
And she wants to have food with you.

695
00:34:58,428 --> 00:34:59,432
Are you available?

696
00:34:59,627 --> 00:35:00,488
Is it okay?

697
00:35:00,788 --> 00:35:01,708
Yeah.

698
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:02,828
You should eat well.

699
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,627
We have a great canteen. Want to try it?

700
00:35:05,627 --> 00:35:06,467
- It's amazing.
- Okay.

701
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,067
I'll leave you to talk.
Let me get some medicine.

702
00:35:11,828 --> 00:35:14,187
Right, Dr. Qin,
we took a photo seven years ago.

703
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:15,948
Can we take another one today?

704
00:35:18,107 --> 00:35:18,984
Can we?

705
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:25,268
Of course.

706
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:28,147
Please take a photo of us.

707
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:29,320
Of course.

708
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:30,408
Thank you.

709
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:31,624
Come on.

710
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,064
Come on.

711
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:41,388
Dr. Qin, why are you standing far away?

712
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,016
Come closer.

713
00:35:44,388 --> 00:35:45,507
Don't you hear her?

714
00:35:45,748 --> 00:35:47,560
She's not happy about it. Go closer.

715
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,187
Okay.

716
00:35:49,187 --> 00:35:50,268
Closer.

717
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,027
Come on.

718
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:54,908
One, two, three, cheese.

719
00:35:55,788 --> 00:35:56,712
Okay.

720
00:35:57,467 --> 00:35:58,667
Do you like it?

721
00:35:58,908 --> 00:35:59,912
Thank you.

722
00:36:03,547 --> 00:36:04,552
It looks nice.

723
00:36:04,868 --> 00:36:05,736
I'm glad you like it.

724
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:09,224
Let's go for lunch now.

725
00:36:09,224 --> 00:36:10,388
Okay.

726
00:36:10,388 --> 00:36:11,627
Let's go, Lele.

727
00:36:12,147 --> 00:36:14,547
Be careful.

728
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,627
Try this, Lele. It's really nice.

729
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:18,056
Thank you.

730
00:36:22,268 --> 00:36:24,868
Lele, have the shrimps.
Dr. Qin peeled them for you.

731
00:36:25,187 --> 00:36:26,056
For extra protein.

732
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:27,788
Thank you, Dr. Qin.

733
00:36:27,788 --> 00:36:28,808
You're welcome.

734
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:31,788
Lele, you look like
a fan of detective novels.

735
00:36:32,547 --> 00:36:33,828
Can you do deductions?

736
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,176
Of course.

737
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:36,168
Really?

738
00:36:36,168 --> 00:36:37,107
Shall I demonstrate it?

739
00:36:38,187 --> 00:36:39,048
Sure.

740
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:43,828
You're not a real couple, right?

741
00:36:49,288 --> 00:36:50,908
See, I knew it.

742
00:36:53,187 --> 00:36:54,056
Well...

743
00:36:55,147 --> 00:36:56,107
Here's the thing.

744
00:36:56,788 --> 00:36:57,736
It's nothing.

745
00:36:58,147 --> 00:36:59,107
And I think

746
00:36:59,308 --> 00:37:03,944
Dr. Qin is dating Su Ying, right?

747
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:10,147
How do you know?

748
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:11,560
From deduction.

749
00:37:14,587 --> 00:37:15,748
How?

750
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,547
First,

751
00:37:18,388 --> 00:37:20,748
you stood so far away
from each other for taking a photo.

752
00:37:21,748 --> 00:37:23,268
And you kept seeking approval

753
00:37:23,587 --> 00:37:25,348
from her after she came

754
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:26,788
because you felt guilty.

755
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,828
And you figured it out just like that?

756
00:37:34,308 --> 00:37:35,272
Certainly not.

757
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:38,788
Dr. Qin rushed to sit in front of you

758
00:37:39,348 --> 00:37:40,948
so that he could see you better.

759
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:43,592
Also,

760
00:37:46,147 --> 00:37:47,547
are these really for me?

761
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:50,587
Love is shown in the details.

762
00:37:50,987 --> 00:37:51,948
It doesn't need a deduction.

763
00:37:54,828 --> 00:37:55,816
Lele.

764
00:37:57,788 --> 00:38:00,667
We didn't tell you
because we didn't want to upset you.

765
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,467
What's the big deal?
You broke up. It's normal.

766
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:10,056
Alright, then.

767
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:11,748
Let me introduce you

768
00:38:12,987 --> 00:38:14,948
to Su Ying, my girlfriend.

769
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,467
I got it right.

770
00:38:18,788 --> 00:38:21,428
May I ask how long you've been dating?

771
00:38:23,987 --> 00:38:24,904
Just eat.

772
00:38:24,987 --> 00:38:26,228
I'm just curious.

773
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:28,467
What do you like about Dr. Qin?

774
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,264
Dr. Qin?

775
00:38:32,264 --> 00:38:33,288
He's handsome.

776
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:36,228
And Dr. Qin...

777
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:57,507
So many reposts.

778
00:39:02,388 --> 00:39:03,467

781
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:39,428

Thanks for your support.

SU's friend is my friend.

783
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:47,560
SU?

784
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:51,467
No wonder. Su helped me.

785
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,027
Mi Bai is Mi Su's little sister?

786
00:39:59,507 --> 00:40:00,456
Yeah.

787
00:40:00,948 --> 00:40:01,788
She joined Meichi?

788
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:04,547
Meichi Hospital just announced
its employment.

789
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:05,868
She was recently enrolled

790
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:07,828
as the Medical Director.

791
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:09,667
She's almost identical

792
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:12,187
(Medical Director Mi Bai)
to her.

793
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:16,268
What does she do there?

794
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:18,828
She's in charge of
introducing foreign techniques.

795
00:40:19,268 --> 00:40:21,627
Meichi has never
developed this section before.

796
00:40:23,268 --> 00:40:24,547
That's good.

797
00:40:25,587 --> 00:40:28,507
That means they still need investment.

798
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:36,828
It's the test report for the surgery

799
00:40:37,547 --> 00:40:38,627
at 4 PM.

800
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:41,627
Make an appointment for that surgery.

801
00:40:41,627 --> 00:40:43,228
Hello, are you Dr. Mi?

802
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,147
Hello.

803
00:40:47,147 --> 00:40:48,547
Can you spare me a few minutes?

804
00:40:50,107 --> 00:40:50,987
Go get ready.

805

How can I help you?

808
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:07,828
Here's the thing. I've been looking into

809
00:41:07,948 --> 00:41:09,467
investment in medical appliances.

810
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:10,987
And I heard that you're

811
00:41:10,987 --> 00:41:12,187
an expert in this field.

812
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:13,868
So I'd like to consult you.

813
00:41:15,627 --> 00:41:19,187
We do need some funding support,

814
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:20,748
but that's beyond my scope of duty.

815
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,144
I see.

816
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:26,147
I can contact
the person in charge for you.

817
00:41:26,748 --> 00:41:28,428
That'd be great. Thank you.

818
00:41:31,547 --> 00:41:32,587
Is there anything else?

819
00:41:32,987 --> 00:41:34,428
No. I'll wait for the good news.

820
00:41:35,308 --> 00:41:36,328
I'll get back to work.

821
00:41:42,788 --> 00:41:43,816
So much alike.

822
00:41:45,428 --> 00:41:48,268
Bai, ignore that guy.

823
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:49,467
He's not a decent guy.

824
00:41:50,187 --> 00:41:51,112
Why?

825
00:41:51,388 --> 00:41:53,908
I've told you about him.
He's Su Ying's ex-boyfriend.

826
00:41:55,507 --> 00:41:58,348
That's why his name sounded familiar.

827
00:41:59,027 --> 00:42:00,027
What's his problem?

828
00:42:00,027 --> 00:42:02,984
He may seem decent
but he's really sneaky.

829
00:42:03,627 --> 00:42:04,987
He wanted Su Ying back but failed,

830
00:42:05,268 --> 00:42:06,428
so he kept causing trouble.

831
00:42:06,788 --> 00:42:08,107
He even tried to buy the glass house.

832
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:12,107
What did he tell you?

833
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,467
He wanted to
collaborate with our hospital.

834
00:42:16,228 --> 00:42:17,288
Collaborate?

835
00:42:17,948 --> 00:42:20,868
On what? He works
on construction materials.

836
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:24,388
Don't worry. I got this.

837
00:42:25,187 --> 00:42:26,888
