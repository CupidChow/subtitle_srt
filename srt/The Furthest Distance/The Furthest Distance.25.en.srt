I couldn't reach you all day today.
Who did you perform surgery with?

20
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,896
Who else could it be? Director Ruan.

00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,451

It's confirmed. What's wrong?

28
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,850
Confirmed?

29
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,930
Why is she back to the firm?

30
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,730
She probably has new ideas,

31
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:38,011
and wants to modify it.

32
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,400

I didn't tell you to.

We know you're
under a lot of pressure today.

41
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:02,930
We definitely need to come back.

42
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:05,192
Relax. We'll work overtime with you.

43
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,091
Right. Don't forget we're family.

Ying, do you have
an upset stomach again?

50
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,651
Did you drink too much coffee?

51
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,970
Do you need a pill?

52
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,091
It's okay. I will be fine
once the plan is approved.

53
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,530
I'll rest after it's over.

Here is the other designer, Tian Mei.

Please have a seat.

57
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,610
As both designers are here,

58
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,872
let's start.

59
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,472
I'll go first.

60
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:49,576
Okay.

61
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:01,571
This public hospital project

62
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:03,691
Is to acquire an old hospital

63
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,410
and do a complete renovation.

64
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,691
So, here's my overall plan.

65
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:13,610
(Wards)
First, increase the number of wards.

66
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:17,331
Add two more wards to each floor.

67
00:07:18,331 --> 00:07:21,290
Next, readjust the layout of the wards.

68
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:27,490
Put a partition
in two-thirds of each ward.

69
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,451
The partition
will be made of frosted glass

70
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:32,011
with controllable transparency.

71
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:34,651
This way, it is convenient
for doctors and nurses

72
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:36,451
to observe the patients at any time.

73
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:37,970
And it won't disturb the patients.

74
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:45,896
This is the effect picture. Take a look.

00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:50,252

76
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:01,530
Quite intuitive.

77
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:01,970
Nice.

78
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:02,344
Yes.

79
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,344
Hello, Chief.

80
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:19,784
Hello, Qin.

81
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,251
You've got a lot of equipment.

82
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,168
It's just a hobby.

83
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,730
Want to compete with me today?

84
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,811
Good idea. Let's go.

85
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,130
(Thanks for Your Time)
That's all.

86
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:37,650
I think it's pretty good.
What do you think?

87
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,600
Good.

88
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:39,571
We can use it directly.

89
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:41,331
Yes, many details are adoptable.

90
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,411
It's good.

91
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:43,051
Yes.

92
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:50,571
Tian Mei, why did you
plagiarize our plan?

93
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,768
Plagiarize?

94
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,880
- What?
- She plagiarized?

95
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,211
What now?

96
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,130
Mr. Xu, you can't make reckless remarks.

97
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,730
When you were working on the plan,

98
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,130
I've never been to the firm.

99
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:06,451
Why do you say I copied your plan?

100
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:08,091
You know if you copied or not.

101
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,160
Ying always treats...

102
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:14,250
I hope you can
resolve your problem privately.

103
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:16,451
We didn't come here to watch you argue.

104
00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:18,312
Please have a seat.

105
00:09:22,691 --> 00:09:24,291
Is there a problem, Miss Su?

106
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:27,931
Is your plan the same with Miss Tian's?

107
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,931
Still need to elaborate?

108
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:43,331
Of course.

109
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,840
Please.

110
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,970
Actually, my previous plan
is very similar to Miss Tian's.

111
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:09,291
It also uses glass as a partition.

112
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:11,211
But I want to add a few points.

113
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,850
Although glass allows doctors

114
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:16,691
and nurses to discover abnormalities
of the patients at the first instant.

115
00:10:17,211 --> 00:10:18,650
But it also invades

116
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,051
the patients' privacy.

117
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:23,291
Even if the transparency
of the glass is controllable,

118
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,411
it will make them feel insecure.

119
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:28,331
After all, the hospital
is a public place.

120
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,730
So patients need

121
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:32,171
their own space and privacy.

122
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:35,130
What Miss Su said does make sense.

123
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,211
It seems like glass
is not suitable to be used in wards.

124
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,411
I wonder if Miss Su has other advice.

125
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,051
Can I take a look at your plan?

126
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,890
While meeting
all the needs of a hospital,

127
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,171
we need to truly consider the patients.

128
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:12,130
It's not necessary for people to know
this is a hospital

129
00:11:12,411 --> 00:11:13,451
when they see it.

130
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,811
The design of the building
should be modern.

131
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,171
At the same time,
we should make it like home.

132
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,730
When patients are unwell,

133
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,331
it will make them even more pressured

134
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,970
to see the cold medical equipment

135
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,890
and the condition of other patients.

136
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,010
Therefore, my plan goes as follow.

137
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:33,331
First, to make it
individualized and like home.

138
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,472
Alright, that's all for my plan.
Thank you.

139
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:06,568
Pretty good.

140
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,610
Although Miss Su's plan
seems conservative,

141
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:13,211
it is really innovative.

142
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,051
You are truly an award-winning designer.

143
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:18,984
Nice.

144
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,890
I have a different opinion.

145
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,531
Though the plans of you two

146
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,250
seem to differ in materials,

147
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:28,811
in fact,

148
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,010
they share many similarities.

149
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:35,211
Also, I heard that Miss Tian
used to be an employee of Miss Su.

150
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,811
Sometimes, famous designers might also

151
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:40,291
copy and modify
the works of new designers

152
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,850
to enhance their own reputation.

153
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,890
I think this is also something

154
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:47,291
that we need to consider.

155
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,216
Yeah.

156
00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:52,051
That's possible.

157
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:53,531
We will also take that
into consideration.

158
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,944
- Yes.
- Indeed.

159
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:57,931
Are you suggesting

160
00:12:58,691 --> 00:12:59,890
that I copied Tian Mei's plan?

161
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,650
It's not exactly what I meant.

162
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,211
However, for now,

163
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:07,130
it's hard to tell who truly
comes up with this in the first place.

164
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:09,691
We don't know
whether there is plagiarism.

165
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:12,171
I believe no one wants to see

166
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:13,531
a public welfare hospital like this

167
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:15,130
gets involved in such a scandal.

168
00:13:15,931 --> 00:13:17,811
So, I suggest

169
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:19,691
you think of even better plans

170
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,211
for a second competition

171
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,411
to avoid disputes
from similarities in details.

172
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:32,091
Do you agree?

173
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:34,600
I do.

174
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,571
Okay. We will give you some more time.

175
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,890
Hope you can come up with better plans.

176
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,931
That's it for today's meeting.

177
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:53,171
Okay.

178
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:54,051
Thanks for your time.

179
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:54,370
Okay.

180
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,250
We'll wait for their subsequent plans.

181
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,608
Alright.

182
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,171
Ying, Tian Mei copied the plan

183
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,490
you have worked so hard on.

184
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,890
Why should we compete again?

185
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:06,770
We don't have enough evidence yet.

186
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:08,776
But...

187
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,544
Tian Mei.

188
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,610
Want to talk to me?

189
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,250
I've already
sent my resignation letter to you.

190
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,392
Why didn't you tell me in advance?
Are you scared?

191
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:30,770
There's nothing to say.

192
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:35,130
What's wrong, Miss Su?
Can't take a loss?

193
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:38,184
To be honest, in terms of ability,

194
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:39,850
I never thought I would lose to you.

195
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:41,931
I'm just short of an opportunity.

196
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,931
Tian Mei, when you were at your worst,

197
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:47,171
I invited you to join SU.

198
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,931
Is this how you repay me?

199
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:52,931
Yes, I am very grateful
for the opportunity you gave me then.

200
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:56,130
But I also remember in the interview,

201
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:59,730
you told me you care more
about attitude than speed in a project.

202
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,610
Now I know what matters to me is speed.

203
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:05,320
So you plagiarized my idea
without hesitation?

204
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,051
Miss Su, you can't just say
whatever you want.

205
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:10,811
Similar creativity occurs often.

206
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,490
Besides, no one has said
only you can use glass, right?

207
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,531
You are right.

208
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,331
Ying can win ADA with glass.

209
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,610
Without her guidance,

210
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,811
you'll only ruin the glass.

211
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,970
The success of Ying is not accidental.

212
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:26,451
It's based on strength.

213
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:29,211
However, you only know
how to take shortcuts.

214
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,211
Let's wait and see.

215
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:34,890
There's a second round.

216
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:39,610
Su Ying, no one can always win.

217
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,600
As long as I'm here,

218
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,451
you can never win.

219
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,176
Just wait and see.

220
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,571
Tian Mei, you...

221
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:58,691
Ying, let's go.
Let's go to see the doctor.

222
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,760
Let's go.

223
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,472
Here.

224
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:12,331
Thank you.

225
00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:13,256
It's a bit hot.

226
00:16:21,032 --> 00:16:22,730
Are you feeling better now?

227
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:24,712
Better.

228
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,250
I'm fine here.

229
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:28,571
Do you want to go back first?

230
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,730
You have to oversee
the case of Jiang Dong.

231
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:33,331
You're getting an IV drip.

232
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,464
How can I leave? I'll stay with you.

233
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:38,291
It's okay, I'll ask Dr. Qin to come.

234
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:41,531
Yunsheng can come?

235
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:42,890
Go ahead.

236
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,650
Okay, if there's anything...

237
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,730
Go ahead.

238
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,664
Call me anytime.

239
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:47,531
Understood.

240
00:16:47,531 --> 00:16:48,552
Fine.

241
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,691
Hurry back.

242
00:16:49,691 --> 00:16:50,970
Alright, goodbye.

243
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,880
Go ahead.

244
00:17:03,784 --> 00:17:04,840
(Dr. Qin)

245
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,748
(Su Ying)

246
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,971
Sorry, the subscriber you have dialed
is not available.

247
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,480
Please dial again...

248
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,584
Uncle Zhao.

249
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,180
(Su Ying)

250
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:13,890
Hello, Su Ying.

251
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:22,408
Where is Qin Yunsheng?

252
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:25,690
He is busy at the moment.

253
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,410
If there's anything,
I can pass it on to him for you.

254
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,291
I'm looking for Qin Yunsheng, not you.

255
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:34,890
Pass the phone to him.

256
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,850
We'll be busy until very late today.

257
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,731
He might not call you back anytime soon.

258
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,448
Goodbye.

259
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:03,850
Missed.

260
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,776
You.

261
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,291
So, while work is important,

262
00:19:07,491 --> 00:19:09,091
we should work out frequently.

263
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:11,331
We still need to play more.

264
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,264
Exactly.

265
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,930
Chief, you are steady and flexible.

266
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,251
I should learn from you.

267
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,491
That's enough.

268
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:20,771
You've been playing with me for so long.

269
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,450
Don't you still want me
to do that surgery for you?

270
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,930
I know you're retiring.

271
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,531
But this patient
is really very important to me.

272
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,531
Yes, I understand what you're saying.

273
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:33,170
The patient is important.

274
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,850
Family is more important
to us, isn't it?

275
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:37,690
Ever since I got married,

276
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,291
I've promised her
I would travel with her.

277
00:19:40,491 --> 00:19:43,011
It got postponed again and again
until now that I'm gonna retire.

278
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,850
I feel really sorry for her.

279
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:48,232
That's why I can't help you
with the surgery.

280
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,331
Uncle Zhao, Yunsheng, have some water.

281
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:52,456
Thank you.

282
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,890
Uncle Zhao.

283
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,011
I am here to discuss the re-hiring
on behalf of my father.

284
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,000
Thanks for your father's appreciation.

285
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,051
But I can't work here
for the rest of my life.

286
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:06,370
But the hospital
and the patients need you too.

287
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,771
Moreover, my father said
as long as you agree to be re-hired,

288
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,210
you can only work two days a week.

289
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,051
You will have time for your family.

290
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:18,091
And you can also
help patients with severe diseases.

291
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:19,560
What do you think?

292
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:24,648
That's a good idea.

293
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,291
You can help the patients
and accompany you family.

294
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:28,771
Please consider it again.

295
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:30,024
Yeah.

296
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,331
You must have prepared this in advance

297
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:34,610
to persuade me together, right?

298
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,531
I will think about it. Okay?

299
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:41,864
Really?

300
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:45,000
Since you're available today,
how about we play for a while?

301
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:46,491
Sure. Come on.

302
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,944
Good.

303
00:20:52,971 --> 00:20:55,410
Mi Bai, what about the pitching?

304
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:58,051
You're asking for Su Ying, right?

305
00:20:59,272 --> 00:21:00,331
Yeah.

306
00:21:00,331 --> 00:21:02,091
There's no problem with her plan.

307
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:05,160
It's just that...

308
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:06,696
Just what?

309
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,011
You know about
the rural public welfare hospital.

310
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,370
The project is big
and the cycle is long.

311
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,291
The review experts said
they need to discuss it further.

312
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:21,091
But there's no problem with her plan.

313
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,264
That's good.

314
00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:26,370
Then I'll join Uncle Zhao for the game.

315
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:27,656
Go.

316
00:21:39,784 --> 00:21:44,648
(Missed call from Su Ying)
(Su Ying)

317
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,380
(Dr. Qin)

318
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:02,024
Hello?

319
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,571
Hello, you called me?

320
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:08,776
I just heard from Mi Bai that you were
doing great. Congratulations.

321
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,208
Where are you?

322
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:12,424
I...

323
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,450
I am out, dealing with something.

324
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:24,731
Sorry,

325
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:25,576
something happened.

326
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:26,731
I will call you back later.

327
00:22:33,704 --> 00:22:34,664
Is everything okay, Mi Bai?

328
00:22:34,664 --> 00:22:35,610
I'm fine.

329
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,650
How are you?

330
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,608
Didn't warm up properly?

331
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,656
Twisted your ankle?

332
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:40,850
A bit.

333
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:43,971
I'm sorry, Uncle Zhao.
I couldn't play with you anymore.

334
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,251
It's nothing. We should stop now.

335
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,091
I'll take you to the hospital.

336
00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:50,091
It will be fine. It will heal quickly.

337
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,168
Yunsheng will accompany me.

338
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:53,170
I will leave her to you.

339
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,120
Okay. I will take her back.

340
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,304
Okay.

341
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,491
Goodbye, Uncle Zhao.

342
00:22:56,491 --> 00:22:57,480
Bye.

343
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,080
Let's go.

344
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,880
Does it hurt a lot?

345
00:23:04,136 --> 00:23:05,011
I'm okay.

346
00:23:05,011 --> 00:23:05,928
Sit there for a while.

347
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,450
Here is the other designer, Tian Mei.

348
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,731
What's wrong, Miss Su?
Can't take a loss?

349
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:25,610
To be honest, in terms of ability,

350
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,331
I never thought I would lose to you.

351
00:23:28,011 --> 00:23:29,291
(I'm just short of an opportunity.)

352
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,571
The hospital project

353
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:43,720
is not suitable for you.

354
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,771
Because I'm the person
in charge of this project.

355
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,091
They share

356
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,370
many similarities.

357
00:23:50,051 --> 00:23:52,051
So, I suggest
you think of even better plans

358
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,890
(for a second competition.)

359
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,971
(He is busy at the moment.)

360
00:24:01,331 --> 00:24:03,731
(If there is anything,
I can pass it on to him for you.)

361
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,491
(Sorry,)

362
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:08,531
(something happened.)

363
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,531
(I will call you back later.)

364
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:19,610
What did you say? Tian Mei?

365
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,850
Ying is competing with her?

366
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,971
T-This is too outrageous.

367
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,210
It's easy to know men's faces,
but not their hearts.

368
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:29,210
But she did not participate
in this project.

369
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,450
How did she get the plan?

370
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,531
I-I also find it very strange.

371
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:35,531
It seems that there is
something to do with her

372
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,610
that the data was wrong.

373
00:24:36,811 --> 00:24:38,971
I can't believe this.
Ying has treated her well, right?

374
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,571
How could she repay her like this?

375
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,024
Accuse her of plagiarism.

376
00:24:42,491 --> 00:24:43,410
Useless.

377
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,370
It's hard to get evidence,

378
00:24:44,731 --> 00:24:45,890
and the litigation takes too long.

379
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,251
The competition will end
before the result comes out.

380
00:24:48,491 --> 00:24:50,091
But we can't just let her off so easily.

381
00:24:50,771 --> 00:24:52,610
Ying is always so nice to her.

382
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:53,890
Ying let her in every project.

383
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:55,850
She did such a thing behind her back.

384
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:58,011
Don't let me see her again.

385
00:24:58,011 --> 00:24:58,890
I'll rip her apart.

386
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,480
Calm down. Don't worry.

387
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,051
If we see her,
we won't let her off easily either.

388
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:06,731
Where's Su?

389
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:08,251
She had a stomachache
during the competition.

390
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:09,850
I took her to the hospital for a drip.

391
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,272
I must go and see her.

392
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,370
Don't.

393
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,690
She said Dr. Qin would take care of her.

394
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,912
He can accompany her.

395
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:19,930
Okay. Hope Dr. Qin
will take good care of her.

396
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,130
Try the sweet and sour pork here.

397
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,130
I think it's their best dish.

398
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,251
Zhengwen, you are too kind.

399
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,771
Don't mention it.

400
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:40,331
We didn't talk much
when we met in the hospital.

401
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,170
You're in Qingyu now.
Shouldn't I play the host?

402
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,650
How do you like this soup?

403
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:48,840
It is their specialty.

404
00:25:49,051 --> 00:25:49,960
Not bad.

405
00:25:50,771 --> 00:25:51,771
So, we can come often.

406
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:55,331
No need for that.
It would cost you too much.

407
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:57,850
Not at all, Mrs. Zhou.

408
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:01,512
When Su and I were together back then,
we didn't have much money.

409
00:26:01,971 --> 00:26:02,850
You took care of us.

410
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:04,571
I remember it all.

411
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,170
Now that we are better off.

412
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:08,370
Please let me show my gratitude.

413
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:12,890
Don't mention the past.

414
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:15,450
You and Su now have new lives.

415
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:18,011
You both are doing well. That's enough.

416
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:19,976
However,

417
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,731
now I often think back

418
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,051
on those days with Su.

419
00:26:28,011 --> 00:26:28,872
Zhengwen,

420
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:33,051
if you can't forget Su,

421
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:34,650
I can't help you.

422
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,930
After all, she won't
change her decisions easily.

423
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:42,571
Su is my daughter.

424
00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:46,251
As a mother,
I will always respect her choice.

425
00:26:49,091 --> 00:26:50,291
Actually, I came this time

426
00:26:50,731 --> 00:26:52,771
to persuade you to let go of the past.

427
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:55,210
Move on.

428
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:57,771
Mrs. Zhou, it's not

429
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,890
that I can't let go.

430
00:27:00,731 --> 00:27:03,410
It's just that as you know, Su and I
have been together for such a long time.

431
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,210
We understand each other.

432
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:07,560
Now...

433
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:10,824
Mrs. Zhou.

434
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:12,328
Mrs. Zhou, what's wrong?

435
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,291
Are you not feeling well?

436
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:15,170
I'm sorry.

437
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,370
I'm a bit uncomfortable.

438
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:18,971
I have to go first.

439
00:27:19,624 --> 00:27:20,491
Let me send you off.

440
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:21,448
No, thank you.

441
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,296
I can walk by myself. Thanks.

442
00:27:29,571 --> 00:27:30,536
Mrs. Zhou.

443
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,291
Mrs. Zhou, what's wrong?

444
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,040
Mrs. Zhou! Call an ambulance!

445
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,690
Mrs. Zhou, are you alright?

446
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:38,952
Mrs. Zhou!

447
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,848
Be careful. Let me help you.

448
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,771
Walk slowly.

449
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:03,011
Maybe you should get an X-ray later.

450
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,328
Okay.

451
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:06,408
(Meichi International Hospital)

452
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,640
Slow down.

453
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,731
Walk.

454
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:14,450
Walk.

455
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,232
Sorry, Yunsheng. I need a hand.

456
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,130
It's okay.

457
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,011
Use this leg to walk.

458
00:28:31,436 --> 00:28:35,148
(Meichi International Hospital)

459
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,304
Hello.

460
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,800
What are you doing?

461
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:45,051
I'm taking care of a patient.

462
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,731
Is Mi Bai your patient?

463
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,104
I'm sorry.

464
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:11,176
Su Ying.

465
00:29:11,656 --> 00:29:14,760
Su Ying. Su Ying!

466
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:15,880
Su Ying.

467
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:17,480
Su Ying.

468
00:29:19,011 --> 00:29:19,912
Su Ying!

469
00:29:39,468 --> 00:29:40,936
(Dr. Qin)
(End Call)

470
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,460
(Yang Zhengwen)

471
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:53,416
Hello.

472
00:29:53,811 --> 00:29:54,811
Su Ying, come to Meichi.

473
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,072
Mrs. Zhou has fainted.

474
00:29:56,331 --> 00:29:57,192
What?

475
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,704
Hello, Yunsheng.

476
00:30:09,704 --> 00:30:11,930
I saw Yang Zhengwen
bringing a fainted woman.

477
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,850
The emergency contact person is Su Ying.

478
00:30:14,091 --> 00:30:15,016
Her surname is Zhou.

479
00:30:15,144 --> 00:30:16,051
Mrs. Zhou?

480
00:30:16,051 --> 00:30:17,251
Do you want to come over?

481
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:19,432
Okay, I am heading back.

482
00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:21,731
Can you help me take care of Mi Bai?

483
00:30:22,011 --> 00:30:22,930
She is at the door.

484
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,880
Okay.

485
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,370
Bai, are you alright?

486
00:30:32,571 --> 00:30:33,450
You twisted your ankle?

487
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,472
It's okay.

488
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,531
Did he mention where he went?

489
00:30:37,051 --> 00:30:38,890
Su Ying's mom was in the hospital.

490
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,011
Yunsheng rushed over.

491
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:41,610
I'll take a look.

492
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,696
I will support you.

493
00:30:47,331 --> 00:30:48,491
- Where is she?
- Don't worry.

494
00:30:48,712 --> 00:30:49,690
She suddenly fainted.

495
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,811
I took her to the hospital.

496
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:52,072
She is under treatment.

497
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:53,930
What happened?
How could she suddenly faint?

498
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,571
We do not know yet. Don't worry.

499
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,091
She will be fine. Okay?

500
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,251
Doctor, how is my mom?

501
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,450
She fainted because there is

502
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:07,091
a minor cerebral hemorrhage
caused by unstable blood pressure.

503
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,331
The rescue was timely.

504
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,450
But she may be unconscious for a while.

505
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,571
She needs to stay here.

506
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,850
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

507
00:31:14,091 --> 00:31:16,011
Please complete
the admission procedures for her.

508
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,352
Okay. Thank you.

509
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:20,450
However, the aneurysm in her head

510
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,370
is the real threat.

511
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:24,251
I recommend her to have surgery soon.

512
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,610
Otherwise, if this aneurysm ruptures,

513
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:27,811
it's really a problem.

514
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,011
Aneurysm?

515
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:32,331
Didn't you know that?

516
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,400
Doctor, how is Mrs. Zhou?

517
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:38,210
Dr. Qin, didn't I tell you last time

518
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,971
that she needs to be hospitalized ASAP?

519
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:41,251
Why did you delay until now?

520
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,491
I'm sorry.
She was already ready to come...

521
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,811
You are also a doctor.

522
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,488
Don't you know how dangerous it is?

523
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:49,992
I'm sorry.

524
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,930
Qin Yunsheng, why don't you tell us?

525
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,370
Who is responsible
if Mrs. Zhou is severely ill?

526
00:32:00,616 --> 00:32:01,531
Su Ying.

527
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:03,531
So you knew my mom was sick, didn't you?

528
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:06,890
Yes.

529
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,731
You know she could be

530
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:09,410
in grave danger at any moment, right?

531
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:15,432
Su Ying.

532
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:17,491
You misunderstood Yunsheng.

533
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:19,491
Shut up.

534
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:43,571
Su Ying, I'm sorry.

535
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,731
It's my fault.

536
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,811
I don't want to argue with you
who's to blame right now.

537
00:32:48,811 --> 00:32:50,610
I just want my mom
to wake up soon, okay?

538
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:54,792
You were on an IV drip?

539
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,291
Why didn't you tell me?

540
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,890
I didn't tell you?

541
00:33:00,571 --> 00:33:01,610
Could I even find you?

542
00:33:03,491 --> 00:33:04,424
I'm sorry.

543
00:33:06,811 --> 00:33:08,370
I know there's some misunderstanding,

544
00:33:09,011 --> 00:33:10,170
but I can explain.

545
00:33:12,011 --> 00:33:14,152
Okay, then explain.

546
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:16,232
I...

547
00:33:30,491 --> 00:33:31,432
Qin Yunsheng.

548
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,608
You said you would keep a distance.
I believed you.

549
00:33:38,531 --> 00:33:40,251
You promised I would
never lose touch with you.

550
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,384
I believed you.

551
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,032
But where were you
when my firm was slandered?

552
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:50,056
Where were you
when I was betrayed by my subordinate?

553
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:52,450
Where were you
when my stomachache was making me faint?

554
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,440
I'm sorry. I...

555
00:34:02,771 --> 00:34:04,650
I don't want to hear that, really.

556
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,091
These days,

557
00:34:11,531 --> 00:34:13,051
when I needed you the most,

558
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,130
I couldn't find you.

559
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,250
And you lied to me.

560
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:26,571
I don't care if you hugged Mi Bai.

561
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:29,971
Why did you
hide my mom's illness from me?

562
00:34:29,971 --> 00:34:30,920
Why?

563
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,688
I'm sorry.

564
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,536
Su...

565
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,210
I'm really tired.

566
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,730

It will be okay.

580
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:09,371
Don't worry. She will be fine.

581
00:36:10,891 --> 00:36:13,250
How could my mom have an aneurysm?

582
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,744
What if...

583
00:36:21,851 --> 00:36:23,851
What if she doesn't wake up?

584
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,371
I won't even be able
to see her one last time.

585
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,290
Stop worrying, okay?

586
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,690
She will be fine.

587
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,170
I've inquired.

588
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,411
Chief Zhao from Meichi
is an expert in this field.

589
00:36:37,491 --> 00:36:38,891
I will get him to cure her.

590
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:43,851
Stop worrying, okay?

591
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:50,130
Are you sure you're okay?
Do you need to go to the orthopedics?

592
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,371
I'm feeling much better now.

593
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,931
I think I'll be fine
after some ice therapy at home.

594
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,051
I think it's safer to get an X-ray.

595
00:36:57,531 --> 00:36:58,408
No need, really.

596
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:00,584
Are you sure?

597
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,088
Yes.

598
00:37:02,451 --> 00:37:04,451
Walk slowly.
I'll go get some medicine for you.

599
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,650
Thanks, Yisen.

600
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,664
No problem.

601
00:37:44,571 --> 00:37:45,448
Mom,

602
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,650
why didn't you tell me
when you got sick?

603
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:53,411
Didn't you say
that we can talk about anything?

604
00:37:56,451 --> 00:37:57,480
It's all my fault.

605
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:00,770
I didn't take good care of you.

606
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,784
I promise you.

607
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,931
When you wake up,

608
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:08,971
I'll take you
to the flower garden, okay?

609
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,770
I still want to eat your pig lung soup.

610
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,971
No matter what soup you cook,
I promise to drink it all.

611
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:16,616
Is that okay?

612
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,536
Mom.

613
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,531
Please wake up.

614
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:36,968
I am sorry.

615
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:39,971
I didn't take good care of you.

616
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,091
How long has she fainted?

617
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,571
About four or five hours.

618
00:39:10,491 --> 00:39:14,690
Chief, her situation is
both dangerous and unusual.

619
00:39:15,571 --> 00:39:16,931
We might need to do the surgery now.

620
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:18,610
I'm begging you here.

621
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,810
I hope you can be the lead surgeon.

622
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,210
As long as you approve,
I'm willing to do anything.

623
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:26,491
Okay, I will do the surgery.

624
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:27,336
Thanks, Chief.

625
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:30,330
But her illness is unique,

626
00:39:31,491 --> 00:39:33,491
I need to work on the treatment plan.

627
00:39:34,531 --> 00:39:35,371
Will she wake up?

628
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:37,800
Let's hope so.
