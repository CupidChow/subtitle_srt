=Episode 1=

17
00:01:54,107 --> 00:01:55,187
(My name is Su Ying.)

18
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:56,667
(I am a spatial designer.)

19
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:58,428
(As a creative worker,)

20
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,068
(I capture the beauty of life
at any time,)

21
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:02,228
(pursue personalized and fun cognition,)

22
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:04,027
(and improve my sensitivity to details.)

23
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:06,708
(This is the key to cultivating
designers' emotional thinking.)

24
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:08,948
(Exploring human's emotional needs,)

25
00:02:09,308 --> 00:02:12,147
(cleverly integrating design thinking
with emotional elements,)

26
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:14,908
(and designing works
that resonate with users)

27
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:16,228
(are my pursuits.)

28
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:19,987
The expression of the connection
between people and society

29
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:22,348
is the responsibility
and lifelong pursuit of designers.

30
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:25,508
Architecture is the carrier of what's
between people and the environment,

31
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:27,987
as well as the carrier
of the relationship between people.

32
00:02:27,987 --> 00:02:29,068
(The Emotion and Resonance of Design)

33
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:29,948
Well,

34
00:02:29,948 --> 00:02:32,468
this is the topic
I want to share with you today.

35
00:02:33,308 --> 00:02:34,184
Thank you all.

36
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:43,464
Miss Su,

37
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:45,107
you were invited to the House Design.

38
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:46,348
Your glass design

39
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:47,468
made you famous right away,

40
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:49,667
and even made
the House Design show popular again.

41
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:51,748
Why did you choose glass as a material?

42
00:02:52,788 --> 00:02:54,308
What kind of love is that?

43
00:02:56,387 --> 00:02:57,547
In short,

44
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:00,788
that is the happiest form of love
I have ever seen.

45
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:05,672
It's so beautiful.

46
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:09,387
I really hope to live here forever.

47
00:04:12,107 --> 00:04:13,147
I'm glad you like it.

48
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:22,088
Yunsheng,

49
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:25,387
this is

50
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,548
the happiest time in my life.

51
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:31,432
Me too.

52
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:20,707
(Can you please introduce yourselves)

53
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:22,147
(so the audience can know you?)

54
00:05:24,387 --> 00:05:25,308
(My name is Qin Yunsheng.)

55
00:05:25,512 --> 00:05:26,508
(House Design)

56
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:27,787
(I am a cardiothoracic surgeon.)

57
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:30,387
(My name is Mi Su.)

58
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:32,628
(Qin Yunsheng is my fiance,)

59
00:05:33,027 --> 00:05:34,467
(and he is also my attending doctor.)

60
00:05:35,907 --> 00:05:37,068
(I took part in the House Design)

61
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:39,587
(to build a dream house for Mi Su.)

62
00:05:41,948 --> 00:05:43,508
(It's because
I don't have much time left.)

63
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:46,440
(I hope)

64
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:49,787
(she is happy)

65
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:52,548
(every day of her life.)

66
00:05:54,548 --> 00:05:56,868
(Actually, I hope to have)

67
00:05:57,508 --> 00:05:58,988
(a home of our own in my last days)

68
00:05:59,868 --> 00:06:01,227
(and to leave beautiful memories.)

69
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:05,347
(The House Design production team
has invited)

70
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:06,587
(a young designer, Su Ying.)

71
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:08,267
(What kind of solution)

72
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:09,907
(will she provide for this couple?)

73
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:15,628
(Hello, everyone. I am Su Ying.)

74
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:19,108
(According to the situation
and needs of my clients,)

75
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:22,027
(I chose glass as the main material
for this house.)

76
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:24,827
(My intention is to
create a beautiful seaside glass house.)

77
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:29,992
(Glass House Proposal)

78
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:34,147
This is my final proposal
for this episode of House Design.

79
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:37,320
Glass?

80
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:39,748
However, glass is rarely used

81
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:41,707
as a main material
in residential design.

82
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:43,748
This is a very bold attempt.

83
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:45,707
What makes you think this is feasible?

84
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:48,508
Can I switch off the lights?

85
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:18,696
It's so beautiful.

86
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,748
Dr. Qin once told me

87
00:07:23,347 --> 00:07:25,347
that love is a thing
that makes people happy.

88
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:26,760
I think

89
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,467
if you could live in such a house,

90
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:30,147
facing the sea,

91
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:31,208
with your loved one around,

92
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:33,108
it must be very romantic, right?

93
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:37,480
Yunsheng,

94
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,664
do you like it?

95
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:39,976
Do you?

96
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:41,384
I like it very much.

97
00:07:42,707 --> 00:07:43,624
Let's go with this one.

98
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,208
♪It's me, silently confessing♪

99
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:03,784
♪It's me, waiting for the wind
to come and say♪

100
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:08,616
♪That you come close and retreat
over and over again♪

101
00:08:08,616 --> 00:08:13,224
♪But my heart pumps involuntarily♪

102
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:17,672
♪I rely on it or forget it♪

103
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:23,368
♪You come and stir up my mind♪

104
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:28,040
♪By your side♪

105
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:35,624
(Push and pick up)

106
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:43,336
What a coincidence!

107
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:44,680
What are you doing here?

108
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,552
Thank you.

109
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:03,560
(Hospital lobby)

110
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:16,467
I didn't expect you
to look like this at work.

111
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:20,392
It's an emergency clinic.
It's like this every day.

112
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:27,548
Actually, I've been wondering
how you've been all these years.

113
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:36,296
I am fine.

114
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:37,896
I'm just a bit busy.

115
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:46,068
Let's be friends in WeChat.

116
00:09:47,347 --> 00:09:48,232
Okay.

117
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:49,827
Hurry up. Over here.

118
00:09:49,908 --> 00:09:50,824
Hurry up. Hurry up.

119
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:53,308
Watch out. Move!

120
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:54,188
Move! Move!

121
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:55,107
Make way!

122
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:56,028
Hurry! Hurry!

123
00:10:25,548 --> 00:10:27,268
The ice cream is here.

124
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:29,224
Pick one.

125
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:31,176
I will take this one.

126
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:32,627
Can you eat so much?

127
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:42,141
(Outside of hospital)

128
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:48,584
Happy birthday to Mi Su!

129
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:55,148
I've been doing this with you
for six years.

130
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:56,308
When will it ever end?

131
00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:10,707
Having an ice cream, huh?

132
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,587
You shouldn't eat cold food.

133
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:16,028
Today is my birthday.

134
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:18,920
I'm a doctor.
Listen to me. Give it to me.

135
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,360
Alright.

136
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:22,428
What are you writing?

137
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:25,747
This is my wish list.

138
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:27,747
It contains many things
that I want to do

139
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:29,587
but haven't had time to do.

140
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:32,548
Would you read them to me
one by one?

141
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:38,428
I wish

142
00:11:39,268 --> 00:11:41,308
I could have ice cream
on my birthday every year.

143
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:45,987
Vanilla, coconut milk, and strawberry.

144
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:48,068
I want to taste all kinds of ice cream

145
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:49,788
from around the world.

146
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:51,827
I also want to

147
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:53,544
go bungee jumping

148
00:11:53,908 --> 00:11:55,948
and go diving.

149
00:11:56,627 --> 00:11:59,507
I also want
to plant a big field of flowers.

150
00:11:59,788 --> 00:12:00,987
Ideally, the kind

151
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,788
that wilts slowly.

152
00:12:04,908 --> 00:12:05,864
What else?

153
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:07,747
I also hope

154
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:10,268
I can see the rainbow here every day

155
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:13,987
just by looking up.

156
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:18,788
Just like the rainbow on the day

157
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:20,987
when I confessed my feelings to you.

158
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,707
It will melt soon.

159
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:43,908
Let's meet tomorrow.

160
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:50,188
Didn't you want to fix your glass house?

161
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:51,507
I've contacted

162
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:53,347
one of the top interior designers
in the industry.

163
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:54,707
He will meet us there tomorrow.

164
00:12:56,788 --> 00:12:58,467
Don't forget it. I'll pick you up.

165
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:00,232
Thank you.

166
00:13:00,552 --> 00:13:01,467
I'm leaving.

167
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:02,344
Okay.

168
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:06,664
Enjoy it.

169
00:13:19,068 --> 00:13:21,467
See? A serious dampening problem.

170
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:23,268
A common issue by the sea.

171
00:13:23,747 --> 00:13:24,627
To be fixed from below.

172
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:30,760
And this sink

173
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,136
needs to be replaced.

174
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:34,107
Do you know why
there are so many insects?

175
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:36,987
The smell of seawater is strong here.

176
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,747
Glass material

177
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:50,867
is prone to overlighting and sunburn.

178
00:13:51,388 --> 00:13:52,747
This needs to be fixed.

179
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:55,627
This house was built six years ago.

180
00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:58,068
The designer said
it could be used for two years.

181
00:13:58,507 --> 00:13:59,548
Now six years have passed.

182
00:13:59,948 --> 00:14:01,467
It's pretty normal
to have some minor issues.

183
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:03,268
No matter what,

184
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:04,627
this unstable facade

185
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:05,987
is caused by the glass material.

186
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:07,827
It must be changed.

187
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,788
Using glass as a replacement for walls?

188
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:12,068
I wonder what the designer
was thinking at that time.

189
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:13,668
It is simply whimsicality.

190
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:19,227
Mr. Su means that these issues

191
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:20,788
have already affected living conditions.

192
00:14:20,908 --> 00:14:21,987
They are not minor issues.

193
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:24,068
He's just trying to help
solve the problem. Right, Mr. Su?

194
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:26,068
Alright, Dr. Zhang.

195
00:14:26,347 --> 00:14:27,268
I have thought it through.

196
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:30,388
We shall use the currently
most popular cyberpunk style.

197
00:14:31,148 --> 00:14:33,347
B-But this is not what I want.

198
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:35,908
Dr. Zhang, can you ask your friend

199
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:36,987
to stop interrupting?

200
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,747
If you're bored,

201
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:40,308
you could go and watch the sea.

202
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:42,948
Well, I didn't have the chance
to introduce him earlier.

203
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:44,987
This is the owner of the house.

204
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:47,107
Qin Yunsheng. You can call him Dr. Qin.

205
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:56,467
Then, Dr. Qin,

206
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:58,308
tell us what you want.

207
00:14:58,587 --> 00:14:59,587
I have one request

208
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:01,352
for this house.

209
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:02,948
I want it adjusted without making

210
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:04,232
big changes.

211
00:15:05,068 --> 00:15:06,587
Are you joking with me?

212
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:08,428
As you can see,

213
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:09,467
there are many problems.

214
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:11,548
It's been six years. It should

215
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:12,668
have been torn down.

216
00:15:13,548 --> 00:15:15,987
To put it plainly, this design
is nothing but beautiful garbage.

217
00:15:17,388 --> 00:15:18,248
Well,

218
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:19,827
can't we give it a try?

219
00:15:22,707 --> 00:15:24,707
If you insist on your request,

220
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:27,148
it will cost you a lot.

221
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,107
Money is not an issue.

222
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:30,388
We will find a way.

223
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:32,467
Because the design of the house
used to be

224
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:33,747
his girlfriend's favorite.

225
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:35,507
So we want to keep the original look.

226
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:38,760
Alright.

227
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:40,227
I can give it a try,

228
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:42,627
but I can't guarantee that it will work.

229
00:15:43,107 --> 00:15:44,068
If it doesn't,

230
00:15:44,548 --> 00:15:46,627
I can also discuss it
with your girlfriend

231
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:47,848
and tell her everything.

232
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:52,148
It was my girlfriend's favorite

233
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:54,148
when she was alive.

234
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:57,672
When she was alive?

235
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:05,627
For this house,

236
00:16:06,987 --> 00:16:08,068
I have another request.

237
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:10,088
Go ahead.

238
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:12,388
I want to see a rainbow every day

239
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:14,987
in this house.

240
00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:16,188
Rainbow?

241
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:18,760
Dr. Qin,

242
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:20,308
are you joking with me?

243
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:22,120
I'm serious.

244
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:24,188
Do you know how outrageous
your request is?

245
00:16:24,587 --> 00:16:25,707
Don't waste my time.

246
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:27,867
You should find the person
who designed this.

247
00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:32,388
Sorry, we are leaving now.

248
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:32,747
Sorry.

249
00:16:32,747 --> 00:16:33,347
Well, wait...

250
00:16:33,347 --> 00:16:33,867
Mr. Su!

251
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:35,016
Mr. Su! Mr. Su!

252
00:16:35,148 --> 00:16:36,040
Mr. Su!

253
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:37,507
Miss Tian.

254
00:16:37,507 --> 00:16:38,388
Please stay, Mr. Zhang.

255
00:16:38,668 --> 00:16:39,528
Mr. Su!

256
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:41,587
Well, I'm really sorry.

257
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:43,308
I brought you all the way for nothing.

258
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:51,560
Bro,

259
00:16:51,788 --> 00:16:53,227
they would think that you are mad.

260
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:55,707
I finally invited
a famous designer over,

261
00:16:56,107 --> 00:16:56,948
and you scared him away.

262
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:59,496
(Play the free fall in the theme park)
Don't be mad about what I'm saying.

263
00:16:59,587 --> 00:17:01,467
What you said is challenging for Mr. Su.

264
00:17:01,627 --> 00:17:03,068
It is simply impossible.

265
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:06,184
(See the rainbow every day)
This is Mi Su's last wish.

266
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:07,588
I want to fulfill it.

267
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:09,868
I know it's Mi Su's wish.

268
00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:11,948
But you are just a doctor.

269
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:13,868
Do you think you can handle

270
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:15,112
what a big designer can't?

271
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:17,987
But he said something

272
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:19,272
that makes sense.

273
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:21,544
What?

274
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,328
(House Design)

275
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:33,672
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

276
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:36,200
Please rest assured.

277
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:37,828
The show is being prepared smoothly.

278
00:17:37,987 --> 00:17:38,987
Shooting will be as planned.

279
00:17:39,707 --> 00:17:41,668
Are you sure? Otherwise,
I will withdraw my investment.

280
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:43,624
Withdraw?

281
00:17:47,547 --> 00:17:49,307
Mr. Zhang,
the reputation of Federal Paint

282
00:17:49,307 --> 00:17:50,868
has been built with the help
of House Design.

283
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:52,787
Isn't it too much
for you to withdraw now?

284
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:54,987
Also, it was us

285
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:57,668
who dug Federal Paint
out of a pile of paint brands.

286
00:17:58,307 --> 00:17:59,747
The plan has been changed many times.

287
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:01,108
Without a budget,

288
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:02,388
how can I find the homeowners?

289
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:05,307
No one wants to be on this show now.

290
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:07,747
Amy asked me to go to her place
the other day.

291
00:18:09,108 --> 00:18:10,027
Are you leaving?

292
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:11,816
I have no choice.

293
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:14,088
I see.

294
00:18:20,936 --> 00:18:21,864
(Incoming call)

295
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:28,547
Hello, who's this?

296
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:30,787
Hello, this is Qin Yunsheng,

297
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:33,787
the homeowner who participated
in your show six years ago.

298
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,072
What do you need?

299
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:38,467
At that time, my glass house by the sea

300
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:40,188
was completed through your show.

301
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:41,672
The glass house?

302
00:18:42,348 --> 00:18:43,668
Yes, it was a design

303
00:18:43,668 --> 00:18:44,628
in the first episode.

304
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:47,067
But now it needs to be renovated,

305
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:48,267
as it has been a while.

306
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:50,348
I want to keep the original design.

307
00:18:50,948 --> 00:18:52,227
I talked to several designers.

308
00:18:52,227 --> 00:18:54,108
But they all think the renovation
is quite difficult.

309
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:55,828
I wonder if your show

310
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,668
can help me find a right designer.

311
00:19:04,668 --> 00:19:05,868
I have learned the general situation

312
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:06,787
of this house.

313
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:08,588
It won't be a problem to fix it.

314
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,227
Since we helped build this house,

315
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:12,467
we will certainly help you

316
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:14,148
solve all the problems.

317
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:15,304
Please rest assured.

318
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:17,188
Thank you very much.

319
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:19,628
Then what about the cost?

320
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:21,227
Don't worry about the cost.

321
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:22,668
We won't charge you a dime.

322
00:19:24,188 --> 00:19:25,948
Are you sure?

323
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:28,868
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

324
00:19:44,027 --> 00:19:45,547
Why are these all buildings for viewing?

325
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:46,787
No practical ones?

326
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:50,307
Ying, these are the only projects
we have so far.

327
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:51,307
There are no others?

328
00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:53,348
There are some,
but they may not fit your positioning.

329
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:54,984
What's my positioning?

330
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:56,227
Wait.

331
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:57,987
Can't I design practical buildings
just because

332
00:19:57,987 --> 00:19:59,348
I'm good at buildings for viewing?

333
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:00,267
You can.

334
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,160
Of course, you can.

335
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:04,148
How did you get so wet?

336
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:07,108
It wasn't raining when I set off.

337
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:08,507
Then it rained cats and dogs

338
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,908
and almost drowned me.

339
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,987
Huixuan, wipe yourself off.

340
00:20:12,148 --> 00:20:13,388
Your hair is wet. Don't catch a cold.

341
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:14,984
Eh...

342
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,232
Thank you.

343
00:20:18,668 --> 00:20:20,148
I'll go get you a hairdryer.

344
00:20:20,747 --> 00:20:21,704
Thank you.

345
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:23,067
This is the first time

346
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:25,267
I knew that our studio even offers
a hair-drying service.

347
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:31,787
I can't have dinner with you after work.

348
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:34,628
I have to rush out
the engineering drawing.

349
00:20:35,188 --> 00:20:36,987
I'm here to discuss
some serious matters with you.

350
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:38,148
Don't even say it.

351
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:39,507
I know what it is.

352
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:40,987
No way. Absolutely no way.

353
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:42,388
I'm not interested in your show.

354
00:20:44,707 --> 00:20:46,747
Why don't you want to join it?

355
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,227
As for tesserae tiles,

356
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:53,307
the owners want me
to arrange them like this.

357
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:58,348
But your show

358
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:02,067
would want me to arrange them like this.

359
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:05,108
It's because they look better this way.

360
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,307
They look great on the screen.

361
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:07,507
Okay, I know

362
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:08,588
they may look better

363
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:09,707
on your screen.

364
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:11,067
But for the owners,

365
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:12,908
this will cost, you know?

366
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:19,828
But that's the difference
between "before" and "after".

367
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:21,828
It's not like that.

368
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:25,307
Please. Just do me
a favor this one time.

369
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:26,747
If this continues,

370
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:29,787
our show might really get canceled.

371
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:32,388
This is a show
I've been doing for six years.

372
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:33,628
If you don't help me this time,

373
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:34,987
you will be stuck with me.

374
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:38,787
Listen to me.

375
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:40,828
I came here to ask you

376
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:42,348
to come on the show

377
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,668
to renovate the glass house.

378
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:45,832
Would you consider it?

379
00:21:46,547 --> 00:21:47,432
The glass house?

380
00:21:57,588 --> 00:21:58,428
Can you cover for me?

381
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:32,188
Didn't you tell the owner before

382
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:33,948
that the glass house
could only last two years?

383
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,628
But it has already persisted
for six years.

384
00:22:36,987 --> 00:22:38,668
It's about time for a good renovation.

385
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:44,188
And the owner begged this time,

386
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:46,908
asking you to do the job.

387
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:49,027
Otherwise, I would never force you.

388
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:53,787
Wait a minute. You said the owner
begged you for me to do the renovation?

389
00:22:55,148 --> 00:22:56,104
Think about it.

390
00:22:57,027 --> 00:22:59,307
It's the glass house
that established your career.

391
00:22:59,307 --> 00:23:00,588
For designers like you,

392
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:02,067
it is like your eldest legitimate son.

393
00:23:02,868 --> 00:23:04,467
Would you bear to hand it over
to a stepmother?

394
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:07,067
What if it ends up unrecognizable
after the renovation?

395
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,227
You haven't seen it
for a long time, right?

396
00:23:10,908 --> 00:23:12,388
Do you know how pitiful it is now?

397
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:14,868
Moisture. Strange smells.

398
00:23:15,348 --> 00:23:17,148
And sometimes it even leaks in the rain.

399
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,668
The exterior facade can't hold itself.

400
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:21,267
Maybe in a few years,

401
00:23:21,588 --> 00:23:23,307
it will no longer exist.

402
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:25,588
Can you really bear

403
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:28,547
to abandon it?

(that beautiful love)

437
00:26:38,227 --> 00:26:39,948
(should maintain
the transparency of glass.)

438
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:41,928
(Clean,)

439
00:26:42,507 --> 00:26:43,400
(pure,)

440
00:26:43,987 --> 00:26:44,936
(and clear.)

441
00:26:45,547 --> 00:26:46,428
(No need to disguise.)

442
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:49,307
(The lovers should treat each other
in the most sincere way.)

443
00:26:50,828 --> 00:26:52,628
(With time's delicate carving,)

444
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:54,908
(love will take on
the most beautiful shape.)

445
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:58,027
(I look forward to having such love.)

446
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:00,348
(But I also know)

447
00:27:01,428 --> 00:27:03,188
(that it is rare.)

448
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:20,040
Thank you.

449
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:22,588
I didn't expect you to come.

450
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:25,828
I just happened to pass by.

451
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:27,388
I didn't expect to see you.

452
00:27:30,588 --> 00:27:32,148
Indeed. Since the glass house was built,

453
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:33,307
I haven't come much.

454
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:34,948
It has been six years.

455
00:27:38,307 --> 00:27:39,267
The design

456
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:40,868
looks great

457
00:27:41,588 --> 00:27:42,547
even now.

458
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:44,707
To be honest,

459
00:27:44,707 --> 00:27:46,588
I'm quite surprised
that this house has managed

460
00:27:48,188 --> 00:27:49,148
to hold up until now.

461
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:52,787
You must have
put a lot of effort into it.

462
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:54,467
I have had a few minor issues.

463
00:27:54,787 --> 00:27:56,027
I just fixed them myself.

464
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:57,908
I don't know how long it can last.

465
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:01,928
I can have a look for you.

466
00:28:02,987 --> 00:28:03,912
Sure.

467
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:11,388
The seaside is quite damp.

468
00:28:11,388 --> 00:28:12,307
Floor is easy to handle.

469
00:28:18,668 --> 00:28:19,868
I can polish the countertop for you

470
00:28:21,348 --> 00:28:23,948
and do some sealing on your sink.

471
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:26,108
When I cook,

472
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:28,227
small flying bugs will fly
around this lamp.

473
00:28:31,388 --> 00:28:32,348
Do you have storage bags?

474
00:28:37,428 --> 00:28:38,348
Insects have compound eyes.

475
00:28:38,588 --> 00:28:39,868
By using water's diffuse reflection,

476
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:41,787
they wouldn't come in.

477
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:42,868
Your biology is not bad.

478
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,108
I'm a doctor.

479
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:46,868
It's makeshift.

480
00:28:47,148 --> 00:28:48,307
I'll get you screen windows.

481
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:49,704
Okay.

482
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:55,908
You also keep plants.

483
00:28:57,227 --> 00:28:58,088
They're blooming nicely.

484
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:06,628
Do you have any special flowers

485
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:07,787
or potted plants that you like?

486
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,640
Tulips.

487
00:29:13,547 --> 00:29:14,948
These are Mi Su's
favorite flowers, right?

488
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:17,512
Yes.

489
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:19,707
The blooming of tulips is short.

490
00:29:20,307 --> 00:29:21,507
It's roughly

491
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:23,027
three to five months.

492
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:30,280
Miss Su.

493
00:29:31,388 --> 00:29:32,296
Miss Su.

494
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,067
How about you have one bulb?

495
00:29:43,027 --> 00:29:44,307
One is enough. Thank you.

496
00:29:51,668 --> 00:29:52,868
The sound of waves is quite loud.

497
00:30:11,668 --> 00:30:12,948
I'll provide a noise reduction plan

498
00:30:13,428 --> 00:30:14,868
to keep it within the standard range.

499
00:30:19,707 --> 00:30:20,707
Dr. Qin,

500
00:30:21,828 --> 00:30:23,467
why do you want
to renovate the glass house?

501
00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:30,188
It's because

502
00:30:31,588 --> 00:30:33,148
if we don't do certain things now,

503
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:35,668
we may not have the chance
to do them later.

504
00:30:37,307 --> 00:30:39,787
This was a favorite place of Mi Su
when she was alive.

505
00:30:40,747 --> 00:30:43,148
Although there are some regrets,

506
00:30:43,948 --> 00:30:45,628
I still want to protect it for her.

507
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,507
Dr. Qin, are you satisfied
with the glass house?

508
00:31:03,108 --> 00:31:04,040
Yes, I am.

509
00:31:04,547 --> 00:31:06,747
Then why did you come back
to House Design?

510
00:31:07,507 --> 00:31:08,707
I want to renovate it.

511
00:31:10,027 --> 00:31:11,148
Do you like the glass house?

512
00:31:12,067 --> 00:31:13,948
Yes, I do. It's really beautiful.

513
00:31:14,987 --> 00:31:15,912
What else?

514
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:18,787
I can also see the sea
when I wake up every morning.

515
00:31:19,267 --> 00:31:20,136
That makes me happy.

516
00:31:20,987 --> 00:31:22,227
But the house is by the sea.

517
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:23,707
Won't it be very damp?

518
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,376
It's okay.

519
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:29,428
The whole house is made of glass.

520
00:31:29,628 --> 00:31:31,707
Will it be cold in winter
and hot in summer?

521
00:31:33,547 --> 00:31:35,227
Aren't all houses the same?

522
00:31:35,668 --> 00:31:36,547
I use air conditioning.

523
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:40,027
Any flaws with the glass house?

524
00:31:41,388 --> 00:31:42,628
Can I not answer this question?

525
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:45,628
Cut. It's enough.

526
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:53,948
Thank you for coming, Dr. Qin.

527
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:55,707
I'm leaving

528
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:57,108
the glass house to you.

529
00:31:58,108 --> 00:31:59,668
Actually, the glass house is significant

530
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:02,108
not only for you
but also for the entire show crew.

531
00:32:02,747 --> 00:32:03,787
We will integrate

532
00:32:03,908 --> 00:32:04,868
all our design resources

533
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:06,148
to meet your requirements

534
00:32:06,668 --> 00:32:08,628
and do our best to renovate

535
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:09,668
our shared work.

536
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:16,360
She is here.

537
00:32:19,588 --> 00:32:21,108
