=Episode 12=

17
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:57,818
Mr. Yang, the cases handed over
to the SU Design Firm

18
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:58,818
have officially started.

19
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:00,419
Got it.

20
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:02,618
But they put someone named Mingshi

21
00:02:02,738 --> 00:02:03,939
in charge of communication with us.

22
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:06,280
Mingshi?

23
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:07,464
Yes.

24
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:11,579
Forget it. You go ahead. I'll handle it.

25
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:12,680
Yes.

26
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:38,312
What a temptation at this hour.

27
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:41,218
Smelling the aroma,
I came down from upstairs.

28
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:42,379
Just in time.

29
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:43,240
What are you making?

30
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:44,296
Taste it. It's wonton.

31
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:48,456
Such a treat. Let me try it.

32
00:02:50,898 --> 00:02:51,784
Is it cooked yet?

33
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,699
It's cooked. It's good.

34
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:54,696
Okay.

35
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,738
Let me tell you.
Add a bit more vinegar, sesame oil

36
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:01,859
seaweed and dried shrimp,
and it'd be more delicious.

37
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:02,792
You really know how to eat.

38
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:06,579
Since we live upstairs and downstairs,
we don't need a warming box, right?

39
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:07,688
I'm afraid it may get cold.

40
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:09,058
It won't.

41
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,218
You're too courteous.

42
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:13,498
Thank you, buddy,

43
00:03:13,738 --> 00:03:15,058
for cooking wontons for me now.

44
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,299
Having a buddy like you
is a blessing from my last life.

45
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,618
It's just what I should do.

46
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:20,738
You don't have to be so polite.

47
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,658
Could you get that bag for me?

48
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:26,024
Put it inside for me.

49
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:28,218
We don't need a bag, right?

50
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:29,458
For convenience. Do it.

51
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:30,859
Okay, as you wish.

52
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:33,672
Great, you're so thoughtful.

53
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:36,104
Done.

54
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:38,819
- Give it to me.
- I can take it.

55
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,752
Why are you so polite?

56
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,299
Where are you going?

57
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:49,864
Wait.

58
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:52,338
I was helping you test if it was cooked?

59
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,419
Tempting me in the middle of the night.

60
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:58,024
Come in.

61
00:03:58,898 --> 00:04:00,938
Ying, Mr. Yang is here for you.

62
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,096
Let him come in, please.

63
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:06,888
Please.

64
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:09,544
Still working?

65
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:11,112
It's so late.

66
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:13,379
Yes, I just finished dinner
and was passing by.

67
00:04:14,408 --> 00:04:16,658
My assistant told me
you'd made progress in the cafe case,

68
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:17,736
so I came to chat with you.

69
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:20,298
I packed some sushi for you
as a late-night snack.

70
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:22,658
Thanks, I'm not hungry yet.

71
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,376
Well.

72
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:28,538
I have some questions to ask you.

73
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:30,440
Wait a second.

74
00:04:31,432 --> 00:04:32,418
Distribute it to everyone.

75
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:33,352
Okay.

76
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:34,059
So much.

77
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:34,538
Let's eat.

78
00:04:34,538 --> 00:04:35,059
Thank you.

79
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:35,619
Thank you.

80
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:37,512
Here.

81
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:39,298
The smell is so good.

82
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:41,864
What is it?

83
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,379
The recent cases I took on

84
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:52,179
were all endorsed
by Tiandi Building Materials Corp.

85
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:54,139
Is it just a coincidence?

86
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:56,259
Whether in terms of economic interests

87
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:58,298
or project quality,

88
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,538
our group hopes to cooperate
with the top design teams.

89
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,858
In my eyes, you are the top-notch.

90
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:07,139
You're usually so busy.

91
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:09,579
Do you need to be personally involved?

92
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,458
We can communicate directly

93
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:12,858
to avoid middlemen.

94
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,778
And you know I don't like wasting time.

95
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:19,976
Is there any problem?

96
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:24,104
No.

97
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:25,768
Don't overthink.

98
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:26,984
It's just that...

99
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:31,499
Alright, I'll do my best.

100
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:37,288
I'll leave you alone.

101
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:41,320
Remember to eat.

102
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:43,752
- Mr. Yang.
- Let's leave.

103
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:12,168
Let's go.

104
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:26,059
You made this?

105
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:26,920
Taste it.

106
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:43,298
Is it good?

107
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:44,200
Yes.

108
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,536
That's good. Here you are.

109
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:50,939
Dr. Qin, how many surprises do you have
that I don't know about?

110
00:06:51,298 --> 00:06:52,338
You'll find out eventually.

111
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:57,139
Let me report it to you.

112
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:00,059
Yang Zhengwen was here just now.

113
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,499
Was it about Subing again?

114
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:04,778
He came for our cooperation
in building materials.

115
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:06,792
Again?

116
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:11,880
Are you angry?

117
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,616
I was joking. Eat.

118
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:21,098
Thirsty? I'll get you some water.

119
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,418
Just a small matter.

120
00:07:38,898 --> 00:07:41,019
Was it necessary for him
to make the trip himself?

121
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:42,408
He's quite considerate.

122
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:45,338
This isn't the first time, is it?

123
00:07:46,338 --> 00:07:48,619
I suspect there's something
between him and Ying.

124
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:50,538
I bet there's something more
to their relationship.

125
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:54,184
What do you think of him?

126
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:56,338
From what I can tell,

127
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:58,504
I haven't interacted
with him much, but I think

128
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:01,288
he's handsome, considerate,
and, most importantly...

129
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:02,179
And what?

130
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:03,739
He even brought us sushi!

131
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:07,298
And from a rather expensive restaurant.

132
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:10,499
Imagine, a high-level executive
coming over to discuss work

133
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,098
and bringing so much food for us.

134
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:14,139
What a thoughtful, caring person!

135
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:16,658
He must be pursuing Ying.

136
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:21,499
The main point is
that he should match with her.

137
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:25,139
That's true. Compatibility
is of utmost importance.

138
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:27,778
Hurry and eat. We still have work to do.

Why didn't you go home?

152
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:10,938
What if you catch a cold sleeping here?

153
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:12,739
You did not drive today.

154
00:10:13,658 --> 00:10:15,298
I can't let you go home alone this late.

155
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:17,800
Get in the car.

156
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:36,019
I don't know what flavor you prefer,

157
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:37,256
so I bought a lot.

158
00:10:37,658 --> 00:10:38,536
Pack them all up.

159
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:48,739
But I've already had
too much sugar today.

160
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:51,979
Let me taste it.

161
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:03,400
It's quite sweet.

162
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:05,672

Huixuan,

175
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:03,139
what's the matter?
You don't seem too cheerful.

176
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:07,259
It's nothing, just a keyboard warrior
giving me a hard time online.

177
00:12:07,538 --> 00:12:09,178
There's an abundance
of such trolls online.

178
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,264
Why get mad at them? It's not worth it.

179
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:15,418
Can you believe someone
questioned my taste?

180
00:12:15,898 --> 00:12:17,219
Is he nuts?

181
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:19,219
Your taste is absolutely impeccable.

182
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:22,259
Otherwise, why would you bring me
on board for this extra episode?

183
00:12:23,418 --> 00:12:24,818
It's your project that we sought out.

If you want my project,
doesn't that mean you want me?

185
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:32,019
All right, stop blowing your own horn.

186
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:35,698
Before filming the extra episode,
I need to do a pre-interview with you.

187
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:38,219
Okay, interview as you wish.

188
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,818
After it is over, how about
I take you to eat something good?

189
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:42,379
Okay, let's get started.

190
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:43,336
Alright.

191
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:45,499
May I ask your opinion

192
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,058
on the Galaxy Bay project this time?

193
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,016
Spicy hot pot.

194
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:00,938
It's the place you took me to last time.

195
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,698
How did you know
I was craving it? Thank you.

196
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:05,864
I've created a new sauce. Try it out.

197
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:09,499
It definitely isn't as good
as my secret recipe.

198
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:13,619
Good?

199
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:15,938
If there is a carbonated drink now,

200
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:17,418
I couldn't be happier.

201
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:23,720
How thoughtful.

202
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:25,224
Try it now.

203
00:13:29,898 --> 00:13:31,499
Bro, it's not enough.

204
00:13:31,698 --> 00:13:34,339
The love-filled wontons you made
yesterday didn't move Su Ying at all.

205
00:13:34,658 --> 00:13:35,499
It was better to give me.

206
00:13:36,219 --> 00:13:37,859
Who told you that? She ate them all.

207
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:39,176
Really?

208
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:40,808
That's not right.

209
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:43,298
Usually, when a boyfriend does
something romantically impressive,

210
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:46,058
his girlfriend will immediately
post about it on her Moments.

211
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:47,298
But Su Ying didn't do it.

212
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:48,936
None of your business.

213
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:50,658
Did she block me?

214
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:52,418
You remind me to do it.

215
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:53,979
No, no, don't.

216
00:13:54,898 --> 00:13:56,058
As your best friend,

217
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,298
shouldn't I want the whole world
to know how happy you are?

218
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,019
With you around,
how could others not know?

219
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,698
Are you praising me or mocking me?

220
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:06,298
Does Su Ying have a friend
as warm-hearted as me?

221
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:11,624
See?

222
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,339
(Hot pot date tonight.)
It's a date.

223
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:16,418
What do you know?

224
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,459
Who hasn't been in a relationship?

225
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:22,739
Let me tell you. Once Bai comes back,
I will start dating too.

226
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:50,938
(Yang Zhengwen)
(I'll be out on business this weekend.)

227
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:52,418
(So for the next few days,)

228
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:54,259
(we need to discuss the plan together.)

229
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:59,656
(And the deadline for the first draft
must be moved up to tomorrow. Sorry.)

230
00:15:03,658 --> 00:15:04,584
(Su Ying)
(No problem.)

231
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:19,418
(Su Ying)
(Our dinner has to be rescheduled due to work.)

232
00:15:25,178 --> 00:15:27,219
(Qin Yunsheng)
(Alright, we can postpone it.)

233
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:39,784
(Qin Yunsheng)
(Finished?)

234
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,224
(Remember to have dinner.)

235
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:42,920
(Go to bed early.)

236
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:44,104

Thank you, Dr. Qin.

248
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:33,736
Thanks.

249
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:38,298
It will take long today.
Don't wait for me.

250
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,219
It's okay.

251
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:40,619
No, it's too late.

you won't get enough sleep.

00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:54,739

00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,219
Don't you find my taste poor?

273
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:12,899
Why are you asking for updates now?

274
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:17,928
(Fight Hard to Win)
Not in the mood.

275
00:18:18,696 --> 00:18:19,624

(Crazy Quet)
(Actually, you're quite excellent)

277
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:28,578
(and have your own style.)

278
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:31,298
(You just need to improve
on a few small things.)

279
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:32,680
(I'm sure you'll succeed.)

280
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:34,824
(So, please don't give up.)

281
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:40,298
(Fight Hard to Win)
Any advice?

282
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:43,459
Please give me some guidance.

283
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:45,298
How?

284
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:52,298
(Crazy Quet)
Stick to your own creations.

285
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:54,216
(Don't repost.)

286
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:55,739
(Unify the video style.)

287

(Make it professional.)

288
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:00,138
"Just a few small things"?

289
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:03,459
Are you misunderstanding what it means?

290
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:11,298
- Follow up on this, Mingshi.
- Okay.

291
00:19:11,298 --> 00:19:13,179
The lighting for the cafe is listed.
Please have a look.

292
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:21,288
(Qin Yunsheng)
(When are you free?)

293
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,499
Send it to my office
after it's printed, Chen.

294
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:28,904
Yes.

295
00:19:31,578 --> 00:19:32,488
Come in.

296
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:53,979
Dr. Qin.

297
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:01,960
Why are you here?

298
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,338
Don't you want me to come?

299
00:20:04,818 --> 00:20:05,858
Didn't you say you were busy?

300
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:09,378
No matter how busy I am,
I must come to see you.

301
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:12,019
Didn't you say
you were taking me for hot pot?

302
00:20:12,618 --> 00:20:13,512
Have you finished work?

303
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:19,208
Yes.

304
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:21,128
Let's go then.

305
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:23,432
Let's go.

306
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:39,112
Hello.

307
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:43,578
Miss Su, the wood board sample
you wanted has arrived here.

308
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,899
Do you want to come over and confirm?

309
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:47,739
Alright, I'll let Mingshi go over.

310
00:20:48,098 --> 00:20:49,499
I think you'd better come in person.

311
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:52,578
There's a bit of color difference
between the sample and the one you want.

312
00:20:52,578 --> 00:20:54,778
If there's a problem,
I can have them change it overnight.

313
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:56,744
That is more efficient. Don't you think?

314
00:20:58,184 --> 00:20:59,098
B-But I'm...

315
00:20:59,098 --> 00:20:59,944
Thank you for your time.

316
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:04,648
Hello.

317
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:09,864
What's wrong?

318
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:12,298
Can you go to a place with me?

319
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,939
We can discuss this project
in detail with Mr. Ye later.

320
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:17,320
Okay.

321
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:19,144
Miss Su.

322
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:24,298
Hello again, Dr. Qin.

323
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,419
Hello again.

324
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:29,538
Let's talk in my office.

325
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:30,858
The sample has arrived.

326
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:32,328
Okay, let's go.

327
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:33,899
Let's go together.

328
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:35,019
You go. I'll wait here.

329
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:42,578
Take a look.

330
00:21:42,578 --> 00:21:44,298
Because the actual product

331
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:46,419
is a bit different in color
from the picture given.

332
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:48,618
Confirm which color you actually want.

333
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:51,432
There is a color difference.

334
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,338
Can I see the color value used?

335
00:21:58,298 --> 00:21:59,176
Here you are.

336
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:00,296
Thank you.

337
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:04,179
Because there is
a water view in the cafe,

338
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:06,778
I suggest you consider
using layer boards.

339
00:22:07,298 --> 00:22:08,899
They're damp-proof
and environmentally friendly.

340
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:12,739
So the cafe can open right
after the renovation to save costs.

341
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,392
Your company's layer boards are good.
Do you have information about them?

342
00:22:20,699 --> 00:22:21,659
Yes. Please wait a moment.

343
00:22:22,778 --> 00:22:23,778
Take a look.

344
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:26,818
These are some of the samples
that we've received recently.

345
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:28,979
Which one do you like to use?

346
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:35,739
These are the products.

347
00:22:57,818 --> 00:22:59,338
(Su Ying)
(Sorry, can you wait a bit longer?)

348
00:23:03,778 --> 00:23:04,680
Miss Su.

349
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:07,624
Okay.

350
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:09,608
Okay.

351
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:25,298
Feeling unhappy?

352
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,378
Are you jealous?

353
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:35,368
No.

354
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:39,338
Then it's a lack of sugar.

355
00:23:51,618 --> 00:23:52,699
I didn't expect the candies

356
00:23:52,818 --> 00:23:55,338
that you put in my bag to be so useful.

357
00:23:56,578 --> 00:23:57,480
Is it sweet?

358
00:23:58,899 --> 00:23:59,752
It's alright.

359
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:01,818
It's alright.

360
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,459
Then it's not sweet enough.

361
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:25,739
Now it's sweet.

362
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,104
(Turning left

369
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,778
Mr. Yang, the representative
of the charity auction wants to see you.

370
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:32,019
You can receive them. I don't have time.

371
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:34,578
It's the cardiothoracic surgeon,
Qin Yunsheng.

372
00:25:39,098 --> 00:25:39,976
Let him in, please.

373
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,416
Yes.

374
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:52,899
Dr. Qin, sorry.
I'm handling some business.

375
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:54,952
Feel free to sit. What's it?

376
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:59,338
I'm here to deliver the certificate
on behalf of the hospital.

377
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:02,818
Just this little thing? Just let me know
and I'll have someone go take it.

378
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:03,976
Leave it there. Thank you.

379
00:26:08,939 --> 00:26:11,979
Thank you, Mr. Yang,
for your support for our event.

380
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:14,019
It's our duty to do good deeds.

381
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:18,376
Speaking of which,

382
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:20,618
Dr. Qin, it seems

383
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:22,659
that you took a lot

384
00:26:23,219 --> 00:26:24,168
I really liked.

385
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:31,659
I also really like the lot.

386
00:26:35,098 --> 00:26:35,939
Here's the thing.

387
00:26:37,538 --> 00:26:40,058
It was my personal negligence

388
00:26:41,338 --> 00:26:42,338
that I missed it,

389
00:26:43,858 --> 00:26:45,459
resulting in it ending up in your hands.

390
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:50,538
If you don't mind,

391
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:52,699
I hope you can give it back to me.

392
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,298
You name your terms.

393
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:00,259
You should know

394
00:27:01,058 --> 00:27:01,979
some things,

395
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:04,259
once missed,

396
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:06,058
can never be regained.

397
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:11,298
Su Ying is now my girlfriend.

398
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:13,416
I think

399
00:27:14,578 --> 00:27:16,138
you are a decent person,

400
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:18,818
so you probably know

401
00:27:19,818 --> 00:27:21,219
how to keep an appropriate distance

402
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:23,098
from my girlfriend.

403
00:27:35,499 --> 00:27:38,179
Mr. Yang, here's the last meeting record
about Seaview Garden.

404
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:40,264
I'll just put it here.

405
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:46,632
And the plan for the investigation
of the garden has been released.

406
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,008
Do you want to have a look?

407
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:51,699
What's Miss Su's plan recently?

408
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:55,179
She will go to the cafe site on Monday.

409
00:27:58,444 --> 00:27:59,564
(Donation Certificate)

410
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:04,392
Ye.

411
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:07,219
The surveyor's measurement
is slightly off.

412
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:09,338
Next time, we must verify
it ourselves in advance.

413
00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:10,632
Yes.

414
00:28:11,378 --> 00:28:13,858
You really do everything yourself.

415
00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:15,058
Hello, Mr. Yang.

416
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:16,008
Okay.

417
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:18,419
Sweating over such a small project?

418
00:28:18,578 --> 00:28:19,419
I made the right choice.

419
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:21,138
We've signed the contract,

420
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:23,338
so whether it's a minor or major case,
it's the same to me.

421
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:25,704
Aren't you the same?

422
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:28,899
I'm different. I was just passing by.

423
00:28:30,858 --> 00:28:33,138
Today, my office was too stuffy,
so I went out for some fresh air.

424
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,899
Miss Cao Xiaoye,
please receive your delivery.

425
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:37,832
I'm coming.

426
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:40,459
The goods have arrived.
I'll give her a hand.

427
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:45,288
Let me help you.

428
00:28:47,578 --> 00:28:48,499
It's all here, right?

429
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:49,179
Yes, it's all here.

430
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:50,499
Alright. Will you deliver tomorrow too?

431
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:51,138
Yes, that's right.

432
00:28:51,138 --> 00:28:52,179
Give it to me. Let me help you.

433
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,098
No need. I can do it myself.

434
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:55,459
Don't. It's heavy.

435
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:56,659
It's fine.

436
00:28:56,659 --> 00:28:57,576
Come on, give it to me.

437
00:28:57,739 --> 00:28:58,696
Give it to me.

438
00:29:02,338 --> 00:29:03,298
Why are you here?

439
00:29:04,098 --> 00:29:05,032
To pick you up after work.

440
00:29:20,778 --> 00:29:22,179
Mr. Yang, how about...?

441
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:25,160
I'll do it myself.

442
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:40,459
What a coincidence.

443
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:44,456
Yes, what a coincidence.

444
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,179
As a manager, why aren't you at work
but moving boxes here instead?

445
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:48,776
Is business bad?

446
00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:52,019
Why aren't you working
in the hospital? No patients?

447
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,138
That'd be a good thing.

448
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:56,699
Alright, I'm done here.

449
00:29:57,219 --> 00:29:58,120
You're off work now?

450
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:00,739
Ye, I'll leave it to you.

451
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:01,608
Yes.

452
00:30:02,618 --> 00:30:03,818
Mr. Yang, thank you for your work.

453
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:05,896
Let's go.

454
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:08,648
Let's go.

455
00:30:14,618 --> 00:30:15,858
Hello, your delivery has arrived.

456
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:17,224
Just leave it there.

457
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:19,259
Sir, you can take this packed one.

458
00:30:24,298 --> 00:30:25,459
Could you grab me a ruler?

459
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:28,168
Here.

460
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:30,824
Take a note.

461
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:33,979
The length is 70.

462
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:37,179
The width is 15.

463
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:38,818
15.

464
00:30:38,818 --> 00:30:40,699
These two samples need
to be taken back and redone.

465
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:43,592
Why are you here?

466
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:45,219
I just greeted you.

467
00:30:46,699 --> 00:30:48,858
Sorry, I've been too busy.

468
00:30:48,858 --> 00:30:51,208
It's okay. I bought you some food.
You should eat something.

469
00:30:51,338 --> 00:30:52,259
Spicy hot pot.

470
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:53,224
I know you.

471
00:30:53,538 --> 00:30:55,219
But I still have
a lot of work unfinished.

472
00:30:55,578 --> 00:30:57,416
No worries. Go eat. I will help you.

473
00:30:58,098 --> 00:30:59,944
Let's eat together later.

474
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:19,459
Did you go to see
Yang Zhengwen yesterday?

475
00:31:20,456 --> 00:31:24,040
Yeah, I delivered the certificate
of the charity event to him

476
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:25,544
and said a few words to him.

477
00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:27,944
A few words? What were the words?

478
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:31,259
Of course I had to say a few words
of thanks for such a large donation.

479
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:36,219
I thought I was the only one
who received the certificate from you.

480
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:37,739
Yes, you were.

481
00:31:38,138 --> 00:31:40,219
But didn't you personally deliver it
to Yang Zhengwen too?

482
00:31:40,219 --> 00:31:41,192
That was different.

483
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:42,378
What was different about it?

484
00:31:43,378 --> 00:31:44,699
I was trying to get him away from you.

485
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:21,338
I think old urban houses like this...

486
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:22,184
Tian Mei,

487
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:24,378
don't answer me so soon.

488
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:27,939
What I value more

489
00:32:28,338 --> 00:32:29,538
is the attitude of solving problems.

490
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:31,880
Take your time and think about it.

491
00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:35,659
I will prove it to you.

492
00:32:49,644 --> 00:32:52,204
(Garden Road No. 123)

493
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:53,320
Miss Su,

494
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:55,179
this is the question you gave me.

495
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:57,019
I've made these three plans. Please.

496
00:32:58,778 --> 00:32:59,618
You did it so quickly.

497
00:33:02,378 --> 00:33:03,304
Go ahead.

498
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:05,704
The first plan.

499
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:08,219
I'll do functional zoning
based on the original layout

500
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:11,699
and segregate the activity areas
of their elder and the child by stairs.

501
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,578
The advantage
of the plan is its privacy.

502
00:33:16,939 --> 00:33:17,928
The second plan.

503
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:21,538
Their elder returns to their hometown
once the child starts elementary school.

504
00:33:21,939 --> 00:33:24,098
So I plan to use his room

505
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:26,179
as a connection
between the living room and the bedroom.

506
00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:28,058
The advantage of the plan is

507
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,259
that it makes the house look bigger.

508
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:32,179
And the third plan

509
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:34,699
is to reduce the space
of the master bedroom

510
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:37,378
and the living and dining rooms.

511
00:33:37,778 --> 00:33:40,456
These are my thoughts on the house.

512
00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:49,618
Miss Su, what do you think?

513
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:54,984
It's well thought-out.

514
00:33:56,138 --> 00:33:57,259
The plans are comprehensive.

515
00:33:58,098 --> 00:33:59,179
I can see your sincerity.

516
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,419
Welcome to our team.

517
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:09,768
Thank you, Miss Su.

518
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:16,578
When you're basking
in the brilliant sunlight...

519
00:34:17,058 --> 00:34:19,656
Everyone, let's put our work
on hold for a moment

520
00:34:20,138 --> 00:34:21,899
and welcome our new colleague, Tian Mei.

521
00:34:23,178 --> 00:34:24,098
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

522
00:34:24,098 --> 00:34:24,939
Welcome.

523
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:27,299
Take care of each other
and help each other out in the future.

524
00:34:28,178 --> 00:34:29,499
Hello, I'm Mingshi.

525
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,538
I'm Ye.

526
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:31,432
I'm Chen.

527
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:33,419
Hello, just call me Tian Mei.

528
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:34,600
Hello.

529
00:34:35,258 --> 00:34:36,232
Thank you, Miss Su.

530
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:39,299
Just call her Ying like us.

531
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:41,379
She doesn't like it
when employees call her Miss Su.

532
00:34:41,738 --> 00:34:42,578
Or anything else.

533
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:47,538
I'll start calling you Ying like them.

534
00:34:49,538 --> 00:34:51,019
Mingshi, send the cases we have taken

535
00:34:51,178 --> 00:34:53,019
to Tian Mei to choose.

536
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,178
Okay.

537
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:55,618
We can choose our own cases?

538
00:34:56,008 --> 00:34:57,859
Of course, interest is the best teacher.

539
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:00,424
It's so lively here.

540
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:02,499
Hello.

541
00:35:02,499 --> 00:35:03,459
- Mr. Yang.
- Mr. Yang.

542
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:06,216
I was just...

543
00:35:06,216 --> 00:35:07,176
Passing by.

544
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:08,776
Yes.

545
00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:10,939
I want to follow your progress

546
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:12,578
for more effective communication.

547
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:16,218
Let's talk inside.

548
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:17,128
Okay.

549
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:18,600
Mingshi, arrange it.

550
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:22,738
Choose from these.

551
00:35:22,819 --> 00:35:24,339
Here's the spa card
I mentioned last time.

552
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:26,899
It can make your skin bouncy.

553
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:28,904
Here you are.

554
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:31,738
Mr. Liu, are you going to ask me
about the collaboration

555
00:35:31,979 --> 00:35:33,578
with SU over the extra episode?

556
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:35,688
How clever.

557
00:35:36,419 --> 00:35:38,218
They've agreed and it is in progress.

558
00:35:38,218 --> 00:35:39,208
Great.

559
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:40,698
Our sponsor is very concerned

560
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:42,859
about our collaboration
with SU on the extra episode.

561
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:44,618
I'll meet with Assistant Li for lunch.

562
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:48,379
Can we get the plan out
as soon as possible?

563
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,920
Shouldn't we wait until the next meeting
to hammer it out?

564
00:35:51,339 --> 00:35:53,658
Look, you don't know
the rules of the world.

565
00:35:54,459 --> 00:35:55,400
Leave it to me.

566
00:35:56,098 --> 00:35:58,698
We have to have a meal and build
a good relationship first, right?

567
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,779
Then I will give some hints
about the future sponsorship.

568
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:04,218
Alright, I will hurry.

569
00:36:04,218 --> 00:36:06,408
(House Design)
Good.

570
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:08,840
Come on!

571
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:11,859
Okay, I will sort it out
and give you a new plan.

572
00:36:12,058 --> 00:36:13,032
Alright, no problem.

573
00:36:14,058 --> 00:36:14,979
It's just time for lunch.

574
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:16,819
I booked a restaurant nearby.

575
00:36:16,936 --> 00:36:18,939
I'll treat everyone
to a meal as a reward, okay?

576
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:20,899
- Great.
- Great.

577
00:36:22,618 --> 00:36:23,464
You don't need to do it.

578
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:26,098
It's okay. I just read the plan,
and everyone did a great job.

579
00:36:26,538 --> 00:36:27,939
Always eating takeaway is not good.

580
00:36:28,058 --> 00:36:29,138
Consider it a reward for you.

581
00:36:29,618 --> 00:36:30,536
We need to rush the plan.

582
00:36:30,779 --> 00:36:31,698
It's just nearby.

583
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:32,819
It won't influence your work.

584
00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:33,736
Dr. Qin.

585
00:36:33,736 --> 00:36:34,600
The meeting's over?

586
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:37,992
It's just finished.

587
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:43,738
Yes, we just finished it,

588
00:36:43,738 --> 00:36:45,379
and we are going to have a meal nearby.

589
00:36:46,058 --> 00:36:49,019
Would you like to join us?

590
00:36:51,138 --> 00:36:52,104
Sure.

591
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:53,896
I'd like to.

592
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:01,339
Alright, let's go
to the Japanese restaurant nearby.

593
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:02,280
No Japanese food.

594
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,979
Su Ying can't eat raw food these days.

595
00:37:11,538 --> 00:37:13,258
I know a pretty good restaurant.

596
00:37:25,258 --> 00:37:26,939
Oh, right. It suddenly occurred to me

597
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:28,618
that a batch
of materials would arrive soon.

598
00:37:29,138 --> 00:37:30,419
I might have to stay.

599
00:37:31,138 --> 00:37:33,859
I'm on a diet and I don't eat
dinner lately, so I can't go.

600
00:37:34,738 --> 00:37:37,098
I-I-I had too many snacks
this afternoon, and I'm not hungry yet.

601
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:38,258
I'll sort out the files.

602
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:40,058
I...

603
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,538
Could you review this document for me?

604
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:59,178
Do you think the dishes are enough,
or should we order a bit more?

605
00:37:59,379 --> 00:38:01,899
No need. Su Ying doesn't like
being extravagant and wasteful.

606
00:38:02,312 --> 00:38:03,240
That's enough.

607
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:05,299
Then let's eat.

608
00:38:07,138 --> 00:38:08,072
Let's eat.

609
00:38:10,618 --> 00:38:12,658
The shrimps look pretty good
and quite fresh.

610
00:38:20,138 --> 00:38:21,178
You both want to eat shrimps?

611
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:32,698
Look, it's already shelled.

612
00:38:34,138 --> 00:38:34,979
You learned so quickly.

613
00:38:35,459 --> 00:38:36,299
You're a good teacher.

614
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:45,192
Try some of the pork knuckle.

615
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:47,538
You love it, don't you?

616
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:50,738
T-T-This is too oily.

617
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:54,408
Let's eat some vegetables
for their freshness.

618
00:38:55,779 --> 00:38:56,872
Scrambled eggs and tomatoes.

619
00:38:57,979 --> 00:38:59,138
She likes it homemade.

620
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:00,552
How about okra?

621
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:02,779
Large intestines, your favorite.

622
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:03,752
Okra is good.

623
00:39:04,098 --> 00:39:05,578
No, she prefers intestines.

624
00:39:05,578 --> 00:39:06,536
Okra.

625
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:08,456
Intestines.

626
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:25,899
I'm going to the restroom.

627
00:39:43,578 --> 00:39:45,859
Miss Su, drink a bit. This wine is good.

628
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:48,168
Su Ying can only drink water.
She can't have alcohol.

629
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:53,448
Can you have a little?

630
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:55,779
He doesn't usually drink.

631
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:58,419
Is that so? Dr. Qin, seems like
you're not up to the task.

632
00:40:01,939 --> 00:40:04,019
It is rare that you are
in such high spirits.

633
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,144
We can have a little.

634
00:40:07,258 --> 00:40:09,218
And it doesn't matter
how often you drink.

635
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:10,859
It depends on the enzymes in our bodies.

636
00:40:11,138 --> 00:40:14,058
That's okay.
You don't have to force yourself.

637
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,019
No means no.

638
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:17,928
Let's have a small sip.

639
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:19,144
Okay.

640
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:22,792
Can you handle it?

641
00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:23,859
Don't worry.

642
00:40:36,904 --> 00:40:37,819
How do we start it?

643
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:38,728
I'll follow you.

644
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:40,264
Okay.

645
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:02,632
Take another sip.

646
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:05,218
You drank a lot.

647
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,779
Mr. Yang, I will send you
the plan tomorrow.

648
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:14,792
Do you feel uncomfortable?

649
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,218
Mr. Yang, are you okay?

650
00:41:17,939 --> 00:41:19,299
You can't drink this much anymore.

651
00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:26,376
Be careful.

652
00:41:38,218 --> 00:41:39,112
