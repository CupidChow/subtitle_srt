00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,860
I remember I left something
in Dr. Qin's room.

190
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,176
I need to look for it.

191
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,059
Let me help you.

192
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:18,419
Yunsheng's things have been moved.

193
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,980
There are some sundries in that cabinet.

194
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:22,020
I'll go find it for you.

195
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,539
It's okay.
I'm looking for a small thing.

196
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:25,768
Let me find it myself.

197
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,299
You can do your things.

198
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,860
I want to stay here for a while.

199
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,432
Well, I'll help you look for it.

200
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:39,048
I'll take a video call.

201
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,939
If the oil stain is not handled in time,

202
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,160
it will leave traces.

203
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,256
This is my dormitory.

204
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:33,819
The seller said
this is suitable for all ages.

205
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,659
Don't underestimate this maze.

206
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,579
It's very challenging.

207
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,380
If you can figure it out,

208
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,699
I promise you a wish.

209
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,048
Thank you.

210
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:02,952
Bai.

211
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,992
How are you doing there?

212
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,220
I'm pretty good. I've adapted.

213
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:09,640
Drink more water.

214
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,340
Take care of yourself.

215
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:14,179
It is important to slow down and rest.

216
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,579
Don't work so hard.

217
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,304
Su Ying.

218
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,140
Mi Bai.

219
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,059
Su Ying.

220
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:25,899
How are you doing?

221
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,500
I'm doing well.

222
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,568
Good.

223
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,179
How about Dr. Qin?

224
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,980
Yunsheng is also fine, right?

225
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,152
I'm glad you are well.

226
00:16:38,152 --> 00:16:39,059
Don't you have work to do?

227
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,140
You do your work. I have to go.

228
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
She is really busy.

229
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:46,020
Let's not disturb her.

230
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,344
Are you leaving?
Let me see you off.

231
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:52,659
No, you don't have to.

232
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,179
See you.

233
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,619
She found out?

234
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,819
No. I was worried.

235
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:11,900
Until when did you plan to hide this?

236
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,460
I am almost ready.

237
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,700
I need to hurry.

238
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,096
Hurry up.

239
00:17:18,764 --> 00:17:19,940
(Garden Road No. 123)

240
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,696
Jiang Dong's project is almost completed
and going smoothly.

241
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,700
And the rural hospital

242
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,099
has officially begun construction.

243
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,379
Everything is going smoothly.

244
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:29,619
We have some new projects.

245
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,819
Ying, check them out.

246
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:37,512
Not interested.

247
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,579
A private estate project?

248
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:45,500
Is it Mr. Chi's project?

249
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,660
That estate is in Germany.
We need to survey on site.

250
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:54,059
The communication cost is high.

251
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:55,496
Germany?

252
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,460
We need face-to-face talks?

253
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,944
Well...

254
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,339
I just remembered.

255
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,859
We once

256
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,740
handled a similar project before.

257
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:06,440
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

258
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,980
Considering the current development
of our firm,

259
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,048
this project is not good.
We should...

260
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,136
I'll go.

261
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:14,536
No. It's too far.

262
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,660
We have other work to do.

263
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:17,420
And it takes a long time
and the cost is high.

264
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:18,700
It's not the best choice.

265
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,900
You think it over.

266
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:20,968
I know.

267
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:23,379
I was so cautious before

268
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:24,980
and thought too much.

269
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,819
So I missed some things.

270
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:29,660
If Qin Yunsheng doesn't come to me,

271
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,688
I will go look for him.

272
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,056
Book a ticket.

273
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:34,900
No.

274
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,904
The firm can't do without you.

275
00:18:36,904 --> 00:18:37,832
- Right.
- Right.

276
00:18:37,832 --> 00:18:39,176
Alright, don't worry.

277
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:41,299
Even if I'm away,

278
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,339
it won't affect the operation
of the firm.

279
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:44,648
Dismissed.

280
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:45,500
Well...

281
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,632
Book the ticket.

282
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:50,539
Dr. Qin, have you thought of a plan yet?

283
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,500
If Ying goes to Germany,

284
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,139
our plan will be completely exposed.

285
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,299
She must take this job?

286
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:01,180
Yes, the point is this project

287
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:03,180
is not suitable for our firm.

288
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,900
But she insisted on taking it
because of you.

289
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,900
Say something.

290
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,136
What should we do?

291
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,980
What if she finds you're not in Germany?

292
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,260
Well, I don't know what to do.

293
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,299
Mingshi, you think of a way

294
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:24,220
to hold her back.

295
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:28,579
I'll find a chance
to tell her the truth.

296
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,020
There's no other way.

297
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,220
Okay, I'll try to do it.

298
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,120
But you must be quick.

299
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,500
I can't buy you too much time.

300
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:38,220
Okay, got it. Keep it up.

301
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:49,579
I just ironed your clothes.

302
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:53,539
Why are you going on a business trip
all of a sudden?

303
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,420
There's a project in Germany.

304
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,176
What did you say?

305
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,619
I'm going to Germany.

306
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,859
Germany?

307
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,099
You're not going to see Qin, are you?

308
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:16,579
Mom, I thought it over.

309
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:18,139
Since I can't get over him,

310
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:19,660
I should go find him.

311
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,980
I was hesitant at first.

312
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:24,220
Since I need to go
to Germany for a project,

313
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,940
I'll take this chance to talk to him.

314
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:37,740
Are you sure?

315
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,059
Mother, aren't you hoping
Yunsheng and I get back together?

316
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,740
Yes, I am.

317
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:48,539
But if you go to Germany alone,

318
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,980
I'll be worried.

319
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,180
How about you go with me?

320
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,056
I...

321
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,660
Don't worry.
It's not my first time going abroad.

322
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:01,260
He used to come to see me.

323
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,460
It's time for me to go to him.

324
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,056
No worries.

325
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:15,059
I'll go get a coat for you.

326
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,180
(Su is packing her bags.)

327
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,460
(She is going to Germany.)

328
00:21:48,332 --> 00:21:51,500
(Garden Road No. 123)

329
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,299
Ying, where are you going?

330
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,856
To the airport.

331
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,500
What?

332
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,500
I'm leaving it to you guys
while I'm on my trip.

333
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:05,579
No problem.

334
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,059
Ying.

335
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:10,180
Mr. Chi just called.

336
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,859
He said you don't have to come to him.

337
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,579
Since we used to cooperate,

338
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,539
we can have a video meeting.

339
00:22:18,184 --> 00:22:19,059
No need to go.

340
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:19,779
No need to go.

341
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:20,339
No need to go.

342
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,099
Let me schedule a video conference
for you.

343
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:32,264
Alright then.

344
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:34,900
So, are we going

345
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:36,980
to have a video meeting?

346
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,460
You do it. I'm not in the mood.

347
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,180
Where are you going?

348
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,776
To the glass house.

349
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,800
Okay.

350
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:50,299
Dr. Qin, I stopped Ying.

351
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,740
She's on the way to glass house.

352
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:54,339
After knowing
that she couldn't go to Germany,

353
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:56,840
she seemed rather upset. Over.

354
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,460
Where are you?

355
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:51,539
I miss you so much.

356
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,619
I admit I miss you.

357
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,379
I miss you.

358
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:02,579
I really want to see you.

359
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,656
Look back.

360
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:15,784
Look back.

361
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:29,256
I'm back.

362
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,740
You're back.

363
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,208
Stop crying. I've come back.

364
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:45,420
I will never leave you again.

365
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:48,059
Don't cry.

366
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:56,220
Are we having fun?

367
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,099
Is it fun fooling me?

368
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,952
What do you mean?

369
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,819
If you want,

370
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:11,220
it's not too late
to pack up your bag for going abroad.

371
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,500
Well played.

372
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,180
Will you show up if I don't do this?

373
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:19,819
Good for you.

374
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:26,420
How did you find it out?

375
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:28,779
I was actually going to believe you.

376
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:31,339
The sunset photo exposed you.

377
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,379
The sunset photo?

378
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:39,299
First, the time difference was wrong.

379
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,856
(World Time Clock, Berlin)

380
00:25:52,139 --> 00:25:54,339
(Second, after that,)

381
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,339
(I checked the weather in Berlin.)

382
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:00,539
(The weather forecast showed
it's been raining in Berlin lately.)

383
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:02,660
(No sunny day as you posted.)

384
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,460
Also, Zhang Yisen's acting is poor.

385
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,619
When I went to your dormitory,

386
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,180
he looked so panicked.

387
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,859
How's Yunsheng doing?

388
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,220
Yunsheng is also fine, right?

389
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:24,460
You guys are fine.

390
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,112
You go back to work. I'll hang up.

391
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,824
Qin Yunsheng,

392
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:33,059
you're very attentive,

393
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,740
but don't forget what I do.

394
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,460
I'm a designer.

395
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:39,112
I can tell whether anyone lives
in a place or not.

396
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,704
(Surgery)

397
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:10,819
That's why you took the job in Germany?

398
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:13,460
What? Can't I trick you?

399
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,339
If Qin Yunsheng doesn't come to me,

400
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:20,264
I will go look for him.

401
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:22,696
Book a ticket.

402
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,264
You contact the client.

403
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,579
You reconsider it.

404
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,672
Where are you going?

405
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:56,488
To the glass house.

406
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:57,512
Okay.

407
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,660
I was worried about you last night.

408
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,040
Really?

409
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,819
I've been crying these days.

410
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,420
I'm sorry, but I've come back.

411
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,260
I will never leave again.

412
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:18,539
Please don't be mad.

413
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:19,420
I'll never leave you.

414
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,500
How can I not be mad?

415
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,059
I'm really angry.

416
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,312
Qin Yunsheng.

417
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:37,180
Do you think distance can separate us?

418
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:40,139
Even if you really go abroad,

419
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,220
no matter the distance,

420
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,059
I will fly to you.

421
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:58,299
Will you lie to me again?

422
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,192
Never.

423
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:03,400
I can't deceive you.

424
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:05,736
I surrender.

425
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,180
I also surrender.

426
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:12,552
I love you.

What's wrong?

436
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,220
Good morning.

437
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,088
What's wrong with you, Ye?

438
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,099
Is it appendicitis?

439
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:44,139
My stomach hurts.

440
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,059
I'll take Ye to Meichi Hospital.

441
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:49,192
Okay.

442
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:51,859
I warned you not
to mention the hospital. Remember?

443
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,020
Especially Meichi Hospital.

444
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:56,040
Sorry.

445
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,379
I'll take Ye to see a doctor.

446
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,660
Okay.

447
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:01,940
Don't mention that.

448
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,740
Ying can't hear that word.

449
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,568
Don't mention Dr. Qin.

450
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,420
My stomach hurts.

451
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,304
Mingshi.

452
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,139
Are you talking

453
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,660
about some doctor?

454
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,619
Who?

455
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,260
Your eyeshadow looks so good.

456
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:23,460
Really?

457
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,460
You're wearing nice lipstick.

458
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:29,544
Drop the act.

459
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:33,192
She has known.

460
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,808
What?

461
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,420
How could you deceive her?

462
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,660
Did you just return?

463
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,779
- Did you return this morning?
- Did you return this morning?

464
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,539
Your return is quite sudden.

465
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,379
I guess you're still jet-lagged.

466
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,099
You came to see Ying.

467
00:30:53,192 --> 00:30:54,059
He's so kind.

468
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:54,980
Right.

469
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,859
Be honest.

470
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,059
What?

471
00:30:58,059 --> 00:30:58,984
Be honest?

472
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:03,779
I didn't expect
that aside from designing,

473
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,059
you guys are good at acting.

474
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,299
It appears I underestimated you before.

475
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,180
Why don't you guys switch careers
and become actors?

476
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,656
- Actors?
- Actors?

477
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,859
Ying, I am wrong.

478
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:15,460
I did as Ye told me.

479
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,500
Ye said it is good for you.

480
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,700
Ying, Mingshi told me to do this.

481
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,779
He said this would let you know
what real love is.

482
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:27,336
Dr. Qin, did I say that?

483
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:31,400
Mingshi.

484
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:33,220
I said no, but you persuaded me.

485
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,299
Exactly.

486
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,779
I am wrong.

487
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:38,940
We are wrong too.

488
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,020
I am wrong too.

489
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,379
Alright, I understand your intentions.

490
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,460
I should thank you guys.

491
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,460
You guys go
to the meeting room right now.

492
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,059
I need to hold a meeting.

493
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:05,379
Okay.

494
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:05,619
Okay.

495
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:06,728

Thank you all for watching.

519
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:48,220
I want to talk more

520
00:33:48,379 --> 00:33:50,020
about the designer Su Ying.

521
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:52,539
We've been good friends for many years.

522
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:53,900
In the past year,

523
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,779
she has focused on humanitarian care,

524
00:33:57,099 --> 00:33:59,420
making the cold architecture warmer,

525
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:02,500
and closing the distance
between the user

526
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,779
and the designer.

527
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,940

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,619

00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,259
Thank you for watching.

532
00:34:15,259 --> 00:34:16,139
Let me see.

533
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,139
I have to talk to them.

534
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,792
What do you want to say?

535
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,099
(Fight Hard to Win)
Look, they are calling for me.

536
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,980
Xu Mingshi.

537
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,099
Hello, guys. Do you miss me?

538
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,539
They know you

539
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,860
because of an accident.

540
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,940
So it's a fortunate coincidence.

541
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:34,500
Look, half of the audience came for me.

542
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,380
More than 3,000 viewers.

543
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,739
I'm going to chat with everyone.

544
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,139
No talking.

545
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:40,860
This is my work account,

546
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:42,059
not an account for a couple.

547
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:42,900
Wait a moment, look.

548
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,699
Are you two a couple?

549
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,860
Yes, we are.

550
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,739
Guys, I will update my content tomorrow.

551
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,860
Please keep following.

552
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,020
That's all for today.

553
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,619
- Goodbye.
- It's not over yet.

554
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,340
Well, we...

555
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,020
we will livestream irregularly.

556
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,300
Are you expecting it?

557
00:34:57,539 --> 00:34:58,504
Try to get it back.

558
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,940
Give it to me.

559
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,579
Hello, everyone.

560
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,820
Don't keep saying hello.

561
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,099
Say goodbye.

562
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:06,952
Don't turn it off.

563
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,872
- I did.
- No.

564
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:11,579
What can you do?

565
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,780
This is my work account.

566
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,792
No.

567
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:16,780
Put me down.

568
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,736
It's okay.

569
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,392
Dr. Zhang, look.

570
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,179
(ED, Zhang Yisen)
Zhang Yisen.

571
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,500
You're on the list.

572
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,539
I...

573
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,020
I'll tell Bai.

574
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:33,420
Bai, I'll be sent abroad.

575
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,099
We're going to meet in Germany.

576
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:40,500
Dr. Zhang, how come Dr. Qin is not
on the list?

577
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,300
He wants

578
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:46,259
to further promote
the public health care cause.

579
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:49,300
I admire him.

580
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,860
What makes you so happy?

581
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,139
Director.

582
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:53,096
Look.

583
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,619
Zhang Yisen, congratulations.

584
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,699
Congratulations.

585
00:35:57,699 --> 00:35:58,980
Thank you, Director.

586
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,340
Since you're all here,

587
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,500
I want

588
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,539
to make an announcement.

589
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,380
What is it?

590
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:12,460
Next month we're getting married.
You all must come.

591
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,980
- What?
- What?

592
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,539
Director, what happened?

593
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,780
So soon.

594
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,752
It's soon?

595
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,380
Women chasing men

596
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:24,579
is much easier

597
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:26,632
than men chasing women.

598
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,099
It's right to move quickly.

599
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,792
Director.

600
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,659
Yisen, you understand me.

601
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,099
Very impressive, Ms. Han.
You won Director over.

602
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,020
You all are aware
of the Director's charm.

603
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,940
She's captivated by my charm.

604
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,940
So, when do you two go on a honeymoon?

605
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,352
When do you have a baby?

606
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,099
You can spend your honeymoon in Germany.

607
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,340
Right.

608
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:53,659
You all have nothing to do?

609
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,980
Don't you need to work?

610
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:05,619
When do we go on a honeymoon?

611
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,720
Han.

612
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:10,420
We need to prioritize work.

613
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,776
I'll get back to my work.

614
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,659
Such a charming man.

615
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:18,259
(Piyixia)
Ye.

616
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,860
I finally could be a lead designer.

617
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:24,020
Impressive.

618
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:27,380
After this, I need to have a title.

619
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,408
Let me think. Master Cai?

620
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:33,099
No, it sounds too rustic.

621
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,176
Designer Cai.

622
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:37,544
How about Mr. Cai?

623
00:37:37,544 --> 00:37:39,528
Sounds good. Thank you.

624
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,340
Good for you, Mr. Cai.

625
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:43,579
Do you remember
what you did to the printer

626
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,099
on your first day at work?

627
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,579
The previous Cai Chen is to blame.

628
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:51,780
It has nothing to do with me, Mr. Cai.

629
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:53,980
Forget it.

630
00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:56,392
Okay.

631
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:02,460
I can't enjoy this happiness alone.

632
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,500
I have to share it.

633
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,219
Snap a photo, and post it.

634
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,900
I'll be the first to give you a like.

635
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:12,136
(Tea Shop Design Contract)

636
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:17,380
The sea is so beautiful.

637
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,780
Come on. Give me a like.

638
00:38:20,456 --> 00:38:21,300
Ying left a message.

639
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,059
(Su Ying: I'll treat you to a meal.)
She will buy me a meal.

640
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,520
(Hui Xuan: I'll treat you to a meal.)
And Huixuan.

641
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,856
I saw it.

642
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,539
(Mingshi: Let's have a meal.)
And Mingshi.

643
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,699
I haven't seen him around.

644
00:38:35,048 --> 00:38:35,944
Cao Xiaoye.

645
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:37,139
Yes.

646
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:38,659
I'm happy today.

647
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,820
How about I buy you spicy hot pot?

648
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,380
No, I don't want a simple meal.

649
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,340
We must have a big meal today.

650
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:49,099
And it's my treat.

651
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,920
Your treat?

652
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:52,168
Why?

653
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,179
Because the library that I designed

654
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,860
has been rated as a new popular spot.

655
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:02,860
Ye, I knew you could do it.

656
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:26,460
Let's have a feast.

657
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,040
It's on me.

658
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,099
(Piyixia)
Let's go. My treat.

659
00:39:31,259 --> 00:39:32,200
Let's go.

660
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:35,860
Hello, everyone, I'm Tian Mei.

661
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,539
Thank you for loving
my tree house design

662
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,780
and for recognizing me.

663
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,340
Can you share with us

664
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,380
how you designed such a great project?

665
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:48,539
Actually, I want to thank one person.

666
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:50,340
She told me

667
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,340
that the attitude is more important
than the speed.

668
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:56,340
I can do it if I put my mind to it.

669
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,099
And I want to take this opportunity
to apologize to her.

670
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,059
Back then, I didn't understand her.

671
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,460
And I hurt her.

672
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,500
And then?

673
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,448
Well,

674
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,340
reality gave me a heavy blow.

675
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,139
I understood what she meant.

676
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,139
Haste makes waste.

677
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:19,020
A down-to-earth designer

678
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,619
is worthy of respect.

679
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,460
May I ask who she is?

680
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,648
Su Ying.

681
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:30,536
Thank you.

682
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:05,020
Are you ready?

683
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,896
Almost.

684
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,624
Chen.

685
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,980
We're almost finished.

686
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,059
We'll leave the rest to you.

687
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:12,579
All right, don't worry. I've got this.

688
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,020
The patients like the glass house.

689
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,940
Thank you
for designing such a nice house.

690
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,139
We should thank Dr. Qin.

691
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,699
He donated the glass house.

692
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,659
Dr. Qin, I heard
you volunteer in the country regularly.

693
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,259
Yes, I'm about to leave soon.

694
00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:27,099
I'll go with him.

695
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:29,219
Okay, I need to get back to work now.

696
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:30,059
Go ahead.

697
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:30,576
Bye.

698
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:32,520
Let's go.

699
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,664
Let's go.

700
00:41:58,699 --> 00:41:59,699
(Start navigation.)

701
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:03,380
(The total distance is 128 kilometers.)

702
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:05,192
It's a long journey. You can take a nap.

703
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,656
No matter the distance,

704
00:42:07,656 --> 00:42:09,800
it's not far as long as I'm with you.

705
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,248
Let's go.
