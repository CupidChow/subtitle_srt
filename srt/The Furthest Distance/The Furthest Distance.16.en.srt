=Episode 16=

17
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,947
Actually, I came here a few days ago.

18
00:01:48,268 --> 00:01:49,548
When I saw this house,

19
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:52,787
I started to
understand your persistence.

20
00:01:55,147 --> 00:01:56,628
We both have someone in our hearts

21
00:01:56,787 --> 00:01:57,708
who can't be forgotten.

22
00:01:58,867 --> 00:01:59,908
As time goes by,

23
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:02,828
they become special to us

24
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:04,147
just like this house.

25
00:02:05,387 --> 00:02:08,148
So crystal-clear,

26
00:02:08,707 --> 00:02:09,947
and so perfect.

27
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:14,667
People in our profession tend to suggest
clients preserve their old houses.

28
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:16,987
Because under careful maintenance,

29
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:19,628
they can have
a nostalgic and elegant charm

30
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:22,428
and show you have good taste.

31
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:24,987
But, Dr. Qin, if you want
to build a new house,

32
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:27,547
you have to demolish the old one first.

33
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,547
Otherwise, I'm afraid the new house
you built on top of the old one

34
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:32,232
might collapse.

35
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:35,348
I'm a doctor.

36
00:02:35,748 --> 00:02:37,507
I don't understand
your architectural terms.

37
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:38,908
However, for us,

38
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:42,664
cherishing the present
is the most important thing.

39
00:02:54,787 --> 00:02:55,688
Okay, I got it.

40
00:02:57,348 --> 00:02:59,748
Mr. Yang, the ADA Committee
has sent an invitation.

41
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:02,868
The organizer wants to invite you
to be the award presenter this year.

42
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:05,928
It seems that Su is on the list
of entrants. What do you think?

43
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:10,148
When is the awards ceremony?

44
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:12,348
In about half a month.

45
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:16,456
Half a month.

46
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:21,928
Just agree to it first.

47
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:25,428
And then follow up
on Su's progress in the competition.

48
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:28,707
But they've made it clear
that they won't cooperate with us.

49
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:32,787
The last time we went,

50
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:35,428
a junior designer
gave us a business card.

51
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:36,908
- Her name is...
- Tian Mei.

52
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:41,000
I understand, sir. I'll go talk to her.

53
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:41,992
No need.

54
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:43,688
I'll go myself.

55
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:45,672
Okay.

56
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:10,428
Hello, Dr. Qin.

57
00:04:10,428 --> 00:04:11,400
Dr. Qin.

58
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:13,348
You're here.

59
00:04:14,468 --> 00:04:15,787
You've set everything up.

60
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:17,347
It looks much better
than it was on the show.

61
00:04:17,347 --> 00:04:18,707
You're really talented.

62
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:20,008
I learned from you.

63
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,072
Okay, let's get moving.

64
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:24,988
Sure.

65
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:25,896
Okay.

66
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:30,587
Thanks for your hard work.

67
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:31,528
It's not hard work.

68
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:34,568
Your dark circles are pretty heavy.
Didn't you sleep well?

69
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:36,947
No. I worked late last night.

70
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:39,907
You've been busy with the house
and your work these days.

71
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:40,947
You must be exhausted.

72
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:42,827
Get a good sleep tonight, okay?

73
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:44,827
Alright. Once you guys
finish shooting, I'll go to bed.

74
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:50,788
Where are we going to shoot later?

75
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:53,587
We'll shoot inside first,
then move outside later.

76
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:54,664
The light will be good then.

77
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:58,947
I can't live without you.

78
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:00,108
You did me a great favor again.

79
00:05:00,988 --> 00:05:02,788
So, how do you plan to thank me?

80
00:05:03,587 --> 00:05:04,947
How do you want me to thank you?

81
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:08,308
Didn't you say you'd
introduce me to someone reliable?

82
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:10,788
Let me look at the photo.

83
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:14,068
I need to ask him if he agrees first.

84
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:16,868
So he doesn't know yet?

85
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:19,748
Didn't you say to talk about it
after these busy days?

86
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:20,988
So I haven't told it to him.

87
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,467
I gave it some thought later.

88
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:25,267
I think it's best to get it done
as soon as possible.

89
00:05:25,628 --> 00:05:27,387
Otherwise, I might change
my mind in a few days.

90
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:29,628
Okay, I will ask him for you later.

91
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:31,507
Sorry. Are you okay?

92
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:32,707
Yes, I'm okay.

93
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,628
Be careful.

94
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:38,632
Dr. Qin.

95
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:47,267
Ying told me
about your feelings for Huixuan.

96
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,256
No!

97
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:52,228
You're so afraid of her finding out?

98
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:55,548
I won't hide it from you.
I tried before,

99
00:05:55,628 --> 00:05:56,507
but all attempts failed.

100
00:05:56,947 --> 00:05:58,947
I'm afraid we won't even be able
to remain friends

101
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:00,548
if she doesn't like me.

102
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:03,748
From my experience,

103
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:06,467
if you like someone, let them know.

104
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:07,827
Even if you get rejected,

105
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,144
at least you won't have any regrets.

106
00:06:12,628 --> 00:06:13,548
That seems true.

107
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:16,228
Okay, I'll go tell her.

108
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:19,016
I'll say it myself.

109
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:20,652
I'll say it myself later.

110
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:23,116
(SU Interior Design Firm)

111
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:31,368
Hello?

112
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:33,947
Tian Mei, I'll send you
a set of photos we just shot.

113
00:06:34,188 --> 00:06:36,456
Please select the appropriate ones
and edit them.

114
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:38,228
Okay. Got it. Send them over.

(Are you free tonight?)

116
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:56,428
(I want to talk to you.)

117
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:06,907
(Yes, Mr. Yang. Please let me know
after you set the time and place.)

118
00:07:17,507 --> 00:07:19,707
Glass, sunlight and flowers.

119
00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:22,347
What a great theme you've chosen.

120
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:25,147
Flowers make it look lively, don't they?

121
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:27,548
Should we give them some water?

122
00:07:27,868 --> 00:07:29,347
Yes, otherwise, they will dry out.

123
00:07:36,027 --> 00:07:36,988
Why is there no water?

124
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,587
There was just now.

125
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:42,027
Perhaps I forgot to pay the water bill.

126
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:45,267
I often forget it too.

127
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:47,428
Pay it on your phone.
It's very convenient.

128
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:48,744
Okay.

129
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,147
Once it is paid, the water
comes back very quickly.

130
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:58,228
It may not be that fast in our area.

131
00:07:58,628 --> 00:07:59,528
Really?

132
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:03,656
What is going on?

133
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:04,904
What happened?

134
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:06,280
This...

135
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,664
Dr. Qin, the power is out.

136
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,748
Sorry, I might've forgotten
to pay the electricity bill too.

137
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:20,748
Then without electricity,
how will you operate the lights?

138
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:23,907
That's okay. The natural light
is sufficient. Let's go outside.

139
00:08:24,748 --> 00:08:25,628
Okay.

140
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:26,600
Let's move these outside.

141
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:27,976

Mr. Yang, you must have
something to tell me, right?

153
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:53,508
Yes, there's a small matter.

154
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:55,496
Here's the thing.

155
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:57,987
Our group is currently working
on a Seaview Garden project.

156
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:01,227
But there's a stubborn homeowner
who refuses to move anyway,

157
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:02,627
making it a big headache.

158
00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:06,028
I would like to hear
other people's opinions.

159
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:09,188
That's why I invited you to have a meal.

160
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:13,627
"A stubborn homeowner
who refuses to move anyway"?

161
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:17,227
It means the current method
does not work on him.

162
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:22,248
The simplest and most effective way
is to wait him out.

163
00:10:22,947 --> 00:10:23,912
To wait him out?

164
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:28,068
Think about it.
He now wants to stall for time.

165
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:31,308
But you can do the same to him.

166
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:34,508
On the surface, it seems like
you are both wasting time.

167
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,107
But in reality, it is a test.

168
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,347
Once you find out
his true needs or weakness,

169
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:43,188
you can take him down directly.

170
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:46,028
After all, everyone
has their weaknesses.

171
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:52,227
You see things differently from others.

172
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:53,747
Thank you in advance.

173
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:55,848
You're welcome, Mr. Yang.

174
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:01,068
By the way,
what have you been busy with recently?

175
00:11:01,548 --> 00:11:04,107
Our studio has been busy
with the ADA Competition.

176
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:07,028
You'll use the glass house
as an entry, right?

177
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:09,148
How did you know?

178
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:11,347
It's not hard to guess.
The design is so unique,

179
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:13,107
and it's so popular.

180
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,587
If it were me, I would choose it too.

181
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:18,508
Yeah, we all believe
Ying is bound to win the prize.

182
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:22,107
It's really a pity.

183
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:24,548
Actually, our group

184
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:27,707
has always been very appreciative
of your studio.

185
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:30,788
Like our Seaview Garden project.

186
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:32,827
It's actually one
of the largest projects

187
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:35,308
that our company
has invested in recent years.

188
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:37,987
We are planning to build it
into a landmark by the sea,

189
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:40,987
but now we can't cooperate
with your studio.

190
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:44,188
It's really a pity.

191
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:49,160
Mr. Yang,

192
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:53,587
actually, it is not totally impossible.

193
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:57,148
I can talk to Ying.

194
00:11:57,788 --> 00:11:58,696
Really?

195
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:02,107
Could you please send me
a project profile?

196
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:03,627
Of course. That's great.

197
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:05,148
I'll let my assistant do it soon.

198
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,428
Okay. I hope to have
a pleasant cooperation with you.

199
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,268
Let's toast our cooperation in advance.

200
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:25,772
(Garden Road No. 123)

201
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:31,148
Ying.

202
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:32,072
Come in.

203
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:38,268
I took a case yesterday.

204
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:40,616
I think it's pretty good.
Please take a look.

205
00:12:50,548 --> 00:12:51,788
What do you think?

206
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:55,508
Who sent this case?

207
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:57,704
Tiandi Building Materials Corp.

208
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,627
I think it's a quite large project.

209
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:02,908
Taking it will be beneficial
to our studio.

210
00:13:05,227 --> 00:13:06,707
Is this part of their development area?

211
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:12,068
Right. They said they wanted to turn it

212
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:14,508
into a landmark building by the sea.

213
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:15,867
This is a rare opportunity.

214
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:20,107
Are they going
to demolish the glass house?

215
00:13:23,148 --> 00:13:24,467
Demolishing the glass house?

216
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,347
Qingya Bay.

217
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:33,028
It's where the glass house is located.

218
00:13:36,388 --> 00:13:38,308
I'm sorry, Ying.
I'll ask for more details.

219
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:40,908
Okay, you can go out.

220
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:42,856
All right.

221
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:56,827
(Mr. Li)

222
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:57,832
There's a call.

223
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:00,328
I'll answer it.

224
00:14:03,347 --> 00:14:04,188
Why is there no water?

225
00:14:06,668 --> 00:14:07,548
There was just now.

226
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:12,936
What is going on?

227
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,944
Dr. Qin, the power is out.

228
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:21,928
Sorry, I might've forgotten
to pay the electricity bill too.

229
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:38,668
Miss Su, do you need anything?

230
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:39,752
Is Yang Zhengwen here?

231
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:41,227
Wait a moment, please.

232
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:42,408
Mr. Yang.

233
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:45,107
We should place the Seaview Garden
where the glass house is.

234
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:49,148
Yes, that area meets the conditions
for building the Seaview Garden.

235
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:52,308
We really don't need
to go far away to other places.

236
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:55,188
And regardless of the cost
or expected return,

237
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:58,028
that area now offers
unmatched advantages.

238
00:14:58,347 --> 00:15:00,627
I know, but I still
stick to my decision.

239
00:15:00,747 --> 00:15:02,068
Shall we find other seaside areas?

240
00:15:02,508 --> 00:15:05,148
Mr. Yang, this relates
to the interests of the group.

241
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:06,587
Do you have the final say alone?

242
00:15:07,347 --> 00:15:08,388
This is my decision.

243
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:11,308
I will explain to the board
if there is any problem, okay?

244
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,188
The person in charge of that area

245
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:16,107
has clearly indicated
they'll fully cooperate with us.

246
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:17,347
It is also good for us.

247
00:15:17,747 --> 00:15:20,268
Did I ever say
before the development area was decided,

248
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,388
no demolition was allowed,

249
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,227
let alone forced demolition?

250
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:25,707
But previously...

251
00:15:25,947 --> 00:15:26,987
There's no but.

252
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:30,028
Fine, how about
I let you sit in my place?

253
00:15:57,867 --> 00:15:58,827
Hello, Qin.

254
00:15:59,107 --> 00:16:01,068
Mr. Li, there's no power or water yet.

255
00:16:02,747 --> 00:16:04,068
Don't worry yet.

256
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:05,467
I'll handle it for you right now.

257
00:16:05,788 --> 00:16:06,788
Okay, hurry up. Please.

258
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:13,736
Open the door!

259
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:17,668
Come on!

260
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:18,107
Come on!

261
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:18,987
Open the door!

262
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:21,576
What are you all doing here?

263
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:23,987
Commissioned by the property management,

264
00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:25,107
we're here to move it.

265
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:26,508
I wasn't notified.

266
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:29,548
They can give you the penalty,

267
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:32,308
but this place must be reclaimed today.

268
00:16:32,552 --> 00:16:33,548
Let's start it, guys.

269
00:16:33,548 --> 00:16:34,467
Let me make a call first.

270
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:35,308
What phone call?

271
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:36,587
Make way. Make way.

272
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:38,856
Let's get in.

273
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,648
Stop it.

274
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:44,028
Stop.

275
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:46,028
We got a notice.

276
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:49,192
Don't move it for now.

277
00:16:50,148 --> 00:16:52,104
Let's leave, guys.

278
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:53,028
What's going on?

279
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:55,112
- Leave.
- Get out, guys.

280
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:02,908
Sorry to keep you waiting.

281
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,028
Recently, there have been
too many meetings.

282
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,387
You'll demolish the glass house?

283
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:15,308
The Seaview Garden project
is very important to our group.

284
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,347
The place where the glass house is
is a very good location.

285
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:20,667
All shareholders unanimously think

286
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:22,228
that it's best for us to develop there.

287
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:25,147
Then why did you just oppose it?

288
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:27,944
It's quite normal.

289
00:17:28,268 --> 00:17:30,068
I often oppose views during meetings.

290
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:32,468
They have their thoughts.
I have my worries.

291
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:37,627
What? You think I did it for you?

292
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,427
You know me.

293
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:46,667
I never let emotions
get in the way when working.

294
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,312
That's true.

295
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,587
I heard that this time,
the ADA Committee

296
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:00,548
has invited your studio
to participate in the competition.

297
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:02,248
Congratulations.

298
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:05,416
It's just an invitation.

299
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:09,347
That also indicates your studio
has received their recognition.

300
00:18:15,468 --> 00:18:16,548
Actually, I don't want you

301
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:19,028
to feel very averse to cooperating

302
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,308
with Tiandi Building Materials Corp
because of our relationship.

303
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:25,788
Because if that's the case,

304
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:27,667
it will be a great loss

305
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:29,387
to both you and us.

306
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:32,296
Anyway,

307
00:18:33,587 --> 00:18:34,867
this time you saved the glass house.

308
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,387
I owe you a favor.

309
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:42,268
You've never owed me anything.

310
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,347
Go ahead with your business.
I'm leaving.

311
00:19:07,508 --> 00:19:10,788
(Mr. Yang, you're planning
to demolish the glass house, right?)

312
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:14,708
(Ying has just found out about it
and she's very angry. She just left.)

313
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:26,344
Hello, where are you?

314
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:27,907
I'm at the glass house.

315
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:29,508
I'm on my way there.

316
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,308
You're here. I just finished
cooking. Let's eat.

317
00:19:51,068 --> 00:19:52,028
Sit down.

318
00:19:59,587 --> 00:20:00,488
Eat.

319
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,028
Let me feed you a chicken wing.

320
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:08,268
Why didn't you tell me
about the demolition of the house?

321
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:10,708
You know.

322
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:14,427
The Seaview Garden project
is known to many in the industry.

323
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:15,748
How could I not know about it?

324
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:19,627
I didn't want to distract you.
You have a competition.

325
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:21,096
Don't worry.

326
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:22,788
I can handle it.

327
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:24,584
Eat.

328
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:25,960
Try the egg.

329
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:27,784
Hurry.

330
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:29,992
Give it a try.

331
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:32,232
It's hot.

332
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:38,088
Is it good?

333
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:41,627
The best soup in the world.

334
00:20:42,948 --> 00:20:43,880
I just knew it.

335
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:46,308
Eat your meal.

336
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:06,468
Mr. Yang, this is your schedule
for the next week.

337
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,427
As usual, the ADA award ceremony date
is almost set.

338
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:12,548
Your suit might need
to be arranged in advance.

339
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:14,907
You guys just decide it for me.

340
00:21:15,228 --> 00:21:16,232
Yes.

341
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:19,907
By the way, isn't the anniversary
of the death of Mi Su coming soon?

342
00:21:20,387 --> 00:21:21,352
Yes.

343
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,667
That will be interesting.

344
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:28,627
Tell the ADA committee

345
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,068
we'll sponsor them exclusively,

346
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,587
but there is one condition.

347
00:21:40,347 --> 00:21:42,627
I'm finally finished
with the competition.

348
00:21:55,508 --> 00:21:56,584
What...?

349
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:02,280
(Scrat)
(What are you doing?)

350
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:05,320
(Fight Hard to Win)
(Watching a match.)

351
00:22:05,988 --> 00:22:11,468
(Scrat)
Me too. May MUFC win a fourth.

352
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:15,944
What a coincidence.

353
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:18,347
(Fight Hard to Win)
(I'm watching it too.)

354
00:22:23,948 --> 00:22:29,187
(Scrat)
It's so relieving to watch it after work.

355
00:22:31,107 --> 00:22:32,308
Besides,

356
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:34,268
you must

357
00:22:35,308 --> 00:22:36,387
grab a can of cold beer

358
00:22:37,827 --> 00:22:39,387
and put your legs up on the sofa.

359
00:22:40,028 --> 00:22:41,064
That's the way to chill.

360
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:48,107
(Fight Hard to Win)
(Geez! How do you know what I'm doing?)

361
00:22:48,587 --> 00:22:50,147
(Did you install a camera in my house?)

362
00:22:50,427 --> 00:22:54,627
(Scrat)
Because I can read minds.

363
00:22:56,028 --> 00:22:57,427
He can read minds?

364
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,352
(Fight Hard to Win)
(Guess what I look like.)

365
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:10,028
Isn't this an easy question?

366
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:16,748
(Scrat)
I guess

367
00:23:18,308 --> 00:23:19,907
you are

368
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:21,672
short-haired

369
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:26,827
with big eyes

370
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,748
and a high nose bridge.

371
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:33,228
And you laugh

372
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:35,144
loud.

373
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:41,827
A writer once said

374
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:46,068
that if you want to be charming,

375
00:23:46,427 --> 00:23:47,867
always remember

376
00:23:48,948 --> 00:23:51,748
to be a bit mysterious.

377
00:23:52,548 --> 00:23:53,788
To be a bit mysterious.

378
00:23:54,387 --> 00:23:55,347
(Oh, no.)

379
00:23:56,147 --> 00:23:57,748
(Am I going to fall in love?)

380
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,387
Why on earth do you want
to meet me so early in the morning?

381
00:24:12,627 --> 00:24:14,068
And why so cheerful?

382
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:15,587
Tell me. What's the good news?

383
00:24:16,548 --> 00:24:19,080
Could it not be
because I'm happy to see you?

384
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,308
You're here to ask me to set up
a blind date for you, right?

385
00:24:26,308 --> 00:24:27,988
It does have to do with the blind date.

386
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,024
But let's put that aside for now.

387
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:31,988
I've actually found
someone good on my own.

388
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:34,024
Who is it?

389
00:24:35,028 --> 00:24:36,988
Do you remember
that e-friend I told you about?

390
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,427
The one you said
you had great conversations with?

391
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:43,948
Yes. I've realized that not only
do we have great conversations,

392
00:24:45,268 --> 00:24:47,468
but I also have a feeling
that he really understands me.

393
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:51,080
He understands you? In what way?

394
00:24:51,508 --> 00:24:55,468
It's just that I've found
that he meets all my criteria,

395
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,587
and moreover, we share
many common interests and hobbies.

396
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:00,708
Especially,

397
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:03,387
he knows a lot about home design.

398
00:25:04,107 --> 00:25:07,228
So, you're going to have a blind date
with the one named Scrat?

399
00:25:08,468 --> 00:25:11,788
I think instead of wasting my time
on an unknown person,

400
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:14,147
I might as well find someone
I'm really interested in.

401
00:25:16,627 --> 00:25:17,907
That's true,

402
00:25:18,536 --> 00:25:19,427
but...

403
00:25:19,427 --> 00:25:21,788
But he's a bit too mysterious.

404
00:25:22,548 --> 00:25:24,667
I'm not sure if I can
get him to meet me.

405
00:25:27,187 --> 00:25:28,347
Do you really want to go so fast?

406
00:25:28,988 --> 00:25:30,748
You don't even know what he looks like.

407
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:33,948
That's exactly why I need to meet him.

408
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:35,464
Listen to me.

409
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:38,667
Meeting face-to-face
is the best way to study a person.

410
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:41,948
If I succeed this time,

411
00:25:42,347 --> 00:25:43,228
will you bless me?

412
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:46,468
Of course, I will.

413
00:25:47,948 --> 00:25:50,268
So I'm asking him out.

414
00:25:51,788 --> 00:25:52,667
I'm really gonna do it.

415
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,228
(Isn't she gonna
start an online relationship?)

416
00:26:02,347 --> 00:26:03,508
(What about Mingshi?)

417
00:26:06,387 --> 00:26:07,427
Vendors.

418
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:17,708
(Fight Hard to Win)
(It's pleasant to chat with you,)

419
00:26:18,347 --> 00:26:19,708
(so I can't help but be curious)

420
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:22,147
(about what you look like
in the real world.)

421
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,028
(Mr. Scrat,)

422
00:26:25,748 --> 00:26:27,347
(care to meet me in person?)

423
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:28,587
To meet me.

424
00:26:32,268 --> 00:26:33,192
Meet me?

425
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:37,667
Good morning, Ying.

426
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:38,536
Mingshi, come in with me.

427
00:26:43,387 --> 00:26:45,748
Your timing is perfect. I was just about
to discuss something with you.

428
00:26:45,948 --> 00:26:46,920
Let me talk first.

429
00:26:48,347 --> 00:26:51,748
Du Huixuan has recently
made a friend online, called Scrat.

430
00:26:52,107 --> 00:26:53,347
She seems to be really into him.

431
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:56,068
She's dead set
on asking him out on a date.

432
00:26:56,268 --> 00:26:58,147
And that guy knows her well.

433
00:26:59,107 --> 00:27:01,228
You've met a formidable rival this time.

434
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:05,548
Ying, actually, I am Scrat.

435
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:10,667
You're Scrat?

436
00:27:12,028 --> 00:27:12,936
That e-friend?

437
00:27:13,268 --> 00:27:14,308
Yes, I am the one

438
00:27:14,427 --> 00:27:15,948
whom Huixuan's dead set on meeting.

439
00:27:16,228 --> 00:27:17,907
Last time I did this behind her.

440
00:27:18,587 --> 00:27:19,468
Didn't you realize?

441
00:27:21,827 --> 00:27:22,824
No wonder.

442
00:27:24,147 --> 00:27:26,308
So it's no wonder that the e-friend
said he liked hazelnuts.

443
00:27:26,508 --> 00:27:27,988
And he knows her well.

444
00:27:28,468 --> 00:27:29,627
So it's you.

445
00:27:29,907 --> 00:27:30,792
It's me.

446
00:27:31,948 --> 00:27:34,788
Right, Ying. Huixuan messaged me.

447
00:27:35,907 --> 00:27:39,016
What should I reply?

448
00:27:40,387 --> 00:27:41,427
Do you want to see her?

449
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:44,228
Of course, I want to, but...

450
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:45,187
But what?

451
00:27:45,907 --> 00:27:47,028
You've had a crush for so long.

452
00:27:47,228 --> 00:27:49,187
How many years have you waited
for this opportunity?

453
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:50,216
What are you hesitating for?

454
00:27:55,147 --> 00:27:56,107
I'll send her a message now.

455
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:56,968
Go ahead. Send it.

456
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:15,820
(House Design's Amazing Finale
of Sea-view Apartment Series)

457
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:38,948
(Scrat)
(Let's meet at this restaurant at 5 PM.)

458
00:28:40,347 --> 00:28:41,587
He agreed.

459
00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:47,708
(Fight Hard to Win)
(Okay.)

460
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:52,468
She said okay.

461
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:55,228
Let me see. This is right.

462
00:29:02,412 --> 00:29:03,500
(Huixuan)

463
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:07,667
Hello, Xuan.

464
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:11,788
Hey, Su. Scrat agreed to meet me.

465
00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:13,028
And it's today.

466
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,708
Really? Then you must prepare well.

467
00:29:17,427 --> 00:29:18,627
Don't worry. Wait for my good news.

468
00:29:19,308 --> 00:29:20,748
Alright, then you go for it.

469
00:29:21,867 --> 00:29:22,760
Love you.

470
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,704
Go for it.

471
00:29:26,508 --> 00:29:27,368
Go for it.

472
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:31,432
I must win.

473
00:29:48,827 --> 00:29:49,864
(Fight Hard to Win)
(I'm here.)

474
00:29:56,187 --> 00:29:57,068
(Scrat)
(I'm coming.)

475
00:30:00,347 --> 00:30:02,600
You're here. You're late.

476
00:30:03,187 --> 00:30:04,104
What drink would you like?

477
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:05,224
Coffee, then.

478
00:30:06,147 --> 00:30:07,016
What are you doing?

479
00:30:07,387 --> 00:30:08,232
Nothing.

480
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:09,627
What are you filming? Show me.

481
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:12,147
I didn't film anything.
What's it to you? Nosy.

482
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:13,576
Stop right there.

483
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:14,548
He took photos of you.

484
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:15,496
Rascal!

485
00:30:17,788 --> 00:30:18,664
Stop!

486
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:19,788
What's wrong, Huixuan?

487
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:22,028
Help me catch that rascal.

488
00:30:22,468 --> 00:30:23,368
A rascal?

489
00:30:25,827 --> 00:30:26,792
- Stop!
- Stop!

490
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:28,627
Huixuan, be careful.

491
00:30:31,752 --> 00:30:32,667
Mind where you're going.

492
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:33,576
Stop.

493
00:30:35,272 --> 00:30:36,187
Are you blind?

494
00:30:36,187 --> 00:30:37,068
What's going on?

495
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,867
Excuse me, make way.

496
00:30:54,508 --> 00:30:55,468
Are you okay, Huixuan?

497
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:56,648
I'm fine.

498
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:58,024
Are you okay?

499
00:30:58,107 --> 00:30:59,468
I'm fine. Wait for me. I'll catch him.

500
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:00,712
Don't chase him.

501
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:02,708
We let that old rascal go.

502
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:06,504
Why are you here?

503
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,107
Actually, I just...

504
00:31:08,387 --> 00:31:10,187
I know you just happened
to be passing by.

505
00:31:11,147 --> 00:31:12,147
Yes, passing by.

506
00:31:14,147 --> 00:31:15,107
You're all dirty.

507
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:16,468
Go change your clothes.

508
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:17,548
I'll call a taxi for you.

509
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:19,107
No, the reason I came
today is actually...

510
00:31:19,228 --> 00:31:20,867
Don't blame me for not being loyal.

511
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:22,948
Actually, I came today for a date.

512
00:31:23,427 --> 00:31:24,347
I know. I'm the one...

513
00:31:24,427 --> 00:31:25,948
But this one
is absolutely reliable this time.

514
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,667
So I won't send you home.

515
00:31:28,948 --> 00:31:30,228
No, Huixuan...

516
00:31:30,508 --> 00:31:32,468
The taxi arrived,
with the license plate ending in 0847.

517
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:33,640
I'm leaving, bye.

518
00:31:33,988 --> 00:31:34,867
Huixuan, I'm...

519
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,107
Scrat.

520
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:49,187
Ying, what shall I do? I messed it up.

521
00:31:50,228 --> 00:31:51,176
What's wrong?

522
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:54,228
Didn't I arrange to meet Scrat today?

523
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,587
But something unexpected happened.

524
00:31:57,427 --> 00:31:59,788
He probably thought
I stood him up, so he left.

525
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,867
How could it be?

526
00:32:03,228 --> 00:32:04,147
What can I do?

527
00:32:06,988 --> 00:32:08,907
Should I DM him to explain?

528
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:10,708
He won't be mad at me, right?

529
00:32:11,788 --> 00:32:12,872
Take it easy.

530
00:32:13,068 --> 00:32:15,028
You just need to explain the thing well.

531
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:17,308
If Scrat is as good as you say,

532
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:19,508
he will understand. Don't worry.

533
00:32:20,748 --> 00:32:21,640
I think so too.

534
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:24,308
Alright. I'm just catching up with you.
Carry on with your work.

535
00:32:25,228 --> 00:32:28,328
Okay, call me if anything comes up. Bye.

536
00:32:34,228 --> 00:32:36,468
So, you did all this to help her

537
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:37,544
catch that Peeping Tom?

538
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:38,984
That's right.

539
00:32:40,427 --> 00:32:42,708
Then Huixuan sent me away

540
00:32:42,948 --> 00:32:43,788
to let me take a shower.

541
00:32:44,068 --> 00:32:46,548
She chased you away
and then waited for Scrat there?

542
00:32:49,788 --> 00:32:51,468
The point is that the taxi

543
00:32:51,788 --> 00:32:53,107
was already in front of me at the time.

544
00:32:53,187 --> 00:32:56,068
And I was too dirty
to confess my feelings to her.

545
00:32:56,427 --> 00:32:57,268
I had to come back.

546
00:33:01,827 --> 00:33:03,387
Are you guys filming a drama?

547
00:33:04,147 --> 00:33:05,587
What should I do now?

548
00:33:05,988 --> 00:33:08,468
What else? Ask her out again.

549
00:33:10,508 --> 00:33:11,464
That's right.

550
00:33:12,788 --> 00:33:14,308
I will find a good time next time.

551
00:33:15,187 --> 00:33:18,107
I will make sure
everything will go perfectly.

552
00:33:21,748 --> 00:33:23,988
Fate is really amazing.

553
00:33:24,427 --> 00:33:26,468
They should cross paths online.

554
00:33:27,147 --> 00:33:28,107
I can't believe...

555
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:32,587
Du Huixuan even created
another account and didn't tell me.

556
00:33:33,308 --> 00:33:34,907
How could she?

557
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:37,068
I don't want to hear about their story.

558
00:33:38,187 --> 00:33:39,907
I want to hear about ours.

559
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:45,268
So here is a piece of news
that is 80 percent good.

560
00:33:45,587 --> 00:33:46,440
Okay.

561
00:33:52,228 --> 00:33:54,867
The shortlist for the ADA award
is about to be released.

562
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:56,827
If, I mean if,

563
00:33:57,748 --> 00:33:58,948
if I get nominated,

564
00:33:59,427 --> 00:34:01,347
will you go with me to the ceremony?

565
00:34:05,788 --> 00:34:08,348
Let me think about it.

566
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:10,632
Think about it.

567
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:12,787
Should I go or...?

568
00:34:12,787 --> 00:34:13,704
Thinking about it, huh?

569
00:34:17,187 --> 00:34:18,216
You're not ticklish?

570
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:19,240
You're ticklish?

571
00:34:20,508 --> 00:34:21,388
But you dare to tickle me.

572
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:22,348
So you are ticklish.

573
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:26,667
I was wrong.

574
00:34:29,227 --> 00:34:30,307
Are you going or not?

575
00:34:34,227 --> 00:34:35,176
Of course I am.

576
00:34:36,587 --> 00:34:38,107
Wear your most handsome suit.

577
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:40,840
Of course.

578
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:46,707
(Fight Hard to Win)
(Sorry, I went to the restaurant today.)

579
00:34:47,028 --> 00:34:48,468
(But due to an unexpected accident,)

580
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:49,948
(I missed the time in the end.)

581
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,908
(Are you angry with me?)

582
00:34:52,028 --> 00:34:55,468
(Scrat)
No. We can just reschedule it.

583
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:57,928
(Fight Hard to Win)
(It was my fault.)

584
00:34:58,307 --> 00:34:59,908
(Ask me out next time when you're free.)

585
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:03,624
(Scrat)
(Alright.)

586
00:35:07,348 --> 00:35:11,468
My mister is always so understanding.

587
00:35:14,107 --> 00:35:15,468
Mister.

588
00:35:24,348 --> 00:35:25,320
Morning.

589
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:42,787
What are you guys doing?

590
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:44,548
Ying, when you left
the house this morning,

591
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:48,187
did you hear the magpie chirping?

592
00:35:48,388 --> 00:35:52,508
Correct, and it must be two of them.
Double happiness is upon us.

593
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:57,428
The first joy is right here with me.

594
00:35:57,828 --> 00:35:59,828
Congratulations on being shortlisted
with the glass house

595
00:35:59,988 --> 00:36:01,028
for the ADA award.

596
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:02,908
The invitation
just arrived this morning.

597
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:07,147
(Your work Glass House is shortlisted.)
We're so close to winning it.

598
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:08,508
Just one step away.

599
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:12,908
You guys make it seem like
I have already won.

600
00:36:13,147 --> 00:36:15,388
Ying, I think you really can start
preparing your acceptance speech.

601
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:16,392
Yes, indeed.

602
00:36:18,307 --> 00:36:21,988
Where does the second joy come from?

603
00:36:22,828 --> 00:36:26,508
Since you're going to attend
the award ceremony, you need...

604
00:36:29,672 --> 00:36:30,667
What is this?

605
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:31,560
Just open and see.

606
00:36:31,828 --> 00:36:34,787
This is a dress
that we specially prepared for you.

607
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,707
A small token of our appreciation.
We hope you'll like it.

608
00:36:48,828 --> 00:36:49,736
Thank you.

609
00:36:53,868 --> 00:36:56,828
The nomination is an honor
for our whole studio,

610
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,227
so we should attend it together.

611
00:37:02,348 --> 00:37:03,368
And

612
00:37:04,187 --> 00:37:05,267
since you guys sent me a gift,

613
00:37:05,787 --> 00:37:06,728
I should return the favor.

614
00:37:07,147 --> 00:37:09,667
I will cover the cost
of all of your outfits.

615
00:37:09,948 --> 00:37:11,388
Thank you.

616
00:37:12,227 --> 00:37:13,747
The award ceremony.

617
00:37:14,028 --> 00:37:15,508
- The award ceremony.
- The award ceremony.

618
00:37:15,828 --> 00:37:17,416
- The award ceremony.
- The award ceremony.

619
00:37:18,187 --> 00:37:19,508
Yunsheng, your suggestion was good.

620
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:21,508
The patient's condition
has significantly improved.

621
00:37:21,828 --> 00:37:22,747
Thank you for your trust.

622
00:37:22,988 --> 00:37:24,388
But the plan was somewhat risky.

623
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:27,667
Trust is built up over time.

624
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:30,627
Director, I have something
to discuss with you.

625
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,988
I am leaving now.

626
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:32,908
Okay, you go ahead.

627
00:37:33,187 --> 00:37:34,216
Bye, Dr. Qin.

628
00:37:35,388 --> 00:37:35,627
What?

629
00:37:35,627 --> 00:37:36,616
Director, please take a look.

630
00:37:36,948 --> 00:37:38,267
This is the duty roster for June.

631
00:37:41,707 --> 00:37:42,747
Monday.

632
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:46,667
Yunsheng cannot work that Tuesday.

633
00:37:47,388 --> 00:37:48,232
Why?

634
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:50,227
It's the anniversary of Mi Su's death.

635
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:51,667
He goes to visit the grave

636
00:37:52,948 --> 00:37:53,988
that day every year.

637
00:37:54,908 --> 00:37:55,880
I'm just forgetful.

638
00:37:56,147 --> 00:37:57,267
I forgot such an important thing.

639
00:37:57,627 --> 00:37:58,468
Okay, I got it.

640
00:37:58,828 --> 00:37:59,948
I'll reschedule it right now.

641
00:38:00,348 --> 00:38:01,227
Hurry up.

642
00:38:01,227 --> 00:38:02,184
Yes, Director.

643
00:38:09,468 --> 00:38:10,388
Hello.

644
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,627
Have you finished your shift yet?

645
00:38:12,267 --> 00:38:13,160
Soon.

646
00:38:13,548 --> 00:38:15,267
I'll come to your dorm later.

647
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:19,464
You sound like you have good news.

648
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:20,707
Yes.

649
00:38:22,908 --> 00:38:23,816
Okay.

650
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:58,068
How could you come so quickly?

651
00:38:58,707 --> 00:39:00,068
You don't want it?

652
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:01,627
Yes, I do.

653
00:39:01,988 --> 00:39:03,227
I'm in the middle of tidying up.

654
00:39:05,107 --> 00:39:06,587
Why haven't you unpacked the pillow yet?

655
00:39:07,508 --> 00:39:10,024
I didn't need it before, but...

656
00:39:11,587 --> 00:39:12,508
I'll probably need it soon.

657
00:39:15,068 --> 00:39:17,548
Dr. Qin, is your suit prepared?

658
00:39:18,227 --> 00:39:19,176
It's always been ready...

659
00:39:21,307 --> 00:39:22,280
You are shortlisted?

660
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:24,936
That's amazing!

661
00:39:25,227 --> 00:39:26,227
Slow down.

662
00:39:26,548 --> 00:39:27,528
That's great.

663
00:39:28,147 --> 00:39:29,128
Let me show you.

664
00:39:34,428 --> 00:39:35,400
Look.

665
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:38,664
The invitation.

666
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,772
(Award Ceremony Time: 2 PM on June 21st)

667
00:39:43,107 --> 00:39:44,667
It's on the 21st.

668
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:46,280
Will you be available?

669
00:39:50,107 --> 00:39:51,048
What's wrong?

670
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,012
(21st, Mi Su's death anniversary)

671
00:39:58,747 --> 00:40:00,187
That's the anniversary of Mi Su's death.

672
00:40:06,468 --> 00:40:07,336
Go visit the grave.

673
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:11,468
You do it every year.

674
00:40:11,908 --> 00:40:13,587
It's not good if you don't go this year

675
00:40:13,988 --> 00:40:15,548
just because we got together.

676
00:40:16,988 --> 00:40:17,828
But you...

677
00:40:18,307 --> 00:40:19,988
I know what you're going to say.

678
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:22,428
Think about it. I'm only shortlisted.

679
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:25,107
The competition is fierce.
It'll be so embarrassing

680
00:40:25,428 --> 00:40:26,747
if I don't win in the end, right?

681
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:30,216
Go ahead.

682
00:40:36,707 --> 00:40:37,587
I'll absolutely be there.

683
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:48,968
Here.

684
00:40:50,187 --> 00:40:51,107
Xu Mingshi.

685
00:40:51,107 --> 00:40:52,068
It is mine. Thanks.

686
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:53,032
Here you are.

687
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,787
Let me eat.

688
00:41:09,988 --> 00:41:11,187
So nice.

689
00:41:18,147 --> 00:41:19,144
(Scrat)
(What are you doing?)

690
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:24,328
(Fight Hard to Win)
(Eating.)

691
00:41:24,828 --> 00:41:26,147
(Let me share some good news with you.)

692
00:41:26,587 --> 00:41:28,627
(My bestie is nominated for the ADA,)

693
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:30,828
(so I must celebrate it today.)

694
00:41:33,028 --> 00:41:34,088
(Scrat)
Congratulations.

695
00:41:39,988 --> 00:41:42,587
(Fight Hard to Win)
(Thanks to her, I'll attend the ceremony.)

696
00:41:46,028 --> 00:41:47,107
(Scrat)
I know.

697
00:41:47,908 --> 00:41:50,508
(This award is the benchmark
of the architectural design industry.)

698
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:53,028
(It brings together
the best designers in the industry.)

699
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:55,147
You're very knowledgeable.

700
00:41:56,587 --> 00:41:58,868
I knew you must be a great designer.

701
00:42:02,267 --> 00:42:05,468
(Fight Hard to Win)
(You know a lot and appear professional.)

702
00:42:06,187 --> 00:42:08,468
(I feel like you're a great designer.)

703
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:11,948
(So are you going too?)

704
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:23,880
(Scrat)
Yes.

705
00:42:29,988 --> 00:42:30,988
(He will go.)

706
00:42:34,508 --> 00:42:37,307
(Scrat)
(So let's meet on ADA night.)

707
00:42:41,948 --> 00:42:43,048
(Fight Hard to Win)
(Okay.)

708
00:42:47,187 --> 00:42:48,028
Yes!

709
00:42:51,747 --> 00:42:54,248
Xu Mingshi, you must succeed.

710
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:56,680
