Mingshi, this is too cool.

(Tomb of the beloved daughter, Mi Su)

30
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:33,195
The concept and philosophy of design

31
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,596
stems from rebellion against the world

32
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,676
and a treasuring of traditional culture.

33
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,835
Since the Industrial Revolution,

34
00:04:41,356 --> 00:04:43,515
the pace of our lives
has been escalating,

35
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,596
which

36
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:47,716
has caused our architectural forms

37
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:49,716
to be compressed to increasing flatness.

38
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:50,515
Looking for someone?

00:04:50,835 --> 00:04:51,916

00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:52,596
which is

54
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:56,356
the awarding
of the Best Architectural Design.

55
00:05:57,036 --> 00:06:00,036
Let's have our award presenter

56
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:03,635

62
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:31,716
but can still be reborn from ashes.

Let's welcome the award-winner,

69
00:07:01,835 --> 00:07:02,676
Miss Su Ying,

70
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:03,716
to accept the award.

71
00:07:34,116 --> 00:07:34,596
Thank you.

72
00:07:34,676 --> 00:07:35,156
Congrats.

73
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:38,315
Thank you.

74
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:02,036
Let me share with you one more thing.

75
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:04,040
You may not know

76
00:08:04,395 --> 00:08:07,116
that behind this beautiful building,

77
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:09,515
there's a tragic love story.

78
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,116
Once upon a time, a young man

79
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:16,716
built this beautiful glass building

80
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:18,916
by the sea

81
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:20,680
for his girlfriend

82
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:22,356
and accompanied her

83
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:25,395
until the end of her life.

84
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:27,755
I believe this deep affection

85
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:31,476
will never be surpassed.

86
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:42,275
Next, let's have Miss Su
say a few words for us.

87
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:36,196
Dr. Qin,

88
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:42,476
you're late...

89
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:04,875
but you are the VIP in my life.

90
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:10,088
Next,

91
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:12,515
I'm going to start my acceptance speech.

92
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:13,675
Please sit.

93
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:32,716
Thanks to the committee
for their acknowledgment

94
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:36,035
and to everyone for their love
for the glass house.

95
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:37,436
Thanks to my team

96
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:40,196
and to the glass house
for the honor that it has brought me.

97
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:41,555
Thank you, everyone.

98
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:49,155
I love glass

99
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:51,755
because it's transparent and pure,

100
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:54,035
and it allows more sunlight
to shine into the room.

101
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,196
It's bright and healing.

102
00:11:57,596 --> 00:11:58,236
Here,

103
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:00,956
I want to thank the glass house again

104
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,316
because it introduced me to a person,

105
00:12:07,956 --> 00:12:09,196
a warm and resolute person

106
00:12:09,915 --> 00:12:11,035
like sunlight

107
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:13,555
shining into my heart.

108
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:18,035
He's with me when I wait for the wind.

109
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:20,275
He gives me a starry sky

110
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:21,996
when I'm down.

111
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:25,795
He sacrifices silently

112
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,515
to protect my work.

113
00:12:30,356 --> 00:12:31,755
Whenever I need him,

114
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:34,035
he is there.

115
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:39,956
♪You make the changing seasons♪

116
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:41,224
Before I met him,

117
00:12:42,356 --> 00:12:43,515
I was just living in the moment,

118
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:45,875
never caring about the future.

119
00:12:49,155 --> 00:12:50,476
But after I met him,

120
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:53,515
I started

121
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:56,795
to have expectations.

122
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:03,436
I want to go see the future with him.

123
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:06,596
He once said,

124
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:08,996
"Love

125
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:11,596
is something
that makes two people happy."

126
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:15,755
So I'm grateful to him.

127
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:19,116
I am now

128
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:22,436
very happy.

129
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:41,675
It seems he's not coming today.

130
00:13:58,716 --> 00:13:59,356
Huixuan.

131
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:02,436
You haven't left yet.

132
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:04,635
These are for you.

133
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:08,356
Why did you do it out of the blue?

134
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:09,915
I am Scrat.

135
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:12,035
You are Scrat.

136
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:14,996
So the person

137
00:14:15,476 --> 00:14:17,155
who's been chatting with me lately

138
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:17,956
is you.

139
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:20,515
Not just these days.

140
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:23,316
It's been five years.

141
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,236
In fact, over the past five years,

142
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,395
I have had a crush on you.

143
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:32,675
It's just that you never noticed it.

144
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:38,836
I-I like it

145
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:40,155
when you get drunk

146
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:41,555
and throw tantrums.

147
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:42,956
It's incredibly cute.

148
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:52,116
And I like it

149
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:53,675
when you stand up for your friends.

150
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:55,356
It's very cool, very loyal.

151
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:09,356
Anyway, I like everything about you.

152
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:14,795
I know you're a very strong person.

153
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:16,836
You can enjoy loneliness

154
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:18,196
all by yourself.

155
00:15:22,476 --> 00:15:23,476
And you said

156
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:24,515
only work

157
00:15:25,436 --> 00:15:26,635
could give you a sense of security.

158
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:31,395
That's because you've never even tried

159
00:15:31,476 --> 00:15:32,675
relying on another person.

160
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:35,356
But now I am here.

161
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:37,795
Could you give me a chance

162
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:39,395
and try it out?

163
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:55,635
Huixuan,

164
00:15:56,795 --> 00:15:57,436
I'm into you.

165
00:16:02,515 --> 00:16:03,395
Mingshi,

166
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:08,476
t-t-this is too sudden for me.

167
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:14,196
I've always thought of you
as a younger brother.

168
00:16:15,196 --> 00:16:16,635
I know you're good,

169
00:16:17,515 --> 00:16:19,116
but I never thought

170
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,755
between us,

171
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:23,436
there would be other feelings involved.

172
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:26,395
I don't know what you think.

173
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:28,035
I only know

174
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:30,155
when I was lost,

175
00:16:30,555 --> 00:16:31,915
you comforted and encouraged me,

176
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:34,555
and that you helped me find my new way.

177
00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:36,755
All of it has made me realize

178
00:16:37,116 --> 00:16:38,795
you're the girl I want to take care of.

179
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:44,116
Perhaps this isn't love,

180
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:48,076
but

181
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,155
your gratitude towards me.

182
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:52,275
No,

183
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:54,035
I've thought it through.

184
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:57,836
Please say yes.

185
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:16,396
Please don't say it.

186
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,476
I-I don't want us
not to be friends anymore.

to put this trophy in the glass house?

226
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:43,275
It belongs to the glass house.

227
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:45,035
Where else should it be put?

228
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:47,436
That makes sense.

229
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,396
We should find a good place.

230
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:52,035
You choose.

231
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:52,835
Me?

232
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,476
You say where it should be put, okay?

233
00:20:54,676 --> 00:20:56,196
Okay, let's see later.

234
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:02,315
Why are the lights on?

235
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,876
I remember I turned them off.

236
00:21:05,835 --> 00:21:08,075
You forgot to turn off the lights.

237
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:08,956
I remember you.

238
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:10,156
What's on your mind?

239
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:10,996
You.

240
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:12,476
Alright,

241
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,755
good.

242
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:16,956
Where will you put it?

243
00:21:18,555 --> 00:21:19,405
I'll find a place later.

244
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:20,795
Just leave it here for now.

245
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:22,075
Just here?

246
00:21:22,236 --> 00:21:22,676
Yes, for now.

247
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:23,515
Not somewhere else?

248
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:24,916
Amazing.

249
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:37,795
Yunsheng.

250
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:07,752
Yunsheng, it's been a long time.

251
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:12,355
This is Mi Bai,

252
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:13,795
Mi Su's twin sister.

253
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:15,755
Hello.

254
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:18,024
You are Su Ying, right?

255
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:19,835
I've seen your show.

256
00:22:21,196 --> 00:22:22,795
Yeah, I'm Su Ying.

257
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:24,956
It's the anniversary of Su's death.

258
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:26,555
I just came back from the cemetery

259
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,075
and thought about
dropping by the glass house.

260
00:22:30,555 --> 00:22:31,035
I see.

261
00:22:31,555 --> 00:22:32,716
Let me introduce her to you.

262
00:22:33,595 --> 00:22:35,916
Su Ying is the designer
of the glass house

263
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:38,555
and also my current girlfriend.

264
00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:40,956
I know.

265
00:22:41,515 --> 00:22:42,676
Before I returned,

266
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,716
Yisen already told me about it.

267
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:47,075
That's not surprising.

268
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:50,595
I'll leave you guys

269
00:22:50,676 --> 00:22:51,835
and get some water for you.

270
00:22:56,035 --> 00:22:56,795
Yunsheng,

271
00:22:57,355 --> 00:22:58,515
I heard you came back to cardio.

272
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,636
Yes, just a few days ago.

273
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:02,396
Does Yisen know that you are back?

274
00:23:03,835 --> 00:23:05,996
I haven't told anyone
about my return yet.

275
00:23:07,676 --> 00:23:08,716
How long are you going

276
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:09,835
to stay this time?

277
00:23:10,876 --> 00:23:12,436
I plan to settle down this time.

278
00:23:17,115 --> 00:23:17,835
Here, water.

279
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:18,716
Thank you.

280
00:23:18,795 --> 00:23:19,355
You're welcome.

281
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:25,315
I noticed just now the house
had been beautifully renovated.

282
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:26,555
It's quite special,

283
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,196
but

284
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:30,115
many details have changed,

285
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:32,795
which has made it a bit strange to me.

286
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:34,636
You just came back.

287
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:36,676
It will take some time to adjust

288
00:23:37,236 --> 00:23:38,595
to the life and environment here.

289
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:39,996
Yes.

290
00:23:40,515 --> 00:23:42,636
If you need any help,
feel free to let us know anytime.

291
00:23:43,075 --> 00:23:44,075
Alright, thank you.

292
00:23:44,476 --> 00:23:46,236
I haven't had a break
since I got off the plane.

293
00:23:46,755 --> 00:23:47,676
I'll go back to the hotel.

294
00:23:48,196 --> 00:23:49,236
I'm leaving.

295
00:23:49,956 --> 00:23:51,795
Okay. We won't see you off.

296
00:23:53,636 --> 00:23:54,236
Goodbye.

297
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:15,196
How come I never heard
you mention before

298
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:17,115
Mi Su had a twin sister?

299
00:24:18,436 --> 00:24:19,755
Do you remember Yisen

300
00:24:19,755 --> 00:24:21,515
often mentions someone called Bai?

301
00:24:23,876 --> 00:24:24,835
It's her!

302
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,075
We were in the same school.

303
00:24:27,595 --> 00:24:28,876
She was two years younger than us

304
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,075
and went abroad to study later.

305
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:34,115
It's been years
since the last time I saw her.

306
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:37,515
Why did she come back suddenly?

307
00:24:38,636 --> 00:24:39,755
I am not quite sure about this.

308
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,956
But I heard she had been researching

309
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:44,436
cutting-edge medical technology abroad

310
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:46,716
and had achieved a lot in the field

311
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,115
of artificial hearts.

312
00:24:50,676 --> 00:24:51,996
That must be a hard time.

313
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:55,636
She's always independent

314
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:56,956
and strong-willed.

315
00:24:57,876 --> 00:24:58,795
She chose to study medicine

316
00:24:59,075 --> 00:25:00,156
for two reasons.

317
00:25:01,436 --> 00:25:02,856
One was because of Mi Su,

318
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:05,035
and the other was because of her father.

319
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:08,716
Her father is a board member
of the Meichi Hospital

320
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:10,355
and known to my parents

321
00:25:10,755 --> 00:25:11,755
for quite a long time.

322
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:14,088
So she comes of a line of doctors.

323
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,096
So you guys

324
00:25:17,236 --> 00:25:18,408
grew up together?

325
00:25:20,315 --> 00:25:21,476
Not exactly,

326
00:25:21,515 --> 00:25:22,696
but we often hung out together.

327
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:25,000
No wonder.

328
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:29,864
She just sent me a message.

329
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:31,755
What did she say?

330
00:25:32,835 --> 00:25:35,035
She said she didn't expect
to bump into us at the glass house

331
00:25:35,876 --> 00:25:36,795
and wanted to invite you

332
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:39,555
to dinner to apologize for scaring you.

333
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:41,795
It's okay.

334
00:25:43,115 --> 00:25:44,196
Let's treat her instead.

335
00:25:44,595 --> 00:25:45,956
She just came back from abroad.

336
00:25:45,956 --> 00:25:46,956
We should take care of her.

337
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:49,555
Okay, I will take your advice.

338
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:02,916
Good morning.

339
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:03,595
- Morning.
- Morning.

340
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:04,236
Ying, morning.

341
00:26:07,156 --> 00:26:07,752
Where's Mingshi?

342
00:26:08,156 --> 00:26:08,776
I didn't see him.

343
00:26:09,075 --> 00:26:10,075
He hasn't arrived yet.

344
00:26:11,156 --> 00:26:11,835
What time is it now?

345
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:16,755
(Ying,)

346
00:26:17,436 --> 00:26:19,156
(I want to take the day off today.)

347
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:24,075
(You're not sick, are you?)

348
00:26:28,156 --> 00:26:28,636
(No.)

349
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,476
(Okay, have a good rest today.)

350
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:38,876
(There's something important.)

351
00:26:42,216 --> 00:26:45,275
(Meichi International Hospital)

352
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:46,035
Your information

353
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:47,755
has been verified
and there are no issues.

354
00:26:48,676 --> 00:26:49,636
I want to tell you that.

355
00:26:49,835 --> 00:26:50,835
The work environment abroad

356
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:52,755
is quite different
from that in our country,

357
00:26:53,515 --> 00:26:55,436
so I hope you can focus and integrate

358
00:26:55,835 --> 00:26:58,156
into our big family as soon as possible.

359
00:26:58,795 --> 00:26:59,476
I will, Director.

360
00:26:59,595 --> 00:27:02,436
Okay, now let me introduce you
to your colleagues. Let's go.

361
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:04,515
Let's go.

362
00:27:04,676 --> 00:27:05,075
Go.

363
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:07,115
Let me introduce her to you all.

364
00:27:07,315 --> 00:27:08,916
This is Dr. Mi Bai.

365
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:11,035
She has been studying

366
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:12,676
abroad all along

367
00:27:13,075 --> 00:27:14,115
and specializes

368
00:27:14,515 --> 00:27:15,835
in artificial heart transplantation.

369
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:17,156
She will help

370
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:18,996
our hospital

371
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:21,436
with state-of-the-art medical technology
in the world.

372
00:27:21,436 --> 00:27:23,636
She's now the medical director
of our hospital.

373
00:27:23,716 --> 00:27:24,476
A very welcome to her.

374
00:27:28,996 --> 00:27:32,072
These are your future mates.

375
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:33,835
You can communicate with them.

376
00:27:35,396 --> 00:27:36,115
You just came back.

377
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:38,636
I'll show you around the hospital.

378
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:40,555
Director,

379
00:27:40,555 --> 00:27:42,156
you're so busy, so I won't trouble you.

380
00:27:42,275 --> 00:27:43,876
Let Yunsheng show me around.

381
00:27:46,555 --> 00:27:47,595
Okay, no problem.

382
00:27:47,795 --> 00:27:49,476
Alright, you guys go ahead.

383
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:58,436
This is just too similar.

384
00:27:59,315 --> 00:28:00,236
It's exactly the same.

385
00:28:01,355 --> 00:28:02,376
Who does she resemble?

386
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:05,755
Stop being so gossipy.

387
00:28:06,156 --> 00:28:06,636
Dismissed.

388
00:28:09,636 --> 00:28:10,115
Director,

389
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,880
c-c-can we leave now?

390
00:28:12,156 --> 00:28:12,555
Yes.

391
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:14,315
Director Han, you can leave now.

392
00:28:15,595 --> 00:28:16,396
Get back to your work.

393
00:28:18,555 --> 00:28:20,196
Let's start with
the cardiac surgery department.

394
00:28:20,876 --> 00:28:22,275
This row is full of wards.

395
00:28:22,956 --> 00:28:24,616
The one in front is our changing room.

396
00:28:26,236 --> 00:28:26,956
Yunsheng,

397
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:28,755
thank you for showing me around.

398
00:28:29,196 --> 00:28:29,835
You don't have to.

399
00:28:31,515 --> 00:28:33,035
I have lunch plans with Yisen.

400
00:28:33,035 --> 00:28:33,755
Do you wanna join us?

401
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:35,315
Yes, I haven't seen him for so long.

402
00:28:35,795 --> 00:28:37,156
He'll be happy to see you.

403
00:28:39,795 --> 00:28:40,795
He said it was an old friend.

404
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:41,636
Here's the canteen.

405
00:28:41,716 --> 00:28:43,636
Who is that mysterious person?

406
00:28:45,196 --> 00:28:45,716
Zhang Yisen.

407
00:28:46,755 --> 00:28:47,355
Look who's here.

408
00:28:47,956 --> 00:28:48,716
Yisen.

409
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:53,515
Bai.

410
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:57,315
You're back!

411
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:58,275
How are you?

412
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:00,712
Did you not get used to
the food over there?

413
00:29:00,795 --> 00:29:01,196
It's good.

414
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:02,676
Why didn't you tell me you'd come back?

415
00:29:02,835 --> 00:29:03,636
I didn't get prepared.

416
00:29:04,315 --> 00:29:05,555
I just arrived at Qingyu last night.

417
00:29:05,795 --> 00:29:07,515
Busy all day yesterday,
I was too tired to tell you.

418
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:10,088
Let her sit.

419
00:29:10,795 --> 00:29:11,996
Have a seat.

420
00:29:13,355 --> 00:29:14,315
You didn't tell me either.

421
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:15,115
It's a surprise.

422
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:15,876
What a great meal.

423
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:17,355
Well...

424
00:29:18,876 --> 00:29:20,552
You've already started your job?

425
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:22,555
Cardiac surgery department.

426
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:24,104
Medical director.

427
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,956
You didn't go abroad for nothing.

428
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:27,956
Have you met your colleagues?

429
00:29:28,196 --> 00:29:29,555
Director Ruan is really nice.

430
00:29:29,956 --> 00:29:30,835
So is Ms. Han.

431
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:31,876
Let her eat first.

432
00:29:33,115 --> 00:29:34,568
Yes, let's have lunch first.

433
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:37,035
Why is Yisen still the same as before?

434
00:29:37,035 --> 00:29:38,595
So talkative. He hasn't changed at all.

435
00:29:39,436 --> 00:29:40,355
I'm not nagging.

436
00:29:40,555 --> 00:29:42,236
I'm showing my concern.

437
00:29:43,355 --> 00:29:44,075
Bai,

438
00:29:44,636 --> 00:29:45,636
where are you living?

439
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:46,952
I'm still staying in a hotel.

440
00:29:47,355 --> 00:29:48,072
Staying in a hotel?

441
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:49,795
It's so boring.

442
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:51,676
Yunsheng and I are living
in the dormitory.

443
00:29:51,676 --> 00:29:52,636
You might as well move over.

444
00:29:52,636 --> 00:29:53,992
It would be lively.

445
00:29:55,595 --> 00:29:56,072
Sure.

446
00:29:56,355 --> 00:29:56,835
Really?

447
00:29:57,636 --> 00:29:59,368
I'll help you move later.

448
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:01,236
Eat more.

449
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:04,264
Really good.

450
00:30:06,315 --> 00:30:07,676
You want to live in the staff dormitory?

451
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:08,996
Yes.

452
00:30:09,515 --> 00:30:10,716
You have a rent allowance.

453
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:12,515
You can find a better place.

454
00:30:13,156 --> 00:30:13,636
Director,

455
00:30:13,956 --> 00:30:16,355
the staff dormitory
of our hospital is not bad.

456
00:30:16,355 --> 00:30:17,275
Besides,

457
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:18,916
living with everyone

458
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:21,476
can help me adjust more quickly.

459
00:30:22,595 --> 00:30:23,275
That's true.

460
00:30:23,795 --> 00:30:24,835
Which dormitory?

461
00:30:25,996 --> 00:30:27,275
I want to live

462
00:30:27,436 --> 00:30:29,156
beside Yisen and Yunsheng's dormitory

463
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:31,676
because they're the ones
I know the best in this hospital.

464
00:30:33,956 --> 00:30:35,196
Okay, I'll arrange it then.

465
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:36,515
Thank you.

466
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:37,315
Go to work.

467
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:42,636
So you knew all along

468
00:30:42,795 --> 00:30:44,396
Mingshi was Scrat?

469
00:30:45,835 --> 00:30:48,616
Just a little bit earlier than you.

470
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:49,636
How would I know

471
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:52,072
he would confess to you
after the award ceremony?

472
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:54,315
I didn't expect it either.

473
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,115
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

474
00:30:57,115 --> 00:30:59,304
See how awkward we are now.

475
00:30:59,876 --> 00:31:01,555
Yes, it is my fault.

476
00:31:01,835 --> 00:31:02,916
I didn't consider it fully.

477
00:31:03,436 --> 00:31:04,515
I saw

478
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:06,636
you and Scrat had a special connection,

479
00:31:06,996 --> 00:31:08,996
so I thought you two were
destined to be soul mates.

480
00:31:09,795 --> 00:31:12,424
That was because I didn't know
he was Mingshi.

481
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:14,664
If he's Mingshi,
of course he understands me.

482
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,747
So you rejected him.

483
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:20,947
What else could I do?

484
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,667
I've always regarded him

485
00:31:23,688 --> 00:31:24,987
as my younger brother.

486
00:31:25,628 --> 00:31:26,028
Well.

487
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:29,747
I've never thought about
that possibility.

488
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:33,108
Come on. I know you're oblivious,

489
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,108
but I didn't expect you
to be this oblivious.

490
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:37,548
It's obvious that Xu Mingshi likes you.

491
00:31:37,947 --> 00:31:39,187
You were busy with work before.

492
00:31:39,507 --> 00:31:41,267
Once I brought up relationships,
you would say,

493
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:42,868
"Being single is nice."

494
00:31:43,144 --> 00:31:43,987
How could I tell you?

495
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:50,427
He didn't come to work today.

496
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:52,707
I thought it was about personal matters.

497
00:31:53,588 --> 00:31:55,227
Now it seems he must be hurting,

498
00:31:55,308 --> 00:31:56,467
and crying at home.

499
00:31:57,308 --> 00:31:58,308
Poor thing.

500
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:01,548
So what do I do now?

501
00:32:03,784 --> 00:32:05,028
Do what?

502
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,227
Both of you are dear to me.

503
00:32:09,768 --> 00:32:10,348
I'm asking you.

504
00:32:12,068 --> 00:32:12,987
Do you hate Mingshi?

505
00:32:13,672 --> 00:32:14,467
No, I don't.

506
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:17,308
Do you still want
to be friends with him?

507
00:32:17,576 --> 00:32:18,267
Of course.

508
00:32:18,408 --> 00:32:19,588
As long as he doesn't mind,

509
00:32:19,747 --> 00:32:20,348
I have no problem.

510
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,788
Then it's easy.

511
00:32:23,628 --> 00:32:24,427
I think

512
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:27,707
you are just startled

513
00:32:27,707 --> 00:32:28,947
by his sudden confession.

514
00:32:29,348 --> 00:32:30,187
You're thrown for a loop.

515
00:32:30,588 --> 00:32:32,108
So you don't have to rush it.

516
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:33,388
Forget anything

517
00:32:33,707 --> 00:32:34,467
for now.

518
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:36,388
Because your mind is in chaos,
you won't work it out.

519
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,467
After you regain your clear mind later,

520
00:32:38,747 --> 00:32:39,828
take your time to consider

521
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:43,028
what kind of feelings
you actually have towards Mingshi.

522
00:32:43,507 --> 00:32:43,907
Okay?

523
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:47,947
But I...

524
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:48,667
No buts.

525
00:32:49,108 --> 00:32:50,667
Give yourself some time

526
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,267
and give him some time too.

527
00:32:52,427 --> 00:32:53,507
Let him recover himself.

528
00:32:58,548 --> 00:32:59,628
That's the only way.

529
00:33:02,987 --> 00:33:05,348
I'll leave Mingshi to you then.

530
00:33:05,576 --> 00:33:06,747
Okay, I'll handle it.

531
00:33:17,064 --> 00:33:19,108
Huixuan rejected Mingshi's confession?

532
00:33:20,187 --> 00:33:20,907
Yes.

533
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:22,628
He didn't even come to work today.

534
00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:23,667
He must be feeling bad.

535
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:25,507
So I'm calling you

536
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:27,548
to ask you to comfort him.

537
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:29,148
I see.

538
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:32,227
After I finish work,

539
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:34,028
I'll get him to Piyixia for a chat.

540
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,308
Thank you, Dr. Qin.

541
00:33:36,868 --> 00:33:38,108
I'll come to see you once I'm done.

542
00:33:38,707 --> 00:33:39,108
Alright.

543
00:33:39,548 --> 00:33:40,068
Bye.

544
00:33:46,788 --> 00:33:49,308
(Piyixia)
Things aren't going my way.

545
00:33:55,628 --> 00:33:56,308
Thanks, bro.

546
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:57,548
Thanks.

547
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:00,108
See? He's too young.

548
00:34:00,108 --> 00:34:01,868
He's already had five or six cans.

549
00:34:02,747 --> 00:34:03,628
How's it, little bro?

550
00:34:03,944 --> 00:34:04,776
Do you need more beer?

551
00:34:05,068 --> 00:34:05,667
I'll go get it.

552
00:34:05,987 --> 00:34:08,227
I'm not a little brother.

553
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:10,028
Don't mention it to me.

554
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:12,267
Let me tell you.
You are just a little boy.

555
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:18,267
No, I don't mean that.

556
00:34:19,347 --> 00:34:20,347
I mean,

557
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:23,148
you can change to another one, right?

558
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:24,707
You're still young.

559
00:34:28,548 --> 00:34:31,752
Being young isn't my fault.

560
00:34:31,752 --> 00:34:34,787
I think I'm quite mature.

561
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:37,347
Mingshi,

562
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:40,508
though it's really painful
to have an unrequited love,

563
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:43,187
every coin has two sides.

564
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:44,827
From another perspective,

565
00:34:44,988 --> 00:34:46,988
at least she knows
you don't see her as a sister

566
00:34:46,988 --> 00:34:47,988
but as a crush.

567
00:34:49,707 --> 00:34:50,068
Right?

568
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:50,908
A crush.

569
00:34:53,428 --> 00:34:53,908
Crush?

570
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:56,548
You are crushing on someone?

571
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:59,068
Let me tell you. I have a crush, too.

572
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:01,387
It's really tiring.

573
00:35:01,747 --> 00:35:04,267
I'm shy of talking to her

574
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:05,628
and afraid of her anger and neglect.

575
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:07,387
Yes, that's the feeling.

576
00:35:07,548 --> 00:35:08,468
It's just like...

577
00:35:08,787 --> 00:35:10,068
Well...

578
00:35:10,948 --> 00:35:11,908
We are here comforting him.

579
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,227
Don't mess it up.

580
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:14,908
No, I...

581
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:16,588
Let me tell you, bro.

582
00:35:16,787 --> 00:35:17,988
This is like what?

583
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:20,347
Have you had buffet meals?

584
00:35:20,948 --> 00:35:21,428
Yes.

585
00:35:22,148 --> 00:35:24,307
Some people eat buffet to get full.

586
00:35:24,908 --> 00:35:26,387
And some are
for making their money worth it.

587
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:27,787
But think about it.

588
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:29,187
You can't stuff yourself to death

589
00:35:29,347 --> 00:35:31,028
just to make your money worth it, right?

590
00:35:31,347 --> 00:35:31,787
Right?

591
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:32,872
What do you mean?

592
00:35:33,672 --> 00:35:36,948
He means you can't do it for nothing.

593
00:35:38,747 --> 00:35:39,548
Let me tell you.

594
00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:41,428
Having a crush
on someone for so many years

595
00:35:41,588 --> 00:35:42,908
proves it's true love,

596
00:35:43,068 --> 00:35:44,948
so you must persist, you know?

597
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:48,187
Yisen is right.

598
00:35:48,428 --> 00:35:50,667
It's not easy to meet someone

599
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:51,468
worth loving,

600
00:35:51,628 --> 00:35:53,187
so you can't give it up easily.

601
00:35:53,747 --> 00:35:54,867
Don't worry, Yunsheng.

602
00:35:54,948 --> 00:35:56,347
I will never give up.

603
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:58,408
But

604
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:00,508
I think

605
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:03,827
I've given her all I can give,

606
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:05,747
but she still can't feel it.

607
00:36:06,508 --> 00:36:08,588
Maybe she just doesn't like me.

608
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:10,908
See, this is the root of your problem.

609
00:36:11,747 --> 00:36:12,588
As the old saying goes,

610
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:14,028
love is a science.

611
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:16,468
You shouldn't always
try to chase too hard.

612
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:17,508
Give her some space.

613
00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:18,028
Some space.

614
00:36:18,227 --> 00:36:20,747
You should keep your distance
on the surface,

615
00:36:21,224 --> 00:36:22,747
but not really too far away from her.

616
00:36:23,176 --> 00:36:24,667
Play hard to get.

617
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:25,960
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

618
00:36:26,508 --> 00:36:28,267
Get close to her and distant
from her now and then.

619
00:36:28,548 --> 00:36:30,068
That's more or less the idea,

620
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,267
but don't go too much, understand?

621
00:36:33,187 --> 00:36:35,747
How can I be sure that I do it right?

622
00:36:36,148 --> 00:36:36,988
Yisen, you tell him.

623
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:39,867
Well...

624
00:36:41,187 --> 00:36:41,787
Is the beer good?

625
00:36:42,148 --> 00:36:42,667
Yes.

626
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:44,548
One bottle is fine.

627
00:36:45,148 --> 00:36:46,108
Drinking too much is bad.

628
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:47,707
So if you don't make it

629
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:49,267
obvious,

630
00:36:49,588 --> 00:36:50,747
she can't feel it.

631
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:53,628
If you are too glued to her,
it will be annoying.

632
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:56,428
So

633
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:58,787
am I very annoying?

634
00:36:59,747 --> 00:37:01,508
I'll change it.

635
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,108
Mingshi,

636
00:37:04,227 --> 00:37:05,028
the most important thing

637
00:37:05,548 --> 00:37:06,508
is your sincerity

638
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:07,787
and genuineness.

639
00:37:10,707 --> 00:37:11,508
Genuineness

640
00:37:12,307 --> 00:37:13,108
and sincerity.

641
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,148
Buffet.

642
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:19,028
Absence.

643
00:37:20,347 --> 00:37:21,867
Playing hard to get.

644
00:37:23,148 --> 00:37:24,187
Don't be annoying.

645
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:26,548
I understand now.

646
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:28,307
Thank you, bros,

647
00:37:29,307 --> 00:37:30,148
for your guidance.

648
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,548
The road is long.

649
00:37:33,387 --> 00:37:34,028
Take it slow.

650
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,187
You can make it. Go for it.

651
00:37:36,904 --> 00:37:37,428
Yes.

652
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,296
(WeChat Moments)

653
00:38:00,787 --> 00:38:01,988
In fact, over the past five years,

654
00:38:02,867 --> 00:38:04,148
I have had a crush on you.

655
00:38:05,187 --> 00:38:06,468
It's just that you never noticed it.

656
00:38:26,468 --> 00:38:27,148
Thank you.

657
00:38:28,827 --> 00:38:29,548
How have you been?

658
00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:31,307
Have you got used to it?

659
00:38:32,028 --> 00:38:33,787
Yes, and Ying treats me very well.

660
00:38:34,028 --> 00:38:36,108
Our studio doesn't have many people now,

661
00:38:36,428 --> 00:38:37,628
but it's quite harmonious.

662
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:38,867
That's good.

663
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:42,148
Have you lost weight?

664
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:42,948
Have I?

665
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,867
Ying has been quite busy recently.

666
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:46,187
She's not overworking you, right?

667
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:47,628
No.

668
00:38:48,168 --> 00:38:50,548
She's in the early stage of her venture.

669
00:38:50,908 --> 00:38:52,707
We do have a large workload,

670
00:38:53,028 --> 00:38:53,628
but

671
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:56,108
I do have many shortcomings
and require learning.

672
00:38:56,108 --> 00:38:56,867
I can gain experience.

673
00:38:57,588 --> 00:38:58,108
That's fine.

674
00:38:58,628 --> 00:38:59,588
If she ever exploits you,

675
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:00,508
tell me.

676
00:39:00,827 --> 00:39:02,267
I'll stand up for you immediately.

677
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:04,307
I'll stop her from turning into

678
00:39:04,707 --> 00:39:05,988
a wicked capitalist.

679
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:08,028
Okay, she won't.

680
00:39:17,227 --> 00:39:17,787
How is it?

681
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:18,667
It's good.

682
00:39:19,068 --> 00:39:20,347
What flavor is this? So unique.

683
00:39:20,628 --> 00:39:21,827
This is my favorite,

684
00:39:22,508 --> 00:39:24,108
coffee with hazelnut syrup.

685
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:27,548
Hazelnut-flavored?

686
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:30,267
Oh, right.

687
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:31,548
Huixuan,

688
00:39:32,227 --> 00:39:34,508
this is a sandwich I made.

689
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:35,588
Do you wanna try it?

690
00:39:35,948 --> 00:39:36,548
Have you eaten?

691
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:39,068
You even know how to make a sandwich?

692
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:40,028
Yes, it's very simple.

693
00:39:40,187 --> 00:39:42,588
Just put two pieces of bread together,
and cut it with a knife.

694
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:44,387
Sounds good.

695
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:45,320
- I'll taste it.
- Try it.

696
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:53,508
How is it?

697
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,712
I didn't expect

698
00:39:56,712 --> 00:39:59,387
a man like you could make
such a delicious sandwich.

699
00:40:00,428 --> 00:40:01,948
Don't just watch me eat.
You have some too.

700
00:40:19,548 --> 00:40:20,307
How's it going?

701
00:40:20,744 --> 00:40:22,227
How's the situation over there?

702
00:40:24,068 --> 00:40:24,548
It's good.

703
00:40:25,068 --> 00:40:26,588
Mingshi doesn't like
to overthink things.

704
00:40:27,307 --> 00:40:27,707
Not bad.

705
00:40:28,307 --> 00:40:28,988
Fine.

706
00:40:30,307 --> 00:40:31,548
After all, he was rejected by someone

707
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:33,387
he crushed on for so many years.

708
00:40:33,787 --> 00:40:34,747
Of course he's heartbroken.

709
00:40:35,816 --> 00:40:37,028
He's lucky to have you comfort him.

710
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,908
Sure, I should.

711
00:40:39,227 --> 00:40:40,387
But he can only

712
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:42,988
get over it by himself.

713
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,787
I really think they are a good match.

714
00:40:48,468 --> 00:40:49,896
They have their own path to take.

715
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:50,867
Now,

716
00:40:51,468 --> 00:40:52,347
let's talk about ours.

717
00:40:54,312 --> 00:40:55,667
I'm buying two movie tickets tomorrow.

718
00:40:56,392 --> 00:40:57,387
We're going to watch a movie.

719
00:40:57,628 --> 00:40:58,227
Really?

720
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,468
Yes.

721
00:41:00,264 --> 00:41:02,068
After the movie, we'll grab a meal.

722
00:41:02,216 --> 00:41:02,827
Perfect.

723
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:10,307
Mi Bai.

724
00:41:13,192 --> 00:41:13,908
Hello, Bai.

725
00:41:14,227 --> 00:41:15,747
Hello, Yunsheng.

726
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:18,028
Could you help me move tomorrow?

727
00:41:18,628 --> 00:41:19,227
Move home?

728
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:20,508
Yes.

729
00:41:20,808 --> 00:41:22,988
I brought a lot of baggage this time.

730
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:26,387
Go ahead.

731
00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:28,628
Sure.

732
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:30,867
If it's too much,
I'll call Yisen for help

733
00:41:31,267 --> 00:41:33,108
so that the moving will be faster.

734
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,468
Okay. Thank you, Yunsheng.

735
00:41:40,588 --> 00:41:41,307
We can reschedule it.

736
00:41:43,548 --> 00:41:44,988
Mi Bai came back from abroad alone.

737
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,108
Not many friends here.

738
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:47,227
Try to help her if you can.

739
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,227
Alright.

740
00:41:55,624 --> 00:41:56,948
(You may not know)

741
00:41:57,267 --> 00:41:59,068
(that behind this beautiful building,)

742
00:41:59,227 --> 00:42:00,867
(there's a tragic love story.)

743
00:42:01,256 --> 00:42:02,108
(A young man)

744
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:06,108
(built this beautiful glass building)

745
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:07,747
(by the sea)

746
00:42:08,148 --> 00:42:09,588
(for his girlfriend)

747
00:42:10,108 --> 00:42:11,148
(and accompanied her)

748
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,588
(until the end of her life.)

749
00:42:14,108 --> 00:42:15,267
(I believe this deep affection)

750
00:42:15,848 --> 00:42:17,028
