You're here.

For the sea-view apartment case,

20

we need to record a few more clips

Okay. I'll have Mingshi assist you.

23
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:04,805
Your outfit today
doesn't seem like your usual style.

24
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,484
The oversized T-shirt.

Unlike my style?

28
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:14,792
What happened?

29
00:02:16,444 --> 00:02:18,044
I went to the hospital.

30
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:21,564
I donated together with Dr. Qin.

31
00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:23,176
Taking pleasure in helping.

32
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:24,744
Taking pleasure in helping.

33
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:28,724
It seems like
you brought pleasure to Dr. Qin.

34
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:32,645
Like doing something for your lover.

35
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,525
How are things with you and Dr. Qin?

36
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:41,844
Can the "wind" still blow over here?

37
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:43,645
It must.

38
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,056
Let me tell you.

39
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:48,645
Just now,

40
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:50,485
I met Yang Zhengwen.

41
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:52,405
Dr. Qin was also there.

42
00:02:52,884 --> 00:02:55,004
Does he know about

43
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,884
your relationship with Yang Zhengwen?

44
00:02:57,564 --> 00:02:58,472
He does.

45
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:01,044
So, what was his reaction?

46
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,004
He didn't have any particular reaction.

47
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,764
No reaction?

48
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:11,645
Do you think it's because

49
00:03:11,764 --> 00:03:14,044
he now knows about
your past with Yang Zhengwen,

50
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:16,764
and the "wind" that was supposed to come

51
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:17,844
has blown back?

52
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:20,965
No way.

53
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:24,004
He knows I broke up with
Yang Zhengwen many years ago.

54
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:26,485
And I told you, didn't I?

55
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:28,044
I should give him more time.

56
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:29,965
Dr. Qin is different from others.

57
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:33,085
You are quite confident.

58
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:34,485
Sure, I am.

59
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:36,392
Well,

60
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:38,125
when we were at Piyixia,

61
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:39,965
I thought...

62
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:42,205
I thought Dr. Qin

63
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:44,004
wanted to say something to me.

64
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:44,936
But...

65
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:48,284
But maybe the timing wasn't right.

66
00:03:48,284 --> 00:03:49,128
Or...

67
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:51,205
Or maybe he was interrupted by someone.

68
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:52,805
He didn't say anything.

69
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:54,125
Then, ask him.

70
00:03:55,164 --> 00:03:56,485
Don't you worry if you don't ask?

71
00:03:56,724 --> 00:03:58,044
Why do I?

72
00:03:58,284 --> 00:03:59,405
That's exactly what I want.

73
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:00,564
Guess.

74
00:04:00,564 --> 00:04:01,884
Guess if I would guess.

75
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,604
Guess if I would guess your guessing.

76
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:05,004
Guess if I would guess

77
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,525
if you would guess.

78
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,008
Let me tell you.

79
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:11,405
This stage is
the most charming one in love.

80
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:13,324
This is based on scientific evidence.

81
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:15,245
It is the most essential part

82
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:17,125
of a romantic relationship.

83
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,285
If you keep guessing,

84
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:21,084
when will the "wind"

85
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:22,725
blow over?

86
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:24,685
If it's Dr. Qin,

87
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:26,404
it's okay to be a bit late.

88
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:28,045
Right, Dr. Qin?

89
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:29,524
If it's Dr. Qin,

90
00:04:29,524 --> 00:04:31,324
it's okay to be a bit late.

91
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:35,444
Someone now only lays eyes on Dr. Qin.

92
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:39,605
But I have you in my heart too.

93
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:42,725
I love you the most, Huixuan.

94
00:04:42,805 --> 00:04:44,125
Alright. I forgive you.

95
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:45,245
Xuan.

96
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:57,324
Zhang Yisen has discovered a new world.

97
00:04:57,644 --> 00:04:59,685
Yang Zhengwen
who donated today is a president.

98
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:01,125
He knows Su Ying?

99
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:02,856
Yes.

100
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:05,004
A president

101
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:06,884
personally came for the donation.

102
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:08,296
He even brought a dog.

103
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:10,964
I noticed his dog
was very close to Su Ying.

104
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:12,245
Stop gossiping.

105
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,564
He just came to donate.

106
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:15,304
I understand.

107
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:16,925
I am just chit-chatting with you.

108
00:05:18,925 --> 00:05:20,805
How's your confession
preparation for Su Ying?

109
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:27,964
Keeping me in the dark?

110
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,605
I won't tell Su Ying.

111
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:31,125
I can help you brainstorm.

112
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:34,120
Take it back to my room.

113
00:05:34,365 --> 00:05:35,285
I'll go to the glass house.

114
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,404
Why will you go there at this hour?

115
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:39,496
It's a secret.

116
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:41,485
A secret?

117
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:44,764
Enter the password.

118
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:46,856

125
00:06:08,605 --> 00:06:10,245
I-I made a mistake.

126
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:13,004
I accidentally donated the real trophy.

127
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,048
For real?

128
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:16,165
I was busy

129
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:17,352
and worked overnight.

130
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:18,884
I got mixed up.

131
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,004
I didn't do it on purpose.

132
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:22,856
Please don't be angry.

133
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:25,404
It's already been registered.

134
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:27,784

It definitely can't be withdrawn now.

135
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:31,464
We can bid it back.

136
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:32,365
Right.

137
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:33,285
Right.

143
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:00,884

such a meaningful thing?

00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:11,324
Don't worry. No one knows
the value of it.

such a tough situation?

No.

181
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:29,565
But you said, "Got it".

182
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:32,936

00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:47,924
Right.

190
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:49,524
You all blame me.

191
00:09:50,565 --> 00:09:51,605
Who is it?

192
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:53,125
I'll buy him a fake one instead.

193
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:00,284
I believe you can see

194
00:10:00,524 --> 00:10:02,404
glass house and sea-view room
are both made of glass,

195
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,284
but they are of different styles.

196
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:06,924
So, not to be restricted by labels

197
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:08,404
but be bold in seeking breakthroughs.

198
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:10,004
It is the attitude of designer Su Ying

199
00:10:10,404 --> 00:10:11,804
and also that of SU Design Firm.

200
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:13,416
Okay.

201
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:17,004
Happy wrap-up.

202
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:18,152

00:10:21,644 --> 00:10:22,565
You remember I love it.

205
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:24,520
Thank you, Huixuan.

206
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:35,112
How is it?

207
00:10:35,445 --> 00:10:36,424
Does it taste the same?

208
00:10:36,644 --> 00:10:37,576
It's exactly the taste.

209
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:41,684
Su sent me a WeChat message,

210
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:42,924
asking me to grab something.

211
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:44,200
She told you about it too?

212
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:46,085
Yes.

213
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:48,605
The Meichi Hospital
is doing a charity auction.

214
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:49,864
She asked me to help her.

215
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:52,764
What on earth is it?

216
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:54,404
She wanted to grab it during work hours.

217
00:10:55,164 --> 00:10:56,085
It must be from Dr. Qin.

218
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,365
No wonder.

219
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:01,524
Love really makes people overly excited.

220
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:06,524
Miss Du, I need you to sign this order.

221
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:07,912
Okay.

222
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,136
Yeah.

223
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:21,512
Love

224
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:22,764
makes us overly excited.

225
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:35,725
This case has finally come to an end.

226
00:11:38,404 --> 00:11:39,368
Yes.

227
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:40,776
It ended.

228
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,445
Why do you seem unhappy?

229
00:11:42,725 --> 00:11:43,592
No.

230
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:46,284
By the way, Huixuan,

231
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:47,725
when do you think we...

232
00:11:48,644 --> 00:11:50,325
I mean, you and Ying.

233
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:51,605
When will you

234
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:52,725
collaborate again?

235
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:56,644
I'm eager to collaborate with her
at every opportunity,

236
00:11:58,044 --> 00:11:59,565
but she has other projects,

237
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:00,565
so she can't be always around

238
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:02,044
our one case all the time.

239
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:04,284
For example,

240
00:12:05,044 --> 00:12:06,924
if I can take on a case on my own,

241
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:08,605
would you work with me?

242
00:12:08,884 --> 00:12:09,736
Of course.

243
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:11,112
Deal.

244
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,924
Speaking of Dr. Qin,

245
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:16,605
he has been working on

246
00:12:16,884 --> 00:12:17,768
the charity donation.

247
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:19,365
Ying seems quite dedicated to it.

248
00:12:19,644 --> 00:12:20,605
Yes, she is.

249
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:23,240
How about we support it too?

250
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,125
Sure.

251
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,004

254
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:35,804
I want to apologize for the trophy.

255
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:37,764
Never mind. Rain check.

256
00:12:38,044 --> 00:12:38,965
Where are you going?

257
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:39,848
Glass house.

258
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:41,524
Why the glass house again?

259
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:44,004
You've been busy as a bee.

Sure.

you like Rubik's Cubes?

317

Yeah. I like to play with it,
which helps me think.

318
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:08,764

I also have this voice recorder,
which is super meaningful.

336
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:48,164
I spent a lot of effort

337
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:49,164
to get it.

338
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:50,764

This is a limited edition
from the past and is hard to get.

341
00:15:57,644 --> 00:15:58,524
You want to donate it?

342
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:01,164
I'll give it to someone
who needs and likes it.

343
00:16:01,404 --> 00:16:02,284
How generous.

344
00:16:02,284 --> 00:16:03,656
Right. Donate it.

00:16:04,884 --> 00:16:05,845

346
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:07,764

for quite a while.

He would donate something
as precious as this?

354
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:39,164
He'll surely regret it in a day or two.

356
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:44,085

359
00:17:04,964 --> 00:17:05,845
It misses you.

361
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,845
What's wrong? Do you miss me?

362
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:15,285
Do you miss me?

363
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:17,325
In these past few years, its walks

364
00:17:17,484 --> 00:17:18,444
have been fixed,

365
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,365
but after the last time it saw you,

366
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:22,525
it has been bugging me
to take it out for a walk.

367
00:17:23,164 --> 00:17:23,525
Right?

368
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:24,392
I think

369
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,244
it must miss you.

370
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:28,164
Alright. Stop rubbing.

372
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:32,005
I have to go out for a trip.

Given its condition,

374
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:34,924
I don't want to
leave it to someone else.

375
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:37,365
So, would you mind taking care of it?

376
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:41,964
Subing,

377
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:44,085
do you want to stay with me
for some days?

378
00:17:44,404 --> 00:17:45,320
Subing.

379
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:47,592
Beg your mom.

380
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:51,724
Subing,

381
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,404
will you behave?

382
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:54,792
Will you behave?

383
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:56,936
Just for two days.

384
00:17:57,484 --> 00:17:58,408
In two days,

385
00:17:58,408 --> 00:17:59,784
my assistant will pick it up
if I'm back.

386
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:06,312
Alright, then.

387
00:18:07,924 --> 00:18:08,840
Thanks.

388
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:10,085
Let's take it for a bath.

389
00:18:12,085 --> 00:18:13,045
Lying down?

390
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:14,444
You want to stay, right?

391
00:18:14,444 --> 00:18:15,125
Go.

392
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:15,765
Just go.

393
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:16,680
Go.

394
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:21,365
Ye, I am going to the pet store.

395
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:23,964
Could you clean the trophy on the desk?

396
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,125
Clean it carefully.

397
00:18:25,244 --> 00:18:26,525
Make it shine. Got it?

398
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:27,845
Okay, Ying. Rest assured.

399
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:31,244
When are you going?

400
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:32,232
Wait a bit more.

401
00:18:35,285 --> 00:18:36,724
(Golden Knife Award)
Ye, you are so amazing.

402
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:37,924
After being cleaned,

403
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:38,805
it's just like new.

404
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,244
Be careful.

405
00:18:40,365 --> 00:18:42,045
This is Ying's surprise for Dr. Qin.

406
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:43,112
Don't break it.

407
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:44,525
For Dr. Qin?

408
00:18:45,285 --> 00:18:47,164
Otherwise, you think
she is interested in this award?

409
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:49,365
I cherish it more than my face.

410
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:50,920
I'll fetch something.

411
00:18:52,525 --> 00:18:53,384
Dr. Qin.

412
00:18:56,164 --> 00:18:57,204
What are you hiding?

413
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,056
Your Golden Knife Award.

414
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:00,204
No. Not your Golden Knife Award.

415
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:04,765
Yes, it is your Golden Knife Award.

416
00:19:05,365 --> 00:19:06,884
Ying knows it's very important to you.

417
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:07,724
It's a surprise for you.

418
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:09,005
We got it together.

419
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:10,444
Ying was afraid she couldn't get it,

420
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:11,884
so she asked us to help her.

421
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:13,884
And she also asked me to clean it.

422
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:15,164
It looks brand new after I handled it.

423
00:19:15,244 --> 00:19:16,404
Right. We wiped it all morning.

424
00:19:16,565 --> 00:19:18,085
Dr. Qin, look. Isn't it just like new?

425
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,752
Where is she?

426
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,325
She... She went to the pet shop.

427
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:22,824
When did she leave?

428
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:24,964
Just now. Mr. Yang came with a dog.

429
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,144
They went to pet shop together.

430
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,752
Yes.

431
00:19:34,285 --> 00:19:35,164
Dr. Qin, take care.

432
00:19:36,484 --> 00:19:38,204
Don't you think you talked too much?

433
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,404
I was just telling the truth.

434
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:46,765
Did you feel happy after the bath?

435
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:47,925
Ying.

436
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:48,872
Where are you going?

437
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:50,005
The trophy is cleaned?

438
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:52,365
- Yes. Dr. Qin came for you.
- Don't go there.

439
00:19:52,765 --> 00:19:53,608
Dr. Qin is here?

440
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:56,684
- He...
- No. He went to the pet shop for you.

441
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:57,960
The pet shop?

442
00:19:58,525 --> 00:19:59,444
When Dr. Qin was here,

443
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:03,484
I told him you and Mr. Yang
took the dog to get a bath at the pet shop.

444
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:04,712
So, he went to look for you.

445
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,120
Yes.

446
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:09,096

Dr. Zhang, is Dr. Qin here?

462
00:21:08,164 --> 00:21:10,404
He received a package and rushed out.

463
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:11,724
He left his phone in the dorm.

464
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:14,204
No wonder I couldn't reach him.

465
00:21:14,924 --> 00:21:16,125
He said he looked for me, but...

466
00:21:16,845 --> 00:21:17,884
Do you know where he might be?

467
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:19,404
He went to the glass house a lot.

468
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,325
Maybe you can go there.

469
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:23,244

474
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:33,384
Yeah.

475

I don't know

500
00:23:44,204 --> 00:23:45,684
how to confess to you.

501
00:23:47,644 --> 00:23:48,924
I've thought of many ways.

502

But when I am looking at your eyes,

503
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:56,765
my mind is blank.

504
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:03,285
I couldn't say any love words.

505
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:08,520
I just know

506
00:24:11,404 --> 00:24:12,296
I want to see you.

00:24:18,045 --> 00:24:19,244

But what I want to say the most now is

00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:45,928
I like you.

512
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:53,125
I like you more day by day.

513
00:24:57,924 --> 00:24:59,005
It's not love words.

actually,

534
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:49,444
I wanted to give you this.

00:26:52,684 --> 00:26:53,544
I thought

537

I'd wait until you agreed
to be my girlfriend.

538
00:26:57,884 --> 00:26:59,605
Have I agreed to be your girlfriend?

Got it.

543
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:11,845
You said, "Got it".

544
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:14,484
No. I saw it wrong.

546
00:28:17,444 --> 00:28:18,312

Ying, after the show was aired,

549
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:29,244
cases coming to us
have obviously increased.

550

551
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:33,285

we think are excellent.

553

I think the Seasons Cafe case is good.

557
00:28:43,845 --> 00:28:44,776
Do you think

558
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:46,504
that I have a chance?

559
00:28:46,504 --> 00:28:48,444
Sure. I'll leave it to you.

560
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:50,724
Leave it to me?

561
00:28:50,724 --> 00:28:51,624
Thank you, Ying.

562
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:52,776
So easy to talk to.

00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:03,045
I've been very interested in this style.

566
00:29:03,444 --> 00:29:05,884
Can you let me...

567
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,285
Okay. I trust you.

568
00:29:10,404 --> 00:29:12,204
Go. Ying is in a good mood.

569
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:13,444
Ying,

570
00:29:13,444 --> 00:29:15,924
I really like the project of
Flora and City B&B.

571
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:16,964
You know me.

572
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,924
I've always liked B&B projects.

573
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:20,605
Okay. I'll leave it to...

574
00:29:22,216 --> 00:29:23,964
No. This project is huge.

575
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:25,845
The demands for water system
and horticulture are high.

576
00:29:26,484 --> 00:29:27,368
I'll keep an eye on it.

577
00:29:28,085 --> 00:29:29,884
Ying, what about me?

578
00:29:30,244 --> 00:29:31,204
You are flexible.

579
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:33,512
Learn well while being the best support.

580
00:29:33,724 --> 00:29:34,664
Support?

581
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:35,805
I'm sorry I can't help you.

582
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:48,845
Ying, what's wrong with you?

583
00:29:49,325 --> 00:29:50,244
Don't you feel well?

584
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:51,325
Why are you lowering head?

585
00:29:51,644 --> 00:29:52,765
Ying, is your neck hurting?

586
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:54,005
The screen is broken?

587
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:56,488
No.

588
00:29:57,365 --> 00:29:58,845
You guys go on.

589
00:30:00,872 --> 00:30:01,805
Keep going.

590
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:02,664
Okay.

591
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:05,085
Mingshi,

592
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:06,884
send me the previous cases.

593
00:30:14,164 --> 00:30:16,204
(Su Ying)
I'm about to get off work. You?

594
00:30:16,204 --> 00:30:17,565
The charity event

595
00:30:18,005 --> 00:30:19,724
was well done and very successful.

596
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,005
We received support from friends.

597
00:30:22,605 --> 00:30:24,045
So, I specifically

598
00:30:25,164 --> 00:30:27,085
applied for some funds
from the hospital.

599
00:30:28,204 --> 00:30:29,805
(Qin Yunsheng)
Still in a meeting. Almost done.

600
00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:32,244
I'll organize a team-building activity.

601
00:30:32,525 --> 00:30:33,444
- Great.
- Good.

602
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:35,085
You can express your ideas.

603
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:36,008
Okay.

604
00:30:36,884 --> 00:30:37,768
Yunsheng.

605
00:30:40,444 --> 00:30:41,448
Yunsheng.

606
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:44,456
Yunsheng.

607
00:30:44,808 --> 00:30:45,704
Director.

608
00:30:45,704 --> 00:30:46,845
What's going on?

609
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:48,285
So thrilled?

610
00:30:48,964 --> 00:30:49,884
Share with us.

611
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:52,744
Right. Tell us.

612
00:30:52,924 --> 00:30:54,684
We are going to have a party.

613
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:56,565
You are happy and so am I.

614
00:30:56,724 --> 00:30:57,605
Yes. He's happy.

615
00:30:58,684 --> 00:31:00,244
If that's the case,

616
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:03,765
the execution will be left to Ms. Han.

617
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:05,448
Okay?

618
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:06,404
Sure.

619
00:31:06,404 --> 00:31:07,884
Yisen, cooperate with Ms. Han.

620
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:09,605
N-No problem.

621
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:10,792
Is that alright, Ms. Han?

622
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:11,724
No problem.

623
00:31:11,724 --> 00:31:13,204
Okay. Since everyone has no problem,

624
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,125
I'll say a few more words.

625
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:16,285
The event...

626
00:31:16,285 --> 00:31:16,684
Director.

627
00:31:16,684 --> 00:31:17,605
It was well done.

628
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:18,085
Director.

629
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,005
So we...

630
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:20,244
My watch looks pretty?

631
00:31:26,404 --> 00:31:27,404
Alright. Dismissed.

632
00:31:27,724 --> 00:31:28,616
Okay, Director.

633
00:31:28,616 --> 00:31:29,512
Thank you, Director.

634
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,408
Thank you, Director.

635
00:31:30,644 --> 00:31:31,592
Goodbye, Director.

636
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:36,045
Why are you in such a hurry?

637
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:37,605
What are you busy with?

638
00:31:38,204 --> 00:31:39,112
A date?

639
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:42,444
The girl from last time?

640
00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:44,424
Yes.

641
00:31:45,884 --> 00:31:46,728
Look.

642
00:31:51,404 --> 00:31:53,684
When you like someone,
you shall let them know.

643
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:55,404
And you're wearing couple shirt now.

644
00:31:56,605 --> 00:31:59,244
Good. Your grandfather told me.

645
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:02,325
The girl must be able to bear children.

646
00:32:03,244 --> 00:32:04,325
She must be healthy.

647
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:06,484
Your father also asked me

648
00:32:06,845 --> 00:32:07,884
to help him take a look.

649
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,776
Thank you, Director.

650
00:32:11,325 --> 00:32:12,296
I have to take a look.

651
00:32:12,404 --> 00:32:14,085
Bring her back.

652
00:32:17,484 --> 00:32:19,525
Why are you looking at me?

653
00:32:20,845 --> 00:32:22,444
Remember to participate

654
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,644
in the team-building activity.

655
00:32:24,605 --> 00:32:26,125
You can bring your partners.

656
00:32:33,204 --> 00:32:34,244
Okay. I'll go ahead.

657
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,005
Nordic style.

658
00:32:48,285 --> 00:32:49,924
What do you think of
the water system of the cafe?

659
00:32:51,644 --> 00:32:53,805
You can start making preliminary plans

660
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:55,204
according to the projects

661
00:32:55,204 --> 00:32:57,845
you've received.

662
00:32:58,765 --> 00:33:00,484
You can refer to the successful cases

663
00:33:00,484 --> 00:33:01,765
from the past for the cafe project.

664
00:33:02,408 --> 00:33:03,304
Same with Nordic style.

665
00:33:03,845 --> 00:33:04,805
Alright, Ying.

666
00:33:06,724 --> 00:33:08,200
Mingshi, can you send me the pictures

667
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,125
of cafes you've visited?

668
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:10,164
Okay. I will send them to you.

669
00:33:10,285 --> 00:33:11,444
Alright. I need reference.

670
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,525
Going to the restroom.

671
00:33:12,525 --> 00:33:13,605
I saw a chair the other day.

672
00:33:13,896 --> 00:33:14,805
I believe I can make it.

673
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:16,204
You just need to cooperate with us.

674
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:17,365
There will be chances for you.

675
00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:18,285
There are so many cases.

676
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:19,924
Right. Just keep working hard.

677
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,512
Ying is in a good mood today.

678
00:33:21,512 --> 00:33:22,404
Maybe...

679
00:33:22,404 --> 00:33:23,244
Just keep learning.

680
00:33:23,325 --> 00:33:24,264
She will give you a chance.

681
00:33:24,264 --> 00:33:26,884
She will certainly give
chances like these to you.

682
00:33:27,244 --> 00:33:28,232
Right, Ying?

683
00:33:29,605 --> 00:33:30,484
Ying.

684
00:33:30,484 --> 00:33:31,400
Ying.

685
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:44,005
The workaholic skips work today?

686
00:33:45,805 --> 00:33:46,964
Ying is the boss.

687
00:33:47,244 --> 00:33:49,045
For her, this is

688
00:33:49,484 --> 00:33:50,444
clocking off early.

689
00:33:51,005 --> 00:33:53,285
Stop looking. Get back to your work.

690
00:33:53,285 --> 00:33:55,204
I should study the cafe case well.

691
00:33:58,164 --> 00:33:59,085
Coming.

692
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:03,765
It's unusual for you
to come to me so early.

693
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,000
Whose dog?

694
00:34:10,844 --> 00:34:11,784
Yang Zhengwen's.

695
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:14,164
Why did his dog end up with you?

696
00:34:15,684 --> 00:34:17,644
It is complicated.
I'll explain it to you later.

697
00:34:17,844 --> 00:34:19,324
Anyway, you have to

698
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:20,605
take care of it for me tonight.

699
00:34:20,885 --> 00:34:22,525
No. You need to explain this to me.

700
00:34:22,724 --> 00:34:24,085
Did you and Yang Zhengwen...

701
00:34:24,204 --> 00:34:24,644
You two...

702
00:34:24,644 --> 00:34:25,844
What are you thinking?

703
00:34:26,005 --> 00:34:27,045
Dr. Qin.

704
00:34:27,324 --> 00:34:28,232
Dr. Qin?

705
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:29,672
We have a date tonight.

706
00:34:29,672 --> 00:34:30,125
Date?

707
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,016
He asked me out.

708
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:32,324
Your first date.

709
00:34:32,525 --> 00:34:34,644
Then just leave the dog at your place.

710
00:34:34,644 --> 00:34:35,684
Why did you bring it here?

711
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:38,005
You don't know how energetic it is.

712
00:34:38,085 --> 00:34:38,925
I kept it on the balcony,

713
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:40,364
but it kept scratching and barking.

714
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:41,724
My neighbors would complain.

715
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:43,885
Besides, this is our first date.

716
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:46,565
What if after the date...

717
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,085
Help me out, Xuan.

718
00:34:50,445 --> 00:34:51,965
Please.

719
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:53,005
Alright.

720
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:54,644
Hand it over. Just a dog, right?

721
00:34:54,764 --> 00:34:56,005
Love you.

722
00:34:57,565 --> 00:34:59,125
Subing, listen to Auntie.

723
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:01,204
I'll pick you up later.

724
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:02,005
Okay.

725
00:35:02,005 --> 00:35:02,885
D-Don't forget.

726
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:03,925
Give it some chicken breast.

727
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:06,125
And yolk. Don't eat something salty.

728
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:06,605
Okay, sure.

729
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:07,485
And some water. Be good.

730
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,324
Enjoy your time together.

731
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:10,684
There is a ball inside.

732
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:11,885
- Let it play with it.
- Ball?

733
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:12,904
Alright.

734
00:35:13,164 --> 00:35:14,085
Goodbye.

735
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:18,376
There you go.

736
00:35:19,644 --> 00:35:21,405
You and I don't
interfere with each other, okay?

737
00:35:21,644 --> 00:35:22,885
Listen to me. Got it?

738
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:25,320
Over here.

739
00:35:47,644 --> 00:35:48,648
Are you feeling dizzy

740
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:49,896
after constant brakes?

741
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:53,000
Yes, a bit.

742
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,804
But it has nothing to do with brakes.

743
00:36:23,085 --> 00:36:24,005
Do you want to travel?

744
00:36:26,244 --> 00:36:27,112
Do you like traveling?

745
00:36:27,324 --> 00:36:28,264
Very much.

746
00:36:28,565 --> 00:36:30,644
Seeing different sceneries and people.

747
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:32,605
But I'm too busy with work
and don't have time.

748
00:36:34,445 --> 00:36:35,405
Let's go together someday.

749
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:38,312
Sounds good.

750
00:36:42,824 --> 00:36:43,684
Did you pass it?

751
00:36:43,684 --> 00:36:44,724
We got on the highway.

752
00:36:45,364 --> 00:36:46,804
Shouldn't your first question be

753
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:48,045
"what movie to watch?"

754
00:36:48,485 --> 00:36:49,364
Does the movie matter?

755
00:36:49,844 --> 00:36:51,445
What matters is
who you are watching it with.

756
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,164
Do you have any plans after the movie?

757
00:36:56,204 --> 00:36:57,724
Let's have dinner together.

758
00:36:58,844 --> 00:36:59,684
And then?

759
00:37:00,565 --> 00:37:01,605
Then...

760
00:37:04,284 --> 00:37:05,284
Then, I don't have plans.

761
00:37:07,164 --> 00:37:08,072
Let's do what I say then.

762
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:09,480
Okay.

763
00:37:19,164 --> 00:37:22,204
Didn't I just take you for a walk?

764
00:37:22,565 --> 00:37:24,844
Why did you pee at home?

765
00:37:25,565 --> 00:37:28,164
Are you jealous of them going on a date?

766
00:37:28,244 --> 00:37:29,804
You want to go too?

767
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:32,125
If you really think so,

768
00:37:32,644 --> 00:37:33,512
okay, just wait then.

769
00:37:33,764 --> 00:37:35,804
You won't get any dog food today.

770
00:37:37,684 --> 00:37:38,525
You're driving me crazy.

771
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:49,965
Don't run around.

772
00:37:52,644 --> 00:37:54,844
Don't run around.

773
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,480
Oh, my God.

774
00:37:58,565 --> 00:38:00,724
If you keep running around,
I'm going to stew you.

775
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:26,605
I can't stand it anymore.

776
00:38:27,565 --> 00:38:31,605
Only one can stay here. You or me.

777
00:38:35,844 --> 00:38:38,376
Design is a feeling and a state of mind.

778
00:38:38,804 --> 00:38:41,644
It's a comfortable
and happy way of life.

779
00:38:42,005 --> 00:38:43,684
Ying's face is glowing,
genuinely rejuvenated.

780
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:45,045
She looks prettier.

781
00:38:46,085 --> 00:38:47,724
Isn't this the case we worked on?

782
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:50,125
This is the legendary situation

783
00:38:50,445 --> 00:38:51,605
where popularity nourishes people.

784
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:54,724
Ying has been touching up her makeup
quite frequently these days.

785
00:38:55,605 --> 00:38:57,324
Is she in a relationship?

786
00:38:59,445 --> 00:39:01,644
As a kid, you shouldn't gossip about
Ying's personal affairs.

787
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:02,952
Fine.

788
00:39:03,244 --> 00:39:05,324
Mingshi, any new developments with Ying?

789
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:06,568
Yes.

790
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:07,445
Who is it?

791
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,296
Who is it?

792
00:39:09,324 --> 00:39:10,216
Who are you talking about?

793
00:39:10,485 --> 00:39:11,565
Are you listening at all?

794
00:39:12,405 --> 00:39:14,600
I mean, this video account
is quite interesting.

795
00:39:14,844 --> 00:39:16,405
I just followed a video account.

796
00:39:16,764 --> 00:39:17,640
Look at this.

797
00:39:17,804 --> 00:39:19,204
It focuses on
the home decoration industry.

798
00:39:19,844 --> 00:39:21,045
Those who dare to struggle can win?

799
00:39:21,844 --> 00:39:22,684
Quite interesting.

800
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:24,284
How did you find this niche account?

801
00:39:24,844 --> 00:39:25,965
Because they have edited

802
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:28,125
many successful cases from our studio.

803
00:39:28,605 --> 00:39:29,525
Go search for it.

804
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,764
Search for it.

805
00:39:30,764 --> 00:39:31,885
Quite interesting. Learn from it.

806
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:33,005
(Huixuan)
Emergency. Help.

807
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:33,864
Taking care of dogs?

808
00:39:34,045 --> 00:39:35,565
I'm nearly driven mad by Ying's dog.

809
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:37,800
Where are you going?

810
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,016
Emergency.

811
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:41,844
Have you noticed people in our studio

812
00:39:41,844 --> 00:39:42,844
have been acting strangely?

813
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:44,520
Fine. You won't understand.

814
00:39:52,644 --> 00:39:53,485
Oh, my God.

815
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:55,644
Is this the world war?

816
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,405
You're finally here.

817
00:40:02,405 --> 00:40:04,164
Huixuan, you can rest now.

818
00:40:04,364 --> 00:40:05,885
I'll take care of the rest.

819
00:40:11,364 --> 00:40:12,405
Drink.

820
00:40:13,284 --> 00:40:14,804
You've been walking me for so long.

821
00:40:14,965 --> 00:40:15,965
Drink more water.

822
00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:06,664
Here. Have some water.

823
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:08,136
Thank you.

824
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:12,284
Finally, Subing can be quiet.

825
00:41:12,605 --> 00:41:13,480
True.

826
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,125
Insect. Insect.

827
00:41:15,244 --> 00:41:16,104
Where is it?

828
00:41:16,364 --> 00:41:17,284
Hurry.

829
00:41:17,284 --> 00:41:18,204
A big black insect.

830
00:41:18,204 --> 00:41:19,764
I'm scared of big black insects.

831
00:41:19,764 --> 00:41:20,684
Don't worry.

832
00:41:38,405 --> 00:41:39,368
You're hungry?

833
00:41:40,885 --> 00:41:41,764
Wait for me for a bit.

834
00:41:42,005 --> 00:41:42,888
Well.

835
00:41:43,324 --> 00:41:44,164
Kitchen is over there.

836
00:41:56,844 --> 00:42:00,140
(Maple Forest, Drive-in Cinema)

837
00:42:17,925 --> 00:42:18,804
Drive-in cinema?

838
00:42:20,445 --> 00:42:21,324
Have you been here before?

839
00:42:23,244 --> 00:42:24,085
No.

840
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,445
You are the one
who I want to talk to before sleep.

841
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,164
I am here tonight

842
00:42:30,644 --> 00:42:31,644
not because I am lonely.

843
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:33,045
Nor for anything else.

844
00:42:34,244 --> 00:42:36,045
When I decide to spend
the rest of my life with you,

845
00:42:38,885 --> 00:42:40,525
I just hope that the rest of my life

846
00:42:40,885 --> 00:42:42,164
