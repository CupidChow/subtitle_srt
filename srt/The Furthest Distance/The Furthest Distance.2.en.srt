Applause.

18
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,140
(House Design)
The applause isn't for me.

19
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,580
It's for you guys,
and mainly for the two of you.

20
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:55,940
Welcome back

21
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,020
to our House Design.

22
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,140
Let me introduce myself.

23
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,700
I am the executive producer,

24
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,580
surnamed Liu.

25
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,259
You can call me Peter Liu.

26
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,552
Peter Liu.

27
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,056
Miss Huixuan,

28
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,380
when did you get a new leader?

29
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:13,224
It's a surprise to me too.

30
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,659
I don't know what the past six years

31
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:16,700
have left on your faces.

32
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,020
But looking back,

33
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,899
I remember six years ago,

34
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,860
I first stepped
into the variety show industry.

35
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,059
The first show I made

36
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:25,459
was One Out of Ninety-nine.

37
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:26,980
I believe you all have watched it.

38
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:29,939
It was a groundbreaking program
for selecting female group members.

39
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:30,939
At that time, it...

40
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:31,779
Mr. Liu,

41
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,120
sorry to interrupt.

42
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:36,420
Mr. Qin is a bit busy today,

43
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:37,939
so shall we start with reviewing

44
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,179
the specific plan?

45
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,300
Okay, sure.

46
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,459
Let's start it. Please.

47
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:45,864
Miss Su.

48
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,260
I have gone and seen the house.

49
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,020
Based on my experience,

50
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,140
the main structure
of the glass house can be preserved.

51
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:53,540
Only small changes are needed.

52
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,580
That's why you're a designer

53
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,179
who is well-known
both at home and abroad.

54
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:58,820
But only small changes...

55
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:01,459
I am a little bit worried, Su.

56
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,179
With only minor adjustments,
would the difference

57
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,499
in how the house appears

58
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,459
on camera not be obvious?

59
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:10,540
The owner's request is to restore it.

60
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,860
Actually, the problems
with the glass house aren't that big.

61
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,580
We just need to do
some anti-humidity, windproof,

62
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,020
and fade-resistant repair work.

63
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,219
I will finish it
in the shortest time possible.

64
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,380
But I heard there are many big problems

65
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,300
with the house.

66
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,779
We have enough funding.

67
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,939
Should we do a big makeover?

68
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,219
Because making major changes
is tantamount to overtreatment.

69
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,020
Just like you just have a common cold,

70
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:36,179
but the doctor asks you
to do an electrocardiogram,

71
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,580
magnetic resonance imaging,

72
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,140
organ transplantation or amputation.

73
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:41,739
I see.

74
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,059
Dr. Qin, may I ask you?

75
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:45,779
Do you want to renovate it

76
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,219
because of Miss Mi Su?

77
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,140
And after Miss Mi Su passed away,

78
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,540
did you live
in the glass house all the time?

79
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,260
I usually live
in the dormitory of the hospital

80
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:01,059
and sometimes go there.

81
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:05,860
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,540
Miss Huixuan, Peter Liu

83
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,059
really knows how to make a show.

84
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,659
And set traps for people.

85
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,300
I haven't been
on this show for a long time,

86
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,899
but I've been a viewer for many years.

87
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:17,700
You and Miss Mi Su

88
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:19,740
were really in love,

89
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,620
and it really moved me.

90
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:23,464
So I have an idea.

91
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:25,140
We'll create a special edition

92
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,899
for the sixth anniversary.

93
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:30,020
A memoir

94
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,580
about their romantic love story.

95
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,979
It can be considered a special gift

96
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:35,339
for Miss Mi Su.

97
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:41,659
I think it's totally unnecessary.

98
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:43,380
Don't rush.

99
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,859
We've designed some highlights

100
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:46,099
for both of you. Think about it.

101
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,020
You're well-known
both at home and abroad.

102
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,859
This time, you get back
to where you started

103
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:55,099
and redo your classic work
from six years ago.

104
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:57,099
Oh, my. The ratings of this program

105
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:59,020
will be on the rise.

106
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,700
Dr. Qin,

107
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,659
all these years, for Miss Mi,

108
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,700
you have remained single, right?

109
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,060
Oh, my. Once this show is aired,

110
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,339
you'll be known

111
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,140
for being handsome

112
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:12,620
and affectionate.

113
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:13,740
I have a request.

114
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,260
Don't hype up the thing
from six years ago.

115
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,544
Otherwise, I'll quit.

116
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,940
Except for renovations,

117
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,339
do you have any other requests?

118
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:33,459
I remember you said before

119
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:36,200
you had a regret. What is it?

120
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:38,824
You still remember it?

121
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,060
I mean, if...

122
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:43,180
If I want to see a rainbow

123
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:45,140
in the glass house every day,

124
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,260
will you think

125
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:48,899
I'm out of my mind?

126
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,712
A rainbow?

127
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,824
In a glass house?

128
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:03,979
From a common sense perspective,

129
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,339
a rainbow is an optical phenomenon.

130
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,500
It's formed by water
and sunlight together.

131
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,740
At first hearing,
it's elusive, intangible,

132
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:14,020
and indeed somewhat unrealistic.

133
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,140
So it's considered a regret.

134
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,140
Too unattainable.

135
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:23,659
But as a designer,

136
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:25,580
since it's the client's request,

137
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,219
I have to try my best to fulfill it.

138
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:29,260
About the rainbow, I think...

139
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,060
I was just joking.
Don't take it seriously.

140
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,704
Do you want to come in?

141
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,659
Well, the hospital
needs me this afternoon.

142
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,299
All right. Anyway, it's not far away.

143
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:51,180
You're welcome to visit.

144
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:52,659
Feel free to contact me anytime.

145
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:53,864
Okay.

146
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,620
Don't be scared.
It's not as frightening as you think.

147
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:11,208
Ying,

148
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:13,859
this is the new intern, Cai Chen.

149
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,580
Hello, my name i-i-is Cai Chen.

150
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,592
Relax.

151
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:24,712
What's your major?

152
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,940
Visual Communication.

153
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,979
Then let me ask you, do you know

154
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,339
how to see a rainbow inside a room?

155
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,552
A rainbow?

156
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,419
A rainbow inside a room?

157
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:37,339
Relax.

158
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:38,280
She won't eat you.

159
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,180
D-D-Did she ever eat anyone before?

160
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,240
What do you think?

161
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,020
Well, hand in your proposal to me

162
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,140
before three o'clock.

163
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,260
Anyway, my requirement

164
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,016
is to see a rainbow inside a room, okay?

165
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:51,912
Okay.

166
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:53,704
A rainbow in the room.

167
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,099
I'll take him out, Ying.

168
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:58,408
Let's leave.

169
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:00,008
Goodbye, Miss Su.

170
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,600
Miss Ye.

171
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:17,640
Miss Su,

172
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,099
these are all my rainbow-related cases.

173
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,740
You are very efficient.

174
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,659
I want you to see it clearly,

175
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,099
so I printed them all out.

176
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:37,500
Chen, our studio isn't rich.

177
00:08:37,939 --> 00:08:40,299
Every brick and tile
and every cup and paper in this studio

178
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,740
were earned

179
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,100
by my hard work.

180
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:47,539
The printer is out of paper,

181
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,860
so I put it in the USB flash drive.

182
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:52,460
I'll plug it in for you.

183
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:56,939
You can put everything
in the flash drive in the future, okay?

184
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:57,800
Okay.

185
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:06,699
This USB drive is good.

186
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,299
You like it?

187
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,220
I have more.

188
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,059
If you want, I'll give them all to you.

189
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,100
Chen,

190
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:18,980
you're really good.

191
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:21,899
Thanks.

192
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,860
Miss Su, I'm leaving now.

193
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,136
Wait a minute.

194
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:30,568
Do me a favor.

195
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,899
The design of home decoration lighting

196
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,620
usually aims to restore sunlight.

197
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:43,299
Yellow and white lights are widely used.

198
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
For instance, the most common LED lamps.

199
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:47,579
By combining and arranging

200
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:49,579
the four basic colors
of white, red, blue and green,

201
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,260
you can get any color you need.

202
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:53,260
Paired with an intelligent chip,

203
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,020
it can also present a gradient effect.

204
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,860
You can see the gradient
or the flash change up close.

205
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,460
There are over 400 change patterns.

206
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,740
You can connect it via Bluetooth.
It is very convenient.

207
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,860
You can also choose the size and length.

208
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:05,819
It's high-tech,

209
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,699
but it's not what I want.

210
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:10,779
This kind uses LED lamps
with a refractive lens.

211
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,620
Through the principle of refraction,

212
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:14,779
the light is refracted onto the wall.

213
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,179
The farther the projection distance,
the bigger the rainbow.

214
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:21,779
This is very beautiful and convenient,

215
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:25,939
but it's just a lamp.

216
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:29,659
Okay, I roughly understand you now.

217
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,939
Alright then.

218
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:31,860
I'll go back and think of

219
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,899
other ways for you.

220
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:34,220
Okay. Thank you for your help.

221
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,380
What's going on?

222
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:43,500
It must have tripped the circuit.

223
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,059
I'll go check.

224
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:45,992
Hang on.

225
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,784
Are you scared?

226
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,320
I...

227
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,272
I am not.

228
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,064
I am going to find someone.

229
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:01,779
Didn't you say that you weren't scared?

230
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:06,740
I-I-I am...

231
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,419
I'm just worried about your safety.

232
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,340
How about I accompany you?

233
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,860
I'm okay. I can do it.

234
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:12,939
No, it's not safe.

235
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:13,960
I should go with you.

236
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,240
This is a sensor light.

237
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:24,424
Yes.

238
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,460
This is a sensor light.

239
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:28,819
It's okay now. I'll go find someone.

240
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:30,760
Wait.

241
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,460
Don't be so hasty.

242
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,419
We can wait for someone
to come here, right?

243
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:40,220
Don't be such a spoilsport.

244
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,020
Isn't this quite fun?

245
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,699
Do you remember the clapping game

246
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,260
we played when we were little?

247
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,240
Look.

248
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:48,488
It's lit!

249
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:26,260
Have you heard the story
about two kids who disappeared

250
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,419
after playing the clapping game?

251
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:46,740
Did you just clap?

252
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,168
Wasn't it you who clapped?

253
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:49,576
I didn't.

254
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,899
So who clapped?

255
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:53,576
I clapped.

256
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,340
What are you two doing?

257
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:56,680
Just leave now.

258
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,740
See? I knew someone would come.

259
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,024
Let's leave.

260
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,952
Wait a minute.

261
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,040
Thank you.

You've grown up.

278
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:35,939
Now you finally know
to ask a girl out after work.

279
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,299
Yes, I'm exhausted.

280
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,136
Exhausted?

281
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,980
What have you done today?

282
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,899
Shopping in a lamp market exhausted me.

283
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,899
Shopping in a light market?

284
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:51,380
There are lights and music.

285
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,100

290
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:01,960

293

This time I know
it should be double-sided printed.

294
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,220
Don't worry. Miss Ye has taught me.

295
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,140
From now on, I will never waste

296

00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:20,584
Miss Su.

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,816
Miss Su.

299
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,392
The case.

300
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,400
Put it there.

301
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,220
By the way,
was Dr. Qin satisfied yesterday?

302
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:36,980
I ordered them yesterday

303
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,939
to display all the lights

304
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,460
related to rainbows.

305
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,620
They said that they had never seen

306
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:43,620
such a big show.

307
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,340
Do you know so many lights
can cause a breaker to trip?

308
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:47,579
I do.

309
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,100
So I put a voice-activated lamp there.

310
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:50,632
Here it is.

311
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,264
Miss Su,

312
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,980
actually, I'm very happy

313
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,899
to be able to help you.

314
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:58,299
I made a lot of effort actually.

315
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:00,260
They commented

316
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,380
- I was serious...
- Go out.

317
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,264
Let me take it away.

318
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,420
Leave the light. You go out.

319
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:15,400
Ying, the clothes have been washed
and are placed here.

320
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,660
- Thank you.

the luxury and add some...

323
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,539
Tell him we only revise it twice.
He can accept it or not.

324
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,864
Okay.

325
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,539
Ying, are you going out?

326
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:29,992
To meet a homeowner.

327
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:32,500
Turn off my computer.

328
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:33,980
Fine, a homeowner.

329
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,260
Dr. Qin, we are going to have a meal.

330
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,740
Dr. Qin, sorry. We are late.

331
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,808
It's okay.

332
00:17:53,096 --> 00:17:53,980
You're here, Tao.

333
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,856
What should you say?

334
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,379
Tao, how's your wound healing?

335
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,760
Taking medicine on time?

336
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,700
Yes.

337
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,616
Yes?

338
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,832
Let me check.

339
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,304
Let's go.

340
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:15,180
Very good. It will be fine soon.

341
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,560
It's done.

342
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,139
Now

343
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:22,940
it's time to fulfill my promise.

344
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,980
I said last time
if you didn't cry today,

345
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,059
I would reward you with a lollipop.

346
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:30,420
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

347
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,020
A man who keeps his word is fantastic.

348
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,120
Fantastic.

349
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,072
Okay.

350
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:39,220
Okay, Dr. Qin. We're leaving.

351
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:40,328
Thank you for your time.

352
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,379
Tao, say goodbye to him.

353
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,139
Bye.

354
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:44,040
Bye, Mr. Qin.

355
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:45,032
- Bye.
- Let's leave.

356
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,368
What brings you here?

357
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,064
To return the coat.

358
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,752
Come in.

359
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,539
Thanks for last time.

360
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,784
It's alright.

361
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:04,220
You haven't eaten yet?

362
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,740
The kid's mother only has time at noon

363
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,592
to bring him here,

364
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,840
so I haven't eaten.

365
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,260
Well, I haven't eaten either.

366
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,704
Let me treat you to lunch.

367
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,299
Treating me?

368
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,168
It is all cold now.

369
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:20,552
How about this? Let me treat you

370
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,500
to our cafeteria's food.

371
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:25,256
Okay.

372
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:27,304
Here you are.

373
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,320
(Hospital canteen )
Thank you.

374
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,020
(Hospital canteen )

375
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,139
Don't hospitals always have

376
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,420
fixed meal time?

377
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,500
We are usually quite busy

378
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,619
and can't eat regularly,

379
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,940
especially ER doctors.

380
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,660
After the leaders knew it,

381
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,539
they had a couple of cooks cook for us.

382
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,568
It looks nice.

383
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,976
Have a taste.

384
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,624
I've been exhausted this morning.

385
00:19:58,059 --> 00:19:59,779
Yunsheng, this is...

386
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,740
This is the designer of the glass house,

387
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,220
Miss Su Ying.

388
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:10,379
This is

389
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,072
my colleague.

390
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:14,139
He's not important. Eat.

391
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,220
You are annoying.

392
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,896
Miss Su, hello.

393
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,579
My name is Zhang Yisen.

394
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,180
Hello, Dr. Zhang.

395
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,460
It's Zhang Yisen.

396
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,700
Hello, Dr. Zhang.

397
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,208
Su Ying.

398
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,299
Visiting the light market.

399
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,099
Yes. Eat it.

400
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:35,740
Miss Su, I've heard of you.

401
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,779
So did you come here

402
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,779
to see Yunsheng for...?

403
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,139
I came to discuss the design
of the glass house with Dr. Qin.

404
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:43,976
Yes.

405
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:45,704
Got it.

406
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,392
Miss Su,

407
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:50,180
this is our hospital's
specialty, meat pie.

408
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,579
There's nothing else like it.

409
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,139
The soup inside is made
using an ancient method.

410
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:56,619
You must have a good taste.

411
00:20:57,619 --> 00:20:59,779
I'll teach you. Hold it like this.

412
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:05,992
Lift it to your mouth

413
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:07,539
and bite down hard.

414
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,224
I'll get some tissues.

415
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:42,280
I'm sorry.

416
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:43,496
You two

417
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:44,488
shot quite accurately.

418
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,579
Do you want to change
your clothes in my dormitory?

419
00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:06,619
If the oil stain
isn't dealt with promptly,

420
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:07,816
it will leave a mark.

421
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:11,059
This is my dormitory.

422
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:12,264
Please make do.

423
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,020
You change here.

424
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,940
I'll go to Zhang's room.

425
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:27,819
Thanks.

426
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:28,740
Feel free to come get me.

427
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:17,500
Dr. Qin once told me

428
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,180
that love is a thing
that makes people happy.

429
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,299
I think if you could
live in such a house,

430
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,904
facing the sea,

431
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,900
with your loved one,

432
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,859
it must be very romantic.

433
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,832
(Mi Su)

434
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,539
(must have had a happy life.)

435
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:56,220
How is it? All done?

436
00:23:57,139 --> 00:23:58,056
In a moment.

437
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,900
Why did I agree to his request?

438
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:06,260
How do I make a rainbow?

439
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,940
How can I make a rainbow?

440
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,980
Why is it so hard?

441
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,856
Garlic Buddy,

442
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,040
tell me

443
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,819
how I can make rainbows.

444
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,544
Say something.

445
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:31,539
You've been at my house for two days.

446
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,299
I haven't mistreated you, have I?

447
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,379
I water you every day

448
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:35,900
and raise you well. Isn't that so?

449
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,819
Now you lie here so comfortably.

450
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,139
At least give me some inspiration.

451
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,660
Forget it. It's pointless to ask you.

452
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,059
Hello, how can I assist you?

453
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:58,779
How do I make a rainbow?

454
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:01,460
A rainbow is composed of seven colors.

455
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,220
Red, orange, yellow,
green, cyan, blue and violet.

456
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,339
I know that, of course.

457
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,619
I don't need you to tell me.

458
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,700
Please say that again patiently.

459
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:12,220
Didn't I make myself clear?

460
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,579
Didn't I articulate my words?

461
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,299
Please control your emotion.

462
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,700
How can I control my emotion?

463
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,059
Emotions are a general term

464
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,859
for a series
of subjective cognitive experiences.

465
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,579
They are attitudes and experiences
towards objective matters

466
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:25,379
and corresponding behavioral responses.

467
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:57,736
Morning.

468
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,460
Ying, morning.

469
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,368
Ying, morning.

470
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,859
What's wrong?

471
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:05,704
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

472
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,080
Move it away.

473
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:26,260
(Dr. Qin, are you satisfied
with the glass house?)

474
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:28,379
(House Design)
(Can I not answer this question?)

475
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,900
(Then why did you come back
to House Design?)

476
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:34,539
(I want to renovate it.)

477
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,819
(Any flaws with the glass house?)

478
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:38,900
(The smell is strong in the summer.)

479
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,420
(The whole house is made of glass.)

480
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:43,740
(Cold in winter, hot in summer?)

481
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,184
(Yes, it's quite hot.)

482
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,700
(Does a glass house get humid easily)

483
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,579
(and is the smell of seawater strong?)

484
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,392
(Yes.)

485
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:54,980
(So are you not satisfied
with the current design?)

486
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,020
(The designer is so bad.)

487
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,619
(What can this eye candy do?)

488
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:58,696
(She should be banned.)

489
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,900
(She should compensate.)

490
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:01,099
(- So bad.)
(- Change her!)

491
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:01,940
(Is she nuts?)

492
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,299
Why didn't you close it?

493
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:25,299
(The whole house is made of glass.)

494
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:26,619
(Cold in winter, hot in summer?)

495
00:27:27,784 --> 00:27:28,808
(Doctors' rest area)
(Yes, it's quite hot.)

496
00:27:28,808 --> 00:27:30,980
(Doctors' rest area)
(Does a glass house get humid easily?)

497
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:32,500
It's not what I said.

498
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,700
(Can one stay long in it?)

499
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,299
(The glass just shook so heavily.)

500
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:36,220
(Is a glass house livable?)

501
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,740
(Are you not satisfied
with current design?)

502
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:39,940
Isn't this the show you are on?

503
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,579
The trailer came out so soon.

504
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,779
The house has so many problems.

505
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:45,139
It's gimcrack.

506
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:56,940
That's why I suggested
you move back to the dorm.

507
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,220
You'd better not
restore your glass house.

508
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,579
It should be completely redesigned.

509
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,339
It was my request.
It has nothing to do with her.

510
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,099
Did the designer lie to you, Yunsheng?

511
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,099
I've heard many designers

512
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:08,420
are good at brainwashing their clients

513
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:10,500
and making them believe what they say.

514
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,420
Yunsheng, you need to learn to say no.

515
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,339
And the comments online are even worse.

516
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:18,379
Look at this. The useless designer

517
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:19,460
only cares about the look,

518
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,500
not caring about real needs.

519
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:21,700
Look at what they say.

520
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,619
Let me take a look.

521
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,328
(Miss Su, the trailer...)

522
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,460
That's right.

523
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:30,728
Look at this.

524
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,260
Ying shouldn't have taken this case.

525
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:39,500
It's thankless.

526
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,220
It's not that bad, Miss Ye.

527
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,344
How is it not bad?

528
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:44,859
The thing from many years ago was dug up

529
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,420
and she has to continue with this case.

530
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,539
If it's well done,
they'd say it isn't innovative.

531
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:50,500
If it's innovative,
they'd say it's gimmicky.

532
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:53,139
I'm so angry.

533
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,099
In that case,

534
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,539
Dr. Qin is really ungrateful.

535
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:00,059
When he chose
that voice-activated light last time,

536
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,020
I felt his taste wasn't quite up to par.

537
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,660
And now I think

538
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:05,859
his character isn't great either.

539
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,460
Can we stop gossiping about others?

540
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,896
Let's just get to work.

541
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,368
I'm angry.

542
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:14,579
Cut this scene.

543
00:29:14,824 --> 00:29:15,740
Here?

544
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,584
Yes.

545
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,008
No, cut that word out
and put it at the end.

546
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,819
- Okay.
- Pay attention to the continuity.

547
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,339
No. Switch to the shots of those people.

548
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:26,696
Hurry.

549
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,912
Do it now.

550
00:29:27,912 --> 00:29:28,819
Is this okay?

551
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:30,859
Yes. That's it.

552
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:32,940
How is it?

553
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,260
Mr. Liu, you are so brilliant.

554
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:37,579
No wonder the click rate
is so high this time.

555
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,912
It's nothing much. It's my experience.

556
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:41,900
Very good.

557
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:43,720
Okay.

558
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,819
Move to the next segment.

559
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:48,740
Miss Du, you're back?

560
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,220
If I didn't come back,

561
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,660
House Design
would turn into Rumormonger.

562
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:56,040
Miss Du.

563
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:57,992
Leave.

564
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,592
What is it, Miss Du?

565
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,579
To see my masterpiece?

566
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:08,744
Mr. Liu, what are you doing?

567
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:12,539
Okay, no more nonsense with you.

568
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,139
Look at the data first.

569
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:18,099
Have a look
at the preview of this episode.

570
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,700
Do you see the number
of bullet comments?

571
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:23,299
Can you see the screen?

572
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,779
No, you can't!

573
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,180
It's all covered by the bullet comments.

574
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,420
Have you seen this before

575
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,420
or so many comments before?

576
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:29,660
And there's more.

577
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,539
Let me show you the back-end data.

578
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,339
Do you see? The contrast is this big

579
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,420
compared to the data from other shows.
It's so hot.

580
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,299
Are you surprised?

581
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,139
You slandered others

582
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:43,500
just for the data.

583
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,980
To create conflict,

584
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:48,900
distorting the owner's words
and malicious editing.

585
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,660
Even if you want good results,

586
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,900
can't you have some conscience?

587
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:55,900
Miss Du, calm down.

588
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,900
Here's the thing.

589
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,260
You know the market has been bad

590
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:00,579
in recent years.

591
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,940
We can talk about dreams and pursuits,

592
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:04,379
but shouldn't we think of ways

593
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:05,900
to make our show survive first?

594
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,900
But our show

595
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,740
is not the type of video clip
that aims to catch the eye.

596
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:13,059
What would this show be like
after you did this?

597
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:15,579
Do you know how difficult it was
to invite those two guests?

598
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:16,840
That's what I want.

599
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:18,859
This is what's called reasonable
but unexpected.

600
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,500
Shall we create a script with a twist?

601
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:22,728
What do you think?

602
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,059
Why did you do

603
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:25,059
such a poor job with the show?

604
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,660
I can't make it clear to you.

605
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:28,420
What's wrong?
I haven't finished talking yet.

606
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:30,379
Young people need
to have flexible minds.

607
00:31:30,728 --> 00:31:33,352
(Miss Su, it was malicious editing
from the production team.)

608
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:41,704
Yunsheng.

609
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,856
Yunsheng.

610
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,020
Take a look. KNK has released
an official statement.

611
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,299
Miss Su Ying from SU Design Firm

612
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:52,700
used 2,000 pieces
of glass for the exterior to create

613
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,740
the most eye-catching visual effect

614
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,139
within just one and a half months.

615
00:31:57,379 --> 00:31:59,859
Since its completion,
the traffic has skyrocketed.

616
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,180
It has brought
substantial economic benefits

617
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,260
to the KNK Group
and surrounding businesses.

618
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,500
But the comments aren't very...

619
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:12,940
(KNK's building was built
within just one and a half months?)

620
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:14,312
(Is the quality okay?)

621
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,460
(The glass house in House Design)

622
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,139
(was built within the same time.)

623
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,180
(But its quality seems
a lot worse than KNK's.)

624
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:25,180
They selectively edited
and twisted my words.

625
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,900
No wonder they think so.

626
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,660
One and a half months

627
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:30,220
is astonishingly short indeed.

628
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,139
(Dr. Qin, are you satisfied
with the glass house?)

629
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,180
(May I not answer this question?)

630
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,980
(Then why did you come back
to House Design?)

631
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,539
Yes, include this entire segment.

632
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,608
Each and every frame.

633
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:50,728
Don't worry.

634
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,660
Please wait a moment. I'll be done soon.

635
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,136
Okay.

636
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,220
I'm really sorry about the trailer.

637
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:05,859
It was my negligence.

638
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:08,500
I need a reasonable answer.

639
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:11,539
The trailer employed

640
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:13,099
rather misleading editing techniques.

641
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:14,660
But don't worry.

642
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,220
I will strictly inspect

643
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,539
every video that is aired.

644
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:18,779
There will be

645
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:19,980
no reckless editing again.

646
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,859
We will also keep

647
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:24,819
every single frame of your videos.

648
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:28,539
That's not what I want to ask.

649
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,819
What happened six years ago?

650
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,344
What are you referring to?

651
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:47,404
(One and a half months? Speciosity.
Such a short time. Grandstanding.)

652
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,819
Why did Su Ying choose
to use glass six years ago?

653
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,059
Actually, there were many reasons.

654
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,139
But the effect of glass was quite good.

655
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,088
I want to watch

656
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:03,660
the interview back then.

657
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,320
You must have the copy.

658
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,656
(The most important reason)

659
00:34:11,656 --> 00:34:12,940
(why I chose to use)

660
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:16,139
(glass as the main building material)

661
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,820
(was that I wanted
to achieve the best effect)

662
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,259
(in the shortest possible time)

663
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:24,860
(to fulfill my client's wish.)

664
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,860
Miss Su didn't let me include this part.

665
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,820
I know why you used glass now.

666
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,659
It is quick to assemble
and doesn't emit a smell.

667
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:01,139
The homeowner can move in
in the shortest possible time.

668
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,820
Miss Mi Su's condition

669
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:09,512
seems a bit terrible.

670
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:13,940
With glass, the period
only takes one and a half months.

671
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,264
Miss Du,

672
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:17,739
I have a favor to ask.

673
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:19,112
Go ahead.

674
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:21,219
Could you not emphasize

675
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,259
the time aspect in this project?

676
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,820
Because it might be a little cruel

677
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,780
to Miss Mi Su.

678
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:30,259
Can the parts where I was interviewed
not be included, please?

679
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,780
But the designers who come to our show

680
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,579
all hope to build a good image

681
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,780
and make a breakthrough through it.

682
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,420
I think it's commendable
for you to use glass

683
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,300
to save time for Mi Su.

684
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,699
We can promote your spirit
of humanitarian concern

685
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,139
as a warm-hearted designer.

686
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,460
I know, but none of that matters now.

687
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,784
As long as they like it.

688
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,539
At that time, I thought

689
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:58,179
I'd make friends with her.
