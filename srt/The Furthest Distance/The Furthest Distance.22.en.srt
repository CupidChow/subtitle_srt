I have something to say.

19
00:01:52,717 --> 00:01:53,277
Go ahead.

20
00:01:55,357 --> 00:01:58,197
Since I resigned

21
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:00,876
and started my own business,

22
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:02,796
you have been helping me.

23
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:04,956
I am fully aware of that.

24
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:07,796
I just don't know how to thank you.

25
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:09,437
You don't have to.

26
00:02:10,037 --> 00:02:11,637
I'm glad I could help.

27
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:13,676
I've never expected anything

28
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:15,276
in return from you.

29
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:16,396
Be easy about it.

30
00:02:16,877 --> 00:02:18,317
I could be okay.

31
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:19,917
I...

32
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,477
Well,

33
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:25,437
if I want to take our relationship
to the next level,

34
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:27,077
will you be okay with it?

35
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:33,357
Actually, I think...

36
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:37,676
Well,

37
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:39,477
after the awards ceremony,

38
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:42,877
I feel like you've been avoiding me.

39
00:02:44,877 --> 00:02:47,077
You seem to be very wary.

40
00:02:47,077 --> 00:02:47,996
I did not.

41
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:50,676
I was just afraid

42
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,757
we might not even be friends anymore.

43
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:55,197
Huixuan,

44
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:56,757
I also have something

45
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:58,157
to tell you.

46
00:02:58,396 --> 00:02:58,996
Go ahead.

47
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:01,477
I lied to you before.

48
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:06,917
I once told you

49
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:08,437
that I've let it go.

50
00:03:09,116 --> 00:03:10,396
But I lied.

51
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:14,556
I've never gotten over you.

52
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:18,157
I like you.

53
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:23,276
As always.

54
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:51,996
You're drunk.

55
00:03:52,637 --> 00:03:53,317
No, I'm not.

56
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:57,597
I know what I'm doing.

57
00:04:00,437 --> 00:04:01,236
I'm drunk.

58
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:21,237
Okay. The most handsome

59
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:23,237
and talented Dr. Qin,
it's time to go to work.

60
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:24,437
I have to go.

61
00:04:24,637 --> 00:04:25,197
Go ahead.

62
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:34,197
Wait a moment.

63
00:04:34,997 --> 00:04:35,596
Wait.

64
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:41,956
You didn't eat much for breakfast.

65
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:42,716
Take this with you.

66
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,036
Eat it before the surgery.

67
00:04:44,637 --> 00:04:45,237
Replenish energy.

68
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:47,677
Thank you.

69
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:51,197
I am leaving.

70
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:51,677
Go ahead.

71
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:53,797
You can do it.

72
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:03,637
Good morning, Su Ying.

73
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:05,077
Morning, Mi Bai.

74
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:08,276
I saw you two showing affection.

75
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,637
We were caring for each other,
not showing off.

76
00:05:13,156 --> 00:05:14,596
You have no need to be shy.

77
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:16,317
Love should be expressed,

78
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:18,237
in case of being stolen away.

79
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:20,557
What?

80
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:23,716
Nothing, just personal insights.

81
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:25,637
But you'll understand soon.

82
00:05:27,797 --> 00:05:29,716
I will have surgery with Yunsheng today.

83
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:30,836
I have to go.

84
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:34,156
Good luck with that.

85
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:41,877
Yunsheng.

86
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:43,356
Relax.

87
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:44,237
It's okay.

88
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:45,516
We just follow

89
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:46,920
the surgical plan.

90
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:48,396
We can do it.

91
00:05:49,237 --> 00:05:49,956
Go for it.

92
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:53,352
(Operation)

93
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:37,276
Director, how's my child?

94
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:39,117
The surgery went very well.

95
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:40,237
Wait in the ward.

96
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:43,356
Thank you.

97
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:44,596
Thank you.

98
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:46,997
Thank you.

99
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:56,516
Dr. Qin.

100
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:58,716
The surgery is successful.

101
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:00,677
You did a good job

102
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:01,637
as a medical assistant.

103
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:03,237
Right.

104
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:05,237
You two worked together so well.

105
00:08:05,677 --> 00:08:08,437
Looks like you've rehearsed many times.

106
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:11,077
Dr. Qin was fully prepared.

107
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:12,437
Well,

108
00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:14,437
I've done a lot of surgeries before.

109
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:15,916
Not many doctors could work together

110
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:16,916
so well like you two.

111
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,197
You did well in this surgery.

112
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:20,596
Thank you.

113
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:21,877
I have to go.

114
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:26,396
Yunsheng, congratulations.

115
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:27,276
You too.

116
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,956
We will have a review meeting later.

117
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:32,236
I know.

118
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,437
There is good news to announce.

119
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:36,277
Good news?

120
00:08:36,996 --> 00:08:37,836
You'll know.

121
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:42,677
Everyone has been working hard.

122
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:45,716
Lele's surgery is very successful.

123
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:46,876
Well,

124
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,557
I want to congratulate

125
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:50,437
Dr. Qin and Dr. Mi.

126
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:53,037
So, let's give them

127
00:08:53,197 --> 00:08:54,517
a round of applause.

128
00:08:59,437 --> 00:09:00,317
Next,

129
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:02,876
I have an announcement to make.

130
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:04,797
The hospital hopes

131
00:09:05,116 --> 00:09:07,677
to help more children like Lele

132
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:09,356
and is going to restart the project

133
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:12,077
of the rural public welfare hospital.

134
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:14,517
It mainly serves children with CHD.

135
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:17,996
This project was set aside
for various reasons before,

136
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:19,996
but now

137
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:21,317
it can be restarted.

138
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:23,596
Dr. Mi is

139
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:25,077
in charge of this project.

140
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:26,397
Mi Bai.

141
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:28,077
You say something.

142
00:09:28,596 --> 00:09:29,157
Okay.

143
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:32,596
First of all, I want
to thank the hospital for trusting me.

144
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,236
Actually, I've been

145
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:36,197
advancing this project for a long time.

146
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:37,277
I hope

147
00:09:37,397 --> 00:09:38,596
that through my efforts,

148
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:40,157
I can help move this project forward

149
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:43,356
to make medical resources

150
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:46,236
more accessible
for rural children with CHD.

151
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:48,356
When I was abroad,

152
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:50,317
I did medical aid for a year,

153
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,517
and learned related operation knowledge.

154
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:55,596
I have also visited those

155
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:58,517
who used to work on the CHD cases.

156
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:00,996
So in this respect,

157
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:03,116
I'm sure
I can take everyone's research spirit

158
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:04,996
on the CHD

159
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:07,356
to a more meaningful stage.

160
00:10:11,517 --> 00:10:12,037
Yunsheng.

161
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:14,356
I hope you can be a consultant

162
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:15,557
for this project,

163
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:17,996
providing surgical information.

164
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:18,716
No problem.

165
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:19,476
Okay.

166
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:22,037
We need to work on
the establishment of the hospital,

167
00:10:22,836 --> 00:10:23,917
look for the designer,

168
00:10:24,236 --> 00:10:25,236
and contractor.

169
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:27,557
Dr. Mi, you discuss it

170
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:30,596
with our colleagues
in the comprehensive office.

171
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:31,197
Okay.

172
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:32,636
Looking for the designer?

173
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:35,356
Dr. Qin's girlfriend is a designer.

174
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,277
Right?

175
00:10:36,277 --> 00:10:37,557
Yeah, Dr. Qin.

176
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:38,917
Miss Su has won big awards.

177
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:39,557
Right.

178
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:40,116
Indeed.

179
00:10:40,996 --> 00:10:41,876
Miss Su can do it.

180
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:43,996
She's highly skilled and a good person.

181
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,116
We're very familiar.

182
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:46,677
I think she's a good fit.

183
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:47,437
Do you think so?

184
00:10:47,836 --> 00:10:48,716
- Right.
- Right.

185
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:51,317
She has won a lot of big awards.

186
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:52,756
Dr. Qin, it's lucky to get her help,

187
00:10:52,996 --> 00:10:54,037
right?

188
00:10:56,716 --> 00:10:58,037
It's going to be well-designed.

189
00:10:58,077 --> 00:10:58,596
Exactly.

190
00:10:58,956 --> 00:10:59,756
Yunsheng.

191
00:11:02,756 --> 00:11:05,317
What do you think
about their suggestions?

192
00:11:05,476 --> 00:11:07,077
Su Ying is the designer of hospital?

193
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:08,037
Right.

194
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:10,836
I need to ask her.

195
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:12,636
Okay.

196
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:22,636
Thanks.

197
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:23,077
See you.

198
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:24,397
Thank you.

199
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:25,517
I can carry it.

200
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:26,677
I can help.

201
00:11:29,236 --> 00:11:30,636
We just selected

202
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:32,157
some proper gifts.

203
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,636
Your client should like them.

204
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:36,077
I remember the first gift you gave me

205
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:37,437
was also bought in this mall.

206
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:39,917
It was a watch, right?

207
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:43,716
It didn't help,

208
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,636
because you are rarely punctual.

209
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:50,557
I was late occasionally.

210
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,596
Every time I was late,

211
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:53,677
I would buy

212
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:55,077
your favorite milk tea as an apology.

213
00:11:58,236 --> 00:11:59,596
This mall has changed.

214
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:02,197
And now I don't drink milk tea much.

215
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:03,277
Too much sugar.

216
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:06,077
I'll go buy some household items.

217
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:14,077
- Su Ying.
- Hi, pay for them together?

218
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:14,756
Right.

219
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:15,437
Separately.

220
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:17,437
I'll pay.

221
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:19,517
I bought them for my boyfriend.

222
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:25,037
Alright, then...

223
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:28,476
Scan for WeChat payment.

224
00:12:29,437 --> 00:12:29,996
Okay.

225
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:31,528
(Supermarket)

226
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:37,437
Thank you for today.

227
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:39,236
Not at all.

228
00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:41,476
On the contrary, I feel like

229
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:43,116
you've given me a chance
to make up for regrets.

230
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:50,116
Do you remember the last request

231
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:51,517
you made to me before we broke up?

232
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:56,557
You wanted to travel

233
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:57,636
and watch a sunrise.

234
00:12:58,677 --> 00:12:59,677
But because of my job,

235
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:01,517
it didn't happen.

236
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:05,517
It's not exactly a regret.

237
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:07,317
You were busy. It's understandable.

238
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:10,716
I just didn't expect it

239
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:12,836
to be your last request for me.

240
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,876
Actually, I've been thinking

241
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:18,517
if we had traveled

242
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:20,077
and watched a sunrise,

243
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,077
what would we be like now?

244
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:28,716
Mr. Yang, Dr. Qin is waiting for me.

245
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:29,876
I have to go.

246
00:13:30,437 --> 00:13:32,917
Thank you for selecting gifts with me.

247
00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:34,517
Thank you.

248
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:46,876
It's a big meal.

249
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:48,277
Is it?

250
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:50,476
That's not all.

251
00:13:51,437 --> 00:13:52,437
And this.

252
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:54,277
What is it?

253
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:55,236
Let me see.

254
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:05,836
Scrub caps.

255
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:08,677
I hope these caps

256
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:10,917
can accompany you
through different surgeries.

257
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:11,996
When you wear it,

258
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:13,716
you'll feel like I'm by your side,

259
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:14,517
cheering for you.

260
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:16,797
I really like it.

261
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:18,077
- Thank you.
- Okay.

262
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:22,157
I went shopping today.

263
00:14:22,476 --> 00:14:23,917
I have something else to tell you.

264
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:25,197
What is it?

265
00:14:25,956 --> 00:14:27,356
Meichi has decided

266
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:29,476
to build a rural
public welfare hospital.

267
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:31,636
Public welfare hospital?

268
00:14:32,077 --> 00:14:32,876
It aims

269
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,677
to allow many children like Lele

270
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:36,836
to get treated in the countryside.

271
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:38,836
That's great and meaningful.

272
00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:40,557
I am a medical consultant.

273
00:14:40,716 --> 00:14:42,236
Mi Bai is in charge of this project.

274
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:44,197
She's now looking for a designer.

275
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:46,876
Designer?

276
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:50,437
They hope you can do this job.

277
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,636
I can't decide for you,

278
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,236
so I'm asking

279
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:54,476
if you want to.

280
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:58,636
Drop the act.

281
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:01,236
You're active in charity events.

282
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:06,037
Send the information to me.

283
00:15:07,596 --> 00:15:08,116
Really?

284
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:11,677
Give you a shrimp.

285
00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:16,157
(Cardiology & Angiocardiopathy Outpatient Hall)

286
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:18,677
Su Ying is willing to know

287
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:20,317
about public welfare hospital.

288
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:21,716
Really?

289
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:24,677
You prepare the materials.

290
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,437
I will bring them to her tonight.

291
00:15:27,797 --> 00:15:28,917
There is a lot of information.

292
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:31,317
Once I finish it,

293
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:33,037
I will give it to her.

294
00:15:33,756 --> 00:15:35,116
Okay, thank you.

295
00:15:36,356 --> 00:15:36,856
Gotta go.

296
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:54,216
(File transferring)

297
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:00,075
(Sister. MP4)

298
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,397
It's the information of a patient
in your department.

299
00:16:11,476 --> 00:16:12,557
You give it to Ms. Han.

300
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:13,356
Yisen.

301
00:16:14,636 --> 00:16:15,157
Bai.

302
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,397
You take half a day off?

303
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:18,077
Yes, I'm off in the afternoon.

304
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:19,077
I am going to the mall.

305
00:16:19,317 --> 00:16:20,356
Do you need anything?

306
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:21,236
No.

307
00:16:22,277 --> 00:16:22,677
Oh, right.

308
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:24,836
Can you help me bring this to Su Ying?

309
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:26,236
What is it?

310
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,756
Some information about hospital project.

311
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,917
Alright, leave it to me.

312
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:33,437
Thank you.

313
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:34,716
Not at all.

314
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,037
I'm on it right now.

315
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,236
Thank you.

316
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:49,197
You could give it to Dr. Qin.

317
00:16:49,197 --> 00:16:49,876
It's okay.

318
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,476
Bai might think you need it badly.

319
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:53,996
I just happened to be off today.

320
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:56,157
This is my first visit here.

321
00:16:56,397 --> 00:16:57,836
Your place looks good.

322
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:00,636
I'm sure you can do a good job

323
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:02,077
on the hospital project.

324
00:17:02,677 --> 00:17:03,956
I'll do my best.

325
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:04,957
Well,

326
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:07,156
I'll have a look around.

327
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:08,436
Go ahead.

328
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:09,037
Can I?

329
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:09,957
Sure.

330
00:17:10,717 --> 00:17:11,196
Gotta go.

331
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:11,876
Alright.

332
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:35,676
(Mi Bai.)

333
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,757
(Do you remember)

334
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:40,477
(the day you confessed)

335
00:17:41,797 --> 00:17:43,317
(to Yunsheng for me under the rainbow?)

336
00:17:45,757 --> 00:17:47,557
(You were confessing for yourself too.)

337
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:48,916
(Right?)

338
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:51,596
(Sorry, I just found out)

339
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:56,436
(that you also like Yunsheng.)

340
00:17:58,436 --> 00:17:59,916
(I shouldn't have done this to you.)

341
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:04,477
(I've been
holding onto his love selfishly.)

342
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:07,636
(I hope)

343
00:18:12,196 --> 00:18:13,277
(you can forgive me.)

344
00:18:14,396 --> 00:18:14,916
(Okay?)

345
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:31,717
(Were the documents sent)

346
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,317
(by Mi Bai?)

347
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,876
(Yes, you have received them?)

348
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,436
(I don't understand some details.)

349
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:02,317
(Give me her contact info.)

350
00:19:02,797 --> 00:19:03,836
(I'll talk to her directly.)

351
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:08,156
(Okay.)

352
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,528
(Mi Bai)

353
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:33,576
(Su Ying, friend verification passed)

354
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:38,277
(Mi Bai.)

355
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:39,717
(Are you free today?)

356
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:40,957
(We need to talk.)

357
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,037
(Yes, you decide the time.)

358
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:24,477
So, what do you want to see me about?

359
00:20:36,356 --> 00:20:37,557
I've checked the documents

360
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:38,916
you gave me.

361
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:40,396
Really?

362
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:42,797
What do you not understand?

363
00:20:42,997 --> 00:20:44,037
I can explain.

364
00:20:45,396 --> 00:20:46,477
I don't understand

365
00:20:47,557 --> 00:20:48,477
your intention.

366
00:20:53,557 --> 00:20:56,077
Such an important video was mixed
in the documents.

367
00:20:56,836 --> 00:20:57,757
Was it accidental

368
00:20:58,237 --> 00:20:58,957
or intentional?

369
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:01,356
Interpret it as you like.

370
00:21:02,237 --> 00:21:03,277
This video

371
00:21:03,717 --> 00:21:05,396
contains the last words of my sister.

372
00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:08,396
This is to clarify a misunderstanding
between Yunsheng and me.

373
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:12,356
The person who confessed
to Yunsheng was me,

374
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:13,156
not my sister.

375
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:15,196
He got us mixed up.

376
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,077
That's what I don't understand.

377
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:23,676
Qin Yunsheng mistook you for Mi Su.

378
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,156
So what?

379
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:28,557
So, it's a destiny that was missed.

380
00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:36,317
To be honest,

381
00:21:37,757 --> 00:21:38,717
I am back

382
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:41,557
to claim what was originally mine.

383
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:45,436
It's obvious.

384
00:21:45,757 --> 00:21:48,196
Your maneuvers haven't stopped
since you returned.

385
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:51,116
I'm not destroying anything.

386
00:21:51,717 --> 00:21:54,116
You're the latecomer
in this relationship.

387
00:21:56,557 --> 00:21:58,636
Why don't you say this to Qin Yunsheng?

388
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:00,717
Because you can see

389
00:22:01,116 --> 00:22:02,636
that he has no interest
in you at all, right?

390
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:06,477
So why are you confident
that he should have been yours?

391
00:22:08,237 --> 00:22:10,916
You think you can replace Mi Su?

392
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:13,396
Aren't you very proud?

393
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:15,317
No need to belittle yourself like this.

394
00:22:16,317 --> 00:22:17,636
Or do you think

395
00:22:17,757 --> 00:22:19,976
Mi Su means nothing to him?

396
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:22,077
She can be replaced easily.

397
00:22:24,596 --> 00:22:25,557
Listen, Su Ying.

398
00:22:27,037 --> 00:22:28,436
I can give him to my sister.

399
00:22:30,196 --> 00:22:31,717
But I won't give him to you.

400
00:22:33,636 --> 00:22:34,596
Give him to me?

401
00:22:35,636 --> 00:22:36,077
Mi Bai.

402
00:22:37,077 --> 00:22:39,037
The only person
Qin Yunsheng loved before was Mi Su,

403
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:41,037
not you.

404
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:43,997
You'll know

405
00:22:44,436 --> 00:22:45,557
who he really loves.

406
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:48,116
Speaking of which,

407
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:50,277
why do you think

408
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:51,916
you're not a substitute

409
00:22:52,077 --> 00:22:54,277
for Qin Yunsheng?

410
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:00,477
Also,

411
00:23:00,997 --> 00:23:02,077
the hospital project

412
00:23:03,156 --> 00:23:04,037
is not suitable for you.

413
00:23:06,277 --> 00:23:07,797
Because I'm in charge of this project.

414
00:23:11,797 --> 00:23:14,517
Giving up at the right time

415
00:23:15,156 --> 00:23:17,757
will keep you from losing too badly.

416
00:23:20,077 --> 00:23:21,557
Giving up?

417
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:23,676
No way.

418
00:23:25,957 --> 00:23:27,196
I've said what I needed to say.

419
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:29,237
I have to go now.

420
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:34,396
By the way,

421
00:23:35,237 --> 00:23:37,676
Yunsheng has several surgeries
to perform.

422
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,356
In the operating room,

423
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:41,797
the medical assistant is important
to the main surgeon.

424
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:43,797
There can be no mistakes.

425
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,676
So you better not

426
00:23:48,196 --> 00:23:49,277
distract him.

427
00:24:13,277 --> 00:24:13,836
It's killing me.

428
00:24:14,517 --> 00:24:15,196
She pissed me off.

429
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:23,196
You're home.

430
00:24:27,196 --> 00:24:28,156
Dinner is ready.

431
00:24:29,277 --> 00:24:30,836
Okay, let me get changed.

432
00:25:00,356 --> 00:25:00,836
Dr. Qin.

433
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:02,037
Look at the two apples.

434
00:25:02,277 --> 00:25:03,156
Any difference?

435
00:25:06,717 --> 00:25:07,517
There's no difference.

436
00:25:07,997 --> 00:25:08,957
Aren't they both apples?

437
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:09,717
Well,

438
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:12,317
they are both apples,

439
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:13,836
but they are different.

440
00:25:14,317 --> 00:25:15,196
Look closely again.

441
00:25:16,957 --> 00:25:18,676
Okay, let me see.

442
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:20,596
They're the same.

443
00:25:21,717 --> 00:25:23,156
No, not at all.

444
00:25:23,317 --> 00:25:24,557
Their patterns

445
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,356
and colors are different.

446
00:25:27,997 --> 00:25:28,636
Dr. Qin.

447
00:25:29,517 --> 00:25:30,757
Are you nearsighted?

448
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:33,116
I'm not.

449
00:25:33,757 --> 00:25:34,876
You must have astigmatism, right?

450
00:25:35,037 --> 00:25:35,797
I'm sure.

451
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:37,676
I don't have it.

452
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,317
How can you not tell the difference?

453
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,156
You should get your eyes checked.

454
00:25:42,836 --> 00:25:44,517
My eyes are fine.

455
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:46,477
What are you trying to ask me?

456
00:25:46,676 --> 00:25:47,156
I...

457
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:49,196
I...

458
00:25:50,356 --> 00:25:51,477
Never mind. Let's eat.

459
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:52,277
Come on.

460
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:17,836
What's wrong?

461
00:26:19,717 --> 00:26:20,317
It's sour.

462
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:22,477
Why did you use lime today?

463
00:26:23,037 --> 00:26:24,916
I remember you always used lemon before.

464
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,436
I've always used lime before.

465
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,396
I can't mix up lemon and lime.

466
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:30,797
What about Mi Bai and Mi Su?

467
00:26:35,356 --> 00:26:36,396
Will you mix them up?

468
00:26:36,757 --> 00:26:38,517
I certainly won't.

469
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:39,997
Mi Bai and Mi Su

470
00:26:40,037 --> 00:26:40,916
are completely different.

471
00:26:41,156 --> 00:26:42,156
How can that be?

472
00:26:43,317 --> 00:26:44,757
But you just got confused.

473
00:26:48,436 --> 00:26:49,836
What's wrong with you today?

474
00:26:51,636 --> 00:26:52,037
I...

475
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:56,077
I don't know which one to eat.

476
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,876
They're both apples.

477
00:26:59,396 --> 00:27:00,676
But they're different.

478
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:02,717
Well,

479
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:05,116
are you going to eat or not?

480
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:08,156
Yes.

481
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,356
I'll eat this one.

482
00:27:26,636 --> 00:27:27,636
(Listen, Su Ying.)

483
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,997
The person who confessed
to Yunsheng was me,

484
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:31,876
not my sister.

485
00:27:32,757 --> 00:27:34,156
I can give him to my sister,

486
00:27:35,836 --> 00:27:37,636
but I won't give him to you.

487
00:27:53,717 --> 00:27:56,116
Thanks for your hard work.

488
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:57,317
My pleasure.

489
00:27:57,636 --> 00:27:59,797
I hope this project can be completed
as soon as possible.

490
00:28:00,836 --> 00:28:02,396
Have you found a designer?

491
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:03,797
How about Su Ying?

492
00:28:04,356 --> 00:28:05,356
I've asked her.

493
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:07,396
She's not interested in this project.

494
00:28:07,797 --> 00:28:08,477
Moreover,

495
00:28:08,517 --> 00:28:10,196
the style of her previous designs

496
00:28:10,277 --> 00:28:12,196
is quite different
from that of this project.

497
00:28:12,797 --> 00:28:14,477
She might not be capable.

498
00:28:14,717 --> 00:28:15,517
Who told you?

499
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:19,396
Miss Su.

500
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:20,436
Director.

501
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:24,077
I'm here today

502
00:28:24,317 --> 00:28:26,557
to formally discuss this with Mi Bai.

503
00:28:27,557 --> 00:28:29,636
So you are interested?

504
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:32,717
Yes, I'm taking this job.

505
00:28:33,636 --> 00:28:36,237
Alright, you two talk about the details.

506
00:28:36,477 --> 00:28:37,116
Okay.

507
00:28:37,356 --> 00:28:38,717
Miss Su, thank you for this.

508
00:28:39,077 --> 00:28:39,757
You're welcome.

509
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:45,317
I didn't expect you to come.

510
00:28:46,636 --> 00:28:49,077
I don't think this project suits you.

511
00:28:49,636 --> 00:28:50,196
Don't worry.

512
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:51,636
I'll prove my worth

513
00:28:52,237 --> 00:28:54,116
at work or something else.

514
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:56,477
Don't be so cocky.

515
00:28:56,876 --> 00:28:58,277
Hand in a preliminary scheme first.

516
00:28:59,237 --> 00:28:59,997
No problem.

517
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,196
(Conference Room)

518
00:29:06,196 --> 00:29:07,836
This is the project
information for the Meichi.

519
00:29:08,156 --> 00:29:08,876
Take a look.

520
00:29:10,077 --> 00:29:12,317
This project looks good.

521
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,317
And it's from Meichi.

522
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:16,836
We can't refuse Dr. Qin's project.

523
00:29:17,596 --> 00:29:19,277
Moreover, this project is
for public welfare.

524
00:29:19,477 --> 00:29:20,997
If we can do this case well,

525
00:29:21,396 --> 00:29:23,156
it will be of great help to society.

526
00:29:23,557 --> 00:29:25,237
Yes, I agree. I'll vote for it.

527
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:26,836
Me too.

528
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:29,517
Although we have many works

529
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,757
with strong aesthetic appeal,

530
00:29:30,957 --> 00:29:32,077
it doesn't mean

531
00:29:32,277 --> 00:29:33,757
we can't design practical buildings

532
00:29:33,757 --> 00:29:34,997
like a hospital.

533
00:29:35,557 --> 00:29:37,317
Yes, I think we can give it a try.

534
00:29:42,436 --> 00:29:44,317
Tian Mei, what do you think?

535
00:29:49,477 --> 00:29:50,436
I think

536
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:53,676
we shouldn't take this job.

537
00:29:56,156 --> 00:29:57,277
Why?

538
00:29:57,717 --> 00:29:58,356
Why?

539
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:01,416
None of us
have ever designed a hospital.

540
00:30:01,928 --> 00:30:04,037
High difficulty,
tight budget, and low return.

541
00:30:04,396 --> 00:30:06,757
Most importantly,
it can't boost our popularity.

542
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:08,916
It's a bit impulsive to take on

543
00:30:09,636 --> 00:30:10,317
this project.

544
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:13,757
Do you think

545
00:30:14,317 --> 00:30:15,436
I'm impulsive?

546
00:30:15,957 --> 00:30:16,517
Ying,

547
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,477
if we give up what we are good at

548
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,717
to design a functional building,

549
00:30:20,757 --> 00:30:22,156
it will be a risk in itself.

550
00:30:23,676 --> 00:30:25,156
If you're not impulsive,

551
00:30:25,396 --> 00:30:26,636
I really can't understand.

552
00:30:27,636 --> 00:30:28,396
Tian Mei,

553
00:30:28,836 --> 00:30:30,957
we shouldn't only
think of fame and profit.

554
00:30:31,317 --> 00:30:33,636
Ying has won the ADA's top award.

555
00:30:33,836 --> 00:30:34,876
Now if we can

556
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,676
be helpful to society,

557
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:37,517
is there a problem?

558
00:30:38,196 --> 00:30:38,916
There's no problem.

559
00:30:39,436 --> 00:30:41,077
But aren't we discussing it now?

560
00:30:41,077 --> 00:30:42,477
I'm just expressing my opinion.

561
00:30:42,477 --> 00:30:43,196
Any problem?

562
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,797
Before we start a project,

563
00:30:53,957 --> 00:30:54,997
we'll do a lot of work.

564
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:56,957
Ying will make thorough preparation

565
00:30:57,237 --> 00:30:58,596
after careful consideration.

566
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:00,077
So we have to trust her.

567
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:00,596
Right.

568
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,196
As you know,

569
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,196
Jiang Dong encouraged Lele before,

570
00:31:09,356 --> 00:31:10,676
and he felt that helping others

571
00:31:10,757 --> 00:31:12,356
is fulfilling

572
00:31:12,636 --> 00:31:13,477
and rewarding.

573
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,237
That's the purpose.

574
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:17,836
It's a one-time thing for Jiang Dong.

575
00:31:18,156 --> 00:31:20,596
But this is a long-term project.

576
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:22,396
Tian Mei,

577
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:24,116
I respect your thoughts.

578
00:31:24,596 --> 00:31:25,477
But we have to

579
00:31:25,997 --> 00:31:27,237
follow the collective decision.

580
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:37,156
Of course.

581
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,477
After all, this is your firm.

582
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:42,436
You have the final say.

583
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,477
Ye, you collect all the materials

584
00:31:46,557 --> 00:31:48,636
about public welfare hospitals
at home and abroad.

585
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:49,676
Okay.

586
00:31:58,436 --> 00:32:00,277
(I ordered coffee for you.)

587
00:32:01,077 --> 00:32:02,317
(Just for me?)

588
00:32:02,997 --> 00:32:04,116
(Isn't this too obvious?)

589
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,037
(I ordered for everyone.)

590
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:12,596
(But yours is the hazelnut flavor.)

591
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:14,436
Xu Mingshi?

592
00:32:14,797 --> 00:32:15,116
It's me.

593
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:15,596
Your coffee.

594
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:16,396
Thank you.

595
00:32:20,876 --> 00:32:22,277
Come on. Let's take a break.

596
00:32:22,517 --> 00:32:23,836
Huixuan got us coffee.

597
00:32:24,436 --> 00:32:26,676
Huixuan has started to feed us remotely.

598
00:32:26,797 --> 00:32:28,557
This means Huixuan loves us.

599
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:34,717
Yours is too big.

600
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,916
I told Huixuan that I was a bit sleepy.

601
00:32:41,116 --> 00:32:42,077
I need three cups of coffee.

602
00:32:42,277 --> 00:32:44,596
Perhaps they're put in one cup.

603
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:46,596
Give this to Tian Mei.

604
00:32:47,037 --> 00:32:48,037
She's not here.

605
00:32:48,636 --> 00:32:49,077
Where is she?

606
00:32:49,196 --> 00:32:49,757
I don't know.

607
00:32:50,317 --> 00:32:51,596
I'll give it to her later.

608
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,749
(For Mingshi.)

609
00:33:09,676 --> 00:33:10,196
(Received.)

610
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:17,156
Dr. Mi,

611
00:33:17,757 --> 00:33:19,317
did the meeting go smoothly?

612
00:33:21,277 --> 00:33:21,916
It went quite well

613
00:33:22,757 --> 00:33:25,037
thanks to you.

614
00:33:25,596 --> 00:33:26,396
It went quite well?

615
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:29,836
You mean you have learned from it?

616
00:33:30,757 --> 00:33:32,037
For your private life,

617
00:33:32,317 --> 00:33:33,596
it didn't go quite well, right?

618
00:33:35,356 --> 00:33:37,196
What do you mean by that?

619
00:33:37,836 --> 00:33:40,037
Are we discussing cooperation?

620
00:33:40,517 --> 00:33:42,676
Or are you laughing at me?

621
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:46,277
Meichi has a public welfare project.

622
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,676
You're in charge of it,
and Su Ying is the designer, right?

623
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:52,836
It seems that you're well-informed.

624
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:54,396
But I'm not going

625
00:33:55,517 --> 00:33:56,676
to give this job to her.

626
00:33:58,676 --> 00:34:00,517
I know what you're thinking.

627
00:34:00,876 --> 00:34:02,037
On one hand,

628
00:34:02,037 --> 00:34:03,676
you don't want her to help Dr. Qin.

629
00:34:03,676 --> 00:34:05,196
On the other hand, you don't want

630
00:34:05,196 --> 00:34:07,396
to offer them a chance
to be together at work,

631
00:34:07,596 --> 00:34:07,997
right?

632
00:34:13,437 --> 00:34:14,596
But think about it.

633
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:18,316
They will be together every day
because of this project,

634
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,477
but they might separate because of it.

635
00:34:23,716 --> 00:34:24,477
What do you mean?

636
00:34:26,756 --> 00:34:27,837
There's an old saying,

637
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:30,077
everything overdone will die early.

638
00:34:30,557 --> 00:34:31,437
In a relationship,

639
00:34:31,557 --> 00:34:32,517
when both sides sink

640
00:34:32,716 --> 00:34:35,316
into enough misunderstandings
and fatigue,

641
00:34:36,077 --> 00:34:37,796
they will naturally separate.

642
00:34:40,276 --> 00:34:41,837
You mean

643
00:34:42,756 --> 00:34:45,357
I should use this project
to sabotage the relationship?

644
00:34:46,236 --> 00:34:47,077
Why not?

645
00:34:48,357 --> 00:34:49,517
If they work together every day,

646
00:34:49,877 --> 00:34:52,116
inevitably, some friction will occur.

647
00:34:52,196 --> 00:34:53,596
This is a normal thing.

648
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:59,837
You underestimate Yunsheng's ability
to handle problems.

649
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:04,276
You underestimate my ability
to create problems.

650
00:35:07,236 --> 00:35:08,316
Let me introduce you to someone.

651
00:35:14,837 --> 00:35:15,517
Please sit.

652
00:35:22,397 --> 00:35:25,756
This is Tian Mei,
a designer at SU Design Firm.

653
00:35:28,077 --> 00:35:29,957
This is the person
in charge of the project.

654
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,077
Dr. Mi.

655
00:35:35,477 --> 00:35:36,116
Dr. Mi.

656
00:35:36,716 --> 00:35:38,517
Since you are in charge of the project,

657
00:35:39,077 --> 00:35:40,796
and I'm the chief designer
of SU Design Firm,

658
00:35:41,397 --> 00:35:43,676
along with Mr. Yang's assistance,

659
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:45,756
we will succeed.

660
00:35:59,477 --> 00:36:00,557
Your input for the upcoming plan

661
00:36:00,756 --> 00:36:01,957
is very important.

662
00:36:03,156 --> 00:36:05,397
Rest assured. I will not disappoint you.

663
00:36:06,116 --> 00:36:07,156
As long as you keep your word,

664
00:36:07,156 --> 00:36:08,397
I won't let you down.

665
00:36:09,357 --> 00:36:10,077
I promise you.

666
00:36:10,957 --> 00:36:12,276
I will use my connections and resources

667
00:36:12,357 --> 00:36:14,796
to help you open a studio for you.

668
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:17,276
You'll become a shining star

669
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,156
in this industry.

670
00:36:29,596 --> 00:36:30,037
Ying.

671
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:31,116
Chen and I have checked

672
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:32,756
the Meichi project separately.

673
00:36:32,997 --> 00:36:34,477
There should be no problem.

674
00:36:35,037 --> 00:36:35,917
Let me take a look.

675
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,688
(Project Overview)

676
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:53,837
No problem.

677
00:36:56,276 --> 00:36:58,397
This proposal needs to be delivered
to Meichi by 2 PM.

678
00:36:58,756 --> 00:36:59,596
You will go with me.

679
00:36:59,877 --> 00:37:00,796
Alright, no problem.

680
00:37:08,557 --> 00:37:09,596
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

681
00:37:10,276 --> 00:37:10,877
Miss Su.

682
00:37:11,557 --> 00:37:13,997
There's something wrong
with color-changing bricks you sent.

683
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:17,796
There's a problem?

684
00:37:18,316 --> 00:37:18,756
Yes.

685
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,636
I helped Lele for you.

686
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:23,997
I think you should help me with my work.

687
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,477
I apologize, Mr. Jiang.

688
00:37:27,116 --> 00:37:27,837
How about this?

689
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:28,917
I will visit you.

690
00:37:29,037 --> 00:37:30,676
If there's an issue,
I will solve it for you.

691
00:37:31,636 --> 00:37:32,276
Alright then.

692
00:37:35,397 --> 00:37:36,477
What happened?

693
00:37:37,636 --> 00:37:38,756
I have to see Jiang Dong.

694
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,477
What about Meichi?

695
00:37:48,156 --> 00:37:48,997
You print it out

696
00:37:49,196 --> 00:37:50,397
and check it carefully.

697
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:51,557
Then you personally deliver it.

698
00:37:51,997 --> 00:37:53,316
Alright, leave it to me.

699
00:37:54,276 --> 00:37:55,037
You tell Tian Mei

700
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:56,557
to see Jiang Dong with me later.

701
00:37:57,397 --> 00:37:58,837
Alright, I will let her know right now.

702
00:38:00,997 --> 00:38:01,676
Tian Mei.

703
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:04,077
You go to see Jiang Dong
with Ying later.

704
00:38:04,676 --> 00:38:05,676
Why?

705
00:38:06,236 --> 00:38:08,477
There seems to be a problem
with the color-changing bricks.

706
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:10,557
You and Ying solve it.

707
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:11,397
Alright.

708
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:13,517
What is this?

709
00:38:14,116 --> 00:38:14,756
A USB drive.

710
00:38:15,037 --> 00:38:16,397
Miss Su can't go to Meichi.

711
00:38:16,596 --> 00:38:17,837
I need to print a file and send it.

712
00:38:19,517 --> 00:38:21,517
I also have something to print.

713
00:38:21,796 --> 00:38:23,156
You've been busy and haven't eaten yet.

714
00:38:23,437 --> 00:38:24,316
I'll help you with it.

715
00:38:24,397 --> 00:38:25,316
Alright.

716
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,077
This is very important. Be serious.

717
00:38:27,077 --> 00:38:27,676
Don't worry.

718
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:28,477
I'm leaving now.

719
00:38:28,796 --> 00:38:29,236
Bye.

720
00:38:29,636 --> 00:38:30,156
Bye.

721
00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:44,557
Dr. Qin.

722
00:38:45,477 --> 00:38:46,077
Mingshi.

723
00:38:47,397 --> 00:38:48,517
The documents and the USB drive.

724
00:38:48,877 --> 00:38:50,196
Ying can't make it today.

725
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:51,116
So I sent them.

726
00:38:53,037 --> 00:38:53,357
Alright.

727
00:38:53,636 --> 00:38:55,116
I'll photocopy this right away.
Thank you.

728
00:38:55,196 --> 00:38:56,716
Not at all. I have to go.

729
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:06,596
Thank you, Yunsheng.

730
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,636
Director.

731
00:39:10,837 --> 00:39:13,716
This is Miss Su's preliminary plan.

732
00:39:13,957 --> 00:39:14,877
Everyone can have a check.

733
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:16,196
And then we can discuss it later.

734
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:16,917
Okay.

735
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:21,837
This is not what I ordered.

736
00:39:23,316 --> 00:39:24,397
I'm not shopping online.

737
00:39:24,957 --> 00:39:26,276
Fake goods?

738
00:39:27,517 --> 00:39:28,837
The ceramic tiles you sent me

739
00:39:28,837 --> 00:39:30,756
are nothing like what was in the plan.

740
00:39:31,156 --> 00:39:32,276
These are just ordinary tiles.

741
00:39:32,877 --> 00:39:34,316
Be careful of the details.

742
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:35,156
Right.

743
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:38,877
This design is wrong.

744
00:39:39,316 --> 00:39:40,596
How come the floor height

745
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:43,156
is 2.6 meters?

746
00:39:43,236 --> 00:39:44,316
Is there something wrong?

747
00:39:44,397 --> 00:39:45,276
This is a mistake.

748
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,077
Dr. Mi.

749
00:39:46,316 --> 00:39:48,557
There is a very obvious mistake.

750
00:39:49,276 --> 00:39:50,037
Where?

751
00:39:51,037 --> 00:39:52,037
By typical standards,

752
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:54,676
the floor height of the consulting room
should not be less than 2.6 meters.

753
00:39:54,837 --> 00:39:56,357
A ward's height is not less
than 2.8 meters.

754
00:39:56,837 --> 00:39:58,397
But according to this design,

755
00:39:58,477 --> 00:40:00,236
the ward's floor height

756
00:40:00,236 --> 00:40:01,796
shows 2.6 meters.

757
00:40:01,796 --> 00:40:02,477
Right.

758
00:40:04,796 --> 00:40:06,517
Tian Mei, what's going on?

759
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:08,636
Mr. Yang said

760
00:40:08,636 --> 00:40:10,357
he would allocate
color-changing bricks to us.

761
00:40:10,557 --> 00:40:12,517
I don't know what's going on.

762
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:15,276
You are in charge of this project.

763
00:40:15,477 --> 00:40:16,397
Ying.

764
00:40:16,756 --> 00:40:18,596
The goods were sent directly
from Tiandi Corp.

765
00:40:18,676 --> 00:40:19,557
You have to ask Mr. Yang.

766
00:40:23,276 --> 00:40:24,796
Mr. Jiang, I'm sorry.

767
00:40:25,517 --> 00:40:25,917
Well,

768
00:40:26,316 --> 00:40:28,037
let me communicate with them.

769
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:29,517
I promise I will solve your problem.

770
00:40:31,236 --> 00:40:31,877
Alright.

771
00:40:33,437 --> 00:40:34,997
Yunsheng, you have a look.

772
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:39,156
There are some errors here.

773
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:41,276
Why do we cooperate with SU Design Firm?

774
00:40:41,636 --> 00:40:42,756
Are they involved in this?

775
00:40:43,196 --> 00:40:44,716
It's an awful plan.

776
00:40:44,837 --> 00:40:45,997
They are too sloppy.

777
00:40:46,357 --> 00:40:47,316
Right.

778
00:40:48,636 --> 00:40:50,077
I believe in SU's expertise.

779
00:40:51,196 --> 00:40:52,196
There must be

780
00:40:52,837 --> 00:40:54,877
a misunderstanding.

781
00:40:55,357 --> 00:40:56,236
How about this?

782
00:40:56,796 --> 00:40:58,917
Let Su Ying explain
to everyone in person.

783
00:40:59,437 --> 00:41:00,837
Even so,

784
00:41:01,236 --> 00:41:01,957
her plan

785
00:41:01,997 --> 00:41:04,116
made me question her sincerity
towards this project.

786
00:41:04,437 --> 00:41:06,276
I suggest changing the designer.

787
00:41:06,437 --> 00:41:06,957
Right.

788
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:08,397
