You have

18

big rooms

19
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,420
and plenty of space to adopt

20
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,381
different colors in different areas.

21
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:52,181
Right?

22
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,981
Look, here.

23
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,780
We can make your study and kitchen

24
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:59,021
into contrasting colors.

25
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:01,821

- Here.
- I like it.

27
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,621
Your balcony faces the sea.

28
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,700
It's such a great view.

29
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,221
You can totally replace these

30
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,381
with French windows

31
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,221
to enjoy the view better.

32
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,981
Let me think.

33
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:20,821
Mr. Jiang.

34
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:23,740
What do you think?

35
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,781
Mr. Jiang.

36
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:28,140
You're absolutely right.

37
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,261
That's the detail I'm talking about.

38
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,101
Let me explain to you.

39
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:34,420
I've always wanted to fix this area.

40
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,941
Make it Gothic. Here. Impactful.

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,341
Build me a lab here.

42
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:41,341
Basement. Secret chamber.

43
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,460
A lab, you know?

44
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,501
Creepy.

45
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:45,300
Also,

46
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:47,900
do as you wish with the ceiling.

47
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:49,061
Most importantly,

48
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,101
the rooms.

49
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:51,700

50
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,501

Details.

52
00:02:56,136 --> 00:02:56,580
Details.

53
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,420
Shiny pink.

54
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,541
Come on, sit.

55
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,860
Tell you what.

56
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:03,180
We're going to work together for real.

57
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,300
What an honor.

58
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:08,261
Come on.

59
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,300
Also,

60
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:10,981
your boyfriend's suggestion

61
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,981
brought me new ideas.

62
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:13,941
Thank him for me.

63
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:14,860
He helped a lot.

64
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,420
Mr. Jiang.

65
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:20,740
In fact, I'm here

66
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,981
to ask you for a favor.

69
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,781
Let's visit Lele tomorrow.

70
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:55,368
I have a gift for her.

71
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:57,580
Lele.

72
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,180
Look.

73
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:02,061
It's the poster
of Jiang Dong's book signing.

74
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:04,900
You can attend the event
after the surgery.

75
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:09,720
(Jiang Dong, Suspense Author
Book Signing)

76
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:12,140
It's next month.

77
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:13,700
Who knows if I can go?

78
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,580
Of course, you can.

79
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,060
You can go to

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,300
all the book signings.

81
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:19,461
Yeah.

82
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,901
There will be many people.

83
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,620
Not everyone can go.

84
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,141
I'm sure you can.

85
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,176
Hello, Ying.

86
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,981
Lele, I brought a friend here.

87
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:41,221
Hello, Lele.

88
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,180
Hello. Mr. Jiang.

89
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,701
Mr. Jiang.

90
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,232
You came to see Lele in person?

91
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:49,060
Yeah.

92
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,760
Take a seat.

93
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,021
Sit.

94
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:53,860
Here, Lele.

95
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,420
Commemorative edition.

96
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:57,781
Thank you so much.

97
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,221
I wasn't expecting

98
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:00,060
such a young reader.

99
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:02,581
Mr. Jiang.

100
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:04,296
I have some questions for you.

101
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:04,860
Yeah?

102
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:07,661
Is the serial killer in Anatomy Diary

103
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,940
the newly-retired doctor?

104
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,860
Well,

105
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,260
wait for the updates,

106
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:15,940
or you'll stop reading my novels.

107
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,661
No way. I promise I'll keep reading.

108
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,420
I just want to know who the killer is.

109
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:23,300
Isn't that the fun of detective novels?

110
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:24,541
Look.

111
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:26,260
You read so many books of mine.

112
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,701
I bet you get it.

113
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,500
But...

114
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,500
I may not

115
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:35,141
be able to read it in a month.

116
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:47,221
Lele.

117
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,620
Think about
the protagonists in my stories.

118
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:52,581
None of them has ever given up

119
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,701
in adversity.

120
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,060
As I wrote in the book,

121
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,060
"There might be turbulences.

122
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,461
But do not give up."

123
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,101
It also works for you.

124
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,740
Have faith, okay?

125
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,940
I'd really love to invite Lele

126
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,180
as a special guest

127
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:08,581
for my book signing.

128
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,141
Really?

129
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,541
Really.

130
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,500
I promise I'll go.

131
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,581
Okay, pinky promise.

132
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,101
Deal.

133
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,620
Mom, can you take a photo for us?

134
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,500
Of course.

135
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,060
Come on.

136
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,740
Come on.

137
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,541
Come on.

138
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:25,981
Come on.

139
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,620
One, two, three, you got this.

140
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:30,101
One more.

141
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:31,420
Okay.

142
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,180
Mr. Jiang.

143
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,620
Thank you so much.

144
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,101
You encouraged Lele a lot.

145
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,781
No problem. I'm happy to meet her.

146
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:41,461
She inspired me a lot.

147
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:43,820
If you really want to thank me,

148
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,060
work harder on the house.

149
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,541
Details. You know?

150
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:49,420
Details.

151
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,781
Sorry.

152
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,260
I bet it's the editor.

153
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,141
Ignoring it again?

154
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,341
Hello.

155
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:02,541
Quiet.

156
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:04,781
I have an idea

157
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,221
for a new character.

158
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:07,420
A cardiac patient.

159
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:10,820
Alright.

160
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:13,704
I have to go.

161
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:14,760
I'll walk you out.

162
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,581
See you.

163
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:16,541
- Bye.
- Thank you.

164
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,101
Just a second.

165
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,060
I got you dinner.

166
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:36,461
I heard you stayed up all night

167
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:38,180
with Yunsheng.

168
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:41,060
Yeah, we were working on Lele's case.

169
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:43,740
I heard Su Ying

170
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:44,981
got Jiang Dong here.

171
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,620
Was Lele thrilled?

172
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,221
Everybody is praising her.

173
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,664
She's indeed a well-known designer.

174
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,781
She even got a known writer here.

175
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,221
Eat first.

176
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,781
Let me finish my work.

177
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,860
Work may be important,

178
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,528
but your health matters more.

179
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:08,936
How can you work

180
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:10,344
without eating properly?

181
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,300
Eat first.

182
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,101
Thank you, Yisen.

183
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,581
No problem.

184
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:21,060
Thirsty?

185
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,981
I'll get you an orangeade.

186
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,221
Okay, thanks.

187
00:08:26,221 --> 00:08:26,701
No problem.

188
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,136
(Cardiac surgery seminar)

189
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:53,978
(Cardiac surgery seminar)

190
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,101
(Mr. Yang.)

191
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:05,101
(I'd like to consult you
about the CHD seminar.)

192
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:13,900
(Sure, why don't we talk in person?)

193
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:17,140
Okay, thank you.

194
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,740
The seminar is held by my friend.

195
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,941
Are you interested?

196
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,020
I have a CHD patient.

197
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:31,660
She was about to get surgery

198
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:33,540
but we had to delay it

199
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,660
for some reason.

200
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,221
I want to make sure
we succeed in the surgery.

201
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:39,784
So,

202
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:41,860
if it's fine with you,

203
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,740
could you please get me

204
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:45,421
to the seminar?

205
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:47,301
Of course.

206
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,061
You're so responsible and devoted.

207
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:52,061
The patients are blessed.

208
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:53,780
I'm flattered.

209
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:55,341
I'm just doing my job.

210
00:09:58,061 --> 00:10:00,540
If I remember correctly,

211
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:03,860
your sister passed away
because of this, right?

212
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:07,981
Sorry, I crossed the line.

213
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:08,900
I mean no offense.

214
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:10,221
I'm just saying.

215
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,660
If your sister

216
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,020
were sick today,

217
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:14,860
she might survive.

218
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,152
But there's no "if".

219
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,400
Let the past

220
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:21,260
be in the past.

221
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,421
But Dr. Mi, I have a question.

222
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:30,221
Judging from your educational background

223
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:32,301
and professional skills,

224
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,660
you must have many options.

225
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:36,620
Why did you choose to come back

226
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,900
to this city

227
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,240
and

228
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:41,860
work with Dr. Qin in the same hospital?

229
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:44,740
Doesn't that make you sad?

230
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,380
Or maybe

231
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,341
you have some feelings for Dr. Qin.

232
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,140
Mr. Yang.

233
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:01,540
I don't think we're close enough

234
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,181
to talk about those things.

235
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:06,701
Sorry, I crossed the line.

236
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,701
I'll appreciate it
if you can get me into the seminar.

237
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:12,740
If there's nothing else,

238
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:14,301
I'll be leaving.

239
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,260
Actually, we have something in common.

240
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,421
I had many options back then,

241
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:27,740
but I chose to come back

242
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,701
because I had to get someone back.

243
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,341
What are you trying to say?

244
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,260
Su Ying is my ex-girlfriend.

245
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,140
We parted for some reason.

246
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:52,020
But I came back

247
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:54,140
to get her back.

248
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:57,181
And I'm sure
she's going to be with me again.

249
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,941
But she's with Yunsheng now.

250
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,620
How can you be so sure?

251
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:05,500
Because I know her.

252
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,341
In nature,

253
00:12:07,981 --> 00:12:09,061
Qin Yunsheng and Su Ying

254
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,780
are different people.

255
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,061
They'll break up sooner or later.

256
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:19,660
You're saying that

257
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,260
Su Ying and Yunsheng

258
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,301
are not meant to be.

259
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,061
Sorry.

260
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:34,140
I mentioned too many irrelevant things.

261
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,461
I'll figure something out
for the seminar.

262
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,540
But since you're asking for tickets,

263
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,581
ask for two.

264
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,900
You'll decide who to take with you.

265
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:28,168
(Cardiac surgery seminar)

266
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,740
(You'll decide who to take with you.)

267
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:36,941
Be careful. It's hot.

268
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,664
Thanks.

269
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:42,101
Thank you

270
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,140
for bringing Jiang Dong to Lele.

271
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,101
I'm glad I can help.

272
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:50,860
I know how important this surgery is.

273
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:00,581
It's so nice.

274
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:02,981
Stayed up again?

275
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,260
No.

276
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,301
Isn't it normal for designers

277
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:09,461
to stay up late?

278
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:11,981
That villa is far away.

279
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:13,620
And you're going alone...

280
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:15,140
Tian Mei keeps me company.

281
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,660
Tell you what.

282
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,664
When I worked on B&B cases,

283
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,500
I was deep in the mountains.

284
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:21,581
Don't underestimate me.

285
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,248
Lele is willing to cooperate now.

286
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,136
Her mom also told me

287
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:33,421
to thank you properly.

288
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,061
What for?

289
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:36,701
I should thank you.

290
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,080
You inspired Jiang Dong

291
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:40,221
with that idea.

292
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,112
That is to say,

293
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,660
I have the talent to be a writer.

294
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,540
I must give it a try.

295
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,701
So I'll be your first reader.

296
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:52,821
Of course.

297
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,461
Dig in.

298
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,500
You didn't sleep enough.

299
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:00,061
Go home and rest well.

300
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,780
Who says I'm going home?

301
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:06,221
Where are you going?

302
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:07,701
What do you think?

303
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:09,941
How would I know?

304
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,740
You'll find out.

305
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:16,900
Just eat.

306
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:44,540
Morning, there.

307
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:47,461
Dig in.

308
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,260
I can't believe you made breakfast.

309
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,900
I'll be late for work
if I join you for breakfast.

310
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,701
Will you make me breakfast every day?

311
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:01,221
Of course.

312
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:03,020
Do you take orders?

313
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,341
What would you like?

314
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,101
You.

315
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,020
That's easy.

316
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,160
Alright, go to work.

317
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:14,632
See you.

318
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,341
Finish the food.

319
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,941
Okay.

320
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:18,981
Bye.

321
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:19,461
Bye.

322
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:20,101
Go ahead.

323
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:20,941
Okay.

324
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:21,821
Think about me.

325
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:22,941
Okay.

326
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:26,101
That's it for the routine meeting.

327
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:26,900
Okay, Director.

328
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,701
Yunsheng, Mi Bai, stay.

329
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,421
Have we decided on a date
for Lele's surgery?

330
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:38,260
She is cooperative now.

331
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,581
But we need to reassess

332
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,941
her health condition
after everything that happened

333
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,701
and go for a low-risk plan.

334
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:46,581
Yeah.

335
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,981
She's young.

336
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,620
It's complicated.

337
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,860
We need a sound plan.

338
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:54,301
Director, I have a suggestion.

339
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,540
Look.

340
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,160
There will be

341
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,301
a cardiac surgery seminar in Jianglin

342
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,020
on the treatment
and intervention of CHD.

343
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:09,421
It's highly related to Lele's case.

344
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,461
And I heard some big names

345
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,100
would be there.

346
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,780
So I was thinking

347
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,260
maybe we could
discuss this with those experts.

348
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,500
In that case,

349
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,181
we may come up with something safer.

350
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,540
Great opportunity.

351
00:17:22,861 --> 00:17:24,621
Okay, go on a short business trip.

352
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,621
Talk to those experts.

353
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,260
Yunsheng,

354
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,661
is it okay?

355
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,221
What's the rush?

356
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:45,300
It's decided at the last minute.

357
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,861
Here.

358
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,540
Oh right.

359
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,060
Here.

360
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,020
I got these for Lele.

361
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:54,861
But you're going on a trip.

362
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:56,040
Here you are.

363
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,540
They will keep you company.

364
00:17:59,181 --> 00:17:59,780
So cute.

365
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,688
There will be a CHD expert
at the seminar,

366
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:05,340
who's highly experienced.

367
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,496
So it's a rare chance.

368
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,096
That's great.

369
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,701
You'll be back in two days?

370
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:11,780
Yeah.

371
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,060
And that will be a wonderful day.

372
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,701
What do you mean?

373
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:20,020
You'll find out.

374
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,181
So mysterious?

375
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:25,941
Let me get that.

376
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:30,421
Yunsheng.

377
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:33,576
The car is here. Let's go.

378
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,221
Okay.

379
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:37,992
See you.

380
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,144
Bai, take this.

381
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,384
Medicine is a necessity
for business trips.

382
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:47,780
Thanks, Yisen. Don't worry.

383
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:49,181
Yunsheng has my back.

384
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:50,181
Yunsheng.

385
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:51,820
Take care of Bai for me.

386
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,064
Got it.

387
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,020
I'll check in.

388
00:19:12,381 --> 00:19:13,780
Okay, I'll call Prof. Chen.

389
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,381
Alright.

390
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:15,840
Here.

391
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:23,381
Hello, Prof. Chen.

392
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:26,504
Mi Bai, just call me Uncle Chen.

393
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:27,381
You're here?

394
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:28,621
Yeah.

395
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,181
We're checking in.

396
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:31,560
Your dad has told me

397
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:33,141
about that closed-door seminar.

398
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,981
How about tomorrow afternoon?

399
00:19:36,381 --> 00:19:37,861
Uncle Chen, I know you're busy.

400
00:19:38,181 --> 00:19:38,981
No rush.

401
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:40,621
Besides, we came here

402
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,981
to talk with our peers.

403
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,221
How about Friday?

404
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,800
It's Tuesday.

405
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,580
So in three days.

406
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:52,461
Alright.

407
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,020
Thank you, Uncle Chen.

408
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:57,221
Right, my dad sent his regards.

409
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,901
That's nice of him.

410
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,128
See you on Friday.

411
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:02,221
Bye, Uncle Chen.

412
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:05,300
How was it?

413
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,020
I called Prof. Chen.

414
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:11,381
Tomorrow will do.

415
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:12,780
That's great.

416
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:14,500
I'll prepare for it tonight.

417
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,221
All set?

418
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:16,861
Yeah.

419
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:19,221
Let's see. 506.

420
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:20,661
50...

421
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:21,540
This is yours.

422
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,181
We're next door.

423
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:25,160
Let's leave our luggage.

424
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:26,060
Okay.

425
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,100
Here, this is the latest plan.

426
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,104
Take a look.

427
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:38,901
(I've checked in.)

428
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,621
(No iced coffee.)

429
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:41,661
(I had lunch.)

430
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,181
(Good girl.)

431
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,221
(Rest well today.)

432
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,141
(I'm having a meeting.)

433
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,580
Ying.

434
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,981
How do you like this plan?

435
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:58,981
Let me see.

436
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,456
Anything else on the villa renovation

437
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:05,260
for Jiang Dong?

438
00:21:06,621 --> 00:21:07,861
Tian Mei has a great plan.

439
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:08,780
I have nothing to add.

440
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,300
Me neither.

441
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:12,100
Me neither.

442
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,344
It's good.

443
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:15,621
Tian Mei.

444
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,340
You'll be in charge.

445
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:22,141
Thank you.

446
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,981
Okay, let's proceed.

447
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,861
(Miss Tian, do you have a minute?)

448
00:21:41,928 --> 00:21:42,600
(Yeah.)

449
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,416
Hello, Mr. Yang. How can I help you?

450
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:55,560
SU Design Firm won the prize

451
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,141
and became a hit.

452
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,500
Yeah, we've got many cases these days.

453
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,701
We just happened to have a new batch

454
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:07,592
of construction materials,

455
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,088
which is unique in the market.

456
00:22:10,941 --> 00:22:13,740
Your design firm seeks
independence and innovation.

457
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,540
I believe our material
will be useful to you.

458
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:19,300
New construction material?

459
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,704
Thank you so much, Mr. Yang.

460
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,656
I do get a say in what kind of material

461
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:24,680
we use in a project.

462
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,952
Let's work together.

463
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:30,056
We could use more opportunities.

464
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:31,260
I have many cases available.

465
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,221
I'll send you the ones suitable for you.

466
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,300
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

467
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,352
Ying.

468
00:22:45,661 --> 00:22:47,432
Yunsheng got you a takeout.

469
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,340
And he told me to supervise you.

470
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,421
Eat on time and drink less coffee

471
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:52,360
for your stomach.

472
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,740
Don't keep staring

473
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,060
at your phone and the PC.

474
00:22:56,901 --> 00:22:57,901
I see.

475
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:00,181
It's a mission for me.

476
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,340
You have to behave.

477
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,861
Or he's going to scold me.

478
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,181
Okay, okay.

479
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,780
Who do you work for? Me or him?

480
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,144
You, of course.

481
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:19,461
Well, I have work to do.

482
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:21,621
Go ahead.

483
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,696
Did I catch you on a lunch break?

484
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,461
Dr. Qin got it for me.

485
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:35,221
He's not here, but he's making sure

486
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:37,500
that I'm eating on time.

487
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:40,264
Dr. Qin is quite considerate.

488
00:23:40,861 --> 00:23:42,312
Have you eaten? Let's share it.

489
00:23:42,312 --> 00:23:43,300
I have. Go ahead.

490
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,712
I'm here

491
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:46,661
for some serious business.

492
00:23:46,981 --> 00:23:47,941
I filmed

493
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,280
a promotional video for a bar.

494
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,181
It went really well,

495
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,480
especially statistically.

496
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,701
So I'm thinking

497
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:55,816
that maybe

498
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:57,820
I can focus on self-media.

499
00:23:58,181 --> 00:24:00,461
I've been a director for years.

500
00:24:00,461 --> 00:24:01,981
I'm a great editor.

501
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,616
And I've gained experience

502
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:06,260
in House Design for six years.

503
00:24:06,901 --> 00:24:09,461
I think I can totally make it work.

504
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,661
But

505
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,820
time waits for no one.

506
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,701
It's been six months since I left.

507
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:18,820
Yeah, it's been six months.

508
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,861
I was working on
that sea-view apartment for Wang Zili.

509
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:31,016
(180 days with Dr. Qin)

510
00:24:33,421 --> 00:24:33,901
What's wrong?

511
00:24:34,421 --> 00:24:35,580
That's why he said

512
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:38,540
we'd go out
once he came back from the trip.

513
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:40,872
So what? You go out all the time.

514
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,461
It's our 180th day together tomorrow.

515
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,941
You've been dating for six months?

516
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,840
You lasted six months?

517
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:55,141
Dr. Qin is quite something.

518
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,221
But

519
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,861
your time together is occupied

520
00:25:01,861 --> 00:25:03,661
by work.

521
00:25:04,141 --> 00:25:05,060
And he has

522
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,300
Mi Bai around him.

523
00:25:09,096 --> 00:25:11,080
(180 days with Dr. Qin)

524
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,808
(Arterial Duct Induction Treatment)
As we all know,

525
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:14,381
once CHD develops

526
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,381
into congestive heart failure,

527
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,060
the patients survive for less than

528
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,780
five years on average,

529
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,221
especially the kids.

530
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,300
Okay.

531
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,480
That's it for today.

532
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,440
Thank you.

533
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:40,424
(Thank you)

534
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,540
Great seminar.

535
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:45,300
Yunsheng.

536
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,496
You wrote down so many notes.

537
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,020
How did you like the seminar?

538
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,981
Very professional, very useful.

539
00:25:52,141 --> 00:25:54,340
But why didn't Prof. Chen come?

540
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,421
Prof. Chen says

541
00:25:58,421 --> 00:25:59,784
he's been busy

542
00:25:59,861 --> 00:26:02,344
so the closed-door seminar
may be delayed

543
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:03,912
for a few days.

544
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,421
So we can't go back yet.

545
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:11,621
Why? Do you have any plans?

546
00:26:15,461 --> 00:26:16,060
Nothing.

547
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,016
We came to see Prof. Chen.

548
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:19,901
Yeah.

549
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:23,060
Oh right, there's a buffet tonight.

550
00:26:23,461 --> 00:26:24,181
Shall we go?

551
00:26:25,381 --> 00:26:27,272
There will be many seniors.

552
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:29,461
It's a chance to talk to them.

553
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:31,540
Maybe Prof. Chen will be there.

554
00:26:34,381 --> 00:26:34,820
Okay.

555
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,181
We're here to talk to other doctors.

556
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,421
Yunsheng.

557
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,820
Here you are.

558
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,820
Thanks.

559
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:11,461
Who are you looking for?

560
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,861
Isn't Prof. Chen here?

561
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:19,141
I don't think so.

562
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,861
I think he's too busy.

563
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,500
Alright.

564
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:25,032
Mi Bai.

565
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,540
It's you for real!

566
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,181
Remember me?

567
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,500
We were schoolmates.

568
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,861
Of course, you majored in Neurosurgery.

569
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:33,461
Yeah, it's been so long.

570
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:34,461
You're still gorgeous.

571
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:34,981
Thanks.

572
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:37,060
Oh right, let me introduce you.

573
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:38,621
This is my senior.

574
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:40,901
Qin Yunsheng.

575
00:27:41,621 --> 00:27:42,100
Hello.

576
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:44,968
Hello.

577
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:47,661
You're the one
who won the Golden Knife Award.

578
00:27:47,661 --> 00:27:48,661
Nice to meet you.

579
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:49,820
So we're schoolmates.

580
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:50,820
Yeah.

581
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,701
You're our senior

582
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:53,576
and the pride of the school.

583
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:54,941
Come on, let me toast you.

584
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,340
He doesn't drink.

585
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:00,100
Let me drink for him.

586
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,500
Cheers.

587
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:02,141
Okay.

588
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,540
Okay, I'll be over there.

589
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,580
Talk later.

590
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:09,581
See you.

591
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,260
Miss Mi Bai.

592
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:16,020
You're back?

593
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,181
I just got back.

594
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:20,300
Your father took care of me

595
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:21,580
when I was studying abroad.

596
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:22,020
Really?

597
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:24,680
Let me toast you to show my gratitude.

598
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,581
Okay.

599
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,301
Cheers.

600
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:33,160
Mi Bai.

601
00:28:34,941 --> 00:28:35,500
Can.

602
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:36,780
Why are you here?

603
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,500
My hospital sent me.

604
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,260
Let me toast you.

605
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:40,901
Okay.

606
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,861
You're even prettier.

607
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,580
Thanks.

608
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:43,181
Let's drink.

609
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:45,141
Slow down.

610
00:28:46,621 --> 00:28:47,181
I'm fine.

611
00:28:51,861 --> 00:28:52,381
Waiter.

612
00:28:53,381 --> 00:28:54,540
You drank too much, Mi Bai.

613
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:57,020
I'm fine, Yunsheng.

614
00:28:58,181 --> 00:28:58,941
Let's go.

615
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:01,221
I can drink more.

616
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,540
Careful.

617
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,260
Okay.

618
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:06,981
Let's go.

619
00:29:08,421 --> 00:29:09,381
Almost there.

620
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,221
Come on.

621
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:12,104
Lean against the wall.

622
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,020
Where's your key card?

623
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:16,580
Key card?

624
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:22,540
I can't find it.

625
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,136
Look again.

626
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,381
How about this?

627
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,621
Sit in my room.

628
00:29:29,661 --> 00:29:30,696
I'll get a hotel staff.

629
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,181
Slow down.

630
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,661
Here. Wait.

631
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,141
Wait.

632
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:52,621
Yunsheng, I feel awful.

633
00:29:52,941 --> 00:29:54,221
Water.

634
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,621
Okay.

635
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:04,520
Here is the towel.

636
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,088
Here's the water.

637
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:12,181
I'll leave it here.

638
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:25,640
Yunsheng.

639
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,336
Hello.

640
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,861
Get me another room.

641
00:30:31,701 --> 00:30:32,141
Okay.

642
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:39,060
My head hurts.

643
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,300
Hello.

644
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:01,672
Done with work?

645
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,176
Yeah.

646
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,544
Why are you in the corridor?

647
00:31:05,941 --> 00:31:07,540
I asked for a new room.

648
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,648
I'm waiting for the key card.

649
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,461
Why?

650
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,981
Mi Bai

651
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:13,192
got drunk during the dinner.

652
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:14,780
And she lost

653
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:15,740
her key card.

654
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:18,536
So I put her to rest in my room.

655
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:20,104
And she fell asleep.

656
00:31:21,461 --> 00:31:22,861
So you got another room?

657
00:31:23,421 --> 00:31:25,340
Yeah, it's better like that.

658
00:31:27,181 --> 00:31:29,141
Sir, here's your new key card.

659
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:29,800
Thank you.

660
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:33,540
See, my new key card.

661
00:31:34,221 --> 00:31:36,008
What about the toilette?

662
00:31:36,981 --> 00:31:37,672
Yeah.

663
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,421
I need my charger.

664
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:41,256
Go get it.

665
00:31:41,661 --> 00:31:42,141
Okay.

666
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:48,661
Let's be quiet.

667
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:55,592
My things are...

668
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,580
Yunsheng.

669
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:16,780
Listen.

670
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,421
Mi Bai explained to me.

671
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,580
She felt sick after I left

672
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,960
and threw up in the toilet.

673
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:23,560
Then she showered.

674
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,661
After all that,

675
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:26,780
she sort of woke up.

676
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,260
That's it.

677
00:32:28,701 --> 00:32:29,421
Got it.

678
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,740
Mi Bai texted me to explain.

679
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,664
You've explained it to me, too.

680
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,461
I trust you.

681
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,024
Sorry.

682
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,141
What for?

683
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,340
I trust you.

684
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:45,320
There's something else

685
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,984
I have to tell you.

686
00:32:47,381 --> 00:32:49,192
I didn't see Prof. Chen today.

687
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,381
Mi Bai says he may come tomorrow.

688
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:54,540
So I won't make it back tomorrow.

689
00:32:55,901 --> 00:32:57,861
It's okay. Work comes first.

690
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,421
But do you know what day it is?

691
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,580
Of course.

692
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:06,820
It's our 180th day together.

693
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,448
Yeah.

694
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,432
Time flies.

695
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,352
It's okay.

696
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:16,296
We'll have plenty of anniversaries.

697
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:18,060
Let's go for a hot pot once you're back.

698
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:19,500
I thought about it.

699
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,621
How about this?

700
00:33:22,381 --> 00:33:24,540
Let's find the same restaurant

701
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:27,020
and order dishes over video chat.

702
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,360
Then

703
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,260
it's like online dating.

704
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:32,060
Online dating?

705
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,580
How's that?

706
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:36,461
Okay.

707
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:38,941
See you tomorrow.

708
00:33:38,941 --> 00:33:39,421
Bye.

709
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,060
Coming.

710
00:33:59,461 --> 00:34:00,360
Yunsheng.

711
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,104
Sorry, I caused you trouble last night.

712
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,540
It's okay.

713
00:34:06,621 --> 00:34:08,020
Don't drink so much again.

714
00:34:09,461 --> 00:34:11,100
I didn't know I'd be drunk.

715
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,700
It won't happen again.

716
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:16,981
Is Prof. Chen available today?

717
00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:20,941
He hasn't answered. Maybe tomorrow.

718
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:23,261
Okay.

719
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:25,100
You are going out?

720
00:34:26,461 --> 00:34:28,540
Yeah, I'd like to visit the mall nearby.

721
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,280
Let's go together.

722
00:34:30,461 --> 00:34:33,261
I can't visit Prof. Chen without a gift.

723
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:34,620
Let me get something.

724
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,580
After all, he came
all the way to meet us.

725
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,500
Listen.

726
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,336
I'm not good at choosing gifts.

727
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,968
And I have plans later.

728
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,620
It will only take half an hour.

729
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,500
You can offer advice

730
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,461
on what to get for Prof. Chen.

731
00:34:54,421 --> 00:34:55,080
Fine.

732
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,020
Yunsheng.

733
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,008
Let's get something here.

734
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:07,688
Hello.

735
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,384
Would you like to see the ties?

736
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,301
These are our best-selling ones.

737
00:35:14,301 --> 00:35:16,100
It's perfect for your boyfriend.

738
00:35:18,821 --> 00:35:19,816
Sorry.

739
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:21,500
I'm not her boyfriend.

740
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:25,861
We're still only colleagues.

741
00:35:26,536 --> 00:35:27,580
Sorry.

742
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:27,981
It's okay.

743
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,384
Take your time.

744
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,448
Yunsheng.

745
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,341
I'd like to buy you this tie.

746
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,500
It's to thank you

747
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,920
for taking care of me at the hospital.

748
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:40,616
Do you like it?

749
00:35:40,941 --> 00:35:43,016
No need. I don't wear ties.

750
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,904
Pick something for the professor.

751
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,421
Hello.

752
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,520
Hello, I'll be there soon.

753
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,100
Don't be late.

754
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,381
Of course not.

755
00:35:59,381 --> 00:36:00,261
I'll be there soon.

756
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:01,301
See you later.

757
00:36:05,741 --> 00:36:06,261
Mi Bai.

758
00:36:06,821 --> 00:36:08,140
I have things to do. See you.

759
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,140
Please pick a gift for Prof. Chen.

760
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:18,060
Excuse me.

761
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,456
Pack this tie for me.

762
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,220
Okay.

763
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:23,341
Hurry up.

764
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:23,781
Okay.

765
00:36:26,381 --> 00:36:27,381
Hello, Madam.

766
00:36:27,381 --> 00:36:28,821
You ordered a set for two.

00:36:28,821 --> 00:36:31,301
You may not be able to finish it.

768
00:36:32,261 --> 00:36:34,060
It's okay, I can pack

769
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,861
whatever there is left.

770
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,096
Okay, please enjoy.

771
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,620

Let's get started.

781
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:11,620
Okay.

782
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:13,140
Wait.

783
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,421
I...

784
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,928
I'll start with bean sprouts.

785
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:23,421

Cheers.

789
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:46,660
Yunsheng.

790
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,301
You said you had plans.

791
00:37:52,301 --> 00:37:54,020
So your plan is to have a hot pot alone?

792
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:57,096
Let me keep you company.

793
00:37:57,421 --> 00:37:58,100
Waiter.

794
00:37:58,341 --> 00:37:59,620
One more set of cutlery

795
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:00,700
and another paste.

796
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,500
They say the most advanced form

797
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,408
of loneliness is having a hot pot alone.

798
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,424
But now, we're not alone.

799
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,580
Or you'd be eating alone,

800
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,620
and I'd be eating alone.

801
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:14,301
In fact...

802
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:17,620
In fact, I'm not here alone.

803
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,660
I'm dating Su Ying.

804
00:38:26,741 --> 00:38:27,688
Hello, Ying.

805
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,301
Hello.

806
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,136
Am I bothering you?

807
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,301
It's my anniversary

808
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,728
with Su Ying.

809
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,944
So

810
00:38:40,941 --> 00:38:41,864
how about this?

811
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:43,660
I'll treat you to dinner another time.

812
00:38:48,381 --> 00:38:49,160
Sure.

813
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,624
I'll get another table.

814
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,700
Let me help.

815
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,500
I don't need them anymore.

816
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,220
Mi Bai.

817
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:09,256
Save the trouble. Remain seated.

818
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,421
Go ahead.

819
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:12,901
Dr. Qin.

820
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:14,344
I have things to do, too.

821
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,301
Let's go out once you're back.

822
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,060
How about this?

823
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,461
Let's watch a movie tonight.

824
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,381
How?

825
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,220
Wait.

826
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:38,341
There's one at eight p.m. here.

827
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,360
There is

828
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,660
one at 20:05 there.

829
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,781
Will you be off work?

830
00:39:47,421 --> 00:39:50,088
So let's watch the movie together.

831
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,060
I'll get the tickets.

832
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,741
Go ahead and enjoy.

833
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,060
Have more.

834
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,981
I see. You too.

835
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:02,461
See you.

836
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,580
Sorry, Yunsheng.

837
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,500
I-I thought you were eating alone.

838
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:26,500
It's okay. Dig in.

839
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,200
Then we'll head back.

840
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,620
Who are you?

841
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:38,861
Who are you?

842
00:40:39,261 --> 00:40:40,301
That's my question.

843
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:41,381
I own this apartment.

844
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:42,981
But

845
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:44,552
I've rented it.

846
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:45,864
You're the owner?

847
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,861
Here's the certificate.

848
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:48,680
Take a look.

849
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:52,901
There's a stamp on it.

850
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:53,941
It's authentic.

851
00:40:53,941 --> 00:40:57,261
But the real estate agency
has rented it to me.

852
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,301
I'm here to get the house back

853
00:40:59,301 --> 00:41:00,861
because they haven't paid me
for two months.

854
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:03,261
Pay up if you want to stay.

855
00:41:04,821 --> 00:41:05,100
Wait.

856
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,461
I've paid my rent.

857
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:07,976
Why would I pay again?

858
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,020
But I'm the landlord

859
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,461
and I haven't received it.

860
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,821
Take your things away

861
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,821
or pay up.

862
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,100
Wait.

863
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,341
Listen to me...

864
00:41:15,341 --> 00:41:16,421
It's pricy!

865
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,421
Cut the crap. Go away.

866
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:27,660
Mingshi?

867
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,341
Are you okay, Huixuan?

868
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:33,781
I got this.

869
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:35,540
Sir.

870
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:36,941
Who are you?

871
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:38,781
Sir.

872
00:41:38,981 --> 00:41:39,821
What do you want?

873
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,928
Sir, relax.

874
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,941
These appliances are pricy.

875
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,060
Each costs

876
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:46,341
more than a year's rent.

877
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,580
Who are you?

878
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:50,861
Let's talk things through.

879
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,220
It won't be nice

880
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,381
if we get into a conflict
and make a scene here.

881
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:56,261
The real estate agency cheated you.

882
00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:58,632
I'm also cheated as the landlord.

883
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,341
But I can't bear all the loss, right?

884
00:42:01,741 --> 00:42:03,261
I totally get it.

885
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:06,020
This place is for rent anyway.

886
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,261
Just rent it to us.

887
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,544
We will keep our things here.

888
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,060
Once we get our money back,

889
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:12,500
let's sign a new contract.

890
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:13,301
How's that?

891
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,381
A new contract?

892
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:17,020
Yeah, something legit.

893
00:42:17,741 --> 00:42:18,381
Alright, buddy.

894
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:20,140
Thank you, sir.

895
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,941
The number you have dialed
is powered off.

896
00:42:22,421 --> 00:42:23,540
What should we do?

897
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,180
I can't reach the real estate agency.

898
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:26,540
How do I get my money back?

899
00:42:26,861 --> 00:42:28,381
Relax. It's okay.

900
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,461
We have the transfer record.

901
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,861
You paid them.

902
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,461
And your accounts are verified.

903
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:35,180
The police can easily track them

904
00:42:35,341 --> 00:42:36,861
with all that information.

905
00:42:37,941 --> 00:42:38,821
I guess that's it.

906
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:40,020
Don't worry.

907
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,381
Why did you come?

908
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,741
Ying said you were here.

909
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,660
She said you were starting a business.

910
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:50,421
So I gathered some information and ideas

911
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
for your reference.

912
00:42:54,341 --> 00:42:55,381
It may be immature.

913
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,700
