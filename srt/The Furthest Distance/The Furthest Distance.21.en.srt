the whole afternoon.

19
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:48,124
You're welcome.

20
00:01:48,404 --> 00:01:49,284
Just give me a call

21
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:50,525
next time.

22
00:01:50,805 --> 00:01:51,445
Mingshi.

23
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:53,564
Weiwei, I haven't seen you

24
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:54,284
for so long!

25
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:55,885
What a coincidence!

26
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:58,844
Huixuan, she is our client.

27
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:00,525
I've done projects for her.

28
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:02,325
Hello.

29
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:03,085
Hello.

30
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,204
What are you busy with?

31
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:05,165
Why are you here?

32
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:07,124
I was checking some apartments

33
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:08,364
and just ran into you.

34
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:09,405
Small world.

35
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:12,552
I heard you were looking for chances
regarding promotional videos.

36
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:13,605
I'm planning

37
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:15,445
to sell the villa you designed for me.

38
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:16,885
Advertise it for me.

39
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,684
What a coincidence.

40
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:19,565
This is Miss Du.

41
00:02:19,644 --> 00:02:20,964
She's an expert in this.

42
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:21,964
She can help you.

43
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:23,005
You should talk over WeChat.

44
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:25,605
Mingming's endorsement works for me.

45
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:27,764
You should set up a group chat for us.

46
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:28,445
No problem.

47
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:29,565
Alright.

48
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:31,165
You can tell me what you need

49
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:32,405
in the group chat.

50
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:32,964
Okay.

51
00:02:33,964 --> 00:02:35,364
Are you going somewhere?

52
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,364
I'm heading back to the firm for work.

53
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:38,445
Want a ride?

54
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:40,125
We can talk about the design

55
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,364
of the new house.

56
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:42,964
Okay, thank you.

57
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:44,964
See you, Huixuan.

58
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:46,045
Okay.

59
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:46,524
See you.

60
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:47,285
- Bye.
- See you.

61
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:48,045
Bye.

62
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:50,165
- What a coincidence.
- Why are you selling it?

63
00:02:50,364 --> 00:02:52,285
I just sell it to get new ones.

64
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:53,725
I thought you didn't like my design.

65
00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:55,244
No, I'm coming back for you.

66
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:56,405
Mingming?

67
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:10,484
Hello.

68
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:12,644
I'm almost done here.

69
00:03:12,804 --> 00:03:13,964
I'll head over soon.

70
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:15,045
The mall is close by.

71
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:17,165
See you in an hour.

72
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:19,445
Be careful.

73
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:21,605
Got it. Bye.

74
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,096
(Low Battery)

75
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,005
Low battery.

76
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:43,764
Yunsheng, look who's here.

77
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:47,005
Prof. Chen.

78
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:48,244
Yunsheng.

79
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:50,845
Mi Bai asked me

80
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,725
for advice

81
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,204
about Lele's case.

82
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:55,764
I'm available now.

83
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,364
Let's talk on the way.

84
00:03:57,644 --> 00:03:59,084
Alright, let's go.

85
00:03:59,244 --> 00:03:59,684
Okay.

86
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:00,364
Go.

87
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:01,804
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

88
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:05,524
We intend to

89
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:07,325
adopt a new method for surgery.

90
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:08,684
Prof. Chen,

91
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:11,165
you're the most experienced
in this field in China.

92
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:13,005
So we'd like to consult you

93
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:14,804
regarding the clinical practice.

94
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:15,644
I won't be

95
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:17,525
modest about that.

96
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:18,884
But

97
00:04:19,924 --> 00:04:21,085
it takes some time

98
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:22,285
to make things clear.

99
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,765
Thanks for the efforts.

100
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:25,444
Mr. Chen.

101
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:26,684
Since you have time,

102
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:28,444
why don't we do

103
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:29,845
the closed-door seminar now?

104
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:30,924
Is it fine?

105
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:32,085
It's fine by me.

106
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:33,405
That's great.

107
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:36,525
Yunsheng.

108
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:38,884
I remember you have a date with Su Ying

109
00:04:38,884 --> 00:04:40,045
tonight, right?

110
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:44,605
Yeah, I almost forgot.

111
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:48,205
My phone.

112
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:50,124
Yunsheng, what's wrong?

113
00:04:51,765 --> 00:04:52,364
Nothing.

114
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:54,804
Mi Bai, I left my phone in the room.

115
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,085
Could you please
text Su Ying and tell her

116
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:58,324
not to wait for me

117
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,324
because I'm meeting with Prof. Chen

118
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:01,564
and that I'm sorry?

119
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:02,725
Okay.

120
00:05:03,965 --> 00:05:04,645
I'm ready.

121
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:08,124
Lele suffers from

122
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:11,525
a downward displacement
of the tricuspid.

123
00:05:12,124 --> 00:05:14,045
It's a great idea to adopt

124
00:05:14,484 --> 00:05:15,244
the CONE method.

125
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:23,004
Look.

126
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:24,725
I'll share with you

127
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:27,085
some experience on CONE.

128
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:28,965
Feel free to ask me

129
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:29,845
anything.

130
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:30,924
Okay.

131
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:33,124
Judging from the recent studies...

00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:39,004

153

You've enlightened us so much.

154
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:30,484
I'm glad I could be of any help

155
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,045

Go ahead and talk.

163
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:43,924
I'll go to the bathroom.

164

Prof. Chen.

165
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:49,364
Thank you so much

166
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:51,205
for sharing, and offering advice.

167
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:52,364
We really appreciate it.

168
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:53,845
And

169
00:07:54,205 --> 00:07:55,924
can I ask for your contact information?

170
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:57,285
I may consult you

171
00:07:57,765 --> 00:07:59,004
on other issues.

172
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:00,845
Of course, no problem.

173
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:01,725
Here.

174
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:03,324
Thank you.

175
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:07,804
Mi Bai's father called me,

176
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:10,405
so I must set up this meeting.

177
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:12,725
It was meant for Wednesday,

178
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:15,484
but Mi Bai said

179
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:17,045
that you were busy.

180
00:08:17,324 --> 00:08:18,564
So I delayed it.

181
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:21,845
Mi Bai asked you to delay it?

182
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:22,684
Yeah.

183
00:08:23,444 --> 00:08:24,364
Weren't you busy

184
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,045
with some academic seminars?

185
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,165
But why isn't Prof. Chen here?

186
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:35,324
He said he's been busy,

187
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:38,312
so the closed-door seminar
may be delayed.

188
00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:41,844
Yeah.

189
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:43,084
Right.

190
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:19,432
(Qin Yunsheng)

191
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:49,285
Sorry.

192
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:50,885
I went to meet Prof. Chen

193
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,084
and left my phone to charge in the room.

194
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,645
I waited until the end of the movie.

195
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:57,684
I kept calling you,
but you didn't pick up.

196
00:09:58,684 --> 00:09:59,804
Didn't Mi Bai text you?

197
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:00,924
No.

198
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:02,405
She didn't.

199
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:09,405
So you had
a private meeting with Prof. Chen

200
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:11,525
and told Mi Bai to inform me.

201
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:14,525
Yeah, Prof. Chen can testify to that.

202
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:17,885
I wasn't suspecting you.

203
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:19,405
I couldn't find you.

204
00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:20,444
So I was worried.

205
00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:21,564
I know.

206
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:22,885
Anyway,

207
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:25,045
it's all my fault.

208
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:26,045
I promise

209
00:10:26,365 --> 00:10:28,165
I won't be out of contact again.

210
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:30,125
Liar.

211
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:31,525
I swear.

212
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:33,485
Punish me however you want

213
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:35,444
if I don't keep my word.

214
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:37,924
Once I'm back,

215
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,045
let me make it up to you

216
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:41,285
with a proper date.

217
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:44,245
Let me see how well you do.

218
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,885
I swear I'll make you happy.

219
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:47,005
Oh, right.

220
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:49,365
Is the meeting with Prof. Chen

221
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:50,684
helpful to Lele's surgery?

222
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,005
It is very helpful.

223
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:54,204
We have improved the surgery plan.

224
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:56,964
I think it will work.

225
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:58,485
That's great.

226
00:10:58,844 --> 00:10:59,885
Well.

227
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:01,365
Go to bed.

228
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:02,405
Got it.

229
00:11:03,444 --> 00:11:04,444
Make it up to me.

230
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:05,084
See you.

231
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:36,405
Yunsheng.

232
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:37,924
What's the matter?

233
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:39,645
Come on in.

234
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:41,204
No need.

235
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:43,165
I just need a few words.

236
00:11:47,885 --> 00:11:49,165
Prof. Chen told me

237
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:51,564
that he could have met us
on Wednesday,

238
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:53,365
but you delayed it.

239
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:55,724
Really?

240
00:11:59,324 --> 00:12:02,005
Maybe there was some misunderstanding.

241
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,564
Also, you didn't tell Su Ying

242
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,724
about our meeting with Prof. Chen.

243
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:10,125
She was waiting the whole time.

244
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:14,405
I was drawn to the conversation

245
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:16,765
and forgot about it.

246
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:22,245
Is she mad?

247
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:27,645
Should I explain to her?

248
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:29,245
No need.

249
00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:30,964
She's not mad.

250
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:34,285
We cherish each other

251
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:37,285
and wouldn't fight
for trivial issues like that.

252
00:12:42,964 --> 00:12:43,525
Mi Bai.

253
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:45,844
After this business trip,

254
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:47,885
there are things

255
00:12:49,324 --> 00:12:51,724
I want to tell you.

256
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:55,165
I don't know if it's a coincidence

257
00:12:55,684 --> 00:12:57,204
or something else,

258
00:12:58,405 --> 00:12:59,324
what you did recently

259
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:01,604
has been making me slightly

260
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:03,804
uncomfortable.

261
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:07,084
You seem to mind

262
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:10,564
my relationship with Su Ying.

263
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:13,485
Of course.

264
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:15,645
I hope it's just a misunderstanding.

265
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:17,005
Or,

266
00:13:17,684 --> 00:13:18,444
you can tell me

267
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,125
how you feel right now.

268
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:23,324
Nothing.

269
00:13:24,924 --> 00:13:26,324
You got me wrong, Yunsheng.

270
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:28,964
That's for the best.

271
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:31,365
If I get

272
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,285
that feeling,

273
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:35,485
I'm sure Su Ying gets it too.

274
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:37,525
She's my girlfriend.

275
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:39,765
I have to protect her feelings.

276
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:47,924
If I have

277
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:50,844
done something reckless

278
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:53,045
these days,

279
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:55,005
or somehow

280
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:58,125
made you and Su Ying misunderstand,

281
00:13:58,765 --> 00:13:59,804
I won't do it again.

282
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:03,005
Well.

283
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:05,084
I'm heading back to Qingyu now.

284
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:06,444
Now?

285
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:09,285
But it's late.

286
00:14:09,924 --> 00:14:11,365
I got the ticket for the last flight.

287
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:14,204
What's the rush?

288
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:18,564
Can't you come with me tomorrow?

289
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:19,924
No need.

290
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,604
See you at the hospital.

291
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:24,084
Bye. Take care.

292
00:14:59,084 --> 00:15:00,684
I'm going to work now.

293
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:02,204
What's your plan for today?

294
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:04,204
Are you done in Jiangling?

295
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:23,444
Come on.

296
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:25,804
You promised to stay in contact.

297
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:38,005
You're back?

298
00:15:42,204 --> 00:15:43,204
I promised

299
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,604
to stay in contact.

300
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:46,844
You're so sweet.

301
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:49,885
Are you going to work today?

302
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:52,964
Any plans after work?

303
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:54,645
Shall we go out for a date?

304
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:56,525
I have

305
00:15:57,245 --> 00:15:59,125
something important to do after work.

306
00:15:59,444 --> 00:16:00,045
What is it?

307
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:01,045
I'll move out

308
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:02,765
of the dorm.

309
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:03,765
What?

310
00:16:17,924 --> 00:16:19,604
Are you really
moving to the glass house?

311
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:25,525
Yunsheng.

312
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:28,365
What are you doing?

313
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:33,245
I'm moving out.

314
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:35,285
Moving out?

315
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:36,964
Yeah, move to the glass house.

316
00:16:37,285 --> 00:16:38,125
Why?

317
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:40,645
It's too noisy here.

318
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,005
I want to stay focused

319
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:43,285
for the surgery.

320
00:16:43,765 --> 00:16:45,365
But you can't live in the glass house.

321
00:16:46,365 --> 00:16:47,564
Should I look for

322
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:48,765
some places for you?

323
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:49,964
It's okay.

324
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:53,525
He'll live at my place.

325
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:05,685
Yeah.

326
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:10,364
Go ahead.

327
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:12,164
I'll leave you to it.

328
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:32,164
What about the glass house?

329
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:36,205
Go ahead if you
really want to live there.

330
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:37,485
But you've invited me.

331
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:39,005
It's not nice to turn you down.

332
00:17:39,604 --> 00:17:41,965
It's okay. Don't be polite.

333
00:17:42,285 --> 00:17:43,084
I'm not.

334
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:44,124
Let's pack up

335
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:45,485
and head to your place.

336
00:18:03,485 --> 00:18:05,765
Here, have a try.

337
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:09,045
I thought I'd make breakfast.

338
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:10,564
Does it really matter?

339
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,164
Good point.

340
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:14,884
Come on, try it.

341
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:16,324
Let me try.

342
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:21,965
How is it?

343
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,045
It's perfect.

344
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:26,884
I'll cook every day.

345
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:29,644
Dig in.

346
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:30,804
Okay.

347
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:32,445
Any surgeries today?

348
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:33,285
No.

349
00:18:33,604 --> 00:18:34,604
Lele's surgery is tomorrow.

350
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:36,564
I'll study it at the hospital.

351
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:41,844
Eat up and go to work.

352
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:52,205
Alright.

353
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:54,285
I'm leaving now.

354
00:18:56,765 --> 00:18:57,364
Wait.

355
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:00,804
What's wrong?

356
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:06,084
What is this?

357
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:11,725
I'll keep you company like that.

358
00:19:13,364 --> 00:19:13,925
Thank you.

359
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:16,644
- See you.
- Okay, go. Be careful.

360
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:21,965
She can be discharged within three days.

361
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:22,685
Okay.

362
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:23,445
Ms. Han.

363
00:19:24,884 --> 00:19:25,525
Okay.

364
00:19:27,564 --> 00:19:28,245
Yunsheng.

365
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:30,285
Nice buttons.

366
00:19:30,725 --> 00:19:32,564
Yeah, they're so pretty.

367
00:19:33,364 --> 00:19:34,164
They're from Su Ying?

368
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:34,884
Yeah.

369
00:19:36,324 --> 00:19:38,445
Yisen said that
you moved in with Su Ying.

370
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:39,364
How is it?

371
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:41,324
Dr. Qin, you moved out of the dorm?

372
00:19:41,685 --> 00:19:42,965
You haven't heard?

373
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:44,285
Reapply medicine for Bed No. 5.

374
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:45,205
Yunsheng.

375
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,884
Director Ruan told us to meet him.

376
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:50,965
Let's go.

377
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:51,644
Alright.

378
00:19:52,364 --> 00:19:53,164
Let's go together.

379
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:55,124
Is it

380
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:56,725
about Lele's surgery?

381
00:19:58,445 --> 00:19:59,525
I've spoken to him.

382
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:02,485
Alright then.

383
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:04,285
Let's go. Next ward.

384
00:20:12,364 --> 00:20:14,485
Pay attention to this section.

385
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:15,124
Okay.

386
00:20:15,124 --> 00:20:15,564
Keep it up.

387
00:20:15,685 --> 00:20:16,084
Okay.

388
00:20:17,765 --> 00:20:18,364
Director.

389
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:19,445
Mi Bai, come in.

390
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:21,205
Sit down.

391
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:26,324
The business trip has worked well.

392
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:29,324
The surgery plan is perfect.

393
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:31,005
Otherwise, things wouldn't

394
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:32,445
have been so smooth for Lele.

395
00:20:32,804 --> 00:20:34,965
Yunsheng did a thorough preparation

396
00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:37,884
and asked all the important questions.

397
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:38,804
Yeah.

398
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,765
Yunsheng has been devoted,
responsible, and careful.

399
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:43,205
I totally trust him.

400
00:20:44,124 --> 00:20:44,765
Director.

401
00:20:44,884 --> 00:20:48,364
I put up some information
and summaries for the seminar.

402
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:51,445
I heard that Yunsheng

403
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:52,925
had spoken to you.

404
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,124
I wanted to talk to you both,

405
00:20:56,285 --> 00:20:57,205
but he was in a rush

406
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:58,604
and came in the morning.

407
00:20:59,005 --> 00:20:59,604
Look.

408
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:01,404
He gave me this.

409
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:10,045
Yunsheng is highly concerned
about Lele's case.

410
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:11,525
Not just Lele.

411
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,604
He really hopes that

412
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:16,164
more and more kids like Lele

413
00:21:16,404 --> 00:21:18,164
can receive better treatment.

414
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:21,164
Right, I heard that

415
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:23,765
he once launched a charity event

416
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:25,925
called Kind Action for Children.

417
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,084
Not only that,

418
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:29,164
he also suggested

419
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:30,965
that the board of directors

420
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:33,364
promote the project

421
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,285
of rural public welfare hospital.

422
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:36,364
Of course,

423
00:21:36,564 --> 00:21:38,445
the project was suspended
for many reasons.

424
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:40,685
If we manage to run this program,

425
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:42,485
it will greatly improve

426
00:21:42,725 --> 00:21:44,644
the medical service
for kids in rural areas.

427
00:21:44,884 --> 00:21:45,685
He's been

428
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:47,604
nagging me about that.

429
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:50,884
Back in college,
he was always talking about

430
00:21:51,164 --> 00:21:53,564
setting up a public service hospital.

431
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:55,725
It's been his aspiration for years.

432
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:56,765
Yeah.

433
00:21:57,205 --> 00:21:58,404
I hope his dream

434
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:01,005
can come true one day.

435
00:22:07,112 --> 00:22:09,844
(Director's Office)

436
00:22:18,445 --> 00:22:19,364
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

437
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:22,005
Have you seen the plan?

438
00:22:22,604 --> 00:22:23,485
Hello, Miss Su.

439
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:26,045
I've checked out

440
00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:27,045
the latest plan.

441
00:22:27,364 --> 00:22:28,084
I love it.

442
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:30,045
Especially the element of

443
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:31,045
color-changing bricks.

444
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,644
Mr. Jiang, I don't think

445
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:36,884
I've included that

446
00:22:36,965 --> 00:22:38,445
in the plan I offered.

447
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:40,925
How come?

448
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,045
Your main designer

449
00:22:43,324 --> 00:22:44,685
Miss Tian checked it with me.

450
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:47,445
I haven't seen such bricks before,

451
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:48,725
but I find them

452
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:50,445
quite unique and innovative.

453
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:53,005
Listen, Mr. Jiang.

454
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:57,205
It's a patent product
of Tiandi Building Materials Corp,

455
00:22:57,564 --> 00:22:59,765
which is not under massive distribution.

456
00:23:00,164 --> 00:23:01,884
So could you please reconsider...

457
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:02,925
I've made up my mind

458
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:04,124
on that.

459
00:23:04,564 --> 00:23:05,245
I want those bricks.

460
00:23:07,205 --> 00:23:07,804
Okay.

461
00:23:08,045 --> 00:23:08,884
Since you like it,

462
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:09,965
I'll do my best.

463
00:23:10,404 --> 00:23:11,525
Okay, bye.

464
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:17,164
Color-changing bricks.

465
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:20,884
Tian Mei.

466
00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:22,005
Color-changing bricks

467
00:23:22,124 --> 00:23:23,205
weren't included

468
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:24,285
in the design plan.

469
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,564
I added it.

470
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:30,056
Throughout the communication,

471
00:23:30,056 --> 00:23:32,124
I thought he'd like such an idea.

472
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:36,324
Tian Mei.

473
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:37,804
First.

474
00:23:38,205 --> 00:23:39,205
We're a team.

475
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:40,404
You should inform me

476
00:23:40,604 --> 00:23:41,765
of any sort of changes.

477
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:42,765
Second.

478
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:45,604
The bricks haven't
stood the test of the market.

479
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,485
What if anything goes wrong?

480
00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:50,485
Designers should seek visual effects,

481
00:23:50,884 --> 00:23:53,285
but we shouldn't flaunt our skills.

482
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:56,245
Instead, we should avoid risks
for the sake of the clients.

483
00:23:58,765 --> 00:23:59,564
Sorry, Ying.

484
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:02,005
I just wanted a better visual effect.

485
00:24:03,164 --> 00:24:04,884
I'll always consult you first.

486
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:08,084
Fine.

487
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:11,124
Since Mr. Jiang loves this plan,

488
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,604
let's go with it for now.

489
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:15,765
Okay.

490
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:16,765
Go ahead.

491
00:24:38,804 --> 00:24:39,285
(Mr. Yang.)

492
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:41,084
(I've recommended Ying)

493
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:42,644
(the color-changing bricks.)

494
00:24:42,965 --> 00:24:45,005
(Don't forget what you promised me.)

495
00:24:58,445 --> 00:24:59,485
Kevin, come in here.

496
00:25:01,965 --> 00:25:03,324
Mr. Yang, what's the matter?

497
00:25:04,364 --> 00:25:06,324
Look for a proper project that needs

498
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:07,445
a designer

499
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:09,364
and assign it to Tian Mei.

500
00:25:09,965 --> 00:25:10,485
Tian Mei?

501
00:25:10,804 --> 00:25:11,404
Yeah.

502
00:25:12,364 --> 00:25:12,725
Also,

503
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:14,324
if SU Design Firm orders

504
00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:16,364
color-changing bricks, stall it for me.

505
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:18,245
We always make it easy.

506
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:19,965
Now we'll follow the protocols?

507
00:25:20,245 --> 00:25:21,285
Say we don't have stocks.

508
00:25:22,045 --> 00:25:22,765
Alright.

509
00:25:26,005 --> 00:25:27,564
Okay, I got it.

510
00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:28,685
Thank you.

511
00:25:33,525 --> 00:25:34,045
Ying.

512
00:25:34,364 --> 00:25:36,045
Assistant Li of Tiandi Corp
said the bricks are not

513
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,245
under mass production.

514
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:38,285
We have to wait

515
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:40,045
for at least six months.

516
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:41,124
Six months?

517
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:43,164
Yeah, we can't wait for so long.

518
00:25:43,364 --> 00:25:45,564
Shall we persuade Jiang Dong
to change the plan?

519
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:47,245
No.

520
00:25:48,525 --> 00:25:50,564
He helped a lot with Lele's case.

521
00:25:50,804 --> 00:25:51,604
We can't do that.

522
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,364
But Assistant Li
said they had no stocks.

523
00:25:57,844 --> 00:25:58,485
I see.

524
00:25:59,124 --> 00:25:59,884
I'll figure

525
00:26:00,445 --> 00:26:01,084
something out.

526
00:26:01,364 --> 00:26:02,285
I'll go back to work.

527
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:30,205
(Mr. Yang.)

528
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:31,084
(I'm working on a project)

529
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:33,084
(that requires
your color-changing bricks.)

530
00:26:33,084 --> 00:26:34,245
(Could you get us some?)

531
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:01,644
Mr. Yang.

532
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:03,525
Sorry to bother you.

533
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:05,965
Did you see my message?

534
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:08,884
Sorry, I was in a meeting
and just saw it.

535
00:27:10,404 --> 00:27:11,164
Here's the thing.

536
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,485
I'm working on a project

537
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:16,005
that requires
your color-changing bricks.

538
00:27:16,604 --> 00:27:17,245
I see.

539
00:27:17,364 --> 00:27:18,965
Just a second. Let me check.

540
00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:25,765
I'm sorry, Miss Su.

541
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,164
We don't have them in stock.

542
00:27:28,725 --> 00:27:29,445
I know.

543
00:27:30,364 --> 00:27:31,485
That's why I'm calling

544
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:32,884
to consult you.

545
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,124
How about this?

546
00:27:36,525 --> 00:27:38,445
A client of mine will receive the order

547
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:39,404
in three days.

548
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:41,965
Let me ask him if he can

549
00:27:42,445 --> 00:27:43,804
share some with you.

550
00:27:44,644 --> 00:27:45,285
Really?

551
00:27:46,604 --> 00:27:47,285
But

552
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:49,084
he's a bit difficult.

553
00:27:50,564 --> 00:27:51,005
Then

554
00:27:52,324 --> 00:27:53,045
how about this?

555
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:56,040
Could you please
give me his contact and let me

556
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:57,245
talk to him?

557
00:27:58,245 --> 00:27:59,005
Well...

558
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:00,725
That's inappropriate.

559
00:28:00,725 --> 00:28:01,485
How about this?

560
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:03,925
I know his preferences.

561
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:06,445
We can go to the mall

562
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,005
and get something he likes.

563
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:10,045
It's better to visit him like that.

564
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:11,324
What do you think?

565
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,005
Alright, when?

566
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:16,164
3 PM tomorrow.

567
00:28:16,844 --> 00:28:17,404
Okay.

568
00:28:17,844 --> 00:28:18,685
See you tomorrow.

569
00:28:19,884 --> 00:28:20,364
Okay.

570
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:27,164
Here's your hazelnut-flavored latte.

571
00:28:27,245 --> 00:28:27,804
Thank you.

572
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,364
And a black tea.

573
00:28:29,525 --> 00:28:30,525
Okay, thank you.

574
00:28:31,925 --> 00:28:33,844
Weiwei, I got you some tea.

575
00:28:34,404 --> 00:28:35,205
Thanks, Mingming.

576
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:37,205
You always remember what I like.

577
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:38,925
Have some.

578
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:41,965
I remember your favorite is Tieguanyin.

579
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:42,804
Am I right?

580
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:46,965
Impressive. You even

581
00:28:47,564 --> 00:28:48,884
remember what she drinks.

582
00:28:49,564 --> 00:28:51,324
Mingming cares a lot about me.

583
00:28:51,644 --> 00:28:52,925
I wanted a promotion

584
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:55,404
and he helped me out right away.

585
00:28:57,245 --> 00:28:58,884
Miss Du is an expert

586
00:28:59,124 --> 00:29:00,445
and you need an expert.

587
00:29:00,604 --> 00:29:01,564
We're all friends here.

588
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:02,725
Thank you.

589
00:29:04,124 --> 00:29:06,445
I have things to do in the office.

590
00:29:06,604 --> 00:29:07,560
I'll leave you to talk.

591
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:08,884
Stay a bit more.

592
00:29:09,245 --> 00:29:10,164
You can help me

593
00:29:10,485 --> 00:29:12,084
if I have inquiries.

594
00:29:12,765 --> 00:29:15,045
But I'm not an expert in this.

595
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:17,965
It's okay. Go ahead.

596
00:29:18,644 --> 00:29:19,205
Miss Weiwei.

597
00:29:19,564 --> 00:29:21,404
I can answer all your questions.

598
00:29:22,485 --> 00:29:24,685
Miss Du is very experienced.

599
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,604
Feel free

600
00:29:25,804 --> 00:29:26,925
to consult her.

601
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:27,925
Rest assured.

602
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:29,164
See you.

603
00:29:30,245 --> 00:29:30,844
Wait.

604
00:29:32,884 --> 00:29:33,644
It's a small gift.

605
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:34,804
I hope you like it.

606
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:36,404
For me?

607
00:29:37,324 --> 00:29:38,604
You're so sweet, Weiwei.

608
00:29:38,925 --> 00:29:40,084
Okay, thank you.

609
00:29:40,324 --> 00:29:41,644
I'll bring you something in return.

610
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:42,965
Mark your words.

611
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:43,965
Okay, no problem.

612
00:29:44,404 --> 00:29:44,804
See you.

613
00:29:44,965 --> 00:29:45,525
Bye.

614
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:46,884
Take care.

615
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:47,965
Okay.

616
00:29:50,045 --> 00:29:50,644
Please sit.

617
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:52,324
If the filming plan

618
00:29:52,485 --> 00:29:53,644
looks fine to you,

619
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:55,525
we can start filming now.

620
00:29:57,604 --> 00:29:59,925
Feel free to wait upstairs

621
00:30:00,164 --> 00:30:01,564
if you don't wish to be filmed.

622
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:03,005
Okay, no problem.

623
00:30:15,804 --> 00:30:18,324
There isn't
excessive interior decoration,

624
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:20,324
which highlights the spacious vibe.

625
00:30:22,925 --> 00:30:24,245
Let's see the French window.

626
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,804
The whole dining area
enjoys a great vision.

627
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:31,925
The furniture adopts European style.

628
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:35,925
Let's check out the kitchen.

629
00:30:39,884 --> 00:30:41,525
It is a Western-style

630
00:30:41,525 --> 00:30:44,164
semi-open kitchen

631
00:30:45,324 --> 00:30:47,564
with in-built cabinets.

632
00:30:52,844 --> 00:30:53,765
What's that sound?

633
00:30:56,445 --> 00:30:57,644
N-Nothing.

634
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:24,164
(I smashed
the client's flower by mistake.)

635
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:26,364
(Can you get me the same flower?)

636
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:37,285
I'm so sorry.

637
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:39,364
I was too careless

638
00:31:39,604 --> 00:31:42,245
and smashed your flower
while I was going backward.

639
00:31:43,045 --> 00:31:45,084
How about this? I'll compensate you.

640
00:31:45,364 --> 00:31:46,084
How?

641
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:48,604
I've kept it for years. We're attached.

642
00:31:48,604 --> 00:31:49,844
You can't compensate me.

643
00:31:50,804 --> 00:31:52,485
You ruined my flower

644
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:53,804
to film a video.

645
00:31:54,124 --> 00:31:54,884
And you

646
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:56,604
call yourself professional?

647
00:31:59,364 --> 00:32:01,005
- Mingshi, why did you come?
- Well...

648
00:32:01,525 --> 00:32:02,084
Sorry.

649
00:32:02,364 --> 00:32:03,324
My friend said

650
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:05,245
that she smashed your orchid.

651
00:32:05,604 --> 00:32:06,245
And I happen

652
00:32:06,564 --> 00:32:08,644
to have the same orchid at home.

653
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:10,364
So I brought it here.

654
00:32:10,644 --> 00:32:11,644
Please forgive her.

655
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:15,084
What a nice orchid.

656
00:32:15,604 --> 00:32:17,644
You kept it for years, right?

657
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:20,205
You're so generous.

658
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:21,564
How can I be mad?

659
00:32:22,564 --> 00:32:23,205
That's great.

660
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:25,045
Do you like it?

661
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:26,525
Of course, I do.

662
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,324
I love it because it's yours.

663
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:31,084
It's so pretty.

664
00:32:33,765 --> 00:32:34,925
This side is even prettier.

665
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:39,404
The pedals are huge.

666
00:32:40,205 --> 00:32:42,364
Let me put it on the table, Weiwei.

667
00:32:43,404 --> 00:32:45,045
You've come all the way here.

668
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:46,644
Stay for a tea.

669
00:32:46,804 --> 00:32:49,205
I just bought the best Tieguanyin.

670
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:51,205
Not anyone gets to taste it.

671
00:32:51,525 --> 00:32:52,245
Have a try.

672
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,324
I'd love to,

673
00:32:55,564 --> 00:32:57,445
but I have work to do.

674
00:32:57,804 --> 00:32:58,725
Rain check.

675
00:33:00,765 --> 00:33:02,245
Let me give you a ride.

676
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,164
No need. Don't bother.

677
00:33:04,324 --> 00:33:05,005
It's close by.

678
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:06,965
I'm so sorry

679
00:33:07,124 --> 00:33:08,404
about the flower.

680
00:33:08,604 --> 00:33:09,404
Sorry.

681
00:33:09,844 --> 00:33:10,604
It's okay.

682
00:33:10,685 --> 00:33:12,648
Mingming brought me a new one.

683
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:14,404
It's okay.

684
00:33:21,525 --> 00:33:22,084
Huixuan,

685
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:24,644
don't take it to heart.

686
00:33:25,205 --> 00:33:26,765
Of course not.

687
00:33:27,445 --> 00:33:29,245
Weiwei can be serious sometimes.

688
00:33:29,245 --> 00:33:30,604
But she's nice once you

689
00:33:30,604 --> 00:33:31,685
get to know her.

690
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:37,045
It sounds like you know her very well.

691
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:39,884
You even remember what she drinks.

692
00:33:42,285 --> 00:33:44,404
You mean back at the cafe?

693
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:47,604
She often got tea when we

694
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,045
went out to talk business.

695
00:33:49,525 --> 00:33:51,445
And she's our major client.

696
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,084
I have to memorize

697
00:33:53,084 --> 00:33:54,005
habits of clients.

698
00:33:55,205 --> 00:33:56,965
And you said

699
00:33:56,965 --> 00:33:58,844
you'd treat her to tea.

700
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:00,364
When?

701
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:02,564
I was just being polite.

702
00:34:02,804 --> 00:34:03,844
I don't even like tea.

703
00:34:04,164 --> 00:34:05,485
Then what do you like?

704
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:08,072
Hazelnut-flavored latte.

705
00:34:13,764 --> 00:34:15,005
Thank you for helping me out.

706
00:34:15,604 --> 00:34:16,845
How can I thank you?

707
00:34:19,284 --> 00:34:21,764
Invite me to your place
for a soccer match.

708
00:34:23,485 --> 00:34:24,525
There's a match tonight?

709
00:34:27,244 --> 00:34:28,525
But my internet is down.

710
00:34:28,845 --> 00:34:29,845
Again?

711
00:34:31,284 --> 00:34:32,164
What a coincidence.

712
00:34:32,325 --> 00:34:34,284
I'm always the one
who fixes your internet.

713
00:34:35,084 --> 00:34:36,965
Please help me out again.

714
00:34:37,764 --> 00:34:38,284
Sure.

715
00:34:48,124 --> 00:34:49,284
Are you busy?

716
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:51,045
Yeah.

717
00:34:51,724 --> 00:34:52,845
It's the surgery tomorrow.

718
00:34:53,604 --> 00:34:55,244
Are you tired? Want a massage?

719
00:34:56,244 --> 00:34:57,124
So considerate.

720
00:34:59,005 --> 00:35:01,124
Do you have to study
before every surgery?

721
00:35:01,564 --> 00:35:02,244
Yeah.

722
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:04,965
Different doctors may conduct

723
00:35:05,124 --> 00:35:06,885
similar surgeries differently, right?

724
00:35:07,244 --> 00:35:09,124
Why are you suddenly
interested in surgeries?

725
00:35:09,724 --> 00:35:11,084
I want to know you.

726
00:35:12,684 --> 00:35:15,365
It depends on the patient's condition.

727
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:17,204
But we get to keep

728
00:35:17,845 --> 00:35:19,764
some personalized items.

729
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:21,164
Like what?

730
00:35:21,845 --> 00:35:22,805
For example,

731
00:35:23,644 --> 00:35:24,724
a unique scrub cap.

732
00:35:25,445 --> 00:35:26,244
Does it bear

733
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:28,485
a certain meaning?

734
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:29,805
Not really.

735
00:35:30,485 --> 00:35:32,284
It's just adding some fun

736
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:33,764
to the dull surgeries.

737
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:35,885
Sounds fun.

738
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:38,045
Alright.

739
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:40,244
That's enough about me.

740
00:35:40,925 --> 00:35:42,684
How are you these days?

741
00:35:44,244 --> 00:35:45,164
I'm fine.

742
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:46,604
Don't worry.

743
00:35:46,885 --> 00:35:48,365
Focus on the surgery tomorrow.

744
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:49,724
It's an important one.

745
00:35:51,005 --> 00:35:52,684
I'll go brush my teeth
and leave you to work.

746
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:12,204
I don't know if it's a coincidence

747
00:36:12,845 --> 00:36:14,244
or something else,

748
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:16,684
what you did recently

749
00:36:16,845 --> 00:36:18,764
has been making me slightly

750
00:36:20,204 --> 00:36:20,965
uncomfortable.

751
00:37:06,284 --> 00:37:06,885
(Mi Bai.)

752
00:37:11,764 --> 00:37:13,045
(Do you remember)

753
00:37:14,244 --> 00:37:15,284
(the day you confessed)

754
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:18,084
(to Yunsheng for me under the rainbow?)

755
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:25,704
(You were confessing for yourself too.)

756
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:27,164
(Right?)

757
00:37:34,724 --> 00:37:35,525
Mi Bai.

758
00:37:36,365 --> 00:37:38,764
Do I look pretty today?

759
00:37:39,325 --> 00:37:40,124
Yeah.

760
00:37:41,684 --> 00:37:44,045
Why are you acting weird today?

761
00:37:45,164 --> 00:37:46,764
I invited Yunsheng to the beach.

762
00:37:47,805 --> 00:37:49,405
I want to confess my love.

763
00:37:52,724 --> 00:37:53,764
Finally!

764
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:55,724
Right.

765
00:37:56,204 --> 00:37:59,124
Yunsheng just got into medical school.

766
00:37:59,684 --> 00:38:01,244
He'll be somewhere far away.

767
00:38:01,644 --> 00:38:03,644
You should confess to him now.

768
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:05,485
But...

769
00:38:06,405 --> 00:38:07,405
But I'm still

770
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:09,644
a bit scared.

771
00:38:09,965 --> 00:38:11,164
Not again.

772
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:14,925
I know you're worried
about your health condition.

773
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:17,525
You think you're not good enough

774
00:38:17,764 --> 00:38:19,684
for Yunsheng because you're sick.

775
00:38:19,885 --> 00:38:21,124
But you like him so much.

776
00:38:21,124 --> 00:38:22,965
It's a pity to hide it from him.

777
00:38:24,325 --> 00:38:25,124
I know.

778
00:38:26,045 --> 00:38:27,124
But

779
00:38:28,365 --> 00:38:30,564
if he turns me down,

780
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:32,604
I don't know...

781
00:38:33,805 --> 00:38:36,124
I don't know how to face him afterward.

782
00:38:39,644 --> 00:38:40,204
Sister.

783
00:38:40,805 --> 00:38:41,684
Maybe

784
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:43,325
I can help you.

785
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:51,485
Mi Su.

786
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:52,845
Yunsheng.

787
00:38:55,244 --> 00:38:57,084
Stay there. I have something to say.

788
00:39:02,764 --> 00:39:05,045
There are things I've always

789
00:39:06,164 --> 00:39:07,445
meant to tell you.

790
00:39:10,525 --> 00:39:11,365
I like you.

791
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:13,684
I've been into you for a long time.

792
00:39:20,244 --> 00:39:21,005
Actually,

793
00:39:24,164 --> 00:39:25,204
