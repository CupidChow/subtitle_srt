(Fenglin Drive-in Theater)

18
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:06,109
Drive-in theater?

19
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:08,949
Have you been here before?

20
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,573
No.

21
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:12,565
This is my first time.

22
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:14,709
How about you?

23
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:16,028
It's also my first time.

24
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:20,533
You like it?

25
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:47,588
Do you like watching movies?

26
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:49,205
Yes, I do.

27
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:50,628
What kind of movies?

28
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:53,549
It depends.

29
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:55,285
What?

30
00:02:56,428 --> 00:02:58,509
For example,
today I feel like watching romance.

31
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:00,725
How about you?

32
00:03:02,468 --> 00:03:03,317
Me?

33
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,028
I like watching you.

34
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:18,389
This is mine.

35
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:20,053
It's yours?

36
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:36,949
Have a try.

37
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:47,549
How is it? I'll get you some soup.

38
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,109
It's delicious.

39
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:52,469
Here.

40
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:55,708
Your cooking is really good.

41
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:57,549
I think you're hungry.

42
00:03:57,549 --> 00:03:58,509
So I made a simple meal.

43
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:59,748
I'm not sure if you like it.

44
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:02,468
I thought
you could only make sandwiches.

45
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:04,168
How could that be?

46
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,509
How did you make Subing obedient?

47
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:13,949
Well, the dog is disgruntled

48
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:15,308
for three reasons.

49
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:17,709
He's thirsty, hungry, or sick.

50
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:20,068
But I fed it.

51
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:22,669
It can only prove

52
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:25,109
that your food didn't suit its taste.

53
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:28,909
So, Mr. Yang's dog

54
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:31,432
is precious and different.

55
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:35,624
Try a shrimp.

56
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:39,304
Vegetables.

57
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:40,488
What's the time now?

58
00:04:42,388 --> 00:04:43,428
It's 6:45 PM.

59
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,388
My favorite match is about to start.

60
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:48,029
Manchester United.

61
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:49,416
Right.

62
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,669
What a coincidence.
I'm also a soccer fan.

63
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:53,188
I have been a fan of the Red Devils

64
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:54,669
since the time of Sir Alex Ferguson.

65
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:55,748
What a coincidence.

66
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:57,469
Let's watch it together later.

67
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:58,600
Sure.

68
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,828
How can we watch the game without...

69
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:03,528
What?

70
00:05:07,948 --> 00:05:09,549
I'm getting smarter and smarter.

71
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:13,384
Finished.

72
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,948
Ye, you've worked so hard.

73
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:22,856
I bought you a soda.

74
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:24,229
So thoughtful.

75
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:27,868
I am a bit weak.

76
00:05:28,549 --> 00:05:29,416
You open it.

77
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,068
I bought it for you.

78
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:32,232
You should open it.

79
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:33,960
Are you tricking me?

80
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,909
No.

81
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:35,848
Then you open it.

82
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:39,624
Look at you. Catch it.

83
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:43,268
Don't try to trick me.

84
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:44,589
You're still too young.

85
00:05:54,428 --> 00:05:56,188
You're still eating tomatoes for dinner.

86
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:58,589
What can I do?

87
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,508
I want to wear size S clothes.

88
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:02,349
Don't be silly.

89
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:03,709
If you only eat this,

90
00:06:03,828 --> 00:06:04,669
you'll have no energy.

91
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:06,789
You should immediately
replenish nutrients now,

92
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:08,308
so you'll have the energy to work.

93
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:10,152
I think you're right.

94
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,469
I recommend super-delicious spicy food.

95
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,832
Do you want to try it out?

96
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:14,789
Yes.

97
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:15,669
Let's go.

98
00:06:17,672 --> 00:06:20,109
Taste my secret sauce.

99
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:21,256
Nobody knows it.

100
00:06:22,388 --> 00:06:23,308
Smells good.

101
00:06:23,308 --> 00:06:24,300
I know.

102
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,580
(Lucky Foodie)

103
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:34,109
Why are you only

104
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:35,229
eating vegetables?

105
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:36,549
Order whatever you like.

106
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:38,216
My treat.

107
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:39,868
I'm not saving money for you.

108
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:41,989
I'm on a diet.

109
00:06:42,748 --> 00:06:44,549
I've told you. You're really not fat.

110
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:48,648
Really?

111
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:51,029
Come on.

112
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,912
Try this.

113
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:53,268
Lunch meat.

114
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:54,664
So delicious.

115
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:56,428
Then I'll start dieting tomorrow.

116
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:57,992
Let's eat.

117
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,709
The long-lost taste
of meat is so satisfying.

118
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:06,376
I want something else.

119
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:09,308
Sir, give me two sodas.

120
00:07:11,828 --> 00:07:12,680
Great.

121
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:26,376
Try it.

122
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:39,428
Not like that. Look.

123
00:07:42,188 --> 00:07:43,080
Well...

124
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:47,784
Take a big gulp.

125
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:57,828
Isn't it refreshing?

126
00:07:58,549 --> 00:07:59,496
Yes.

127
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:03,669
Miss Su let me take charge of a project
on my own.

128
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:06,029
I'm feeling a bit pressured.

129
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:08,909
It's normal to feel pressured.

130
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:10,216
You'll never know

131
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:11,428
if you don't try.

132
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:15,229
Well,

133
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:16,508
will we become excellent designers

134
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:18,628
like Miss Su in the future?

135
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,388
Geniuses

136
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:25,188
are extraordinary

137
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,628
not because they are naturally superior,

138
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:28,909
but because they have

139
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:30,989
put in consistent efforts.

140
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,229
According to a theory,

141
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:36,268
this process must last
at least 10,000 hours.

142
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:39,189
10,000 hours?

143
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:42,600
Alright.

144
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:44,548
I'll continue to work hard
for 10,000 hours.

145
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:46,109
Let's toast.

146
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:47,400
Cheers.

147
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,312
I'm back.

148
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:51,388
Okay.

149
00:08:51,388 --> 00:08:52,388
Has it started?

150
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:55,189
Not yet. The game will start
after this highlight reel is over.

151
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:56,508
Good, perfect timing.

152
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:57,480
Come on.

153
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,709
Pass it.

154
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,600
Pass it.

155
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:03,868
Pass.

156
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:04,709
Goal. Pass it.

157
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,720
Speed up.

158
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,668
Pass it.

159
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:09,544
Speed up.

160
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:13,992
Let's toast.

161
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:19,469

You're the last person
I want to talk to before I go to sleep.

I came here tonight,

174

not because I'm lonely,

175
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:45,028

I told you it was a goal.

180
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:22,589
Alright, you're smart.

181
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:28,469
Huixuan, where's Subing? Subing.

182
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:29,309
Isn't Subing over there?

183
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:31,548
I'll check the balcony.

184
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,309
Subing.

185
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:34,184
Subing.

186
00:11:36,469 --> 00:11:37,320
Subing.

187
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:40,424
Subing.

188
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:43,080
It's not on the balcony.

189
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:45,788
I didn't find it in the bedroom either.

190
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,388
How is the door open?

191
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:53,148

192
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:56,989
didn't I close the door?

193
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,920
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:03,508
Let me get it for you.

195
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:19,949
Hello, what's up?

196
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:20,872
Hello, Su.

197
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:22,069
Subing is missing.

198
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,176
What?

199
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:25,800
Xuan.

200
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,668
What happened?

201
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:27,624
I'm sorry, Su.

202
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:30,109
I went out to buy beer. When I returned,
I didn't close the door.

203
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:30,984
The dog came out.

204
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,628
Don't worry.

205
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:33,896
Did you check the surveillance?

206
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,829
I've checked it.

207
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:36,748
Subing left
through the entrance of the residence.

208
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:38,216
Well,

209
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:39,548
let's split up and search.

210
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:40,872
- Let's split up.
- Let's go over there.

211
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:41,800
Let's go.

212
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,748
Subing.

213
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:43,624
Subing.

214
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:46,344
Subing.

215
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:49,480
Subing.

216
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,024
Subing.

217
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:02,748
Subing.

218
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:04,309
Subing.

219
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:05,949
I found nothing.
I'll go check over there.

220
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:07,069
What should we do?

221
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:08,168
Subing.

222
00:14:08,268 --> 00:14:09,148
Subing.

223
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:17,256
Subing.

224
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:20,148
Subing.

225
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:23,829
- Subing.
- Subing.

226
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:27,464
I've searched many places.

227
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:28,360
I didn't find it.

228
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,508
Give me the ball.

229
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:30,429
Go over there.

230
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:31,349
Subing.

231
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:32,776
Subing.

232
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,949
Subing.

233
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:52,229
(Mr. Yang, the items you bid on
at the charity auction have arrived.)

234
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:54,309
(They were all donated by Su Ying.)

235
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:55,724
(Assistant Li)
(But one item is missing.)

236
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,508
(Find out who bought it.)

237
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,589
(No matter the cost, buy it back for me.)

238
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,420
(Su Ying)

239
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:21,309
Hello.

240
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:22,268
Hello, Zhengwen.

241
00:15:23,868 --> 00:15:24,808
Subing is missing.

242
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:26,024
What?

243
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:27,268
I'll explain to you later.

244
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:28,908
I'm trying to find it now.

245
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:30,668
Can you look for it too?

246
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:35,748
Don't panic. Subing is very smart.

247
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:37,309
It will go to places
it is familiar with.

248
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:39,229
You keep looking,
and I'll ask someone to check

249
00:15:39,349 --> 00:15:40,628
near my house and the company.

250
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,120
Don't worry.

251
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:43,112
Okay.

252
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:44,069
Keep me updated.

253
00:15:44,548 --> 00:15:45,508
I'll call you if I find it.

254
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:47,528
Okay, bye.

255
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:53,949
Hello, have you seen a golden retriever?

256
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:54,984
About this big.

257
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:56,648
Sorry, but I haven't seen one.

258
00:15:56,908 --> 00:15:57,768
Okay, thank you.

259
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:01,096
Subing.

260
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:08,840
Subing.

261
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:11,528
Subing.

262
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,444
(Pet Clinic)

263
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:31,496
What should we do?

264
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:34,788
What if Subing was taken away
by a bad guy?

265
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:36,508
It's hard to steal such a big dog.

266
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:38,829
Maybe it went home.

267
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:42,152
Let's go.

268
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:54,472
Subing.

269
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:58,388
How did you get back here?

270
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:03,469
Did you miss me?

271
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,508
Little boy.

272
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:15,348
You missed me?

273
00:17:31,989 --> 00:17:33,508
(Assistant Li)
(Mr. Yang, Subing is found.)

274
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:36,392
(Just sent you a photo. Don't worry.)

275
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:06,184
Mr. Yang, while you were away,

276
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:07,828
several important meetings
have been postponed.

277
00:18:07,828 --> 00:18:08,840
Here's related information.

278
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:10,536
Okay.

279
00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:12,788
Also, among the cases you recommended

280
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:13,748
to SU Design Firm,

281
00:18:13,748 --> 00:18:14,788
two of them were accepted.

282
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:17,384
Which two?

283
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:19,068
The Flower & City Homestay Project,

284
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:21,108
and the Galaxy Bay project.

285
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:24,469
Don't reveal my involvement.

286
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:25,800
Okay.

287
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:28,429
By the way, have you found out

288
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:30,548
who bought the item that was missing?

289
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,028
Yes, I found that it was purchased
by a doctor from Meichi,

290
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:34,308
named Qin Yunsheng.

291
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:36,709
Qin Yunsheng?

292
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:37,576
Yes.

293
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:40,989
Qin Yunsheng.

294
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:42,748
He's a cardiac surgeon at Meichi.

295
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:44,709
He's also the owner of the glass house.

296
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:45,800
My friend.

297
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:51,108
You look up information on him.

298
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:52,308
As detailed as possible.

299
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:53,640
Okay.

300
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:03,180
(Beer House)

301
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:07,149
Strange.

302
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:08,709
Exactly.

303
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:10,068
You noticed it too?

304
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:15,912
Here, try this.

305
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:22,344
Does it taste good?

306
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:25,064
I'll grill another one for you.

307
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:31,496
Tasty.

308
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:33,629
It's a bit spicy.

309
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:34,472
Spicy?

310
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:35,752
Hai.

311
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,256
Get me some water.

312
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:42,709
Chicken.

313
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:44,776
Chicken? I'll grill chicken for you.

314
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:52,488
Yunsheng.

315
00:19:53,989 --> 00:19:55,548
I also want to eat meat.

316
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:57,064
I'm not afraid of spiciness.

317
00:19:57,149 --> 00:19:58,028
You two grill yourselves.

318
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:00,429
Come on.

319
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:02,068
We've been watching you two.

320
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:03,548
Just now,

321
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:05,788
you grilled eight pieces
of meat for Su Ying,

322
00:20:06,348 --> 00:20:07,748
and she peeled 11 shrimps for you.

323
00:20:08,068 --> 00:20:08,909
What's more, the way

324
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:11,272
they look at each other is different.

325
00:20:11,548 --> 00:20:12,629
I can't believe

326
00:20:12,788 --> 00:20:14,788
you two are completely ignoring us.

327
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:16,709
You two giggled from time to time.

328
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:17,992
Why?

329
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:19,240
Did we?

330
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:20,588
You're doing it now.

331
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:38,949
Qin Yunsheng, good for you.

332
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:41,192
When did this happen?

333
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:45,256
Just a couple of days ago.

334
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:47,880
I knew something is off.

335
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:51,028
Su Ying, if Qin Yunsheng makes you mad,

336
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:52,308
I will be on your side.

337
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:54,068
But, I have a condition.

338
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:56,108
You'll introduce
pretty female co-workers

339
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:57,192
to me.

340
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,308
That's right.

341
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:00,709
If any female patients try
to add Yunsheng

342
00:21:01,068 --> 00:21:01,989
on WeChat,

343
00:21:02,268 --> 00:21:03,176
I'll stop them all.

344
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:07,268
I don't think what Hai said

345
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:08,712
will happen.

346
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,788
But what Dr. Zhang just said

347
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,200
might happen.

348
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:13,949
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

349
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:14,828
Will it happen?

350
00:21:14,828 --> 00:21:15,788
No, it won't.

351
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:19,629
Okay, I am happy today.

352
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:20,909
We must open a good wine later.

353
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:22,429
Let's drink and celebrate.

354
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,268
I'm going to take a walk with Su Ying.

355
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:26,068
After that, we'll join you for drinks.

356
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:27,229
Go ahead.

357
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:29,068
The beach and sea breeze. How romantic.

358
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:31,429
There's another thing.

359
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,648
Keep it a secret for now.

360
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:34,068
I'll make it public myself.

361
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,720
Don't worry.

362
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,629
You two go ahead.

363
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,308
We won't feel lonely.

364
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:40,308
Just the two of you at the moment.

365
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:42,149
Then we're leaving.

366
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:43,989
Enjoy your moment now.

367
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:55,149
You brought pig's feet.

368
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:55,828
Have you had enough?

369
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:56,776
Yes.

370
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:03,068
What's going on?

371
00:22:03,828 --> 00:22:05,068
What's going on?

372
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:06,952
I get it.

373
00:22:07,189 --> 00:22:08,629
You lost a game again.

374
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:09,544
We didn't play any games.

375
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:12,808
We're together now.

376
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:17,909
You're together now.

377
00:22:17,992 --> 00:22:18,909
See,

378
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:19,784
I told you.

379
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:21,096
They're a perfect match.

380
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:27,432
Let's go.

381
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:28,616
Let's go.

382
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:33,268
This project really troubles me.

383
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:34,828
How should I report this to Mr. Su?

384
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:36,629
The big deals we worked on earlier

385
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:37,989
all came to Su Ying.

386
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,748
It's all because
of the One-Line Sky program.

387
00:22:39,949 --> 00:22:41,189
Tian Mei was in charge of that.

388
00:22:41,588 --> 00:22:44,392
Someone caused trouble for us.

389
00:22:44,392 --> 00:22:46,548
Yes. She's coming. Stop saying.

390
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:00,808
Tian Mei.

391
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:02,792
We need to talk.

392
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,108
Do you know how many deals

393
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:23,469
were lost after the show was on air?

394
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:25,788
Do you know how much trouble
you've caused me?

395
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:28,469
I'm sorry.

396
00:23:28,469 --> 00:23:29,469
It's too late.

397
00:23:31,189 --> 00:23:32,268
Everyone in the industry now

398
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:33,709
knows I lost to Su Ying.

399
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:35,748
How will I take on projects?

400
00:23:36,308 --> 00:23:37,192
You tell me.

401
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:39,588
I didn't expect things
to turn out like this.

402
00:23:39,828 --> 00:23:41,028
I did it all for our firm.

403
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:42,469
I don't want to hear your explanation.

404
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:46,588
I shouldn't have hired
an incompetent person like you.

405
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:50,429
You're useless.

406
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:01,709
Is it that hard
to acknowledge the other's achievements?

407
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:04,869
It's not a shameful thing

408
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,548
to recognize others' abilities.

409
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:08,429
Don't be so self-righteous,

410
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:09,748
living in your own world.

411
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:14,629
I'm not worthy
to work with someone like you.

412
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:23,560
I quit.

413
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:27,469
You are too naive.

414
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:29,389
With your work capability

415
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:30,828
and your attitude,

416
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:33,268
I can assure no company will hire you.

417
00:24:34,268 --> 00:24:35,208
Please do.

418
00:25:03,028 --> 00:25:03,944
Did you hear anything?

419
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:09,108
Why are you here?

420
00:25:09,828 --> 00:25:10,709
Where should I be?

421
00:25:12,308 --> 00:25:14,149
You two left first yesterday.

422
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:15,208
Well,

423
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:18,108
I'll leave you alone.

424
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:19,429
I'll take care of myself.

425
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:23,709
See you.

426
00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:26,728
What are you looking for?

427
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:29,669
I lost something the other day.

428
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:30,600
Zhang Yisen.

429
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:32,552
Drop the act.

430
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:35,308
Well, last night,

431
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:37,389
you two didn't come back.

432
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:40,229
I thought you two would come back
and do something here.

433
00:25:41,469 --> 00:25:42,344
I was wrong.

434
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:44,949
This is for Su Ying.

435
00:25:45,268 --> 00:25:46,189
Have a look.

436
00:25:46,664 --> 00:25:47,508
What is this?

437
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:48,869
This is the certificate awarded

438
00:25:49,028 --> 00:25:51,189
to the person who donated the most.

439
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:52,776
This is Su Ying's.

440
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:54,408
Take a look.

441
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,160
(Donation Certificate)

442
00:25:58,828 --> 00:25:59,816
She donated so much.

443
00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:01,469
As I know,

444
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:03,028
the number of items donated by Su Ying

445
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,869
already broke the record for this event.

446
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:06,909
Because of you,

447
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:08,748
the figure broke six digits.

448
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:11,028
Looks like she did it for you.

449
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:12,788
Whose is that?

450
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:14,408
This is Yang Zhengwen's.

451
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:16,149
Take a look.

452
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:17,149
He's generous.

453
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:18,949
He donated the most.

454
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:20,940
(Donation Certificate)
So much money.

455
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:24,348
I'm going to send it away.

456
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:27,028
You give that to Su Ying.

457
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:29,864
Okay, no problem.

458
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:31,629
I need to thank her.

459
00:26:33,788 --> 00:26:34,664
How?

460
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:36,712
You guess.

461
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:39,784
I guess?

462
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:42,268
Those who are in love are different.

463
00:26:42,508 --> 00:26:43,869
They always make people jealous.

464
00:26:44,189 --> 00:26:45,469
I guess?

465
00:26:46,268 --> 00:26:47,208
I can't guess.

466
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:54,709
Location matters to Seaview Garden.

467
00:26:55,268 --> 00:26:56,629
Let them give me another two days.

468
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:57,909
I'll think about it.

469
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,189
I'll decide at a meeting.

470
00:26:59,508 --> 00:27:00,424
Okay.

471
00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:02,588
Mr. Yang, do I need
to pick up Subing today?

472
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:06,536
Right.

473
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:08,520
It's okay. I'll go myself.

474
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:09,512
Okay.

475
00:27:11,949 --> 00:27:13,588
Mingshi, we've watched the video account

476
00:27:13,748 --> 00:27:14,949
you recommended. It is really good.

477
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:17,508
The logic and techniques
of his editing are good.

478
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:18,629
However, I think

479
00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:19,989
it can be more professional.

480
00:27:20,189 --> 00:27:21,268
If he were still in school,

481
00:27:21,588 --> 00:27:22,989
he would be an expert
in particular areas.

482
00:27:23,748 --> 00:27:24,748
I have one more feedback.

483
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:25,989
He's slow

484
00:27:26,108 --> 00:27:27,389
in his content updates.

485
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:29,989
I suspect someone uses this account
for practice.

486
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:31,429
He can't update it frequently.

487
00:27:31,828 --> 00:27:32,909
I assume so too.

488
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:33,828
But I think he does well.

489
00:27:34,108 --> 00:27:35,016
Mingshi, Ye.

490
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:36,669
Have you revised the contract?

491
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,508
Yes, and it will be sent tomorrow.

492
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:39,752
Okay.

493
00:27:40,348 --> 00:27:41,224
Well,

494
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:42,664
I have an announcement.

495
00:27:43,348 --> 00:27:45,469
After we confirm this contract,

496
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:48,068
we'll go on a team-building trip.

497
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,189
The company will cover all expenses.

498
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:54,669
Think about where to go.

499
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:55,816
What are you talking about?

500
00:27:56,949 --> 00:27:57,960
You're here.

501
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:01,389
We'll leave you alone. Goodbye.

502
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:02,312
We have to go.

503
00:28:02,312 --> 00:28:03,240
We still have work to do.

504
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,189
Here's your certificate.

505
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:11,304
Let me see.

506
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,859
(Donation Certificate)
Thank you for your contribution.

507
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:18,469
I'm honored

508
00:28:18,469 --> 00:28:20,949
to do a small good deed with Dr. Qin.

509
00:28:21,348 --> 00:28:22,312
Small?

510
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:23,629
It's huge.

511
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:26,376
It's a lot.

512
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:29,828
Your influence is truly immense.

513
00:28:32,068 --> 00:28:33,629
Your trophy is still at my home.

514
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:34,669
I'll give it to you.

515
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:36,104
No need.

516
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:37,352
I'll fetch it myself.

517
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:40,392
Keep it well.

518
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:41,828
I know.

519
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:44,232
Are you busy?

520
00:28:44,232 --> 00:28:45,108
I'm free.

521
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:46,748
Can you accompany me to the pet shop

522
00:28:46,748 --> 00:28:47,788
to clean Subing?

523
00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:49,189
No problem.

524
00:28:49,189 --> 00:28:50,088
Go.

525
00:29:00,844 --> 00:29:04,172
(You spent 499 yuan for pet cleaning.
The remaining balance is 4,365 yuan.)

526
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:08,748
Turn right ahead.

527
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:11,268
Aren't we going to Miss Su's firm?

528
00:29:11,788 --> 00:29:12,629
Go to the pet shop first.

529
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:14,024
Okay.

530
00:29:14,732 --> 00:29:16,780
(Tourism Destinations)

531
00:29:19,828 --> 00:29:20,744
Dr. Qin.

532
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:23,629
Have you been busy recently?

533
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:24,869
Will you have days off?

534
00:29:25,949 --> 00:29:27,989
I have two days off over the weekend.

535
00:29:28,788 --> 00:29:29,672
This weekend?

536
00:29:29,828 --> 00:29:31,268
Yes, because I'll get busier afterward.

537
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:34,600
I have a question.

538
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:36,488
What is it?

539
00:29:37,189 --> 00:29:38,669
If you are to travel,

540
00:29:39,189 --> 00:29:40,040
where do you want to go?

541
00:29:41,189 --> 00:29:42,828
If I am to travel,

542
00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:46,828
I want to go
to Iceland to see the Aurora.

543
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:48,308
Iceland?

544
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:49,748
It's too far.

545
00:29:51,028 --> 00:29:52,548
Otherwise,

546
00:29:53,068 --> 00:29:54,028
spend two days

547
00:29:54,548 --> 00:29:55,469
on a small island.

548
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:56,840
A small island?

549
00:29:57,788 --> 00:29:58,629
Sounds good.

550
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:02,056
Why?

551
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:04,229
I arranged a team-building event.

552
00:30:05,189 --> 00:30:06,548
I don't know if I have the honor

553
00:30:06,548 --> 00:30:08,669
to invite Dr. Qin to accompany me.

554
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:12,869
I will have to think about it.

555
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:15,752
Look at this.

556
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:19,909
It's a wooden house.

557
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:23,588
Yes, quite nice.

558
00:30:29,108 --> 00:30:29,992
Look.

559
00:30:34,229 --> 00:30:35,629
Zhengwen, you're back.

560
00:30:36,949 --> 00:30:39,068
If you use the membership card,
I will be notified.

561
00:30:39,268 --> 00:30:40,348
I saw it.

562
00:30:40,348 --> 00:30:42,348
So I came by to pick up Subing.

563
00:30:44,949 --> 00:30:46,348
About Subing that night...

564
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:47,304
It's okay.

565
00:30:48,989 --> 00:30:50,389
I know you didn't mean to.

566
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:53,149
After all, you are Subing's mother.

567
00:30:59,949 --> 00:31:02,028
Let me introduce him to you again.

568
00:31:02,548 --> 00:31:03,548
My boyfriend Qin Yunsheng.

569
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:14,472
Congratulations.

570
00:31:18,229 --> 00:31:19,176
Thank you.

571
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:23,869
Subing is cleaned up.

572
00:31:24,104 --> 00:31:25,028
Subing.

573
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:25,928
Subing.

574
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:29,160
Are you being good?

575
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:32,068
Alright, I will give Subing back to you.

576
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:33,256
We are leaving now.

577
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:34,508
Okay, thank you.

578
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:38,888
Let's go.

579
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:53,909
I used to be very scared of dogs.

580
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,909
One day Yang Zhengwen
brought Subing home.

581
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:04,508
He saw Subing on the side of the road.

582
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:06,024
Subing was so small.

583
00:32:07,949 --> 00:32:09,588
It was shivering, looking pitiful.

584
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:11,629
He thought

585
00:32:12,308 --> 00:32:13,748
he could take it in for a few days,

586
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:15,989
and someone else could adopt this dog.

587
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:18,248
I don't know why,

588
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:20,028
but after Subing came,

589
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:21,629
it kept wagging its tail at me.

590
00:32:22,348 --> 00:32:24,108
Wherever I went, it followed.

591
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:25,469
When I was eating and bathing,

592
00:32:25,828 --> 00:32:26,909
it would squat next to me.

593
00:32:27,189 --> 00:32:28,040
It was well-behaved.

594
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:30,869
Then

595
00:32:32,068 --> 00:32:32,968
I suggested

596
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:34,748
to keep Subing.

597
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,268
It must be fate.

598
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:40,788
Since then
I have never been afraid of dogs.

599
00:32:42,949 --> 00:32:44,748
No wonder you are Subing's mother.

600
00:32:50,588 --> 00:32:52,229
Would you mind my past

601
00:32:52,229 --> 00:32:53,669
with Yang Zhengwen?

602
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:01,864
I don't mind.

603
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:04,709
Everyone has a past.

604
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:08,229
Anyway,

605
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:12,949
we are together now.

606
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:27,304
Let's go.

607
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:39,429
Let me introduce him to you again.

608
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:40,909
My boyfriend Qin Yunsheng.

609
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:50,280
Boyfriend?

610
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:53,949
How is the work with SU Design Firm?

611
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:55,429
I just finished the contract.

612
00:33:56,108 --> 00:33:57,469
You follow up and make them get started.

613
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,508
Okay. And House Design is asking

614
00:34:00,508 --> 00:34:01,909
about the follow-up sponsorship.

615
00:34:04,229 --> 00:34:05,108
I will contact them.

616
00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:07,389
Mr. Yang, I can handle that.

617
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:09,628
After all,
you have barely rested lately.

618
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:13,148
Being busy is good.
It keeps me from overthinking.

619
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:17,580
(Mr. Yang)

620
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,548
Mr. Liu, you have a call.

621
00:34:24,588 --> 00:34:26,349
Hello, Mr. Yang.

622
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:27,208
Hello, Mr. Liu.

623
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,068
If I remember correctly,

624
00:34:29,188 --> 00:34:31,228
our sponsorship contract is about
to expire, right?

625
00:34:31,548 --> 00:34:32,488
Yes.

626
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:34,749
I have been waiting for your reply.

627
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:36,744
Right.

628
00:34:37,148 --> 00:34:39,309
Well, after discussion,

629
00:34:39,508 --> 00:34:41,269
if you don't cooperate

630
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,429
with Su Ying again,

631
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,628
we'll not continue our cooperation.

632
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:45,640
You can rest assured.

633
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,389
I've already thought of a solution.

634
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:49,508
House Design

635
00:34:49,508 --> 00:34:51,909
will definitely work with Su Ying again.

636
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,829
Really? I am looking forward to it.

637
00:35:15,668 --> 00:35:16,584
Mr. Liu.

638
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:18,668
Xuan, come here.

639
00:35:18,668 --> 00:35:19,656
Are you looking for me?

640
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:21,269
Please have a seat.

641
00:35:22,028 --> 00:35:22,984
Come on.

642
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:24,232
Well...

643
00:35:25,228 --> 00:35:26,216
Huixuan.

644
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:29,309
Cola, Sprite, coffee, and tea.

645
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,148
Dear Huixuan,
what would you like to drink?

646
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:33,989
No, thanks.

647
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:35,880
Come on.

648
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:38,269
You don't look well.

649
00:35:38,949 --> 00:35:40,869
I have a spa card.

650
00:35:41,148 --> 00:35:42,309
You can use it for skin care

651
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:44,228
to make your skin elastic.

652
00:35:45,548 --> 00:35:46,548
Please, Mr. Liu.

653
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:47,949
Tell me what I can do for you.

654
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:49,309
Nothing.

655
00:35:49,588 --> 00:35:50,429
Don't be silly.

656
00:35:51,548 --> 00:35:52,456
The first season

657
00:35:52,456 --> 00:35:54,028
of the House Design
has already ended, right?

658
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,469
But we have to maintain this momentum.

659
00:35:56,269 --> 00:35:57,508
There was a poll online before,

660
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,628
making the audience

661
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:01,864
select their favorite design firm
among the six seasons.

662
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,749
So many people suggested
to make a spin-off.

663
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:06,668
A spin-off?

664
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:09,028
Su Ying ranked first.

665
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:11,548
Your good friend is far ahead.

666
00:36:12,148 --> 00:36:14,789
It would be a great chance
to promote her firm.

667
00:36:15,028 --> 00:36:16,708
You need to persuade her to do this.

668
00:36:19,749 --> 00:36:20,708
What are you hesitating for?

669
00:36:21,384 --> 00:36:22,269
What do you say?

670
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:23,389
I can have a try,

671
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:25,108
but I have one condition.

672
00:36:25,508 --> 00:36:27,469
Just let me know.

673
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:29,989
I will decide on the content

674
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:31,628
and format of this spin-off.

675
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:34,989
That's no problem.

676
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:36,328
You can do it.

677
00:36:36,616 --> 00:36:37,608
Great.

678
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:39,869
I made this tea personally.

679
00:36:40,188 --> 00:36:41,068
Do you like it?

680
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:41,989
Well,

681
00:36:41,989 --> 00:36:42,869
I'll get the coffee.

682
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:43,912
Coffee?

683
00:36:45,028 --> 00:36:45,896
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

684
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:47,708
Take a good rest.

685
00:36:51,228 --> 00:36:52,668
Miss Su, the contract

686
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,108
with my client has been processed.

687
00:36:54,228 --> 00:36:55,869
But I found this project

688
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:57,389
is owned
by Tiandi Building Materials Corp.

689
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:58,696
You take a look.

690
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:01,909
Miss Su, Seasons Cafe

691
00:37:02,148 --> 00:37:04,469
is invested by a subsidiary

692
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:05,548
of Tiandi Building.

693
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:08,068
We were told about their background

694
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:09,949
after receiving their contract.

695
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:12,389
So the upper management

696
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:14,508
at Tiandi Building Materials Corp
has a final say.

697
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:22,156
(Tiandi Building Materials Corp
has the final say)

698
00:37:25,188 --> 00:37:26,068
Mingshi,

699
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:29,668
from now on, you deal with all work

700
00:37:30,108 --> 00:37:31,108
related to Tiandi.

701
00:37:31,508 --> 00:37:32,424
Okay.

702
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:36,429
I hope our design draft

703
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:38,028
can be completed within a week,

704
00:37:38,148 --> 00:37:39,548
so we can go on...

705
00:37:40,028 --> 00:37:40,909
Team building.

706
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:42,188
No worries, Miss Su.

707
00:37:42,188 --> 00:37:44,148
We will work harder for that.

708
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,469
Surfing on the ocean
will speed me up at work.

709
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:49,028
Sunshine, beach, we are coming.

710
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:50,824
Good. Go for it.

711
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,429
Guys, surprise.

712
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:56,108
Delicious food.

713
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:58,348
(Director's Office)
Have you been busy recently?

714
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:01,588
Yes, I've been awfully busy.

715
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:04,829
I have an idea.
Do you want to hear it?

716
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:05,704
Go ahead.

717
00:38:06,228 --> 00:38:07,148
House Design

718
00:38:07,148 --> 00:38:09,068
launched a vote

719
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:10,829
for netizens

720
00:38:11,108 --> 00:38:12,829
to vote for the most popular design firm

721
00:38:12,949 --> 00:38:15,668
over the past six seasons.

722
00:38:16,188 --> 00:38:17,949
My firm is always in the first place.

723
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:19,708
Right, so the show team

724
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:21,749
wants to shoot a spin-off

725
00:38:21,909 --> 00:38:23,869
with the top-ranking firms.

726
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:31,869
So, what do you say?

727
00:38:38,628 --> 00:38:39,496
How about this?

728
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:42,536
I agree,

729
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:45,789
but could you give this opportunity

730
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:46,792
to my employees?

731
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:47,949
Let them be seen.

732
00:38:48,749 --> 00:38:49,628
They're really capable.

733
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:51,588
Each of them can handle a case
on their own.

734
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:54,389
Actually, I've considered it.

735
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:55,944
Any recommendations?

736
00:38:57,028 --> 00:38:57,989
Mingshi.

737
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:00,188
Mingshi has grown rapidly recently.

738
00:39:00,508 --> 00:39:02,108
I just handed a big case over to him.

739
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:03,309
I've taught him a lot.

740
00:39:05,736 --> 00:39:08,588
Okay, send his information to me.

741
00:39:08,588 --> 00:39:09,544
Alright, I'll send it later.

742
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,336
I hope we can work well.

743
00:39:11,668 --> 00:39:13,829
As always.

744
00:39:17,148 --> 00:39:18,668
Miss Su, Tian Mei is looking for you.

745
00:39:18,909 --> 00:39:20,840
Tian Mei? What is she doing here?

746
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:24,904
Let her in.

747
00:39:25,148 --> 00:39:26,056
Okay.

748
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:27,508
Come in.

749
00:39:27,508 --> 00:39:28,829
I won't bother you. I'm leaving.

750
00:39:29,068 --> 00:39:30,632
Alright, I'll send it to you later.

751
00:39:35,028 --> 00:39:35,944
Why did Tian Mei come?

752
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:37,000
I don't know.

753
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:43,068
(Garden Road No. 123)
What were you talking about with Ying?

754
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:44,668
We will shoot a spin-off.

755
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:47,789
So, we can collaborate again?

756
00:39:49,028 --> 00:39:50,708
And you will be the leading role.

757
00:39:51,068 --> 00:39:53,188
Me? Really?

758
00:39:53,188 --> 00:39:54,228
Hold on to this chance.

759
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:55,068
Okay.

760
00:39:55,068 --> 00:39:56,008
Go for it.

761
00:39:56,108 --> 00:39:57,064
Go for it.

762
00:39:57,389 --> 00:39:58,312
I'm off, bye.

763
00:39:58,829 --> 00:39:59,720
Bye.

764
00:40:05,508 --> 00:40:07,789
Sorry to interrupt you.

765
00:40:08,628 --> 00:40:09,708
Did I disturb your work?

766
00:40:10,668 --> 00:40:11,560
No.

767
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:13,768
You want me for something?

768
00:40:16,108 --> 00:40:18,309
Actually, I've always wanted

769
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:19,749
to apologize to you in person.

770
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:22,269
I'm less experienced,

771
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:24,228
striving after effect.

772
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,432
That's why the incident happened

773
00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:29,228
and caused you so much trouble.

774
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:30,888
I'm sorry.

775
00:40:32,028 --> 00:40:33,588
You wanted to say this to me

776
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:34,789
at the hospital, right?

777
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:36,949
I should make things clear to you.

778
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:38,989
Okay, I see.

779
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:45,508
Are you here just to tell me that?

780
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:52,789
I want to join your company.

781
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:57,068
I have resigned from Yangfan Studio.

782
00:40:57,909 --> 00:40:58,824
You resigned?

783
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:00,949
When did this happen?

784
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:03,208
This morning.

785
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:11,228
The working style here

786
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:13,588
is different
from that at Yangfan Studio.

787
00:41:14,628 --> 00:41:16,588
It's okay. I will adapt.

788
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:18,152
Honestly,

789
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:20,068
through the work in the House Design,

790
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:22,309
I really admire you.

791
00:41:22,588 --> 00:41:24,588
I also like your design style.

792
00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:25,864
So,

793
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:27,869
if you're willing to give me a chance,

794
00:41:28,628 --> 00:41:29,548
I will work hard

795
00:41:30,028 --> 00:41:31,188
and try to fit into your team.

796
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:41,992
How about this?

797
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:43,304
To be fair,

798
00:41:44,108 --> 00:41:46,269
take this case as your job interview.

799
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:53,429
This is an old house,

800
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:56,269
with a ceiling height of 3.8 meters
and a usable area of 30 square meters.

801
00:41:56,749 --> 00:41:57,640
A family of five people.

802
00:41:58,068 --> 00:41:59,469
The client hopes

803
00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:00,829
that the elderly and children

804
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:03,269
have separate bedrooms
and activity space.

805
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:06,389
What would you do
if you did this job?

806
00:42:06,909 --> 00:42:08,548
I think that when old houses

807
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:09,576
are renovated...

808
00:42:09,576 --> 00:42:11,548
Tian Mei, you don't need
to give me your answer now.

809
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:16,389
What I value more

810
00:42:16,628 --> 00:42:17,829
is the attitude to solve problems.

811
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,328
I'll give you time.
You think about it carefully.

812
00:42:23,548 --> 00:42:25,869
Okay, I will give you a plan
as soon as possible.
