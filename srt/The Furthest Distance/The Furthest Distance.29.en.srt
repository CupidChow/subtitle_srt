I want to show you a video.

18
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:57,786
(House Design)
(Actually, I chose glass)

19
00:01:57,946 --> 00:02:00,747
(as the main material of this house
for another important reason.)

20
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:05,907
(I want to achieve the best effect
in the shortest possible time.)

21
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:09,706
(It's also
to fulfill the wish of my client.)

22
00:02:13,907 --> 00:02:15,747
In fact, before the construction,

23
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:18,946
Mi Su's health was
already deteriorating.

24
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:20,747
In order to...

25
00:02:21,986 --> 00:02:23,506
To let Mi Su move in
as soon as possible，

26
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:26,147
Su Ying chose glass as the material.

27
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:30,627
But this choice
was questioned by many people.

28
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:32,907
But she never thought of asking

29
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,427
us to explain for her.

30
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:36,786
She bore all the burdens herself.

31
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:48,307
Actually, Yisen has talked a lot to me.

32
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:51,826
I also have thought a lot.

33
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,226
I did many things
that hurt you and Su Ying before.

34
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:57,986
I truly

35
00:02:59,106 --> 00:03:00,627
feel sorry for you.

36
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:06,266
I will gradually let go of it.

37
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:12,187
There's another question

38
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:13,826
I want to ask you.

39
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:18,747
Are your feelings for me
out of your intention

40
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:21,307
or some kind of obsession?

41
00:03:26,187 --> 00:03:27,307
Since your birth,

42
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:30,587
you have always been
healthier than Mi Su.

43
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,067
You were often joked

44
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:35,427
that it was because
you took away her nutrition.

45
00:03:36,706 --> 00:03:38,187
So, you naturally feel

46
00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:40,706
you need to do some things for her,

47
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:43,467
even including relationships.

48
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:47,106
But what about you?

49
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:50,386
Is this really what you want?

50
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:56,187
Is this really what Mi Su wanted to see?

51
00:03:57,576 --> 00:04:02,786
♪Passing by and letting go,
leaving behind empty expectations♪

52
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:04,907
I've always felt
that Mi Su left with regrets.

53
00:04:05,826 --> 00:04:08,147
So, I thought about
fulfilling her wishes.

54
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:11,506
Until later someone told me

55
00:04:13,027 --> 00:04:14,786
the meaning behind her true wish.

56
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:18,946
Mi Su made a lot of wishes.

57
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:21,747
But in fact, she only had one wish.

58
00:04:24,826 --> 00:04:26,266
She hoped you can be happy.

59
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:30,146
Because she believed love
can make people happy.

60
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:32,307
No matter whether she was by your side,

61
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,826
she hoped you'd always be happy.

62
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:42,547
Actually, Mi Su wanted me to be happy.

63
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:44,466
Similarly,

64
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:46,586
your sister

65
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:48,826
also hoped that you'd be happy.

00:04:57,307 --> 00:04:59,266
After Mi Su left, we were all very sad.

69
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:01,826
But you are not a substitute for her.

70
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:05,187
Both of us need to step

71
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,427
out of her shadow.

75
00:05:20,227 --> 00:05:20,867
Thank you.

76
00:05:22,946 --> 00:05:23,547
I believe

77
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,386
you will surely find your own happiness.

78
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,867
I have made some adjustments here.
Please have a check.

79
00:05:42,747 --> 00:05:43,667
I am sorry.

80
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:46,187
It's okay. You are just
being responsible for your work.

81
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:47,747
Kindly have a look.

82
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:51,026
Why hasn't the project leader, Dr. Mi,

83
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:52,627
arrived yet?

84
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:53,586
Yeah.

85
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,466
I have already notified her of the time.

86
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:56,706
Why is she still late?

87
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:58,187
In my opinion,

88
00:05:58,427 --> 00:05:59,346
such a large project

89
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:01,547
shouldn't be handed over
to young people.

90
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:03,346
Is she experienced?

91
00:06:03,787 --> 00:06:04,506
Is she capable?

92
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:06,946
I haven't seen her showing
much ability in the past.

93
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:08,747
If it weren't for her father,

94
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,187
would she get the project?

95
00:06:10,346 --> 00:06:10,867
Exactly.

96
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:12,466
Launching the welfare project

97
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,867
is doing the right thing
for the hospital.

98
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:18,107
Isn't that improper to say

99
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:20,026
young people lack ability?

100
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:31,586
Sorry, everyone.

101
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:32,627
I'm late.

102
00:06:33,787 --> 00:06:34,627
I've made adjustments.

103
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:39,026
Let's start.

104
00:06:54,307 --> 00:06:54,987
Sorry.

105
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:02,266
Are you saying

106
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:03,906
the thing that day?

107
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:07,146
Not entirely.

108
00:07:08,307 --> 00:07:09,427
For the harm

109
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:11,867
and misunderstandings
I've caused you these days.

110
00:07:16,346 --> 00:07:18,627
Yunsheng told me a lot about you.

111
00:07:20,946 --> 00:07:22,146
I just learned

112
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:24,987
that you also put in a lot of efforts

113
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,146
for my sister's project.

114
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:30,547
I should have thanked you,

115
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:32,466
but I...

116
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:34,427
It is my responsibility.

117
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:36,026
It's nothing.

118
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:45,307
In fact, I have been thinking a lot
during this period.

119
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:47,906
Since I came back, I have always been
prejudiced against you.

120
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:51,466
So, I have never

121
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,146
really tried to understand you,

122
00:07:54,826 --> 00:07:56,706
nor get to know you properly.

123
00:07:57,826 --> 00:07:58,307
Of course,

124
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:00,187
although I'm telling you these today,

125
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:02,427
I don't expect forgiveness from you.

126
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:04,946
But I still feel like

127
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:07,427
I should express my apologies to you.

128
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,346
We are getting to know each other
all over again.

129
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:28,506
I'll meet Yang Zhengwen.

130
00:08:29,146 --> 00:08:29,826
See you next time.

131
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:31,906
Thanks.

132
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:33,626
Hold on.

133
00:08:34,586 --> 00:08:36,427
Yang Zhengwen
from Tiandi Building Materials Corp?

134
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:41,547
I had a chat with Tian Mei this morning.

135
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:43,427
I think I need to tell you something.

136
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:03,336
Have you checked?

137
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:05,267
So, what do you think?

138
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:14,088
Live here alone?

139
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:15,307
Or a club or something?

140
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:20,027
I haven't decided yet.

141
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:22,507
But

142
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:24,067
no matter what,

143
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:27,346
I hope you can design it yourself.

144
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:28,787
Why?

145
00:09:31,706 --> 00:09:32,346
Because

146
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,307
the meaning of this house is

147
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:35,986
a bit different.

148
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,667
When we were together,

149
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:42,027
I had checked this house here.

150
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:45,106
You said you liked to see the sunrise.

151
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:50,387
You can see it from here.

152
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:53,027
A very beautiful sunrise.

153
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:57,626
It was a pity that I couldn't afford it.

154
00:09:58,466 --> 00:09:59,387
It's been so many years

155
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:02,427
and we're not who we were.

156
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:06,986
But you have always been
my greatest regret.

157
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:10,507
So I bought it later to give it to you.

158
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:13,466
I hope you will give me a chance

159
00:10:15,986 --> 00:10:17,187
to make up for this regret.

160
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:29,027
Yang Zhengwen.

161
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:31,667
What do you mean by that?

162
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:32,986
Are feelings something

163
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,267
you can summon and dismiss at will?

164
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:38,427
Don't you find it ridiculous
to win affection desperately

165
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:39,586
by hurting others?

166
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:41,586
Love is not your business.

167
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:44,226
Relying solely on schemes
will make you lose everything.

168
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:47,027
If you continue like this,
you will never deserve real love.

169
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:49,946
We are no longer possible.

170
00:10:51,626 --> 00:10:53,267
Even if I wasn't with Qin Yunsheng,

171
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:55,106
we couldn't be together anymore.
Do you understand?

172
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:58,626
If you asked me here

173
00:10:58,706 --> 00:11:00,187
just to say these words to me,

174
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:01,667
I'll leave now.

175
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,307
Is Qin Yunsheng that good?

176
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:07,626
Yes, he really is good.

177
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:11,387
He made me realize
that true love leaves no traces.

178
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,787
Even though he is not by my side,

179
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:15,907
as soon as I think of him,

180
00:11:16,746 --> 00:11:18,466
I feel secure

181
00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:19,387
and warm.

182
00:11:22,027 --> 00:11:23,346
He made me feel this way.

183
00:11:24,346 --> 00:11:25,427
I'm grateful to have met him.

184
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:30,226
Also,

185
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:32,667
I know what you've done

186
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:34,147
by using Mi Bai and Tian Mei.

187
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:37,667
Qin Yunsheng

188
00:11:38,226 --> 00:11:40,307
never uses his contributions to me

189
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:41,826
as a bargaining chip for love.

190
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:47,907
No matter what,

191
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:50,267
I thank you for having helped me.

192
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:52,746
I'll design this house for you for free,

193
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:55,507
as my final blessing to you.

194
00:11:58,466 --> 00:11:59,547
Let's not meet again.

195
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:01,667
Take care.

196
00:12:32,187 --> 00:12:33,027
(After work today,)

197
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:34,547
(can you come to the glass house?)

198
00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:07,067
Do you need me?

199
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:10,307
I donated the glass house
to Meichi Hospital.

200
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:12,626
As a recovery house for patients.

201
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:13,507
It was donated?

202
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:18,387
Then, where will you live?

203
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:19,866
Back to the dormitory?

204
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:22,946
I'm going abroad.

205
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:28,147
When I am abroad,
it will be empty anyway.

206
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:30,746
So, I want to put it into use.

207
00:13:31,826 --> 00:13:32,586
So...

208
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:34,866
You decided to go abroad?

209
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:38,147
I think you are right.

210
00:13:39,547 --> 00:13:41,067
People should follow their hearts.

211
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:43,826
Right.

212
00:13:44,746 --> 00:13:45,586
Follow the heart.

213
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:50,466
After all, this opportunity

214
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:51,946
is indeed a rare one for me.

215
00:13:55,226 --> 00:13:56,267
You're happy for me, right?

216
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:01,706
Really?

217
00:14:03,547 --> 00:14:04,187
Of course.

218
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:13,387
There are still some procedures
and documents for the glass house.

219
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:16,346
Can I entrust them to you?

220
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:18,226
Sure.

221
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:20,387
I'll do it.

222
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,187
When I'm not around,

223
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:25,826
could you come by more

224
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:26,946
and help take care of it?

225
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:28,907
No problem.

226
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:38,147
Auntie will be discharged from
hospital tomorrow?

227
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:38,986
Yes.

228
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:40,626
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:42,787
I might not be able to pick her up.

230
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:45,907
It's okay. Go back to your work.

231
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:47,226
Huixuan will go with me.

232
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:51,746
When will you leave?

233
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:53,067
I'll see you off.

234
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:54,787
No need.

235
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:02,866
It's pretty much it.

236
00:15:05,547 --> 00:15:06,307
I will leave now.

237
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:10,507
Well...

238
00:15:16,226 --> 00:15:16,946
Three years, right?

239
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:27,226
Take care.

240
00:15:34,907 --> 00:15:35,427
Take care.

241
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,432
(Cardiology & Angiocardiopathy
Outpatient Hall)

242
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:31,067
Please come in.

243
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:33,466
Yisen.

244
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:39,866
How's it? Have you finished packing up?

245
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:41,787
Almost done.

246
00:16:42,986 --> 00:16:44,787
Is there anything else
I can get for you?

247
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:46,667
No, thanks.
I can buy it when I get back.

248
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:48,907
That's good.

249
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:52,226
Bai,

250
00:16:53,427 --> 00:16:54,267
I have a gift for you.

251
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:56,626
A thermos.

252
00:16:57,106 --> 00:16:58,946
Drink more water when you're there.

253
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:00,187
Take care of yourself.

254
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:01,787
Thank you, Yisen.

255
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:08,866
What's the matter?

256
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,186
Bai,

257
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,906
when you're there,

258
00:17:16,027 --> 00:17:18,067
I hope you can really
let go of everything,

259
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:19,747
and start a new life.

260
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:23,626
I know in these years,

261
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:25,547
because of Mi Su's illness,

262
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:29,186
everyone might have devoted
more attention to her

263
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:30,186
and neglected you.

264
00:17:31,106 --> 00:17:32,707
But there will always be someone

265
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,747
who cares more about and values you.

266
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:37,507
If you can be a little less persistent

267
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:38,947
and look around,

268
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:41,507
you will find that in this world,

269
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,227
there are many people and things
worth paying attention to.

270
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:46,906
Bai,

271
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:50,307
you should have a new life of your own.

272
00:17:56,307 --> 00:17:57,787
All people should find

273
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:00,067
what is worth their attention.

274
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:02,987
Yisen.

275
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:04,866
I hope

276
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:06,787
you can find

277
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:08,626
your own life.

278
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:11,346
For me,

279
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:14,346
you will always be my good senior

280
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:15,987
and good friend.

281
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:19,826
I don't want these

282
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,426
to change because of some things.

283
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:29,346
It's okay.

284
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:31,106
No matter what our relationship is,

285
00:18:31,626 --> 00:18:33,507
I will always be
the most reliable person behind you.

286
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:34,947
If anything happens there,

287
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:36,267
call me immediately.

288
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:39,146
If anyone bullies you, I will go there
and deal with them immediately.

289
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:40,307
Go to bed early.

290
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:41,547
Safe trip.

291
00:18:42,227 --> 00:18:42,947
Yisen.

292
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:46,426
Thank you.

293
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:56,067
Welcome home, Mrs. Zhou.

294
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,467
Home is always the best.

295
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,386
I really couldn't bear
to stay in the hospital.

296
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,866
As soon as you're home,
you look better.

297
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:02,386
Really?

298
00:19:03,507 --> 00:19:04,186
Yes, Auntie.

299
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:07,067
Moreover, the doctor said
the operation is very successful.

300
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:07,866
Don't worry.

301
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:10,186
Just rest at home for this period.

302
00:19:10,586 --> 00:19:11,987
I really appreciate your help.

303
00:19:12,146 --> 00:19:13,426
(Zhang Yisen)
Sorry for the trouble.

304
00:19:13,547 --> 00:19:14,906
Don't say that.
Su is my good friend.

305
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:15,826
It's nothing.

306
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:17,386
Thank you.

307
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:18,866
Hello, Dr. Zhang.

308
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:19,747
Su Ying,

309
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:21,186
I have something to tell you.

310
00:19:21,586 --> 00:19:22,586
Yunsheng's flight is today.

311
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:23,947
He will be gone for years.

312
00:19:24,826 --> 00:19:26,146
He told me that he misses you.

313
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:27,426
He didn't want to leave you.

314
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,027
But you didn't keep him.

315
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,106
I think since you two
were so good before.

316
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:33,067
Even if you've broken up,
at least see him off.

317
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:34,504
You should come now.

318
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:36,186
Hello? Hello?

319
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:38,027
What's wrong, Su?

320
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:43,346
Qin Yunsheng is going to the airport.

321
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:44,826
Why are you standing there?

322
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:45,826
Chase him.

323
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:46,987
I'm afraid after he leaves,

324
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:48,826
he won't be back for a while.

325
00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:50,787
Su.

326
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:52,906
Hurry up and send Qin off.

327
00:20:15,586 --> 00:20:16,707
How could you drive like this?

328
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:17,947
Scratched so much.

329
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:19,186
Enough.

330
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:20,106
The insurance won't cover it.

331
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:22,307
What does your sudden change
have to do with me? Your fault.

332
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,666
He just can't drive.
Let me tell you.

333
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:26,586
Hello. A traffic accident ahead.
Please detour.

334
00:20:27,987 --> 00:20:28,626
Okay. Thank you.

335
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:39,547
Once you've made up your mind,

336
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:40,666
there's no turning back.

337
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:46,826
Yisen, I'm leaving now.

338
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:52,987
Get in the car.

339
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:16,267
Where is Yunsheng?

340
00:21:16,507 --> 00:21:17,267
He's already left.

341
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:24,547
It's okay.

342
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:26,267
He's not gone forever.

343
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:48,547
You are back.

344
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:52,307
How did it go?

345
00:21:56,186 --> 00:21:57,067
Did you see Qin?

346
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:00,186
I didn't make it.

347
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,866
It's okay, Mother.

348
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:07,186
Career is important.

349
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:08,467
Besides,

350
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:10,186
it's just going abroad.

351
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:11,426
We are all on the Earth.

352
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:12,747
Don't worry. It's okay.

353
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:14,547
How could I not worry?

354
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:16,386
I know you.

355
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:18,106
You keep everything to yourself.

356
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:18,906
Look at you.

357
00:22:19,426 --> 00:22:20,626
I'm really fine, Mother.

358
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:21,987
I'll go rest.

359
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:22,866
It's okay.

360
00:23:06,826 --> 00:23:08,346
Do you have
a lot of rumored girlfriends?

361
00:23:11,586 --> 00:23:12,906

You couldn't even hide it.

Even kids can tell.

366
00:23:26,386 --> 00:23:27,368

00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:09,160
♪I want to get close to you♪

375
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,264
♪Even if you are far from me♪

376
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:16,826
I love glass

377
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:19,307
because it is transparent and pure.

378
00:24:19,747 --> 00:24:21,747
It allows more sunlight
to get into the room.

379
00:24:22,507 --> 00:24:23,906
It's bright and healing.

380
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:26,267
Here,

381
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:28,787
I want to thank the glass house again.

382
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:32,146
(Because it let me meet a person.)

383
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:34,547
(He is warm and determined,)

384
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,386
(like sunlight)

385
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:38,866
(shining into my heart.)

386
00:24:49,672 --> 00:24:54,728
♪It's you♪

387
00:25:05,866 --> 00:25:06,826
So...

388
00:25:10,507 --> 00:25:11,987
In the end, Ying

389
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,467
did not meet Dr. Qin.

390
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:19,947
Then,

391
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:22,547
how is she?

392
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:27,866
She must be quite upset
as she failed to meet Dr. Qin.

393
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,826
So, she still likes Dr. Qin.

394
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:34,507
It's okay.

395
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:36,067
This is

396
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:38,186
not a bad thing.

397
00:25:40,987 --> 00:25:41,586
Why?

398
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:43,146
Look at this.

399
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:46,707
After the separation,

400
00:25:47,186 --> 00:25:49,987
she can truly know her inner thoughts.

401
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:54,307
So what? He is gone.

402
00:25:55,626 --> 00:25:57,787
Dr. Qin is just studying abroad
for a period of time.

403
00:25:57,947 --> 00:25:58,747
He'll be back.

404
00:25:58,906 --> 00:26:00,307
There will be a chance
when he comes back.

405
00:26:00,547 --> 00:26:01,787
You make it sound so simple.

406
00:26:01,906 --> 00:26:03,747
Studying abroad for a period of time?

407
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:05,467
He is going abroad for three years.

408
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,346
Mi Bai is also by his side.

409
00:26:07,426 --> 00:26:09,626
She is eyeing him all the time.

410
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:11,707
Who knows what will happen
after three years?

411
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,826
I guarantee this to you.

412
00:26:13,987 --> 00:26:15,586
Dr. Qin can't be that kind of person.

413
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:19,987
And it would not possibly
escalate to this extent.

414
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:22,947
How can you be so sure?

415
00:26:24,947 --> 00:26:29,146
After so many years
of interaction with Ying,

416
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:30,707
I understand her.

417
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:32,987
And I also understand Dr. Qin.

418
00:26:33,346 --> 00:26:34,747
So,

419
00:26:34,947 --> 00:26:36,186
they can't

420
00:26:36,586 --> 00:26:37,586
just be separated like that.

421
00:26:37,787 --> 00:26:38,906
I am sure.

422
00:26:39,386 --> 00:26:39,906
Impossible.

423
00:26:40,936 --> 00:26:42,696
(Dr. Qin)

424
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:45,467
Dr. Qin?

425
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:46,707
Fraud.

426
00:26:47,747 --> 00:26:49,866
How could Dr. Qin call you?

427
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:51,067
That's not right.

428
00:26:51,747 --> 00:26:53,227
Isn't he supposed to be
in Germany right now?

429
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:55,666
What's going on?

430
00:26:57,787 --> 00:26:58,987
It's Dr. Qin.

431
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:01,346
But not the one we know.

432
00:27:02,346 --> 00:27:03,666
Well...

433
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:05,906
A few days ago, I had tooth decay.

434
00:27:06,106 --> 00:27:07,346
Then I went to see a doctor.

435
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:09,467
Interestingly,
the doctor's surname is also Qin.

436
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:10,747
Qin Zhigang?

437
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:11,267
Really?

438
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:12,787
Yes. I'll introduce you to him.

439
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:14,146
No. I'll take the call now.

440
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:14,666
Don't.

441
00:27:16,146 --> 00:27:16,906
Tell the truth.

442
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:21,666
Yes, it's Dr. Qin.

443
00:27:22,227 --> 00:27:24,186
He didn't leave.

444
00:27:25,987 --> 00:27:28,666
Actually, Dr. Qin just wanted to
create an illusion of going abroad.

445
00:27:29,507 --> 00:27:30,386
So that Ying

446
00:27:30,987 --> 00:27:32,947
can really know her inner thoughts.

447
00:28:00,106 --> 00:28:00,866
I'm exhausted.

448
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,866
It's the first time I've seen

449
00:28:04,426 --> 00:28:06,947
Ying chasing you.

450
00:28:16,307 --> 00:28:17,547
Are you really going abroad?

451
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:18,826
What about Su Ying?

452
00:28:19,707 --> 00:28:20,426
I refused.

453
00:28:23,547 --> 00:28:24,626
Compared to studying abroad,

454
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:26,826
the welfare hospital here needs me more.

455
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:29,987
There is another important reason.

456
00:28:31,707 --> 00:28:32,787
I won't leave Su Ying.

457
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:37,106
How was it?
Did you have a good chat with Ying?

458
00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:41,906
I think

459
00:28:42,626 --> 00:28:44,947
she might be afraid
of affecting your career,

460
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:46,346
so she never gave in

461
00:28:46,426 --> 00:28:47,386
to get back to you.

462
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,826
Then why is she so sure
that I'm willing to go abroad?

463
00:28:51,787 --> 00:28:53,626
At least ask about
my thoughts and feelings, right?

464
00:28:53,947 --> 00:28:55,426
She's afraid

465
00:28:55,987 --> 00:28:57,947
that she'll affect your career.

466
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:01,346
I think Ying wants to keep you for sure.

467
00:29:01,747 --> 00:29:03,906
But she doesn't know
how to ask you to stay.

468
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:05,267
She also has a hard time.

469
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:08,666
But do you know?

470
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:11,146
You are actually very important

471
00:29:11,707 --> 00:29:13,106
to Ying.

472
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:17,987
She used to dare to love
and value the present.

473
00:29:18,547 --> 00:29:20,547
She never considered
the future in relationships.

474
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,826
But after she met you,

475
00:29:23,307 --> 00:29:25,027
it's clear she cares about you a lot.

476
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:33,186
She was lying just now.

477
00:29:34,426 --> 00:29:35,346
What she said just now

478
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:37,866
is not what she meant.

479
00:29:38,227 --> 00:29:40,507
So what are you planning to do?

480
00:29:43,586 --> 00:29:44,067
Director,

481
00:29:44,626 --> 00:29:47,027
studying abroad
does help a lot for promotion,

482
00:29:47,906 --> 00:29:49,666
I want to devote more energy

483
00:29:50,787 --> 00:29:51,826
to the rural welfare hospital.

484
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:53,267
No regrets?

485
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,186
No.

486
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:59,816
(Disagree)

487
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:03,227
Yunsheng.

488
00:30:04,507 --> 00:30:05,747
I am proud of you.

489
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:07,626
Have you decided?

490
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:10,547
Compared with studying,

491
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:12,626
the rural welfare hospital
needs me more.

492
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:15,866
Once you decide,

493
00:30:16,386 --> 00:30:17,467
there's no turning back.

494
00:30:18,227 --> 00:30:18,666
Yeah.

495
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:20,467
Goodbye.

496
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:38,866
Actually,

497
00:30:39,027 --> 00:30:40,747
Ying is just
used to being strong-willed.

498
00:30:41,146 --> 00:30:41,666
This time,

499
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:43,866
she must be made to
understand her inner self better.

500
00:30:44,227 --> 00:30:45,707
You must keep it a secret.

501
00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:46,747
Don't worry.

502
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:49,826
My secret love for such a long time
is not worth nothing.

503
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:00,586
So...

504
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:03,866
What we are doing
is really for Ying's own good.

505
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:06,866
We wanted to help her
to get out of the constraint sooner,

506
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:08,947
and understand her inner self better.

507
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,467
I hope they can make up.

508
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:11,547
So, I didn't...

509
00:31:12,267 --> 00:31:12,747
It's not

510
00:31:13,227 --> 00:31:14,067
I didn't tell you.

511
00:31:14,547 --> 00:31:15,386
Don't be angry.

512
00:31:15,386 --> 00:31:17,547
Why didn't you
tell me about this earlier?

513
00:31:17,866 --> 00:31:18,547
I am wrong.

514
00:31:18,906 --> 00:31:20,106
I can help you guys.

515
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:21,947
Help me?

516
00:31:22,426 --> 00:31:23,666
I know Su so well.

517
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:25,866
We can have a perfect plan,

518
00:31:26,307 --> 00:31:28,146
and make a specific plan.

519
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:31,787
I am the director of this story, okay?

520
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:34,307
Alright.

521
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:35,707
Assembly?

522
00:31:39,426 --> 00:31:39,906
Stop.

523
00:31:41,227 --> 00:31:41,666
Everyone,

524
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,307
I call you here

525
00:31:43,547 --> 00:31:44,106
because

526
00:31:44,386 --> 00:31:45,346
we want to save the love

527
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:46,906
between Qin Yunsheng and Su.

528
00:31:47,227 --> 00:31:47,947
So this time,

529
00:31:48,227 --> 00:31:49,507
I must invite you

530
00:31:49,906 --> 00:31:51,067
to help me, cooperate with me,

531
00:31:51,547 --> 00:31:52,267
and assist me.

532
00:31:52,707 --> 00:31:53,386
- Okay.
- Okay.

533
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:53,987
Sure.

534
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:55,906
I have already informed Mrs. Zhou.

535
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:56,826
She told me

536
00:31:56,947 --> 00:31:59,426
Su will accompany her to Meichi Hospital
to get medicine tomorrow.

537
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:01,787
There are some points

538
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:03,707
I must share with you.

539
00:32:04,346 --> 00:32:07,426
Meichi Hospital is a very special place,

540
00:32:07,787 --> 00:32:08,866
because there are

541
00:32:09,106 --> 00:32:10,747
many memories of Dr. Qin and Su.

542
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,186
So when Su goes to
get the medicine tomorrow,

543
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:16,106
it will inevitably bring her
back to the old days.

544
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,467
We must take advantage of this chance.

545
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:19,267
Understood.

546
00:32:19,586 --> 00:32:20,267
- Okay.
- Sure.

547
00:32:21,346 --> 00:32:22,666
But there are also many risks

548
00:32:23,146 --> 00:32:24,947
in the process.

549
00:32:25,787 --> 00:32:26,346
Firstly,

550
00:32:27,106 --> 00:32:29,067
for Dr. Qin's usual hangouts,

551
00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:30,987
(Save-the-Love Plan)
if Su goes there,

552
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:32,507
arrange it in advance.

553
00:32:33,227 --> 00:32:35,227
The key areas include

554
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:37,267
the cardiac surgery office
and the operating room.

555
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:38,906
Director Ruan,

556
00:32:39,507 --> 00:32:41,067
this is your place.
You are in charge.

557
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:43,464
Yes, Director.

558
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:45,267
Secondly,

559
00:32:46,146 --> 00:32:47,146
we must avoid Su

560
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,426
running into those people

561
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:50,307
who are not in the loop.

562
00:32:50,787 --> 00:32:52,146
Otherwise, they will spill the beans.

563
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:53,866
Chen and Ye.

564
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:54,664
- Yes.
- Yes.

565
00:32:55,027 --> 00:32:57,866
Stay at the company. Standby.

566
00:32:57,928 --> 00:32:59,186
- Okay.
- We three King Kong.

567
00:32:59,466 --> 00:33:00,552
We'll fully cooperate with you.

568
00:33:00,847 --> 00:33:02,027
You have your own task.

569
00:33:03,386 --> 00:33:04,906
After Su leaves the hospital,

570
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,866
we do not know
what her trajectory will be.

571
00:33:07,227 --> 00:33:09,186
There is no way
to arrange it in advance.

572
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:10,507
So, Mingshi,

573
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,186
you have to cooperate with me.

574
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:13,507
Be flexible.

575
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:15,346
Rest assured. I'll always be with you.

576
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:16,346
Alright.

577
00:33:17,027 --> 00:33:19,307
Lastly, let me remind you

578
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,027
that the great show

579
00:33:21,106 --> 00:33:23,106
doesn't give us any chance of rewinding.

580
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:24,626
So we must

581
00:33:25,146 --> 00:33:26,067
be careful and cautious.

582
00:33:26,386 --> 00:33:27,227
Always keep in touch.

583
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,626
No mistakes.

584
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:29,386
- Okay.
- Okay.

585
00:33:30,027 --> 00:33:31,666
In the end, for their happiness,

586
00:33:31,947 --> 00:33:32,386
cheers.

587
00:33:32,906 --> 00:33:33,666
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

588
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:34,346
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

589
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:34,787
Come on.

590
00:33:34,906 --> 00:33:36,186
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

591
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:41,747
The medicine.

592
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:49,386
Did you forget

593
00:33:49,507 --> 00:33:50,826
we need to stick to the plan?

594
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:52,346
Don't say too much.

595
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:53,386
Leave her alone.

596
00:33:53,386 --> 00:33:54,346
Okay. You are right.

597
00:33:54,747 --> 00:33:55,307
Thank you.

598
00:34:16,507 --> 00:34:17,067
Dr. Qin,

599
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:18,467
buying coffee?

600
00:34:19,347 --> 00:34:19,867
I am done.

601
00:34:20,427 --> 00:34:20,867
See you.

602
00:34:20,947 --> 00:34:21,507
I have to go.

603
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:25,666
Su Ying?

604
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:31,626
Dr. Zhang.

605
00:34:32,226 --> 00:34:32,867
Why did you come?

606
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:35,186
I came here to get
medicine for my mother.

607
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:36,746
Mrs. Zhou is here.

608
00:34:37,626 --> 00:34:38,306
I'll leave you.

609
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:39,027
See you.

610
00:34:39,987 --> 00:34:40,467
Bye.

611
00:34:51,586 --> 00:34:52,626
Let's add each other on WeChat.

612
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:01,507
(Garden Road No.123)
Give me all the projects we have.

613
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,306
What's happening?

614
00:35:05,106 --> 00:35:05,586
Ying,

615
00:35:05,947 --> 00:35:08,146
these are all the materials
for the project.

616
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:08,706
All here.

617
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:10,467
Okay. Put them here. You can leave now.

618
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:15,146
Why are you drinking coffee again?

619
00:35:15,467 --> 00:35:16,987
Didn't Dr. Qin tell you not to drink it?

620
00:35:26,387 --> 00:35:28,106
I enjoy coffee now.

621
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:29,827
Coffee is good.

622
00:35:30,067 --> 00:35:31,626
E-Enjoy.

623
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:40,987
It's not good for your stomach.

624
00:35:45,586 --> 00:35:47,347
Why is Ying wearing sunglasses at work?

625
00:35:47,706 --> 00:35:48,947
Something is not right.

626
00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:50,666
I think so too.

627
00:35:50,947 --> 00:35:52,947
I reckon she was just
thinking about Dr. Qin

628
00:35:53,146 --> 00:35:54,146
and cried last night.

629
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:55,226
You go and ask.

630
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:57,626
I-I'm not going.

631
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:58,467
Mingshi, you go.

632
00:35:58,987 --> 00:35:59,867
I'm not going.

633
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:01,547
Didn't you see her expression just now?

634
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:02,947
She nearly ate me alive.

635
00:36:03,186 --> 00:36:03,666
You go.

636
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:05,146
Me?

637
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:06,867
Yes, you go.

638
00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:08,827
Brothers, I'm leaving.

639
00:36:08,987 --> 00:36:09,647
- Go for it.
- Go for it.

640
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:12,827
Ying, this is the floor plan of
the Jiang Dong project.

641
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:14,786
I've made adjustments
to the door frame. Take a look.

642
00:36:18,146 --> 00:36:19,427
Why an inward-opening door?

643
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,106
We can't make inward-opening doors.

644
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:21,947
It's inconvenient.

645
00:36:22,226 --> 00:36:24,666
Ying, why are your eyes so swollen?

646
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:28,867
I-I used an eye cream last night
and had an allergic reaction.

647
00:36:29,027 --> 00:36:29,987
Allergic reaction.

648
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:31,106
It's fine.

649
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:32,666
You should leave now.

650
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:33,626
I'll take a look.

651
00:36:34,706 --> 00:36:36,626
Ying, you can't use the eye cream again.

652
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:39,706
No. I've already thrown it away.

653
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:53,347
Why are you here?

654
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:55,347
Late-night snacks.

655
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:01,027
What did you bring me?

656
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:04,706
Your favorite wontons.

657
00:37:05,226 --> 00:37:08,306
Mingshi said you've been working nonstop
and haven't had time to eat.

658
00:37:08,586 --> 00:37:10,146
Even if you want to distract yourself,

659
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:12,226
please don't ruin your health.

660
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:14,867
If you have stomachache again,

661
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:16,507
there's no more Dr. Qin...

662
00:37:19,427 --> 00:37:20,666
Mrs. Zhou will worry about you.

663
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:23,867
I know. I'll eat.

664
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:25,947
Love makes people nag.

665
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:28,306
I miss the days
when you are cold and ruthless.

666
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:29,666
Just dig in.

667
00:37:31,186 --> 00:37:31,907
It smells so good.

668
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:38,146
How is it?

669
00:37:44,106 --> 00:37:44,706
What's the matter?

670
00:37:50,706 --> 00:37:51,746
It has special taste.

671
00:37:53,027 --> 00:37:53,706
What?

672
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,266
It hasn't gone off, right?

673
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:58,827
I just had this packed. It's still warm.

674
00:37:59,467 --> 00:37:59,907
No.

675
00:38:01,706 --> 00:38:03,226
Is this from the Jixiang restaurant?

676
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:06,146
Why do I feel
as if Qin Yunsheng made it?

677
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,867
Could it be

678
00:38:12,507 --> 00:38:14,106
that you miss Dr. Qin so much

679
00:38:14,547 --> 00:38:16,507
that you're hallucinating?

680
00:38:17,907 --> 00:38:19,226
How is that possible?

681
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,947
Is it delicious?

682
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:32,867
You made it?

683
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:33,907

Yunsheng applied for donation

703
00:40:26,387 --> 00:40:27,507
for the glass house.

704
00:40:27,786 --> 00:40:29,186
We're here to finalize the handover.

705
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:30,786
Alright. Give me a moment, please.

706
00:40:33,427 --> 00:40:35,106
All files of the glass house,

707
00:40:35,106 --> 00:40:37,027
including construction blueprint
and design planning.

708
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:37,427
Look.

709
00:40:37,427 --> 00:40:37,666
Okay.

710
00:40:38,306 --> 00:40:40,146
Su Ying, could you please sign here?

711
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:40,867
Okay.

713
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:49,746
Thank you, Su Ying.

714
00:40:50,106 --> 00:40:50,706
Alright, Su Ying.

715
00:40:50,786 --> 00:40:51,387

00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,186
Goodbye.

719
00:41:07,347 --> 00:41:07,987
Su Ying.

720
00:41:09,706 --> 00:41:10,666
You've broken up already.

721
00:41:10,987 --> 00:41:11,907
He left.

722
00:41:12,786 --> 00:41:14,226
You need to pull yourself together.

723
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:20,347
Mingshi,

724
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:21,427
I want to sing tonight.

725
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:22,987
Reserve a room. I will throw a party.

726
00:41:23,186 --> 00:41:23,944
Let's have a party.

727
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:35,306
What's the matter?

728
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:36,586
Hello, Ying.

729
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:39,306
The karaoke rooms are fully booked.

730
00:41:39,907 --> 00:41:41,306
How about we

731
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,626
meet at Piyixia?

732
00:41:42,827 --> 00:41:43,706
The usual place.

733
00:41:46,387 --> 00:41:47,306
Ying,

734
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,947
Piyixia is spacious and lively.

735
00:41:49,987 --> 00:41:51,827
Don't worry. I will invite more people.

736
00:41:52,146 --> 00:41:54,266
I promise the party
will be lively and entertaining.

737
00:41:56,907 --> 00:41:57,466
Alright.

738
00:41:58,067 --> 00:41:58,427
See you.

739
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:00,507
Okay. Deal.

740
00:42:00,987 --> 00:42:01,467
Bye.

00:42:12,586 --> 00:42:13,146
She comes.

743
00:42:13,467 --> 00:42:13,827
Su.

744
00:42:14,106 --> 00:42:14,867
I am here!

745
00:42:17,507 --> 00:42:18,867
Director, Ms. Han, you both are here.

746
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:19,827
Su, let's enjoy.

747
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:20,947
We ran into them.

748
00:42:21,027 --> 00:42:22,226
