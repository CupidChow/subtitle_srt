=Episode 3=

17
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:46,831
To attract attention,
he maliciously edited the content.

18
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:47,590
And he told me

19
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,471
to create suspense in stories.

20
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,911
He also showed me
the viewer ratings curve.

21
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,191
Anyway,

22
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,590
I am so embarrassed.

23
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:56,391
If you're not okay with it,

24
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:57,590
you can sue the show team.

25
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,831
On this issue,

26
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,111
I'll stand by your side.

27
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,590
Okay, don't be mad.

28
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,031
Obviously,

29
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,430
it's a malicious clip.

30
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:08,710
If I sue him,

31
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,111
it will increase his exposure.

32
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,190
Can you let it go?

33
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,750
It's okay for suspense.

34
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,430
It's good for the show effect.

35
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:19,071
After the full episode is released,

36
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,030
there will be a reversal.

37
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:21,590
It will spark a lot of discussions.

38
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:23,511
But he is deliberately
discrediting you now.

39
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,470
Rest assured. I will not

40
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,630
put up with it for nothing.

41
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:28,910
But we need to take a long view.

42
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,910
We must control the pace ourselves

43
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:32,671
instead of being led by others.

44
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:34,511
After I modify this case,

45
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,351
I will give you
a before-and-after comparison.

46
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:37,551
The truth will come out.

47
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,351
I'm afraid that by that time,

48
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:41,710
the malicious comments
about you will be everywhere.

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,831
I'm not worried about that.

50
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,430
You're with me, right?

51
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:46,391
If hitting people could be legal,

52
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:48,271
I would definitely hit him.

53
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:49,791
Alright.

54
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:51,150
I'm so angry.

55
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:52,991
Come in.

56
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:54,470
Coffee.

57
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,391
Thank you.

58
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:56,951
Huixuan.

59
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,750
- Hazelnut flavor.

60
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:00,630
Thanks.

61
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:01,470
I'll not bother you.

62
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,791
Look.

63
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,870
Only when you come here,

64
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:09,590
I'll have hazelnut-flavored coffee.

65
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:11,111
I usually can't get this.

66
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:13,710
Alright, stop it.

67
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:14,470
I have to go

68
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,551
to supervise their editing.

69
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:16,231
I'm off.

70
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:16,710
Bye.

71
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:18,111
Don't be upset.

72
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:32,710
(She loves using glass so much.)

73
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,750
(She must be fragile too.)

74
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,551
You're fragile.

75
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:41,430
It's for suspense.

76
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:43,310
Put aside

77
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:44,590
the display of rainbow.

78
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:45,831
Some problems

79
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:47,430
about the glass house
need to be resolved.

80
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:48,910
Is there a plan?

81
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:50,791
Considering solidity and stability,

82
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,590
as well as the complexity and cost,

83
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,590
we have two plans.

84
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,231
Please look.

85
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,592
(Glass house renovation plan A,
Glass house renovation plan B.)

86
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,231
Plan B.

87
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,271
The entire exterior is changed

88
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,310
to the latest advanced glass.

89
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,391
The steel structure is switched
to a round-edged one.

90
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,071
The cost is higher,

91
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:09,430
but the priority

92
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,111
is to prolong the service life
of the glass house.

93
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:11,910
Okay.

94
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:12,551
Miss Su.

95
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,750
All mosquito repellent systems

96
00:04:13,951 --> 00:04:14,951
sold on the market

97
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:15,951
are shown here.

98
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:18,231
(Mosquito Repellent System)

99
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:18,870
Optical one.

100
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:20,671
It's energy-saving.

101
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,351
Okay.

102
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:24,151
(Wind Noise)
Miss Su,

103
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,510
we haven't figured it out yet.

104
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,671
Fully-enclosed noise reduction.

105
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,750
However,

106
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:30,151
it can't last for a long time.

107
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,390
These problems

108
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:35,671
are all caused by the materials.

109
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,830
Why did you have to use the glass?

110
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:40,750
Are you asking me?

111
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:42,231
It looks good.

112
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:43,551
Right, it looks good.

113
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:44,830
Right.

114
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,190
Come on. Let's do it.

115
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:07,510
(I'm at the door of your firm.)

116
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,791
(You do your work.)

117
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:10,870
(We can meet later.)

118
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:11,830
(I can wait.)

119
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,111
(Thank you. I'm okay.)

120
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,231
(You don't have to.)

121
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:56,390
Okay.

122
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:58,111
Let's proceed with the plan.

123
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,231
Keep me updated.

124
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,231
Okay.

125
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,591
Miss Su.

126
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:03,671
I've sent you

127
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,430
the phone number.

128
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,151
I think I can

129
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:06,591
make some time to talk to him.

130
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,830
After all, the plan can be executed.

131
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,190
Mingshi.

132
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,070
Hello, Mr. Yu.

133
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:17,630
Hello.

134
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,750
I would like to discuss with you

135
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,151
about the plan I sent you yesterday.

136
00:06:32,911 --> 00:06:33,390
Dr. Qin.

137
00:06:34,231 --> 00:06:34,510
Hello.

138
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,070
Hello.

139
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:37,310
Miss Su is still busy now.

140
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,551
Miss Du has come over

141
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:39,991
and explained everything clearly.

142
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:41,711
It is a problem with the show team.

143
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,190
Don't blame yourself.

144
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:44,111
I think

145
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:45,310
I better make it clear in person.

146
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,031
It's okay.

147
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:48,711
Miss Su won't care about small things.

148
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:51,630
If her reputation is hurt,
I'll make it up to her.

149
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:52,430
I'm serious.

150
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:53,830
Okay, I see.

151
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:54,630
No worries.

152
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:55,510
I will let her know.

153
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,190
You may leave.

154
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,591
Alright, if there's anything,

155
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,390
ask her to call me.

156
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,791
Okay, I get it.

157
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:04,430
See you.

158
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,111
Miss Su.

159
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:21,471
Takeaway food has arrived.

160
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,310
Okay, just leave it there.

161
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,310
I'll eat it later.

162
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,310
Miss Su.

163
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:28,630
Don't forget to eat.

164
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:36,151
She is not eating again?

165
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:37,351
It's been all day.

166
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:38,390
Right.

167
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:39,711
I ordered so much food,

168
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,190
but she hasn't eaten anything.

169
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:42,791
She works too hard.

170
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,510
So much food.

171
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:46,991
I will eat some.

172
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,310
You do your work.

173
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:18,430
I don't have much time left.

174
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:24,471
Actually, I hope to have a family

175
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,351
with him during this period,

176
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:28,471
creating the best memories

177
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,671
that belong to us.

178
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,870
I want to achieve the best result

179
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,351
in the shortest time.

180
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,150

00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:54,198
♪Trying to heal that broken part♪

193
00:09:54,719 --> 00:10:01,704
♪Perhaps I will smile again♪

194
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,231
She refused to see you?

195
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,071
She must be angry.

196
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:08,351
She is a good girl,

197
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:09,471
but you ruin her reputation.

198
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,630
She must be angry.

199
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:11,951
I tried to explain to her.

200
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,270
She doesn't even see you.

201
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:15,071
Who do you explain to?

202
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,711
What's going on?

203
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,831
A new dish for you two.

204
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:19,670
Thanks.

205
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:20,550
It has a new name,

206
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,150
Wound Healing Shrimp.

207
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,270
Have a try.

208
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:26,311
Buddy.

209
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,231
You are now like the elderly,

210
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,750
carrying a radio with you.

211
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,910
You can also take a birdcage.

212
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:32,510
Done.

213
00:10:32,951 --> 00:10:34,351
You don't know it.

214
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:37,711
Listening to the radio

215
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,471
is the current emerging island culture.

216
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:40,951
Never mind.

217
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,831
What were you saying?

218
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:43,991
I heard something about a girl.

219
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:46,231
And you ruined her reputation.
It's dramatic.

220
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,510
Come on. Tell me more.

221
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:50,431
Well, he attended a show a few days ago.

222
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:52,191
The show team edited it maliciously.

223
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:54,111
He offended the designer
who decorated his house.

224
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:56,351
She was originally supposed to help.

225
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,150
But he caused trouble for her.

226
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,351
She's avoiding him now.

227
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,311
It's an infringement.

228
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:05,071
You ask them to post a statement online.

229
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,191
What if someone stirs up the issue
with Mi Su again?

230
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:09,951
Yeah.

231
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:12,951
This is a bit difficult to handle.

232
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,471
But it's okay.

233
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:18,870
Given my years

234
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,790
of life experience,

235
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,670
I can give you advice.

236
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,711
What do you say?

237
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:25,431
Buddy.

238
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:27,711
I am all ears.

239
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,591
Yunsheng,

240
00:11:32,831 --> 00:11:34,431
listen to my advice.

241
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,030
Just apologize with a smile.

242
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,591
You won't lose anything.

243
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,471
You are a young

244
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:41,351
and handsome man.

245
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:42,231
A good man,

246
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,150
with a good-looking face

247
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,870
and a good heart.

248
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:48,471
Any girl can

249
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,870
forgive you.

250
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:52,030
Buddy.

251
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,111
You really

252
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,711
enlighten me.

253
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:56,231
But that girl doesn't see him.

254
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,231
You both are too young.

255
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,991
Do you know how I wooed girls

256
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,471
when I was your age?

257
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,870
How did you do?

258
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:05,231
Back then,

259
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,191
no mobile phones,

260
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,270
no WeChat,

261
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,630
and messages.

262
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:10,630
I directly went

263
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:11,790
to the school's radio room

264
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:12,910
and read poetry

265
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,030
via the microphone.

266
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:17,870
"Very quietly I take my leave."

267
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,750
"As quietly as I came here."

268
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,390
It's so romantic.

269
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:24,030
Upon hearing this,

270
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,510
any girl could forgive you.

271
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:26,431
Am I right?

272
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:27,951
Here's a problem.

273
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:30,270
Now there is no radio room.

274
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,750
(Let this night)

275
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:36,951
(listen to the voice)

276
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:38,071
(in your heart.)

277
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,750
(Speak out the words)

278
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,150
(you haven't said yet.)

279
00:12:42,351 --> 00:12:42,991
Right.

280
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,311
She doesn't see you,

281
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,630
but she can hear, right?

282
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:47,670
Even if she doesn't listen to the radio,

283
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:49,951
we can get someone to play it for her.

284
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,431
Just give it a try.

285
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:55,030
Follow his advice.

286
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:56,550
You can't go wrong.

287
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,390
Morning, Ye.

288
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,071
Morning.

289
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,191
You have cherry tomatoes for breakfast?

290
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,270
I'm dieting.

291
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:57,351
But you're not fat.

292
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,471
Don't comfort me. I'm fat.

293
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:01,670
My mother told me to eat nutritious...

294
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:03,191
Miss Su.

295
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:09,150
Well, didn't she go home last night?

296
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,351
She's working so hard,

297
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,071
without eating or sleeping.

298
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,431
Doesn't she

299
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,071
feel tired?

300
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:19,670
This is her real state at work.

301
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:21,191
A fighting girl.

302
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,030
Those who criticized her

303
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:23,831
are just jealous.

304
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,431
Miss Su is the talent
of the design world.

305
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,471
That makes sense.

306
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:31,831
Should I take this breakfast

307
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,030
to her?

308
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,231
Go ahead.

309
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:37,550
Me?

310
00:14:39,991 --> 00:14:41,150
I'll just eat it myself.

311
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:43,111
Huixuan.

312
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,150
I'm sorry.

313
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:46,910
I'm late. Have you been waiting?

314
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,910
I just arrived.

315
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:50,431
Huixuan.

316
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,431
What's going on?

317
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:53,831
Wait a moment.

318
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,591
Well,

319
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:57,390
we've edited

320
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,231
that video again.

321
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,351
And I personally oversaw the editing.

322
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:03,030
When it's broadcast,

323
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,030
the full video will be released.

324
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,870
There will be

325
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,030
no problem.

326
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:09,750
If you are still not assured,

327
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,150
you can check it out.

328
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,231
Okay.

329
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:13,670
We believe in you.

330
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:18,311
Right now, Miss Su is especially busy.
She can't spare the time.

331
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,390
So she's throwing herself

332
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:22,670
in her work again.

333
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:23,471
Right.

334
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,790
You even know this.

335
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:26,591
She didn't answer my calls

336
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,550
and gave me a brief response.

337
00:15:29,231 --> 00:15:30,191
So she is.

338
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,231
Miss Su is trying to develop a solution

339
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,071
for repairing the glass house.

340
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:35,390
She's been staying up late.

341
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:37,670
And she doesn't eat, drink,

342
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:38,390
or sleep?

343
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,471
Moreover,

344
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,030
she's living at the company.

345
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:42,670
I knew it.

346
00:15:43,351 --> 00:15:44,071
So,

347
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:46,351
I have prepared it.

348
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,630
I got this porridge for her.

349
00:15:51,431 --> 00:15:53,111
She easily has stomach pains.

350
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,071
No matter what,

351
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:55,431
you have to persuade her to eat some.

352
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,150
Okay.

353
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,150
You really are her best friend.

354
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:00,951
How about you?

355
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,111
Have you been eating on time lately?

356
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:06,711
I can tell you haven't.

357
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:09,510
Perfect timing.

358
00:16:10,591 --> 00:16:11,111
Thanks.

359
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,111
Well...

360
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:19,150
Hazelnut-flavored coffee.

361
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,150
Right.

362
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,870
How come you always

363
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,191
order the flavor I love?

364
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,790
Because it's my coffee.

365
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,191
I ordered milk for you.

366
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:31,231
You've been staying up late
to edit videos

367
00:16:31,471 --> 00:16:32,311
without a good rest.

368
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,431
While caring for Miss Su,

369
00:16:34,991 --> 00:16:36,311
you also need to take care of yourself.

370
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:37,711
Okay.

371
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:42,030
Drink it slowly.

372
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,150
I'm leaving.

373
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:49,150
I have a meeting later.

374
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:50,150
What's the rush?

375
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,111
Remember

376
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:53,390
to bring it to Su Ying.

377
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:54,670
See you.

378
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:54,991
Okay.

379
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,351
Thanks.

380
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,150
Grab a sandwich.

381
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:58,191
Take one.

382
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,231
Okay.

383
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,351
Thank you for breakfast.

384
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:01,951
Not at all.

385
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,310
Bye.

386
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:04,911
Bye.

387
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:22,472
(Dr. Qin)

388
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,231
Hello.

389
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,191
Come in.

390
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,070
Miss Su.

391
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:37,191
Huixuan knew

392
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:38,911
you're busy with work without eating.

393
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:39,991
She's worried about you.

394
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,590
She asked me to bring you porridge.

395
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:42,951
And she reminded you

396
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,631
to eat it.

397
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,951
Okay, just put it there.

398
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:46,711
I'll eat it later.

399
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:55,151
I'll not bother you.

400
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,830
(Let's go on.)

401
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,790
(Next, let's take a call)

402
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,790
(from Mr. Qin.)

403
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,671
(I want to say something to my friend.)

404
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:14,471
(I know)

405
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,790
(this rumor recently)

406
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,631
(has caused you a lot of trouble.)

407
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:19,151
(I've learnt)

408
00:18:19,671 --> 00:18:21,431
(of your kind intentions
from six years ago.)

409
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,871
(If possible,)

410
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,871
(I would like to say)

411
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,590
(I'm sorry)

412
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,191
(and thank you.)

413
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,270
(So,)

414
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:32,510
(Miss Su,)

415
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,871
(if you hear me,)

416
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:36,991
(could you come to the glass house?)

417
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,270

Thank you.

429
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,310
If I hadn't listened to the radio,

430
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,270
or I had been away from you,

431
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,671
how long would you wait?

432
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:35,110
I guess I will keep waiting.

433
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,270
Actually, I didn't
intentionally avoid you.

434
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,790
I just focused on my work.

435
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,991
This is the result of my work.

436
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,151
The rainbow plan.

437
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,671
I believe in your plan.

438
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,911
In fact, Huixuan told me

439
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,431
the real reason
why you made the glass house

440
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:12,991
six years ago.

441
00:21:14,631 --> 00:21:15,391
Thank you

442
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,550
for silently giving.

443
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,951
You've borne many unjust criticisms.

444
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,590
And you've helped Mi Su
achieve her dreams.

445
00:21:32,431 --> 00:21:34,911
So you're grateful to me.

446
00:21:39,951 --> 00:21:41,231
After the glass house was built,

447
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:43,991
I haven't told you how I feel
about this house yet.

448
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,790
I can tell you now.

449
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,750
I like sitting here.

450
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:51,191
I sit on this sofa,

451
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,590
feeling the sea breeze,

452
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,030
and watching the sea.

453
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,030
When it rains,

454
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,151
I like to lie in bed, falling asleep

455
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,110
to the sound of the rain.

456
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,110
It's delightful.

457
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:10,030
And over there.

458
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,790
I don't cook often,

459
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,151
but when the sun is setting,

460
00:22:18,391 --> 00:22:19,070
I sit here, drinking

461
00:22:19,191 --> 00:22:20,070
and watching the sunset.

462
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:21,951
I feel cozy.

463
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:29,590
Su Ying.

464
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:32,911
I just want to tell you

465
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:35,590
that you are an excellent designer.

466
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:39,991
Despite negative public opinions online,

467
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,391
don't take it seriously.

468
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:43,830
Because that's not the truth.

469
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,550
You have to believe

470
00:22:48,391 --> 00:22:50,070
that many people are behind you,

471
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,711
liking and supporting you.

472
00:22:56,871 --> 00:22:57,790
So which side are you on?

473
00:22:59,310 --> 00:22:59,830
Me?

474
00:23:03,391 --> 00:23:05,231
Supporting you.

475
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,790
Okay.

476
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:14,231
I'm glad to hear that.

477
00:23:15,951 --> 00:23:16,750
I have to go now.

478
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,671
Su Ying.

479
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:30,590
Su Ying.

480
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,750
Su Ying.

481
00:23:48,871 --> 00:23:49,310
Somebody.

482
00:23:49,991 --> 00:23:50,550
Help.

483
00:23:51,911 --> 00:23:52,830
Come on.

484
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:53,830
What happened?

485
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:54,510
What's wrong?

486
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:55,191
She's in shock.

487
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:58,030
A stomach problem.

488
00:23:58,631 --> 00:23:59,750
She was pressing her stomach.

489
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,830
Is she...

490
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,711
She's currently slightly dehydrated.

491
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:05,310
She needs to be examined.

492
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,671
Leave it to me.

493
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,991
Okay.

494
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:12,951
Dr. Qin, we need
to contact the patient's family.

495
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,191
I'll do it.

496
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:24,590
Hello.

497
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,590
Miss Du.

498
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:29,391
Dr. Qin.

499
00:24:29,991 --> 00:24:30,471
How is she?

500
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:31,951
What happened?

501
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,510
I'm waiting for the result.

502
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,191
She put her hands on her stomach.

503
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:36,590
Did she have

504
00:24:36,991 --> 00:24:37,911
any stomach diseases?

505
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,110
I don't think so.

506
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:41,030
I haven't heard it.

507
00:24:42,871 --> 00:24:44,750
It could be food poisoning.

508
00:24:45,871 --> 00:24:47,110
I'm afraid she hasn't eaten anything.

509
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,391
She neglects to eat when she's busy,

510
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:51,231
and she always drinks coffee.

511
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,431
How did it go?

512
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:55,510
The results are out.

513
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,151
It was caused by hypoglycemia.

514
00:24:58,991 --> 00:25:02,151
But her serum pepsinogen value
is slightly low.

515
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,951
There are signs of atrophic gastritis.

516
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:04,991
I suggest

517
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,110
that after she recovers,

518
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:08,270
she'd better have a full examination.

519
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:11,471
Okay.

520
00:25:14,892 --> 00:25:17,199
(Prescription)

521
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,191
She fell asleep.

522
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:42,590
She finally can rest for a while.

523
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,632
I'll get the medicine.

524
00:25:46,871 --> 00:25:47,871
It's okay. I can do it.

525
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:49,631
You watch her.

526
00:25:49,951 --> 00:25:50,790

Dr. Qin.

552
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,631
You want a medical card?

553
00:27:57,431 --> 00:27:57,750
Yes.

554
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:58,830
I apply for it.

555
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:00,520
For a man or a woman?

556
00:28:00,671 --> 00:28:01,151
For a woman.

557
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,830
In addition to a full examination,

558
00:28:04,911 --> 00:28:06,310
what else does she need to check?

559
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,110
Gynecological examination?

560
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:09,231
What?

561
00:28:11,631 --> 00:28:12,030
No.

562
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,391
My friend had a stomachache.

563
00:28:16,871 --> 00:28:18,431
Your friend.

564
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,750
I recommend the package C
to your friend.

565
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:24,270

566
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,471
Okay.

567
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,191
Add a gastroscopy for your friend.

568
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:30,631

00:28:43,871 --> 00:28:44,391
Chen.

575
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:46,110
Order a hazelnut-flavored latte

576
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,510
for Huixuan next time.

577
00:28:47,871 --> 00:28:49,030
Okay.

578
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:51,350
Dr. Qin.

579
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,191
Thank you.

580
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:54,030
Miss,

581
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,471
your black coffee.

582
00:28:55,871 --> 00:28:56,350
Thanks.

583
00:28:56,991 --> 00:28:58,110
What would you like to drink?

584
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:58,911
Iced latte.

585
00:28:59,231 --> 00:28:59,790
Huixuan.

586
00:29:01,431 --> 00:29:02,310
How is Su Ying doing?

587
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,830
She is recovering,

588
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:04,871
but she looks better.

589
00:29:06,231 --> 00:29:07,110
She will not come today?

590
00:29:07,951 --> 00:29:08,871
She will rest at home.

591
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:10,991
Mr. Liu,

592
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:12,991
your coffee.

593
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,991
I don't drink this coffee.

594
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,550
Mr. Liu.

595
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:28,231
Isn't Su Ying coming today?

596
00:29:29,991 --> 00:29:31,631
Is there anything more important
than proposal?

597
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,711
Here's the thing.

598
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,391
Miss Su has been busy
with the glass house project.

599
00:29:36,911 --> 00:29:37,911
She's feeling a bit unwell.

600
00:29:40,911 --> 00:29:41,590
Dr. Qin,

601
00:29:42,471 --> 00:29:43,871
how did you know?

602
00:29:44,191 --> 00:29:45,550
She was sent to my hospital yesterday.

603
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:47,590
Miss Du took care of her overnight.

604
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:49,711
Right.

605
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,911
Well, Su Ying isn't here.

606
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,431
Will it delay our program's progress?

607
00:29:56,871 --> 00:29:57,550
Don't worry.

608
00:29:57,991 --> 00:30:00,070
Miss Su has asked me
to present her plan.

609
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:00,830
You?

610
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,951
Let's get started.

611
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:06,631
Hello, everyone.

612
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,550
I'm Mingshi from SU Design Firm.

613
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:10,830
I will provide our solutions

614
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,471
to addressing the existing problems

615
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,951
of the glass house.

616
00:30:14,911 --> 00:30:16,070
Firstly,

617
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,590
to further extend

618
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,350
the service life of the glass house,

619
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:20,871
we will adopt latest glass

620
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:22,871
craftsmanship for the exterior wall.

621
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,991
Please look.

622
00:30:24,552 --> 00:30:25,736
(GLASS CRAFT)

623
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:27,720
(Latest glass craftsmanship)

624
00:30:31,151 --> 00:30:32,871
Remember to report to Miss Su.

625
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,431
Okay.

626
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,471
Mingshi.

627
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,151
Mingshi.

628
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:37,510
Dr. Qin.

629
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:38,750
What's it?

630
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,871
Do you have any problems?

631
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:41,871
No.

632
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,911
You did a good job.

633
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,310
I've written my feedback.

634
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,911
Could you give it to Su Ying?

635
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:48,110
No problem.

636
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,270
I'll give it to her.

637
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,510
Anything else?

638
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,671
How is Su Ying doing?

639
00:30:56,391 --> 00:30:57,030
Miss Su?

640
00:30:57,471 --> 00:30:58,830
She didn't come to work today.

641
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,350
I think

642
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,750
she's fine.

643
00:31:03,471 --> 00:31:03,951
Good.

644
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:06,750
Please make her read it.

645
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,431
Okay, don't worry.

646
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,431
I have to go now.

647
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,310
Miss Su.

648
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,310
I'm back.

649
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:22,231
How did it go?

650
00:31:22,951 --> 00:31:24,191
It's terrific.

651
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:27,911
He's nice in front of others,

652
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,350
but why is he tough in front of me?

653
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:31,510
Do you mean Dr. Qin?

654
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,750
He is also very satisfied.

655
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,030
Right, he has some minor comments

656
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,270
noted in this book.

657
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,510
Such a thick one.

658
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:39,671
Minor comments?

659
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:42,191
He told me

660
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,871
to deliver it personally to you.

661
00:31:47,911 --> 00:31:48,431
Miss Su.

662
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,991
You just got discharged.

663
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,191
Don't be so tired.

664
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:52,391
Leave it to me.

665
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:54,671
I don't have the time to rest.

666
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,991
Do you want to rest

667
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,350
or want to be laughed at?

668
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,951
Construction will start soon.

669
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:00,951
We will depend on the rainbow glass.

670
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:03,310
You're right.

671
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,110
Have you eaten?

672
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,391
Let me buy you some soup.

673
00:32:25,966 --> 00:32:27,176
(Medical Card)

674
00:32:30,095 --> 00:32:32,968
(Eat well, rest well,
and get a physical examination.)

675
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,671
(Thank you.)

676
00:33:13,631 --> 00:33:14,871
(The medical card)

677
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:16,110
(looks so old-fashioned.)

678
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:17,790
(I can help improve it.)

679
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,631
(Do a checkup tomorrow.)

680
00:33:27,151 --> 00:33:28,040
(On an empty stomach.)

681
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:43,191
Is that okay?

682
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:43,871
Put it here.

683
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,231
Put it at the front.

684
00:33:45,631 --> 00:33:46,590
Adjust this to the front.

685
00:33:51,151 --> 00:33:51,471
Hello.

686
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,830
I take away this, please.

687
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,550
Okay.

688
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:53,991
Thank you.

689
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:54,711
Not at all.

690
00:34:11,951 --> 00:34:12,591
(Huixuan.)

691
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:13,710
(Have you had dinner?)

692
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,311
(A meal for working overtime.)

693
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:26,871
(With vegetables, meat,
soup, and condiments.)

694
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,590
(It's like eating hot pot.)

695
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:31,871
Sir.

696
00:34:32,311 --> 00:34:33,230
I'll take away one more.

697
00:34:33,751 --> 00:34:34,190
Okay.

698
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,630
The wall...

699
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:57,230
(Building Materiel Selection)
We chose...

700
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:58,190
Xu Mingshi.

701
00:34:58,991 --> 00:34:59,831
What's wrong with you?

702
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:01,710
Can't you even make a presentation?

703
00:35:02,431 --> 00:35:03,431
Overlapped texts and pictures.

704
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,230
Are you blind?

705
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,710
Is this what you learned at school?

706
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,150
You're fired.

707
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,150
Meeting dismissed.

708
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:09,791
Director.

709
00:35:31,951 --> 00:35:33,030
You felt aggrieved, right?

710
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:36,951
When I was an intern,

711
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,751
I received even harsher reprimands.

712
00:35:41,951 --> 00:35:43,230
You noticed

713
00:35:43,311 --> 00:35:44,710
that one of our guests

714
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:46,190
has poor eyesight,

715
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,831
so you enlarged the texts

716
00:35:47,831 --> 00:35:48,951
to make it clearer for him.

717
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:51,871
There were so many people in the room.

718
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:52,751
You can't say it out

719
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:53,471
to embarrass him.

720
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,510
You were doing great.

721
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,630
But the director didn't think so.

722
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,351
He even fired me.

723
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,871
I have a friend who's just like you,

724
00:36:04,311 --> 00:36:05,311
always thinking about others.

725
00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:06,311
But she never expresses it.

726
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,391
Right.

727
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,991
You studied architecture, right?

728
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,831
She's starting a business right now.

729
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,150
If you're interested,

730
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,230
you can work for her.

731
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,510
She's the popular designer

732
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,751
in the first season of House Design.

733
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:24,710
Su Ying?

734
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:25,791
Right.

735
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:27,550
If you work for her now,

736
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,590
you will be one of her veteran staff.

737
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:32,070
Can I do it?

738
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:33,271
Of course, you can.

739
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:34,311
Believe in yourself.

740
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:36,670
Don't miss the opportunity. Go for it.

741
00:36:37,271 --> 00:36:38,150
Thank you, Huixuan.

742
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,510
I'm leaving.

743
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,710
Bye.

744
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,391
(Another day of envying Su Ying.)

745
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:18,751
(Thanks for your dinner.)

746
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:38,951
So you're Dr. Qin's friend?

747
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,590
Sort of.

748
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:42,391
Let me tell you.

749
00:37:42,911 --> 00:37:44,471
You take this medical card

750
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:46,030
and do each medical examination.

751
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:47,991
If you have any problems,
feel free to tell me.

752
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,070
Don't worry. Just relax.

753
00:37:49,391 --> 00:37:50,590
After the examination,

754
00:37:50,871 --> 00:37:52,150
we've prepared a meal for you.

755
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:52,991
If you're thirsty,

756
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:53,791
or hungry,

757
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:54,951
just tell me.

758
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,710
We're all here.

759
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,271
This way, please.

760
00:37:57,871 --> 00:37:58,351
Your card.

761
00:37:58,791 --> 00:37:59,390
Thank you.

762
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,110
Not at all.

763
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,070
Go ahead.

764
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:01,831
Thanks.

765
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:02,871
We're at your service.

766
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:07,510
Could you help me check this?

767
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:08,590
Alright, Dr. Qin.

768
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,070
Thank you.

769
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,991
Dr. Qin.

770
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,110
Your colleagues are so warm-hearted.

771
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,510
I've never seen so enthusiastic doctors.

772
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:24,550
Are you done?

773
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:28,670
Well, the health check center
usually gives patients gifts?

774
00:38:29,271 --> 00:38:30,791
This is usually prepared
for the elderly.

775
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:32,670
How about this?

776
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,590
This is for the children.

777
00:38:35,311 --> 00:38:36,271
Why did they give it to me?

778
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,271
Maybe because you're my VIP.

779
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:44,190
I know they did it because of you.

780
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:45,710
You're quite popular.

781
00:38:49,431 --> 00:38:49,871
Thank you.

782
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,070
Indeed, it's a bit heavy.

783
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,630
No.

784
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,030
Gastroscopy report.

785
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,951
The doctor said I'm fine.

786
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:00,831
Let me take a look.

787
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:01,991
Alright.

788
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,471
Help me hold this.

789
00:39:07,951 --> 00:39:08,471
And this.

790
00:39:14,871 --> 00:39:15,751
It's urine test result.

791
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,471
Ultrasound report.

792
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:24,351
Su Ying, I need the gastroscopy report.

793
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:26,550
Gastroscopy?

794
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:27,871
Which one?

795
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,791
I just had it a moment ago.

796
00:39:30,391 --> 00:39:30,951
Oh, no.

797
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:33,230
I left it at the health check center?

798
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:36,710
Well, wait for me here.

799
00:39:36,831 --> 00:39:37,510
I'll look for it.

800
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,271
When I find it,
I'll let the nurse give it to you.

801
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:41,831
Your stuff.

802
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,230
I am a VIP.

803
00:39:53,951 --> 00:39:54,670
Stick its head out.

804
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,190
Thank you.

805
00:39:58,311 --> 00:39:58,951
On the left.

806
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:09,230
Ms. Han.

807
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,070
Dr. Qin, what's up?

808
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,070
Do you have the health check report
to give me?

809
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,190
No, I don't.

810
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:16,271
Are you sure?

811
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,230
Right.

812
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,391
Alright, thank you.

813
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:32,831
(Did you skip the gastroscopy?)

814
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,471
