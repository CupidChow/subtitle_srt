Nothing.

Get back to your work.

81
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,701
Thank you, Dr. Qin.

82
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,621
So, as cardiothoracic surgeons,

83
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:13,096
(Treatment of Coronary Heart Disease)
we should work like cardiomyocytes

84
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:15,464
(or Ischemic Heart Disease with Stem Cells)
with autonomous initiative.

85
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:17,621
No matter what difficulties
and obstacles we encounter,

86
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,340
we should strive to maintain

87
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:21,501
rhythmic excitation

88
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,900
to be enterprising,

89
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:24,900
energetic cardiothoracic surgeons,

90
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:27,340
and take care of every heart we handle.

91
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,712
Here,

92
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:30,061
I hope

93
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,780
when you engage in clinical work
in the future,

94
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,581
you can truly achieve

95
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,100
a clear conscience.

96
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,181
Okay. Next,

97
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:48,072
you all can ask questions.

98
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,240
Please.

99
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,701
Dr. Qin, you work at Meichi, right?

100
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,701
The workload at Meichi must be huge.

101
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,581
Every doctor has a huge workload.

102
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,340
So you should cherish your time
in school.

103
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,340
If I work in Meichi,

104
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,340
can I become your colleague?

105
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,860
We could become your colleagues.

106
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:13,181
Meichi welcomes
all outstanding medical students.

107
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,381
Any other questions?

108
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:24,200
Please.

109
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:29,621
Dr. Qin, what's your phone number?

110
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:34,420
I'll tell you after class.

111
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,261
After you go back,

112
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,704
you will get busy, right?

113
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,700
This new project will keep me busy.

114
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:00,741
But that's how a design works.

115
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:01,704
What about you?

116
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:04,021
I'm a surgeon again.

117
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:05,501
I have to focus on my work.

118
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,420
(Turn right in 500 meters ahead.)

119
00:09:08,621 --> 00:09:10,341
(The current traffic is smooth.)

120
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,540
(You're expected to arrive
in one hour and forty minutes.)

121
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,141
Not this intersection.

122
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:17,741
Two more up front.

123
00:09:20,381 --> 00:09:21,300
I think it's the right one.

124
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,152
No.

125
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,616
Okay.

126
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,981
(You have deviated.)

127
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,700
(I'm rerouting for you.)

128
00:09:31,461 --> 00:09:34,420
(You're expected to arrive
in two hours and fifteen minutes.)

129
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,080
The sun is setting. Keep warm.

130
00:09:55,101 --> 00:09:56,060
(You have deviated.)

131
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,861
(I'm rerouting for you.)

132
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:02,981
(You're expected to arrive
in two hours and forty-five minutes.)

133
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:04,904
Strange.

134
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:06,184
I think this is the way.

135
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:08,261
I think so.

136
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:21,221
Well,

137
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,341
did Dr. Qin come here on purpose?

138
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:27,300
When Miss Su was sick,

139
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,861
Dr. Qin was very concerned with her.

140
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:31,861
What a surprise.

141
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:41,896
What happened to you?

142
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,381
I'm just feeling sick to my stomach.

143
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,861
I've been staying up late.

144
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,621
You must take care of yourself.

145
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,501
It's okay.
I've just been tired recently.

146
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:53,261
Don't take it lightly.

147
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:54,700
Keeping healthy is very important.

148
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:56,621
You look pretty strong,

149
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:04,981
but your constitution is so poor.

150
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,832
Drive slower.

151
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:10,780
No worries.

152
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,461
Don't talk to me.
Focus on driving.

153
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,752
Sir.

154
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,940
Here.

155
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,700
Here's the menu.

156
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,580
I want the vegetable porridge.

157
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,568
Okay.

158
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,981
Huixuan, can I order coconut jelly?

159
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:31,101
Look at that couple.

160
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,501
Their coconut jelly looks good.

161
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,021
Alright, two coconut jellies.

162
00:11:38,261 --> 00:11:39,101
Okay.

163
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:40,520
Anything else?

164
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,660
Two dishes.

165
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,660
Just vegetable dishes.

166
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,141
Okay, please wait a moment.

167
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:46,088
Thank you.

168
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:48,540
Come on.

169
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,416
Let me help.

170
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,261
Let me do it.

171
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:51,900
It's okay. You're feeling unwell.

172
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:53,000
Let me take care of you.

173
00:11:54,728 --> 00:11:55,621
Come on.

174
00:11:55,621 --> 00:11:56,552
Thank you.

175
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,744
Thank you.

176
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:02,780
I'm sorry,
but we only have one jelly left.

177
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,461
I'll give you an extra one next time.

178
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:07,141
Huixuan, you have it.

179
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:09,461
Why don't we have it together?

180
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:11,112
Together?

181
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:13,896
Okay.

182
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,504
It's so cool.

183
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,461
There is coconut jello.

184
00:12:25,021 --> 00:12:25,864
By the way,

185
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:28,101
have you taken photos
of the sea view room's balcony?

186
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,221
- Yes, I saved it on my phone.
- Good.

187
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:32,072
Wait a moment.

188
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,440
Let me unlock this for you.

189
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,368
Huixuan.

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,021
Let me help.
You might not find them.

191
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:50,984
Well,

192
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:52,360
some secrets are kept

193
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,341
on your phone, right?

194
00:12:53,341 --> 00:12:54,248
No.

195
00:12:54,248 --> 00:12:55,540
I have put photos

196
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,501
into a group.

197
00:12:57,981 --> 00:12:58,940
I created too many groups.

198
00:12:59,141 --> 00:12:59,981
You can't find them.

199
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:01,420
You didn't find them, did you?

200
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,060
Okay, you can send them to me later.

201
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,221
After I finish the porridge,
I will do it.

202
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:09,660
Eat the porridge.

203
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,624
Okay.

204
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,780
I already have an idea
for the sea-view apartment.

205
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,341
Tonight, I will make a preliminary plan.

206
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,540
We can have a meeting tomorrow morning.

207
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:45,836
(Qin Yunsheng)

208
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,141
Hello, Dr. Qin.

209
00:15:57,861 --> 00:15:58,728
I just made rounds.

210
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:00,940
Now I can take a five-minute break.

211
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,221
How was your break?

212
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:05,800
Yesterday...

213
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,280
You had a cold?

214
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:14,021
I might have caught a chill.

215
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,060
Don't go to work today.

216
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,440
Have a good rest at home.

217
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,580
You just got better.
Can't get too tired.

218
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,221
I know. Don't worry, Dr. Qin.

219
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,912
I will definitely follow your advice.

220
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:29,512
I will.

221
00:17:00,341 --> 00:17:01,224
Mingshi.

222
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,780
Will we have a meeting today?

223
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,461
Yes,

224
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:09,620
but the meeting location needs
to be changed.

225
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:15,701
According to the plan,
we have selected

226
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,820
samples of ripple glass
to match the expected effect.

227
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:18,984
Please look.

228
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:30,344
Looks good,

229
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,688
but it's too expensive.

230
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,300
We must keep the budget

231
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,140
within eighty percent

232
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,461
of the client's expected value.

233
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:37,864
Understood.

234
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,424
Miss Su, what do you think of this?

235
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:43,140
This one's embossing is closest

236
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:44,701
to waves.

237
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:46,824
But...

238
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,520
But what?

239
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,901
If this glass

240
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:52,461
is installed on the balcony,

241
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:54,820
how will we
deal with the light transmission?

242
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:57,021
The client will not
watch the scenery outside.

243
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,181
Install it on both sides.

244
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,344
What?

245
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,752
Both sides?

246
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,696
Look,

247
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:08,701
when the sun rises every morning,

248
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:10,981
the sunlight will come in
from the east through the glass

249
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,820
and project the ripple pattern
onto the floor.

250
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,152
What does it look like?

251
00:18:14,421 --> 00:18:15,336
It looks like the tide.

252
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:17,780
That's right. You're so clever.

253
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,100
I'll send you the pictures, Mingshi.

254
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:25,544
Okay. And send the ripple pictures

255
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:26,461
to my email.

256
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:27,400
Alright.

257
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,264
Chen.

258
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:30,461
Have you checked
the compressive strength of the glass?

259
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,901
Before talking about the effect,

260
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,100
we must ensure the safety. Understand?

261
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,140
Okay. I'll check it now.

262
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:39,272
Receive the pictures.

263
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:41,300
Mingshi.

264
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,380
The light transmission rate

265
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,780
of this glass should be
between 20 and 30 percent.

266
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:45,941
I haven't confirmed it yet.

267
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:47,144
I'll do it now.

268
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,540
That's okay.
I can call the glass manufacturer.

269
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:51,656
Okay.

270
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,936
Well,

271
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,820
the number starts with 0532?

272
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,261
Okay.

273
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,580
I also sent you a new proposal.

274
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,632
Okay.

275
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,768
Don't talk.

276
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,421
Hello, Dr. Qin.

277
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:09,608
Are you at home?

278
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,984
Are you working?

279
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,780
No, I'm at home.

280
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:15,560
Really?

281
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,661
Yeah.

282
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:18,380
I'm resting now. Don't worry.

283
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,000
Alright.

284
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:22,300
I'll be at your house.

285
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:24,221
Hello?

286
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:30,696
Everyone,

287
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,860
all of you are young talents
in the design industry.

288
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,021
Is there any way

289
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:35,620
to turn our current work environment

290
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:37,620
immediately into my resting environment?

291
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,421
How long?

292
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,096
Three minutes.

293
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,501
Or two minutes.

294
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,221
How long until Dr. Qin arrives?

295
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:46,408
Be here in a minute.

296
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,784
Hurry up.

297
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:12,181
Dr. Qin.

298
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,056
You're here.

299
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,060
I'm resting at home.

300
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:33,461
They're here to visit me.

301
00:20:33,981 --> 00:20:37,300
Yes. We know she's feeling unwell.

302
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:39,021
So I brought her some fruits.

303
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:40,261
Right.

304
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:42,461
I brought some snacks for her.

305
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:44,380
I just came to check on her.

306
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:47,336
Thank you all.

307
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:48,424
Not at all.

308
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,340
You look a little pale.

309
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:53,261
Let me check on you.

310
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:57,620
Shall we go downstairs?

311
00:20:59,021 --> 00:20:59,976
Okay.

312
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,461
Let's go.

313
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,752
The room.

314
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:17,288
What's up?

315
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,976
Well,

316
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,741
I placed the samples in the wrong place.

317
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,048
Where did you put them?

318
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:25,448
Forget it. It's too late anyway.

319
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:27,181
Get out of here.

320
00:21:30,741 --> 00:21:31,624
Okay.

321
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:33,320
Lie down for a bit.

322
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,776
Lie down.

323
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,024
Yeah.

324
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,981
You were pricked?

325
00:22:01,981 --> 00:22:02,856
Nothing.

326
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,808
Well,

327
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,568
I just feel

328
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:09,661
so comfortable on this bed.

329
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,080
Really?

330
00:22:11,181 --> 00:22:12,104
Super comfortable.

331
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,600
It's very bouncy, right?

332
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,661
I took you to select a mattress before.

333
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,941
I'm using the same brand as you.

334
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,540
But the sound was different.

335
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,221
Well,

336
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,580
there are springs inside the mattress.

337
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,620
It will make a creaking noise like this.

338
00:22:31,021 --> 00:22:32,741
Strange. My mattress
doesn't make this sound.

339
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,501
Mine is thicker than yours.

340
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,624
Right.

341
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,380
Dr. Qin, I'm on a drip now.

342
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:44,820
How about you go back

343
00:22:45,221 --> 00:22:46,981
to your work?

344
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:48,181
You can do your things.

345
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:50,701
I can remove the needle by myself.

346
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,701
What if you fall asleep?

347
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:53,064
I've taken leave.

348
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:54,472
Have you?

349
00:22:57,421 --> 00:22:58,280
Well,

350
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,620
how long will it take?

351
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,380
About one and a half hours.

352
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,741
Over an hour?

353
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:09,864
Okay, no problem.

354
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:18,472
Su Ying.

355
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,741
Well,

356
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:22,901
your posture is quite unique.

357
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,992
Really?

358
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:27,941
I usually practice yoga.

359
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,060
Is there something under your blanket?

360
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,620
There's nothing.

361
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,461
What could be there?

362
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:34,340
See, nothing.

363
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,224
Su Ying.

364
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,941
Can I change my posture?

365
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:09,261
Thank you, Dr. Qin.

366
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:13,608
Are you mad?

367
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:18,312
I'm not.

368
00:24:23,941 --> 00:24:24,872
I'll get you water.

369
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:40,340
Be careful. It's hot.

370
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,072
My hand is numb.

371
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,080
You want to say something?

372
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:29,661
Well,

373
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,060
after I'm done with this case,

374
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:35,021
I will give you a small gift.

375
00:25:35,461 --> 00:25:36,340
Just as a reward

376
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,501
for giving me an IV drip.

377
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,780
I will give you a glass pot that I made.

378
00:25:46,901 --> 00:25:47,784
I will like

379
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,256
whatever you give me.

380
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:50,941
Anything?

381
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,008
Of course.

382
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,701
Well,

383
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:56,060
I need to think more carefully about it.

384
00:25:56,461 --> 00:25:57,352
Is it difficult?

385
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,728
Not at all.

386
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,340
(Glass Workshop)

387
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:23,080
So beautiful.

388
00:26:23,501 --> 00:26:24,820
Have you been here before?

389
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,992
No, it's my first time.

390
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:28,181
Be careful with the furnace. It's hot.

391
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,140
Over 1000 degrees.

392
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:32,392
It's really hot.

393
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:34,580
This is the color mixing area.

394
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:36,360
Look.

395
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:37,608
Color mixing?

396
00:26:41,221 --> 00:26:43,741
Simple crafts can be made here.

397
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:47,380
So do you usually work here?

398
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,100
Here's sort of my workshop.

399
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:52,221
You really love glass, don't you?

400
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,140
Regardless of what others say,

401
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:57,741
I think glass is

402
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,100
the most beautiful material.

403
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:04,981
My proposal has been accepted.

404
00:27:05,741 --> 00:27:06,696
Really.

405
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,656
Congratulations.

406
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:09,501
Well,

407
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,060
I promised you

408
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,181
that if my proposal was accepted,
I would give you a gift.

409
00:27:14,421 --> 00:27:15,820
Right, you fell asleep that day.

410
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,140
I was wondering what it could be.

411
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,016
Glass house?

412
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,712
Do you like it?

413
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,464
You made it?

414
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:46,760
Look.

415
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,224
I like it.

416
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,421
Very much.

417
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:01,300
I knew you would like it.

418
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:04,936
I should thank you
for giving me an IV at my home.

419
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:06,501
Otherwise,

420
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:08,421
I'll feel too embarrassed
to bother you again.

421
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,981
You never

422
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:13,128
bother me.

423
00:28:20,021 --> 00:28:21,421
You're good with your hands.

424
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:23,981
This glass house is beautiful and cute.

425
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,640
I know.

426
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:26,888
It suits you.

427
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:30,140
I know so much more.

428
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,820
I'll surprise you in the future.

429
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:34,140
Okay, I'm looking forward to it.

430
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,512
Whose dog is that?

431
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:39,941
So cute.

432
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:42,340
Where is your keeper?

433
00:28:43,901 --> 00:28:44,820
Such a big head.

434
00:28:45,461 --> 00:28:46,461
What's your name?

435
00:28:47,724 --> 00:28:50,124
(Subing)

436
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:52,712
Subing?

437
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:04,661
I just wondered
why it suddenly ran away.

438
00:29:16,461 --> 00:29:17,320
Long time no see.

439
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,624
Long time no see.

440
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:27,400
I moved here.

441
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,540
I brought it out for a walk.

442
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,464
Thank you.

443
00:29:40,461 --> 00:29:42,261
I won't disturb you. I have to go.

444
00:29:43,941 --> 00:29:44,872
Bye.

445
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:54,152
Let's go.

446
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,048
Where is the homeowner?

447
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:07,300
To save on his travel costs,

448
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,860
we'll have a video conference.

449
00:30:11,221 --> 00:30:13,128
Hello, I'm here.

450
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:16,060
What on earth is going on?

451
00:30:17,661 --> 00:30:19,021
How does he view the plan like this?

452
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,552
Don't worry.

453
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:22,741
I have already sent the plan
to him in advance.

454
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:25,416
Mr. Wang.

455
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,240
Mr. Wang.

456
00:30:27,741 --> 00:30:29,661
Have you gone through both plans?

457
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,176
Yes, I have.

458
00:30:31,941 --> 00:30:33,261
I am very satisfied.

459
00:30:33,661 --> 00:30:35,181
Can you really

460
00:30:35,421 --> 00:30:37,380
achieve the wave-like effect?

461
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:38,701
I'm looking forward to it.

462
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,060
Thank you for your approval, Mr. Wang.

463
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,380
Don't worry.
The final scene will exactly

464
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,580
look like the rendered image I gave you.

465
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,901
That's great.

466
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,300
But to be honest,

467
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,981
your cost is a bit high.

468
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:54,741
Mr. Wang.

469
00:30:54,981 --> 00:30:57,181
Under the premise of ensuring quality,

470
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,741
we've offered you the lowest price.

471
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:03,340
Mr. Su's cost is very low.

472
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,620
How much did you subsidize?

473
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:11,021
Mr. Wang, with a low cost,

474
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,021
I can guarantee quality.

475
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:15,336
You make your choice between us.

476
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,380
Alright.

477
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,728
Let me think.

478
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,981
Well, I'll choose Miss Su's plan,

479
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:27,540
but Mr. Su needs to execute it.

480
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,380
Mr. Wang, it's not feasible.

481
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,261
What's wrong?

482
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,701
If you say so,

483
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,820
I have to reconsider it.

484
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,021
Actually, I'm not satisfied
with the two plans.

485
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,820
Do you have any other designers?

486
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:47,592
I agree.

487
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,608
Miss Su.

488
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,580
I only provide a design.

489
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:54,100
I won't execute it.

490
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:57,421
I disagree.

491
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:00,140
Miss Su's plan is whimsical.

492
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,540
I can't implement it.

493
00:32:02,981 --> 00:32:04,100
Ripple glass?

494
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,661
Have you considered
the transmission of light?

495
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:09,421
Mr. Su, here's the thing.

496
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,060
If you agree,

497
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,021
you'll still be in.

498
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,981
It's a win-win cooperation.

499
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,860
But if you don't agree, you'll be out.

500
00:32:19,181 --> 00:32:21,221
When the program is broadcast,

501
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,021
you'll feel more awkward.

502
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,520
The time is limited.

503
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,992
I shall customize it.

504
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:31,780
There's not enough time.

505
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,592
Mr. Su,

506
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:38,300
I can take care of the glass.

507
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,300
You just focus on the rest
of the project.

508
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,981
It's better than being eliminated now.

509
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,021
Okay, it's decided.

510
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,060
Mr. Wang, do as you expected.

511
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,261
Okay, I'll be waiting
for your good news.

512
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,480
Okay.

513
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,208
Let's go.

514
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,864
Miss Su.

515
00:33:14,181 --> 00:33:15,901
Can I put the ripple glass

516
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,780
on the sides of the balcony?

517
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,620
So the front light transmission
won't be affected.

518
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,261
The glass needs to be customized.

519
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,981
Don't ignore its compressive strength.

520
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,661
So make sure to measure the data well.

521
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,792
Okay, got it.

522
00:33:48,748 --> 00:33:50,092
(Poly International Plaza)

523
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:02,888
Hello.

524
00:34:02,981 --> 00:34:05,300
Can I customize

525
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,981
thinner ripple glass?

526
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,700
Yes, I want to adjust the thickness.

527
00:34:12,781 --> 00:34:14,861
I need to contact
the building materials sponsor.

528
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,821
Okay, thank you.

529
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,580
The first love six years ago?

530
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,981
Why have you never mentioned this to me?

531
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,901
It has been in the past though.

532
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:41,501
The world is so big.

533
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,301
How could you two bump into each other
in the same place?

534
00:34:47,941 --> 00:34:49,461
So how did Dr. Qin

535
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:50,861
react?

536
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:52,861
He didn't ask anything.

537
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,060
He didn't see your relationship
with him?

538
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,901
Surely, he must have noticed.

539
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,301
He is such a smart person.

540
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,781
He just gave me some privacy.

541
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:05,260
What a considerate man.

542
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:07,821
Anyway, the past is the past.

543
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,301
Just take it as a small episode.

544
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,580
You bought a savings pot.

545
00:35:16,341 --> 00:35:17,861
Are you kidding me?

546
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,208
What is this?

547
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,301
This is the glass house
that Su Ying made for me.

548
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:23,720
Glass house.

549
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:28,660
This is pretty good.

550
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,021
Looks good, right?

551
00:35:30,021 --> 00:35:31,941
Yes. I didn't recognize it
without the color.

552
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,660
She's a great designer.

553
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,301
It's even more beautiful with color.

554
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,381
So nice.

555
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:38,312
Okay.

556
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,381
Don't break it.

557
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,672
I need to put it.

558
00:35:45,981 --> 00:35:48,740
Do you start to ignore your good friend?

559
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,540
I can't believe you.

560
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:52,821
Enjoy your glass house.

561
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,632
I'm leaving.

562
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,040
(Qin Yunsheng)
(When are you free?)

563
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:17,580
(Let's go to the glass workshop.)

564
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,700
(I want to color the glass house.)

565
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:26,740
(Su Ying)
(Okay, but I'm busy tomorrow.)

566
00:36:33,821 --> 00:36:35,620
(Qin Yunsheng)
(That's okay. I'll wait for you.)

567
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,572
(House Design, Meeting Room 1)

568
00:36:43,341 --> 00:36:45,128
(A Warm Welcome to Mr. Yang)
These are real flowers!

569
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:46,700
What's the occasion? Looks serious.

570
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,461
The sponsor is coming.

571
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,220
The Tiandi Building Materials Corp.

572
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,740
I heard they invested a lot.

573
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:58,021
You know Tiandi Building Materials Corp?

574
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:00,260
A rising star in the industry.

575
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,021
They have cooperated
with many large real estate developers.

576
00:37:03,341 --> 00:37:04,220
I know.

577
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,381
Today, they are here

578
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,580
to meet designers.

579
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:10,100
Of course, if you'd like

580
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,941
to avoid it, you don't need to talk.

581
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:13,384
Don't worry.

582
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:22,220
Welcome, Mr. Yang!

583
00:37:22,461 --> 00:37:23,400
He's here.

584
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:26,540
Let me introduce him to you.

585
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,540
This is Mr. Yang
from Tiandi Building Materials Corp.

586
00:37:28,941 --> 00:37:30,021
Clap!

587
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:32,781
These two are our designers

588
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:34,381
of first-line sea-view apartment.

589
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:35,461
This is Mr. Su.

590
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,821
This is Su Ying.

591
00:37:39,981 --> 00:37:40,904
I...

592
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:46,824
Su Ying.

593
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,180
Yang Zhengwen from Tiandi Group.

594
00:37:57,421 --> 00:37:58,376
Su Ying.

595
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,620
I'm here

596
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,660
to say hello to everyone

597
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:07,861
and meet designers,

598
00:38:08,901 --> 00:38:09,861
especially Miss Su.

599
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:12,501
I've seen a lot of your works

600
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,100
and have been following you.

601
00:38:24,341 --> 00:38:26,140
You know Mr. Yang?

602
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,540
He's the ex-boyfriend I told you before.

603
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:32,901
That's him.

604
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,220
No wonder you seemed shocked.

605
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:39,176
Do you think
he knows you're on this show?

606
00:38:39,176 --> 00:38:41,421
That's why he sponsored this show.

607
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:43,861
Please. That's impossible.

608
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,060
You don't know him.

609
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:46,421
He's a businessman.

610
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:48,260
He can never sacrifice work for love.

611
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:49,421
Impossible.

612
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,620
That was six years ago.

613
00:38:52,021 --> 00:38:53,821
People do change.

614
00:38:54,781 --> 00:38:55,941
I don't care if he changes or not.

615
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:58,060
Anyway, I'm only concerned
with Dr. Qin now.

616
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,632
Yunsheng, come in.

617
00:39:06,941 --> 00:39:07,784
Are you looking for me?

618
00:39:08,901 --> 00:39:09,981
Here's the thing.

619
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:11,461
The hospital is planning to hold another

620
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,700
charity auction this year.

621
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,100
Kind Action for Children?

622
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,140
Yes, this event is very meaningful.

623
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,700
I remember you were the first

624
00:39:19,861 --> 00:39:21,981
to propose this event
to the hospital leadership.

625
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,700
Yes, when I just worked
in the cardiac surgery department,

626
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:26,660
I knew many surgeries couldn't be done

627
00:39:26,861 --> 00:39:27,821
not for technical reasons,

628
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,021
but for financial reasons,
which made me sad.

629
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:32,620
Yes, and now you're back.

630
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:33,901
So, the hospital leader thinks

631
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,260
we might try to hold this event again.

632
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,220
I do this job?

633
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,136
Yes.

634
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,544
What do you think?

635
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,861
I'm happy to do it.

636
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:45,580
I just came back.

637
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:48,781
It does take time
for me to be a chief surgeon.

638
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,700
If I have a chance to shine,

639
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,136
I am happy to do that.

640
00:39:52,981 --> 00:39:53,864
Listen,

641
00:39:54,301 --> 00:39:55,861
once you get this job done,

642
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,060
it will be worth ten surgeries.

643
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,464
Right.

644
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:03,180
Here's the plan.

645
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:04,781
You read it.

646
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,664
Okay.

647
00:40:06,861 --> 00:40:07,816
I'll get back to my work.

648
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:44,140
We utilize the principle
of glass refraction

649
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,620
and install ripple glass on the balcony.

650
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:50,220
At nightfall, when the light comes in
from a certain angle,

651
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:51,981
it creates the scene of tides.

652
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,008
So Mr. Wang,

653
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,672
do you still like it?

654
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,528
I do.

655
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,781
It would be even better
if this budget could be lower.

656
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,341
Looks good.

657
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:17,341
How's the safety of this glass?

658
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:18,984
It is safe,

659
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,540
and quite cost-effective,

660
00:41:20,821 --> 00:41:22,501
entirely within the budget.

661
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,580
What do you think?

662
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,700
Are you satisfied

663
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,928
with this house transformation?

664
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,901
Yes, I am.

665
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,096
I'm very satisfied.

666
00:41:33,192 --> 00:41:34,100
It's good.

667
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,048
Great.

668
00:41:54,901 --> 00:41:56,540
Mr. Wang.

669
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,021
Mr. Wang, are you alright?

670
00:41:58,021 --> 00:41:59,620
Mr. Wang.

671
00:41:59,941 --> 00:42:00,861
Don't move me.

672
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,941
What can I do for you?

673
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:07,421
The hospital started
a charity auction online.

674
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,620
Here are some logos.

675
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,260
I need you to review them.

676
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:19,176
These logos?

677
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,781
It's a charity event.

678
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,180
This one. I like its simplicity.

679
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:31,540
Our taste is quite similar.

680
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:33,220
I thought this is the best one too.

681
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,616
What about the materials?

682
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:38,408
On the next page.

683
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:39,912
Please have a look.

684
00:42:41,861 --> 00:42:42,821
There are many clothes.

685
00:42:42,941 --> 00:42:43,880
Right.

686
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,064
Let me see.

687
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,528
It's a lot.

688
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:50,824
Hello?

689
00:42:53,341 --> 00:42:54,341
Okay, I'll be right back.

690
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,512
I have to go.

691
00:42:57,861 --> 00:42:58,981
It's okay. Go ahead.

692
00:42:58,981 --> 00:42:59,901
I'll leave this to you.

693
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:15,501
