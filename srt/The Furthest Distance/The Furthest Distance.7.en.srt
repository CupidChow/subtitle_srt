Dr. Qin?

18
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:50,819
Why are you here?

19
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:55,298
As I knew you were here,
I came to see you.

20
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:56,680
To see me?

21
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,578
Do you have something to tell me?

22
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:07,688
I...

23
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:09,939
I've asked Director Xie.

24
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,928
Your stomach is still recovering.
You can't stay up late

25
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:15,272
or drink alcohol.

26
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:20,872
And...

27
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:24,936
And...

28
00:02:27,138 --> 00:02:28,219
And...

29
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:33,928
Breakfast is a must.
You can't be on an empty stomach.

30
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:38,600
I know.

31
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:40,618
Did you have breakfast today?

32
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:41,992
I...

33
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:43,784
I...

34
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:45,448
Come with me...

35
00:02:50,898 --> 00:02:51,784
To the canteen.

36
00:02:53,418 --> 00:02:54,344
Okay.

37
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:06,499
That video.

38
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:07,688
Dr. Qin.

39
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:10,298
Miss Su, you're here.

40
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:11,560
Ms. Han.

41
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:12,616
Wait.

42
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:15,240
Perfect match.

43
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:17,539
I just watched that video.

44
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,059
All the nurses here watched it.

45
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:22,219
You two really are a perfect match.

46
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:23,499
Truly a perfect match.

47
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:24,520
What video?

48
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:26,618
Just that...

49
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:31,059
Video.

50
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:34,418
You two on the beach.

51
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:38,259
Miss Su, are you two together now?

52
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,819
Are you here to ask Dr. Qin for a date?

53
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,659
Let me tell you. It's great.

54
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:47,578
This long-time single
has finally entered a new relationship.

55
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:48,458
You don't know he...

56
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:50,184
Ms. Han, it's not what you think.

57
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:52,738
It was just a game.

58
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:55,698
You were there, weren't you?

59
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:59,339
A-A-A game?

60
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:01,178
Yes, you misunderstood.

61
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:04,059
Miss Su came here today
for a stomach recheck.

62
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,339
So, you're saying
I got my hopes up for nothing.

63
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:08,898
Okay, you two go ahead.

64
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,184
Oh.

65
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:23,498
What did you want to say?

66
00:04:26,818 --> 00:04:30,298
Nothing. I've got some work
to do in my studio.

67
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:31,464
You eat by yourself.

68
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:32,680
It won't take much time.

69
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:34,378
Being misunderstood feels terrible.

70
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:36,258
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

71
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:48,584
What happened?

72
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,298
What exactly happened?

73
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,480
That's not yours. This is yours.

74
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:05,378
Did someone upset you?

75
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:07,656
No.

76
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:10,440
I need to try again.

77
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,096
Let's take a picture.

78
00:05:22,828 --> 00:05:24,364
(The happiness of two single women)

79
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:33,139
Here.

80
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,088
Thank you.

81
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:34,979
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

82
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:36,899
Yunsheng, look.

83
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,504
Bro.

84
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:44,456
Look at his mouth.

85
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:45,899
The disdainful curl to his lips.

86
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:50,888
Why?

87
00:05:50,888 --> 00:05:51,818
What?

88
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,459
It looks like he's troubled by love.

89
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:55,539
Today, I saw Su Ying

90
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,738
storm out of the hospital.

91
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:59,019
It's so obvious.
He must have annoyed her.

92
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:00,738
How could I?

93
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:02,659
Let me tell you.

94
00:06:03,178 --> 00:06:05,498
You have really let down
Su Ying's sincere heart.

95
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:07,858
She even gave you a gift today.

96
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:09,139
What? There's a gift?

97
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:10,504
For Yunsheng?

98
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:11,899
- Give me.
- Let me show you.

99
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:20,938
The strokes are so detailed.

100
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:22,418
The person who painted it

101
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:24,459
invested a lot of her time and energy.

102
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,178
Yunsheng, you must reciprocate.

103
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:27,304
Right?

104
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:29,384
Reciprocate what?

105
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:30,600
What should he give her?

106
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:34,024
Wait a moment.

107
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:38,760
How cute.

108
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:40,579
Not curling your lips now?

109
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,699
(Bar)
It's different.

110
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:42,632
Look.

111
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:45,058
This is the prize I won today.

112
00:06:45,378 --> 00:06:46,339
How about this?

113
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:48,378
This is free support from me.

114
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:49,258
What is this?

115
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:50,219
Couple outfits, bro?

116
00:06:51,298 --> 00:06:52,200
Look at it.

117
00:06:53,298 --> 00:06:54,539
She painted you so handsome.

118
00:06:55,258 --> 00:06:56,168
What is it called?

119
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:58,378
"Beauty lies in the lover's eyes."

120
00:06:58,738 --> 00:07:00,219
This little round face is so cute.

121
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:01,539
Okay then.

122
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:01,858
Isn't it?

123
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:03,298
Let me take a picture
of it for Su Ying now.

124
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:07,099
Bro, Su Ying posted
something on her Moments.

125
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,019
(The happiness of two single women.)

126
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:15,498
Where is the beer?

127
00:07:18,258 --> 00:07:19,178
Just arrived?

128
00:07:19,178 --> 00:07:20,616
Okay, you sit.

129
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:22,952
Pour me a glass of beer.

130
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:28,140
(Garden Road No. 123)

131
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:45,579
(Mingshi, deliver something to Meichi
for me tomorrow.)

132
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:48,136
(Okay.)

133
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:56,648
Yunsheng,

134
00:07:58,618 --> 00:07:59,618
where's your marble labyrinth?

135
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,858
Can I borrow it?

136
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:02,459
No problem.
Let me get it for you.

137
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:03,720
Alright.

138
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:09,219
It seems to be over there.
I'll find it.

139
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:10,504
Thanks.

140
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:16,618
Yunsheng, what shall we have for lunch?

141
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,176
Why are you here?

142
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:21,019
I am here to borrow
his marble labyrinth.

143
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:24,456
Zhang Yisen.

144
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:30,920
You took it away, right?

145
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:31,979
What?

146
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,738
What can it be? Give me.

147
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:34,632
No.

148
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:36,552
Is anyone there?

149
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:37,768
Someone's here for you.

150
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,219
Mingshi, you're here.

151
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:45,352
Dr. Qin, this is
a little gift for everyone

152
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:46,538
that Ying asked me to bring.

153
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:48,232
Okay, give it to me.

154
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:50,792
It's not for you.

155
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,928
She asked me to give it
to Zhang Yisen. Is he here?

156
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:56,264
A gift to me?

157
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:57,699
Yes, Dr. Zhang.

158
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:00,339
This is something Ying
specifically asked me to pass on to you.

159
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:02,498
A gift from Miss Su?

160
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:03,624
Yes.

161
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:07,080
What is it?

162
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,738
It's just a few small portraits

163
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:10,138
that Ying drew for everyone.

164
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:12,179
Small portraits drawn by Miss Su.

165
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:19,624
- Isn't this me?
- What a good likeness.

166
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:20,968
Am I this handsome?

167
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:26,024
And Director Ruan.

168
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:30,056
And Hai.

169
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:34,728
What about Yunsheng?

170
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:52,939
Dr. Qin, no need to see me off.
I'm almost there.

171
00:09:53,498 --> 00:09:54,378
It's the least I could do.

172
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:56,939
It's just a few hundred meters away.

173
00:09:58,059 --> 00:09:58,920
Alright.

174
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,456
Mingshi.

175
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:03,459
Dr. Qin, what's wrong?

176
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:09,288
You walked here?

177
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:10,699
Just a few hundred meters.

178
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:11,579
I walked here.

179
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:12,898
Coming here by car
would be convenient.

180
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:14,792
Something's up?

181
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:18,408
The weather's nice.

182
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,480
I think it's going to rain.

183
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:24,138
Well, Mingshi.

184
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,176
I have a question.

185
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:28,979
Go ahead.

186
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:31,459
Is there any particular reason
for you designers

187
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,618
to draw sketches for people?

188
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:36,738
Any particular reason?
I can't say there is.

189
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:37,979
We just often give

190
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:39,819
some gifts and such

191
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,059
to our clients and friends.

192
00:10:42,898 --> 00:10:43,816
So, no specific reason.

193
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,059
So Su Ying...

194
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,299
I saw her Moments.

195
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:51,138
She is on a break?

196
00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:52,059
She's not on a break.

197
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,738
She's just taking it easy.

198
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:57,018
A couple of days ago,
she and Huixuan...

199
00:10:58,979 --> 00:10:59,979
(Huixuan: Happy being single.)

200
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:02,179
Happy being single?

201
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:04,648
Who?

202
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:06,312
She...

203
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:08,618
She's enjoying her single life so much.

204
00:11:11,618 --> 00:11:13,419
She's enjoying her single life?

205
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,339
Bye, Huixuan.

206
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:20,232
Bye.

207
00:11:20,936 --> 00:11:21,858
Huixuan.

208
00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:22,459
Mingshi.

209
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:23,898
Let me give you a ride.

210
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:25,898
No, no need. Just do your things.

211
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:29,579
Why haven't you come to the company

212
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:30,664
for Ying as often recently?

213
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:32,059
I go to her place.

214
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:35,099
Have you been busy with work recently?

215
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:37,339
Work is alright.

216
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:41,099
It's just some interpersonal relations.

217
00:11:43,898 --> 00:11:44,744
It's nothing.

218
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:48,538
Is there anyone

219
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:50,419
who you've recently found
is particularly annoying?

220
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:51,819
It was my fault.

221
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:54,699
I shouldn't have drunk.

222
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:56,219
Drinking?

223
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,056
Let's not talk about it.

224
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:03,720
I'm done.

225
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:06,579
I'm done. I was too impulsive.

226
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:07,496
You're back.

227
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:09,384
How is it?

228
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:11,419
Has it been sent?

229
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:12,712
What?

230
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:15,618
Yes, it's sent.

231
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:16,459
What's the reaction?

232
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:18,179
They asked me to say
"thank you" to you for them.

233
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:19,699
Not them.

234
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:21,339
What's Dr. Qin's reaction?

235
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:23,339
Dr. Qin.

236
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,219
No reaction.

237
00:12:25,219 --> 00:12:26,152
No reaction?

238
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:29,658
Not even a little?

239
00:12:30,018 --> 00:12:32,819
I may not have paid attention.

240
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:36,200
Aw, man.

241
00:13:39,658 --> 00:13:41,138
Isn't it coming?

242
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:44,858
Can you help check the glass house?

243
00:13:45,538 --> 00:13:46,979
I would like to do an environment test.

244
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:51,179
Dr. Qin asked me to do
an environment test for him

245
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:52,339
this afternoon.

246
00:13:54,138 --> 00:13:55,738
Tell Chen and Ye to go there.

247
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,299
Okay, are you going too?

248
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:05,384
You're here.

249
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:07,144
Dr. Qin,

250
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:10,018
today, we are here to do
an environment test as post-sales,

251
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:12,898
which is mainly about wind speed, noise
and the ventilation system.

252
00:14:13,258 --> 00:14:14,258
to see if there's any problem.

253
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:15,528
Su Ying isn't here?

254
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:16,819
She is out...

255
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:19,018
She is busy with other cases out there.

256
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,299
Come on in.

257
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:22,280
- Okay.
- Okay.

258
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:36,979
The highlight is to follow.

259
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:38,632
Dr. Qin,

260
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:40,072
it's the tulip

261
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:42,219
you gave to Ying before.

262
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:43,898
She said although it looked nice,

263
00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:45,320
she couldn't grow it well.

264
00:14:45,658 --> 00:14:46,632
So she let me take it back.

265
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:48,378
Putting it in the glass house
might be better.

266
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:55,858
Isn't it well looked after?

267
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:03,378
Is there any other reason

268
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,299
why she sent this back?

269
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:06,579
Dr. Qin,

270
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:08,898
did you upset Ying recently?

271
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:12,219
She loved to come here before.

272
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:15,939
Why do you say that?

273
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,419
Perhaps a careless word might

274
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,138
cause the other person
to distance themselves

275
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:24,099
or develop feelings of avoidance.

276
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:31,819
Why did they even start talking?

277
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:45,618
Hello, Miss Su.

278
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:48,219
Don't speak.

279
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:49,538
Just leave your phone there.

280
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:51,059
I'll be listening.

281
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:52,776
Act natural.

282
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:53,704
Yes.

283
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:54,632
She's got her hands full.

284
00:15:54,632 --> 00:15:55,560
There's been too much work.

285
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,456
Yes, too many projects.

286
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,498
Has she been in a good mood

287
00:15:58,699 --> 00:15:59,624
or working overtime?

288
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:00,968
Yes, sometimes.

289
00:16:01,538 --> 00:16:03,738
But she has meals on time every day.

290
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:05,928
That's good.

291
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:08,738
Good job. I'll give you a reward.

292
00:16:09,738 --> 00:16:10,632
Thank you, Miss Su.

293
00:16:12,498 --> 00:16:13,339
Who are you talking to?

294
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:16,008
No one.

295
00:16:16,658 --> 00:16:17,699
Is Su Ying at the office today?

296
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:18,824
- Yes.
- Yes.

297
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:20,538
I'll go there with you.

298
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,498
- Dr. Qin.
- We haven't started the test yet.

299
00:16:22,618 --> 00:16:24,059
No need.
I've just tested it. It's normal.

300
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:37,288
How annoying.

301
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:44,328
Don't forget your stuff.

302
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:45,576
Let's go.

303
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:49,000
Wait for me.

304
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:52,072
What's wrong, Dr. Qin?

305
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:53,800
Nothing.

306
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:18,699
Dr. Qin, Ying is probably in her office.

307
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:33,979
Dr. Qin, what brings you here?

308
00:17:40,338 --> 00:17:41,419
Are you working out?

309
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:43,538
Yeah, exercising.

310
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:44,818
To relieve stress.

311
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:47,080
And dressed like this?

312
00:17:48,018 --> 00:17:48,859
A sudden whim.

313
00:17:59,018 --> 00:17:59,912
Well.

314
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:01,160
Please sit.

315
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:05,352
Here's the thing.

316
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,058
I gave you the seed.

317
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:10,792
But I forgot to tell you
the instructions. That's my oversight.

318
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:13,659
Dr. Qin, you are quite considerate.

319
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:15,659
You could just send me a WeChat message.

320
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:16,979
You don't have to come here.

321
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:19,619
Don't you often come to my glass house

322
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:21,859
over small matters?

323
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:24,538
You are my client.

324
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:25,544
And I am the designer.

325
00:18:25,699 --> 00:18:27,784
That's what I should do. Never mind.

326
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,936
No more practice?

327
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:37,896
Done practicing.

328
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:39,944
Okay.

329
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,640
Since you're done,

330
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:44,619
put on your shoe.

331
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:00,298
Bai, I've recently found a new toy.

332
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:04,538
It's a great way to exercise your hands.

333
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:06,139
Look, it's called

334
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:08,338
a marble labyrinth.

335
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:10,248
Look.

336
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:15,304
It's really fun.

337
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:17,139
The marble goes round and round,

338
00:19:17,979 --> 00:19:18,920
and then it falls in.

339
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:22,699
Fun, right?

340
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:25,379
It's fun?

341
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:26,312
Fun.

342
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:33,578
When did you come? Go out.

343
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:35,419
I said you took it this morning.

344
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:37,258
What?

345
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:38,120
Give it to me.

346
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:42,459
I'm afraid it will make you sentimental.

347
00:19:42,818 --> 00:19:43,720
I'll buy you a new one.

348
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:45,864
You got a WeChat message.

349
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:48,744
You.

350
00:19:49,258 --> 00:19:50,379
This has a special use.

351
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,648
Others can't replace it. Understand?

352
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:00,018
What special use?
Isn't it just for hand exercises?

353
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:01,058
Well. At least,

354
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:02,179
tell me where you bought it.

355
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:04,098
I've already sent
the WeChat message to Bai.

(House Design)

357
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:11,699
Thank you, both of you,

358
00:20:12,098 --> 00:20:15,179
for preparing the design report
for Mr. Wang's sea-view apartment.

359
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:17,459
We're not in a hurry to compete today.

360
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:18,899
It's all about communication.

361
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:21,298
It's best to reach harmony
despite differences

362
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:22,419
and take the best.

363
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:25,258
We can't work together.

364
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:30,738
So let's start the competition.

365
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:32,459
Who's going first?

366
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:33,352
I'll go first.

367
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:35,738
Maybe Mr. Wang only
needs to hear one plan.

368
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:37,419
Please look at the screen.

370
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:49,659
Please look at the screen.

(First-Line Sea-View Room Design Report)

372
00:20:52,578 --> 00:20:53,544
Mr. Wang, look.

373
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:55,080
Your apartment is located

374
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,298
(Real Scene Analysis of Sea-View Room)
between two buildings,

375
00:20:57,699 --> 00:21:00,419
so it's right in the blustery zone.

376
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,379
The first issue we need to address then

377
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:03,379
is wind protection.

378
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:05,379
Yes, it must be resolved.

379
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:07,018
I can't even dry my clothes.

380
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:11,098
Right, the details in our design

381
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:13,699
all use imported materials.

382
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:14,920
Imported?

383
00:21:16,616 --> 00:21:17,538
Imported stuff?

384
00:21:17,538 --> 00:21:18,472
What's wrong?

385
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:22,459
The most cost-effective ones.

386
00:21:23,778 --> 00:21:24,859
I can accept that.

387
00:21:25,538 --> 00:21:26,408
No problem.

388
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:34,888
Mr. Su,

389
00:21:35,098 --> 00:21:36,680
do you have any great ideas to share?

390
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,179
Mr. Wang, this is my assistant, Mei.

391
00:21:41,498 --> 00:21:43,139
She is an excellent designer.

392
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:44,459
Mei, you go ahead.

393
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:46,568
Mr. Wang,

394
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:48,459
to show our sincerity,

395
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,098
we'd like to reduce the fee

396
00:21:50,298 --> 00:21:51,338
from 2,000 per square meter

397
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:53,219
to 300

398
00:21:53,699 --> 00:21:56,419
to save you a direct cost of 119,000.

399
00:21:56,818 --> 00:21:59,139
So I'll save 119,000.

400
00:21:59,258 --> 00:22:00,168
Yes, that's correct.

401
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:03,379
That's very nice, isn't it?

402
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:04,338
It's unreasonable for you

403
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:06,738
to invite me to the show
and charge me a design fee, right?

404
00:22:06,738 --> 00:22:07,818
That's very nice. I accept it.

405
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:10,578
You're not even going

406
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:12,699
to pay the construction cost, are you?

407
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:14,778
I'll charge the lowest price for it.

408
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:16,298
Yours can't be cheaper than mine.

409
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:18,699
I am sure to win you on price.

410
00:22:20,578 --> 00:22:22,298
You know this show will be aired, right?

411
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:24,072
Yes, I do.

412
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,018
Design fees are easy to increase.

413
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:29,578
As long as I can win against you.

414
00:22:36,258 --> 00:22:37,160
Oh, right.

415
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:39,379
Here is the floor plan
of the sea-view apartment.

416
00:22:39,939 --> 00:22:41,659
Additionally, we have a draft comparison

417
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,538
with Su Ziyang next Friday.

418
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:45,179
I remember it's Thursday.

419
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:46,472
Thursday?

420
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,258
Sorry, I got the time wrong.

421
00:22:57,818 --> 00:22:59,939
I forgot it in the printer.
I'll go get it now.

422
00:23:00,738 --> 00:23:01,608
Come back.

423
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:05,064
Sit down.

424
00:23:10,018 --> 00:23:10,920

Xu Mingshi!

426
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:16,179
What's wrong with you recently?

427
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:17,979
Acting so strangely.

428
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,018
Really?

429
00:23:20,018 --> 00:23:20,968
Really?

430
00:23:22,338 --> 00:23:23,304
Ying, I...

431
00:23:25,498 --> 00:23:26,376
How should I put it?

432
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:27,459
What do you mean?

433
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:29,576
What can't you tell me? Just say it.

434
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:30,824
Well,

435
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:34,818
I confessed to the girl
I've had a crush on for a long time.

436
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:35,880
You confessed?

437
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:37,139
Did you say...?

438
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:40,699
Who is she?

439
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:42,778
Just

440
00:23:42,778 --> 00:23:45,179
the girl I've liked
for a very long time.

441
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,419
We got drunk that day,

442
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:49,298
and then I just impulsively...

443
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:51,699
How did she react?

444
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:54,778
She seemed rather averse to it,

445
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:57,459
and she's been avoiding me ever since.

446
00:23:58,298 --> 00:23:59,659
When she mentioned it later,

447
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,018
she seemed to be regretful.

448
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:03,298
Ying, what should I do?

449
00:24:05,818 --> 00:24:08,298
Solve the problem the way it arose.

450
00:24:10,018 --> 00:24:10,920
How?

451
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,184
I want to drink this.

452
00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:27,979
No, you drink that.

453
00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:29,128
This is for Huixuan.

454
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:31,979
Doesn't she already have coffee?

455
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,419

00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:05,768
the one in cartoon style?

561
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:07,304
Because you're cute.

562
00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:09,352
Because I'm cute?

563
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:11,432
Like a child.

564
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:13,384
A child?

565
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:16,018
Don't you like being a child?

566
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:18,298
Then, be a good friend.

567
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:20,072
Good friend.

568
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:27,459
Let's go, good friend.

577
00:32:15,338 --> 00:32:16,659
It's too quiet. Play some music.

578
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:21,298
Huixuan, is it true
that some relationships,

579
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:22,899
once changed, can't be recovered?

580
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:27,419
It has already happened.

581
00:32:28,498 --> 00:32:29,379
How can it be reversible?

582
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:31,464
Really?

583
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:34,058
Has it really become this serious?

584
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:35,432
Yes.

585
00:32:35,738 --> 00:32:37,298
He's put it out in the open.

586
00:32:37,298 --> 00:32:38,179
What can I do?

587
00:32:39,098 --> 00:32:40,072
He?

588
00:32:40,298 --> 00:32:41,160
Huixuan,

589
00:32:41,298 --> 00:32:42,184
who are you talking about?

590
00:32:42,338 --> 00:32:43,272
Mr. Liu.

591
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:47,298
Do you remember that night, you...?

592
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,179
I remember it.

593
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:49,498
I was drunk that night.

594
00:32:49,498 --> 00:32:50,699
And I slapped him.

595
00:32:51,944 --> 00:32:52,859
And then?

596
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:54,899
I'll deal with the rest later.

597
00:32:58,939 --> 00:33:01,058
Do you remember that night,

598
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,088
I...

599
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:03,624
I...

600
00:33:04,578 --> 00:33:05,480
Remember what?

601
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:06,536
Nothing.

602
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:23,058
Could you please tell us

603
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:24,619
why you suddenly changed your mind

604
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:26,899
and decided to participate
in the sea-view apartment project?

605
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:28,738
I have a friend.

606
00:33:29,818 --> 00:33:31,338
At my most difficult time,

607
00:33:32,098 --> 00:33:33,419
he gave me a lot of help.

608
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,338
So influenced by him,

609
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:37,659
I would like to try

610
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:39,400
the new layout.

611
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:42,818
So the person must be
very special to you.

612
00:33:43,498 --> 00:33:44,392
Very special.

613
00:33:45,498 --> 00:33:47,298
He always traps himself in the past,

614
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:49,738
unwilling to face what he truly wants.

615
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:51,080
So,

616
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:54,778
I hope

617
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,419
he can break free
from the shackles of the past

618
00:33:57,859 --> 00:34:00,219
and courageously pursue what he wants.

619
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:03,560
Cut. That's it.

620
00:34:06,699 --> 00:34:08,979
Your interview just now
obviously hinted at something

621
00:34:09,218 --> 00:34:10,138
between the lines.

622
00:34:11,538 --> 00:34:13,259
(He always traps himself in the past,)

623
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,779
(unwilling to face what he truly wants.)

624
00:34:16,259 --> 00:34:17,299
(So I hope)

625
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:20,018
(he can break free
from the shackles of the past)

626
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,819
(and courageously pursue what he wants.)

627
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,939
It's been a day. Why hasn't she replied
to my WeChat messages yet?

628
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:47,178
Yunsheng, can you tell Bai...?

629
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:53,899
Poor boy.

630
00:35:27,899 --> 00:35:28,899
(Qin Yunsheng)
(My wish?)

631
00:35:35,578 --> 00:35:36,979
(Can you make some time tomorrow night?)

632
00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:39,339
(I know a good snack store.)

633
00:35:43,618 --> 00:35:44,552
(Su Ying)
(I'll have a meeting.)

634
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:45,832
(The day after tomorrow?)

635
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:48,296
(Qin Yunsheng)
(Surgery.)

636
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:49,832
(The day after that?)

637
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:54,018
(Su Ying)
(The day after that,)

638
00:35:55,538 --> 00:35:56,698
(I'll go to Donglin on business.)

639
00:36:07,116 --> 00:36:09,772
(Meichi International Hospital)

640
00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:13,178
I heard you and Su Ying did karaoke.

641
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:14,819
Tell me how it felt.

642
00:36:16,538 --> 00:36:17,416
It was pretty good.

643
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:19,058
What do you mean by "pretty good"?

644
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:21,578
What's your relationship status now?

645
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:23,336
Our relationship?

646
00:36:24,578 --> 00:36:25,448
It's pretty good too.

647
00:36:27,578 --> 00:36:28,584
Let me tell you.

648
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:29,768
Hai said

649
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:31,658
as long as you need the couple shirts,

650
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:32,744
it will be ready anytime.

651
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:36,200
Don't leave.

652
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:38,419
I've been really worried

653
00:36:38,419 --> 00:36:39,618
about your relationship.

654
00:36:40,018 --> 00:36:41,058
I've given it a lot of thought.

655
00:36:41,538 --> 00:36:43,578
Su Ying's post on her Moments
was clearly for you to see,

656
00:36:43,899 --> 00:36:44,819
which showed her care,

657
00:36:45,138 --> 00:36:46,138
so you should be proactive.

658
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:49,224
I did take the initiative.

659
00:36:50,979 --> 00:36:51,944
I tried asking her out.

660
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:53,416
That's good.

661
00:36:53,939 --> 00:36:54,888
She's on a business trip.

662
00:36:56,218 --> 00:36:57,658
It's not a big deal.

663
00:36:57,939 --> 00:36:59,538
My Bai is on the other side
of the ocean.

664
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:00,819
She's just on a business trip.

665
00:37:00,979 --> 00:37:03,272
She didn't leave the Earth, so you...

666
00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:07,816
Take the initiative.

667
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:21,992
What do you think?

668
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:23,240
Is it hard?

669
00:37:24,939 --> 00:37:27,058
The problems of space
and lighting are easy to solve.

670
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,058
The apartment is small,

671
00:37:30,058 --> 00:37:31,779
but the layout is not bad,
square and proper.

672
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:35,339
I just need to make it have
a sense of space and a good layout.

673
00:37:36,618 --> 00:37:38,779
Or actually, a one-way mirror
can be installed here

674
00:37:39,098 --> 00:37:40,419
for visual depth.

675
00:37:40,618 --> 00:37:43,098
The whole space will appear
at least twice as large,

676
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:45,098
and it's easy to install.

677
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:47,658
Most importantly,
it's cheap and suitable for Wang Zili.

678
00:37:50,578 --> 00:37:53,339
As for how to make this vertical view
into a horizontal one,

679
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:55,819
I need to think about it.

680
00:37:56,779 --> 00:37:58,299
And this apartment faces west.

681
00:37:58,618 --> 00:38:00,939
The sunshine
in the afternoon is very strong.

682
00:38:04,098 --> 00:38:05,859
I wonder

683
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:07,379
how far along Su Ziyang is.

684
00:38:07,658 --> 00:38:08,578
It's not proper to ask.

685
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:11,538
Never mind. They do their work.

686
00:38:11,538 --> 00:38:12,379
We focus on our own.

687
00:38:13,018 --> 00:38:13,960
Don't mind them.

688
00:38:14,899 --> 00:38:15,819
Measure the room, Mingshi.

689
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:16,098
Okay.

690
00:38:16,098 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm going upstairs.

691
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,712
Director Ruan.

692
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:46,299
Come and take a seat.

693
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:49,256
Director, you're still busy
with work at noon.

694
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:50,819
I'll give you a task.

695
00:38:52,419 --> 00:38:53,384
Here's the thing.

696
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:54,760
Many medical colleges

697
00:38:55,618 --> 00:38:57,859
want our hospital's doctors
to give lectures.

698
00:38:58,498 --> 00:38:59,498
I know you're all very busy,

699
00:38:59,498 --> 00:39:00,779
but we can't refuse all of them.

700
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,819
Yunsheng, how about you do it?

701
00:39:09,218 --> 00:39:10,184
Lectures for students?

702
00:39:14,299 --> 00:39:15,459
Yisen can do it.

703
00:39:17,178 --> 00:39:20,138
Director, I'll respectfully accept it.

704
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:25,658
Yunsheng, I ask you to go

705
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:28,218
because cardiac surgery
is our hospital's flagship department.

706
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:30,379
Besides, most of the medical students

707
00:39:30,939 --> 00:39:33,800
aspire to the sacred operating table
of cardiac surgery,

708
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,698
don't they?

709
00:39:34,698 --> 00:39:35,592
Yes.

710
00:39:35,592 --> 00:39:37,979
Director, I disagree with that.

711
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:40,899
Who are the ones
who bring patients back to the living?

712
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:43,058
Who are experiencing the flavors of life

713
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:45,379
and dedicating themselves
at the ordinary working post?

714
00:39:45,618 --> 00:39:46,739
It's us, the ED.

715
00:39:47,058 --> 00:39:49,618
So the operating table
of our department is more sacred.

716
00:39:49,899 --> 00:39:51,698
So I think Yisen must go.

717
00:39:53,379 --> 00:39:54,259
Thinking you're noble?

718
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:55,624
I'm going then?

719
00:39:56,098 --> 00:39:57,618
Okay, pick one.

720
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,859
I'll give you an extra day
for your business trip.

721
00:40:02,218 --> 00:40:03,578
Go on weekend. I'll make it up for you.

722
00:40:04,098 --> 00:40:05,578
Really? There's one more day off?

723
00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:07,880
Help choose for me.

724
00:40:09,736 --> 00:40:10,668
(Qingyu Medical University)

725
00:40:10,764 --> 00:40:11,692
(Donglin Medical College)

726
00:40:13,484 --> 00:40:14,956
(Donglin Medical College)

727
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:17,896
Dong...

728
00:40:18,259 --> 00:40:19,859
How about Donglin, Director?

729
00:40:20,299 --> 00:40:21,192
It's very good, Donglin.

730
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:23,018
With the sea breeze and the sun,

731
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:24,008
it's especially fantastic.

732
00:40:24,008 --> 00:40:24,899
I'll go to Dong...

733
00:40:24,899 --> 00:40:25,832
I'll go.

734
00:40:26,618 --> 00:40:28,018
I just promised Yisen.

735
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:31,259
It's like this.

736
00:40:31,538 --> 00:40:33,618
I thought about it.

737
00:40:34,538 --> 00:40:36,779
Our hospital is recruiting

738
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:40,018
interns, right?

739
00:40:40,018 --> 00:40:42,379
And our cardiology department
is short-staffed.

740
00:40:42,379 --> 00:40:43,528
I'll go to Donglin Medical College

741
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:44,658
to give a lecture

742
00:40:45,018 --> 00:40:47,339
and take the opportunity
to promote our department.

743
00:40:50,178 --> 00:40:51,739
Okay, since there's no objection,
I'm leaving.

744
00:40:54,178 --> 00:40:55,112
I'll go prepare.

745
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:56,808
Help me dump it.

746
00:41:00,098 --> 00:41:00,968
What's wrong with him?

747
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:02,259
Isn't this what you said?

748
00:41:02,618 --> 00:41:05,339
There are beaches,
a sea breeze and a vacation.

749
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:07,859
H-H-He is just too lofty.

750
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,578
I'll eat his share so as not to waste.

751
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:26,152
Hello.

752
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:27,848
Hard work, Dr. Qin.

753
00:41:28,058 --> 00:41:28,899
Hello, Director Li.

754
00:41:28,899 --> 00:41:30,058
Welcome to our school.

755
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:31,379
The students are excited.

756
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:32,744
You are too kind.

757
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:33,939
Everything is arranged.

758
00:41:34,178 --> 00:41:35,739
Our school is near this hotel.

759
00:41:35,939 --> 00:41:37,259
Why don't you rest first?

760
00:41:37,259 --> 00:41:38,178
Sure, okay.

761
00:41:38,178 --> 00:41:39,080
Come help Dr. Qin.

762
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:40,058
I can do it myself.

763
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:41,192
Okay.

764
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:42,152
Let's go in.
