Why are you up so early?

23
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:31,778
Because I sleep early.

Huixuan.

38
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:24,979
- Huixuan.
- Huixuan.

39
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,312
I brought you snacks.

40
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:27,379
Thank you.

00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:32,968

00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:05,139
Chen, get them hazelnut-flavored coffee.

50
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:09,618
But you usually do that yourself.

51
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:12,819
I-I have work to do. Go ahead.

52
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:21,128
New flavor today.

53
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:24,658
Thank you for promoting my channel.

54
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,418
Promoting your channel?

55
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:30,819
Didn't you tell Baozou Coconut
to repost my videos?

56
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:32,904
No, I didn't.

57
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:35,778
Could it be...

58
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,259
Huixuan, here's
your hazelnut-flavored coffee.

59
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:43,400
Thank you.

60
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:45,800
Wait.

61
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:53,259
Give this to Mingshi.

62
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:55,912
Okay.

63
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:03,619
I guess Mingshi
is still deeply in love with you.

64
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:07,560
How is he doing?

65
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:09,128
What do you think?

66
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:11,858
He's focusing on work.

67
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:14,619
That's good.

68
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:19,499
Mingshi, Huixuan told me
to bring you this coconut jelly.

69
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:20,808
Enjoy it.

70
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:23,240
Really? Well...

71
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:25,538
Did she say something?

72
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,600
No.

73
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:27,898
Nothing?

74
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,576
Nothing.

75
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:31,464
Thanks.

76
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:33,338
You're acting weird.

77
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:43,019
And you? How are you?

78
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:44,392
Me?

79
00:05:45,298 --> 00:05:46,379
My work is going well.

80
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:49,699
How's it going with Dr. Qin?

81
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:54,408
Mi Su

82
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:56,499
had a twin sister, who just

83
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:57,939
came back from abroad.

84
00:05:58,418 --> 00:05:59,379
Twin sister?

85
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,739
So they look identical?

86
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:09,579
She's been studying abroad

87
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:12,179
on a new technology.

88
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,739
She brought Dr. Qin a solution

89
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:16,179
for Lele's surgery.

90
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,538
Aren't you worried

91
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:21,499
that she's going to be around Dr. Qin

92
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:23,208
all day long?

93
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:25,858
What for?

94
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,400
Am I not excellent?

95
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:29,858
You are.

96
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,298
It's good that she can help Dr. Qin.

97
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:35,819
And he told me that

98
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:38,458
he'd handle things properly.

99
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:40,264
That's good enough.

100
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:42,499
You should trust Dr. Qin.

101
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:45,832
I trust him.

102
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:56,298
Director, I heard that
Mi Bai studied artificial hearts abroad.

103
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:58,939
Are we introducing new technology?

104
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,168
Of course.

105
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:02,978
I think Mi Bai studied it

106
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:04,978
for her big sister.

107
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:09,139
What a pity. Mi Su didn't make it
until the operation was available.

108
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:12,538
If she managed to pull through,

109
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:17,059
she'd be as excellent as Mi Bai.

110
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:21,179
Even we feel sorry for her,

111
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:23,458
let alone Yunsheng and Mi Bai.

112
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:28,819
That's it. Let's go to Ward 3.

113
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:29,672
Okay.

114
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:47,500
(Mi Bai, Medical Director)

115
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:57,768
Come in.

116
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:07,819
Ying, I bet you're thirsty.
Have some water.

117
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:09,224
Thank you.

118
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,298
Are you hungry? Want something to eat?

119
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:14,088
No, thanks.

120
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:20,379
Your table is kind of dusty.
Let me clean it.

121
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:25,128
So dirty.

122
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:32,339
You want to know
what we talked about, right?

123
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:35,912
What did you talk about?

124
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:38,898
She cares about you.

125
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,339
And I told her

126
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,178
that you are focusing on the work.

127
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:44,778
She is happy for you.

128
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:47,099
Anything else?

129
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,379
And...

130
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,739
And

131
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,619
she cherishes her friendship with you.

132
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:59,259
You should give her some time and space.

133
00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:01,139
Like I said.

134
00:09:01,418 --> 00:09:03,658
Get the tempo and vibe right.

135
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:06,058
Make her slowly accept you.

136
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:09,459
Okay, I see.

137
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:12,680
This is for you.

138
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:14,504
What is it?

139
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:16,859
These are the clients I worked with,

140
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:18,658
all related to the video channel.

141
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,418
Visit them on behalf of our firm

142
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,019
and promote for Huixuan.

143
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:27,176
Thank you.

144
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:28,392
What for?

145
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:29,619
I also care about her.

146
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,658
Okay, I'll go back to work then.

147
00:09:33,418 --> 00:09:34,376
Go ahead.

148
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:38,696
Thank you.

149
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:54,898
Good news.

150
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:58,298
We're preparing for Lele's surgery.

151
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:00,099
Here comes

152
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,979
the most important surgery

153
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:03,418
after your return.

154
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:06,058
I must encourage you.

155
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:08,648
Encourage me? How?

156
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:11,658
Come to my place. I'll cook for you.

157
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:13,960
Okay.

158
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:15,816
- Yunsheng.
- See you at night.

159
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:20,379
How's it going
with Lele's operation plan?

160
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:23,459
Almost done. I'm waiting
for the director to confirm it.

161
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:24,968
That's great.

162
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,072
Dr. Qin. Dr. Mi.

163
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:30,739
Lele is gone.

164
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:39,058
Ms. Han, have you seen Lele?

165
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:40,339
No, why?

166
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:41,896
She's missing.

167
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:43,499
Have you searched other floors?

168
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:45,099
Not yet.

169
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:46,139
I'll check the surveillance.

170
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:47,418
- Stay calm.
- I'll check over there.

171
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:48,616
Okay.

172
00:10:58,418 --> 00:10:59,259
Have you seen Lele?

173
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:00,872
No.

174
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:03,688
Lele.

175
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:06,248
Lele.

176
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:07,496
Lele.

177
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:39,778
I hope she's fine.

178
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:45,100
(Found her.)

(Clinical Lab, Operating Theater)

180
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:55,560
Lele, what's wrong?

181
00:11:57,298 --> 00:11:58,619
I don't want the surgery anymore.

182
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:06,339
Are you scared?

183
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:15,400
You know?

184
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:17,778
Many cardiologists

185
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:19,778
care about your well-being.

186
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:21,898
We're working hard.

Trust us.

189

We cured you seven years ago.

190
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,418
We can do the same

191
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:33,099
seven years later.

192
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:34,499
Yeah, Lele.

193
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:39,099
Believe in Dr. Qin and me, okay?

194
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:46,898
Mi Su has passed away, right?

195
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:01,128
Come in.

196
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:03,208
Director.

197
00:13:04,178 --> 00:13:05,160
Yunsheng, what's the matter?

198
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,938
Wang Lele's surgery has to be delayed.

199
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:12,552
Why?

200
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:14,139
She's quite emotional

201
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:16,259
and refuses any checkups.

202
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:18,698
She also stopped fasting and had snacks.

203
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:22,859
Besides, she's very negative
about the surgery now.

204
00:13:23,818 --> 00:13:24,680
We have to delay it

205
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:26,619
just in case.

206
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:28,058
When will we do it?

207
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:29,698
I'm not sure yet.

208
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:32,898
But we don't have much time.
I spoke with her mom.

209
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:35,019
We'll try hard to change her mind.

210
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:38,920
Fine, hurry up.

211
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,392
Okay.

212
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:18,019
Lele, I didn't mean to lie to you.

213
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:19,739
I'm Mi Bai.

214
00:14:20,418 --> 00:14:22,178
Mi Su was my twin sister.

215
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:26,499
We look identical.

216
00:14:27,178 --> 00:14:29,578
That's why you mistook me for her.

217
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:34,099
I thought I could
bring you hope like that,

218
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:35,979
so I just...

219
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:37,739
Adults are all liars.

220
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:39,418
I'm used to it.

221
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:43,720
It's all my fault.

222
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:45,658
I shouldn't have lied to you.

223
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,058
How about this?

224
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:52,139
I promise I won't lie to you ever again.

225
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,658
Not even about your conditions.

226
00:14:57,979 --> 00:14:58,920
Alright?

227
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:04,219
Dr. Mi, I'm tired. Please leave.

228
00:15:13,898 --> 00:15:16,979
I made you chicken soup
to boost your energy.

229
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:18,658
Lele is about to have the surgery.

230
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:20,418
I will try my best to support you.

231
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:23,658
The surgery will be a huge success.

232
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:28,658
Lele's surgery

233
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:30,499
is getting delayed.

234
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:34,979
Why? She's not doing well?

235
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:37,928
She's in deep trouble.

236
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:41,578
She lost hope and wouldn't cooperate

237
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:43,859
after she found out

238
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,658
that Mi Su passed away.

239
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:50,056
I see.

240
00:15:53,739 --> 00:15:55,339
She just found out about it.

241
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:58,459
It's understandable
that she can't accept it.

242
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:01,818
But we're running out of time.

243
00:16:02,658 --> 00:16:03,592
You know?

244
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:06,778
She had the same problems
and shared a ward

245
00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:08,938
with Mi Su seven years ago.

246
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:11,538
And after my return,

247
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:14,139
she was back as my patient.

248
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:19,898
I really don't hope...

249
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:20,904
No way.

250
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:25,778
It won't go like that.
You'll figure something out.

251
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:27,019
I'll help you, okay?

252
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:43,219
Right, I'm going to
the bookstore tomorrow.

253
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:44,859
You're getting books?

254
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:48,040
No, it's for Lele.

255
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:50,920
She doesn't eat or talk.

256
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,859
She's only reading Jiang Dong's books.

257
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:55,578
I'll get a few books to make her happy.

258
00:16:57,698 --> 00:16:58,696
Jiang Dong?

259
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:05,772
(Director's Office)

260
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:07,304
Come in.

261
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:10,219
Ying, what's wrong?

262
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:12,979
You remember the project

263
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:14,138
of the writer's villa?

264
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:16,296
The villa?

265
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:17,378
Yeah.

266
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:18,338
Is the writer Jiang Dong?

267
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:19,528
Yeah.

268
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:20,979
Contact him now.

269
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,459
We're taking on the project.

270
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:24,360
Okay.

271
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:30,312
Okay, thank you.

272
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:34,858
Ying, I spoke to Jiang Dong.

273
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,138
The meeting is held tonight.

274
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:38,459
He writes suspense novels.

275
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:40,739
So he likes meeting people at night.

276
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:42,138
No problem.

277
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:45,939
Okay, here's the information
on the villa. Take a look.

278
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:51,179
Find his novels and send them to me.

279
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:52,578
Okay, I'll send them to your email.

280
00:17:53,778 --> 00:17:54,760
Lele.

281
00:17:55,298 --> 00:17:56,298
Look what I got you.

282
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,179
I've read this book. It's amazing.

283
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:02,138
A group of people
went to an old castle...

284
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:04,259
The murderer was the housekeeper.

285
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:09,000
And this one.

286
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:11,240
It's even better.

287
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:13,179
- A bunch of backpackers...
- The blind guy did it.

288
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:14,696
He wasn't really blind.

289
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:16,899
You've read the new book?

290
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:18,618
I've read all his published works,

291
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:21,019
except for the one being updated online.

292
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:30,298
Lele, I got your favorite cake.
Want a bite?

293
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:31,378
Leave me alone, okay?

294
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:32,739
I don't want to talk to you.

295
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:47,939
What do we do?
It's not good for the surgery

296
00:18:48,618 --> 00:18:50,138
if it goes on like this.

297
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,576
Let's keep trying. Be patient.

298
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:01,939
Ying, I checked the map.

299
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:03,858
His villa is quite far from here.

300
00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:05,179
It's more than two hours of driving.

301
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:07,699
I've traveled into the mountains

302
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:09,138
for B&B projects.

303
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:18,778
Ying, why did you suddenly decide
to take on Jiang Dong's project?

304
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:22,219
There's something personal.

305
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:25,219
This project is very important
to me right now.

306
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:29,659
You took me on
such an important project.

307
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:31,219
I swear I'll do my best.

308
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:35,720
You're talented.
I can see your potential.

309
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,058
Thank you for your trust.

310
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:53,138
Ying, Jiang Dong
is waiting for us in the study.

311
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:55,138
Enter the house and keep going.

312
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:56,424
The inner room.

313
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:02,312
Mr...

314
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:04,699
Mr. Jiang.

315
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:09,096
Ying.

316
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:11,688
This house is weird.

317
00:20:13,298 --> 00:20:14,618
Haven't you tried room escape?

318
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:15,778
Isn't that creepier?

319
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:19,464
See? It's just cotton. It's fake. Look.

320
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:20,520
It's okay.

321
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:23,272
But...

322
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:25,419
But I feel that...

323
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:26,728
It's okay.

324
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:27,659
Follow me.

325
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,058
Don't touch anything.

326
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:30,899
So many books.

327
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:34,338
Ying, is this really Jiang Dong's house?

328
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,578
Who would live here?

329
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,419
Maybe he needs to write
in a quiet place.

330
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,600
Please take a seat.

331
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:49,778
Can I help you?

332
00:20:55,939 --> 00:20:56,936
- Mr. Jiang.
- Mr. Jiang.

333
00:20:57,818 --> 00:20:58,888
We're here.

334
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:05,179
Sorry, I'm short-sighted.

335
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:14,408
Your best friend?

336
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:16,488
It's been years.

337
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:20,899
Let me introduce myself.

338
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,979
I'm Su Ying from SU Design Firm.

339
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:25,219
She's our designer Tian Mei.

340
00:21:25,704 --> 00:21:28,419
We came to discuss the main theme

341
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:31,219
of the renovation with you.

342
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:44,578
Mr. Jiang, you prefer
writing at night, right?

343
00:21:44,818 --> 00:21:47,578
Is it more inspiring to write at night?

344
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:49,979
Each author has a special habit.

345
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,459
Some look for inspiration
while sitting in a bathroom.

346
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:54,219
Some write while carrying a bow.

347
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,979
I'm pretty normal compared to them.

348
00:21:58,138 --> 00:21:59,058
This is normal?

349
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:00,136
Let go of it.

350
00:22:02,098 --> 00:22:03,179
It's pricy.

351
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:04,680
Sorry.

352
00:22:05,378 --> 00:22:07,618
Normal. Absolutely normal.

353
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:11,618
Every author has a unique habit.

354
00:22:11,778 --> 00:22:14,098
You can only produce great work

355
00:22:14,378 --> 00:22:17,778
like Dawn after the Dark Night
in a cozy environment.

356
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,058
You're reading my new book?

357
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,232
I read some.

358
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:27,739
But I prefer your early work.

359
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:30,058
Out of the Cocoon has a better taste.

360
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:34,504
Tell me

361
00:22:35,578 --> 00:22:36,520
about that taste.

362
00:22:38,138 --> 00:22:39,138
It's something

363
00:22:40,578 --> 00:22:43,739
peculiar and indescribable.

364
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:50,019
Excellent works allow the readers
to perceive them differently.

365
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:56,659
That's my hardcore fan.

366
00:22:58,618 --> 00:23:03,176
Ying is definitely your fan.

367
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:06,538
She gets your taste.

368
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:08,808
You've got the taste.

369
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:11,880
In fact,

370
00:23:12,338 --> 00:23:13,352
to be honest,

371
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:15,659
I read your books

372
00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:17,219
because I wanted to work with you.

373
00:23:17,538 --> 00:23:20,459
Of course, I've become your fan.

374
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:23,578
You read my books purposefully,

375
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:26,019
but I appreciate your work attitude.

376
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:29,618
You're meticulous.

377
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,019
No wonder you became
an excellent designer.

378
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,419
I'm flattered.

379
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:38,338
We've studied your information.

380
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:41,219
We came to discuss the main idea

381
00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:43,778
of the design.

382
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:45,128
Tian Mei.

383
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:48,419
Mr. Jiang, please take a look at our...

384
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,058
No need.
I asked for your service a week ago?

385
00:23:51,578 --> 00:23:52,456
Yeah.

386
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:54,664
That's right.

387
00:23:56,538 --> 00:23:59,818
So, you've already found a designer?

388
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:02,818
No, I simply changed my mind on it.

389
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:11,618
Mr. Jiang, feel free
to tell us your problems.

390
00:24:11,939 --> 00:24:12,899
We can discuss them.

391
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:14,459
Yeah, we came with great sincerity.

392
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:15,939
No need. I know.

393
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:19,219
I've always appreciated Miss Su's work.

394
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:20,979
I wanted to work with you.

395
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:21,858
Thank you.

396
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:22,856
But I changed my mind

397
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:25,179
due to some personal reasons.

398
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:27,176
Please forgive me.

399
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:29,019
I am

400
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:31,338
working on something

401
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:33,259
and I need inspiration.

402
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:34,979
Make yourself at home.

403
00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:35,944
I'll get back to work.

404
00:24:36,098 --> 00:24:37,960
For creation. You get it.

405
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:39,816
Make yourself at home.

406
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:41,064
Let's go.

407
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:42,659
Go find mommy.

408
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:44,219
Let's go.

409
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:48,776
Let's go.

410
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:53,138
I can work on the details and structure.

411
00:25:06,578 --> 00:25:08,578
Ying, I just don't get it.

412
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:11,138
Why did he suddenly turn us down?

413
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:13,578
Because we didn't
take on his project right away?

414
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:16,584
I don't think so.

415
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:20,899
What a weird writer. So unpredictable.

416
00:25:22,778 --> 00:25:24,298
He said it was something personal.

417
00:25:25,538 --> 00:25:28,259
If we find out
what it is and solve the problem,

418
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,378
then we may still have a chance.

419
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:11,618
(Do you have a minute?)

420
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:20,538
(Is it awkward to consult him now?)

421
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,780
(Mingshi)

422
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:42,920
Hello.

423
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:46,056
Hello, Huixuan. Do you have a minute?

424
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:49,064
May I ask you something about work?

425
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,899
- Go ahead.
- There's a bar owner

426
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:55,298
who wants a vlogger to film the bar

427
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:56,818
for a promotional video.

428
00:26:56,939 --> 00:26:58,739
You're an expert here.

429
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:01,298
So I'm calling to ask
if you're interested.

430
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:04,328
Alright.

431
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:06,419
Okay, I'll arrange for a meeting.

432
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,098
What time tomorrow?

433
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,459
Any time.

434
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:13,098
I'll inform you once we settle it.

435
00:27:13,739 --> 00:27:15,138
Here's his contact information.

436
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:16,378
You can start talking.

437
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:18,376
Okay.

438
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:19,784
Bye.

439
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:22,578
Well...

440
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:25,538
Thank you.

441
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:44,019
Yunsheng, I brought you coffee.

442
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:46,920
Thank you.

443
00:27:48,378 --> 00:27:49,448
It's hot.

444
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,912
And also, take a look at this.

445
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:03,208
What is it?

446
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:06,298
It's a case
of a successful treatment of CHD.

447
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:07,858
My friend abroad found it for me.

448
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:11,944
Let me see.

449
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:14,459
I think Lele is upset

450
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,778
partly because she lacks confidence.

451
00:28:17,338 --> 00:28:19,298
So I thought these successful cases

452
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:20,459
may encourage her.

453
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:23,899
And look.

454
00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:28,419
The medicines and the treatments adopted

455
00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:30,499
are similar to the ones we have adopted.

456
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:34,939
And here, the treatment plan.

457
00:28:35,578 --> 00:28:38,899
Here. If we show it to Lele

458
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,024
and encourage her, I bet she will have

459
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:44,419
greater confidence.

460
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:47,578
Okay, I'll look into it.

461
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:49,928
Go get some rest.

462
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:56,659
Some friends
will send me more cases in a while.

463
00:28:56,979 --> 00:28:58,019
I might as well wait here.

464
00:28:58,179 --> 00:29:00,378
We can discuss the details
once you read this.

465
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:06,459
It's okay. We can talk tomorrow.

466
00:29:07,138 --> 00:29:08,538
I have to write the surgery plan.

467
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:11,219
I can help you with that.

468
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,179
I know the technique the best.

469
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:19,459
It's okay. I have many things to read.

470
00:29:19,578 --> 00:29:21,378
I may stay up late.

471
00:29:22,298 --> 00:29:23,304
Go back and rest.

472
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:29,384
Alright.

473
00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:31,378
Take care.

474
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:36,648
Bye, Yunsheng.

475
00:29:55,052 --> 00:29:58,252
(Meichi International Hospital)

476
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,818
I heard Dr. Qin stayed up all night
for the surgery plan.

477
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:02,298
Exactly.

478
00:30:02,298 --> 00:30:03,499
It was Lele's case.

479
00:30:03,818 --> 00:30:04,776
Really?

480
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,778
Ms. Han.

481
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:08,712
Hello, Su Ying.

482
00:30:09,138 --> 00:30:10,098
Is Dr. Qin in his office?

483
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:11,979
He's in Director Ruan's office.

484
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:13,352
Okay, I'll find him.

485
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:14,408
Thank you.

486
00:30:17,739 --> 00:30:18,818
Dr. Qin is so lucky.

487
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:22,939
The director could have a cup of coffee.

488
00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:24,979
Mi Bai's plan

489
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:26,499
can solve the technical problems.

490
00:30:27,138 --> 00:30:28,008
I'm more reassured.

491
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:31,979
That's right. Mi Bai
will be the technical instructor.

492
00:30:32,378 --> 00:30:33,419
You'll be the first assistant.

493
00:30:34,538 --> 00:30:37,138
I have confidence in your teamwork.

494
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:39,659
Rest assured, Director.
We won't let you down.

495
00:30:39,858 --> 00:30:40,904
Okay, that's it.

496
00:30:44,778 --> 00:30:45,800
Hello, Su.

497
00:30:45,992 --> 00:30:46,858
Morning, Director.

498
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:47,578
Morning.

499
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:47,939
Well...

500
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:48,778
Su Ying.

501
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:49,778
Sorry to bother you.

502
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:51,179
Not at all.

503
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:52,338
We're almost done.

504
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:54,728
You stayed up all night?

505
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:56,499
Yeah.

506
00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:59,659
He was working on Lele's surgery.

507
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,858
And we just discussed the plans.

508
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:04,019
So many books?

509
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:06,179
I said I wanted to visit Lele.

510
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:07,138
How is she?

511
00:31:07,138 --> 00:31:08,104
We're going there.

512
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:09,499
Let's go together.

513
00:31:09,939 --> 00:31:10,824
Sure.

514
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:12,219
Sure. Go ahead.

515
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:14,739
See you, Director.

516
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,618
See you around.

517
00:31:16,618 --> 00:31:17,512
Okay, go ahead.

518
00:31:19,219 --> 00:31:21,858
These are similar cases abroad.

519
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:23,419
They're all cured.

520
00:31:25,098 --> 00:31:27,578
This girl called Cindy

521
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:28,744
is your age.

522
00:31:29,378 --> 00:31:31,499
The surgery went well for her.

523
00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:33,578
She's very healthy.

524
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,179
She can play with her friends

525
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:38,659
and go to school.

526
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:40,538
You'll be able to do that too.

527
00:31:44,098 --> 00:31:45,058
Rest assured, Lele.

528
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,298
Dr. Qin and I

529
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:49,578
will come up with the best plan for you

530
00:31:50,298 --> 00:31:51,618
and make you recover soon.

531
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:53,448
Yeah, Lele.

532
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:57,019
Mi Bai brought us
the latest operation plan.

533
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:59,538
You must have faith in yourself.

534
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:04,659
Who knows if you're lying to me?

535
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:15,298
Lele, I have some good news.

536
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:19,179
Your idol Jiang Dong is going to hold
a book signing for his new book.

537
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:22,459
You have to work with the doctors
to read his new book.

538
00:32:23,578 --> 00:32:25,298
Will he release the full Anatomy Diary?

539
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:27,618
What is that?

540
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:30,219
An old rich man allegedly died

541
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:32,858
from heart failure
according to his children.

542
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:34,739
And there was the Death Certificate.

543
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:37,320
But the heart failure was fabricated.

544
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:42,019
How do people fabricate that?

545
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:44,899
He stopped writing.

546
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,072
What?

547
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,538
Lele, I have some good news.

548
00:33:02,338 --> 00:33:05,378
Your idol Jiang Dong is going to hold
a book signing for his new book.

549
00:33:05,939 --> 00:33:08,338
You have to work with the doctors
to read his new book.

550
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,419
Latest book signing.

551
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,932
(Anatomy Diary)

552
00:33:29,058 --> 00:33:29,979
You stayed up all night.

553
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:33,219
Take a nap during the noon break.

554
00:33:36,578 --> 00:33:37,858
I can't sleep even if I want to.

555
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:42,459
I know you're worried
about Lele's surgery.

556
00:33:44,818 --> 00:33:46,618
She's been sick since an early age

557
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:49,098
and suffered for years.

558
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:52,264
It's understandable
that she has mood swings.

559
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:54,280
We will definitely

560
00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:56,378
figure something out.

561
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:00,648
I'll be with you.

562
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:09,299
Right, you remember
the story Lele mentioned?

563
00:34:11,698 --> 00:34:13,299
You mean forging a heart failure?

564
00:34:13,658 --> 00:34:15,618
Yeah, as a professional doctor,

565
00:34:15,738 --> 00:34:18,738
is there a way to do that?

566
00:34:22,779 --> 00:34:23,658
There might be.

567
00:34:24,538 --> 00:34:25,480
Tell me.

568
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:27,578
Tian Mei.

569
00:34:27,578 --> 00:34:27,939
Ying.

570
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:30,578
I think I know
why he canceled the renovation.

571
00:34:30,939 --> 00:34:31,979
Why?

572
00:34:31,979 --> 00:34:33,339
Do you remember all those

573
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:35,419
used draft paper
and empty bottles by his desk

574
00:34:35,538 --> 00:34:36,488
when we visited him?

575
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,544
Yeah.

576
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,258
When do the writers
and designers suffer the most?

577
00:34:42,658 --> 00:34:44,520
When they are stuck.

578
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,459
That's right, and I just found out

579
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,779
that his latest novel
stopped being updated.

580
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:49,819
He got stuck on a plot.

581
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:51,459
It's been exactly a week.

582
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:54,379
So his writing went into a bottleneck
this week and he was scared that

583
00:34:54,698 --> 00:34:56,058
the renovation would make it worse,

584
00:34:56,058 --> 00:34:57,738
so he decided to pause it.

585
00:34:58,098 --> 00:34:59,016
That's right.

586
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:01,138
That's the breakthrough we need.

587
00:35:02,939 --> 00:35:03,880
Alright, Ying.

588
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:06,178
I just finished
the draft plan for the renovation.

589
00:35:08,258 --> 00:35:09,698
The biggest problem lies in

590
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:11,499
the unanimous and depressing color.

591
00:35:11,698 --> 00:35:13,819
So I'm planning
to make color changes there.

592
00:35:14,218 --> 00:35:15,499
Adopt bright colors

593
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:17,178
to enhance the visual effect.

594
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:19,658
Maybe it can bring back
his desire for creation.

595
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:22,088
Good.

596
00:35:22,379 --> 00:35:23,432
Let me see.

597
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:25,459
Make an appointment with him.

598
00:35:27,379 --> 00:35:30,339
But he's turned us down.

599
00:35:30,618 --> 00:35:31,459
Will he meet us?

600
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,098
Don't say it's about the project.

601
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:36,859
Just tell him that I want to meet him

602
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:39,578
as a new fan to discuss the novels.

603
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:42,088
Got it.

604
00:35:44,218 --> 00:35:45,256
How do you like the plan?

605
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,008
It's good. I like it.

606
00:35:48,008 --> 00:35:48,939
Yeah.

607
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:49,939
Nice cinematography.

608
00:35:51,058 --> 00:35:52,499
I-I think it suits us.

609
00:35:52,658 --> 00:35:53,544
Mingshi.

610
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:57,218
Huixuan, this is Chen. This is Miss Du.

611
00:35:58,248 --> 00:35:59,178
Hello.

612
00:35:59,178 --> 00:36:00,578
- Hello, Miss Du.
- Nice to meet you.

613
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:04,058
Chen, look. These are Miss Du's works.

614
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:09,698
I listed ten videos here.

615
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,899
Chen, how do you like

616
00:36:13,098 --> 00:36:14,819
Miss Du's filming plan?

617
00:36:15,658 --> 00:36:17,658
I think it's a nice idea,

618
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:20,299
but I'm a bit concerned

619
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:22,098
about the final result.

620
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:24,379
Don't worry.

621
00:36:24,738 --> 00:36:26,499
This is only the draft plan.

622
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:29,379
I will come up with a script
and check the details with you.

623
00:36:30,258 --> 00:36:33,058
Have you watched the short video clip
that won the ADA Competition?

624
00:36:33,736 --> 00:36:34,698
Yeah.

625
00:36:34,698 --> 00:36:36,258
That's her work.

626
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:37,320
Really?

627
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:40,939
So I don't think you have to
worry about the visual effect.

628
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:43,058
She has the endorsement of SU.

629
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:44,578
Then I can be reassured.

630
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:47,138
Looking forward to working with you.

631
00:36:48,379 --> 00:36:49,578
I won't let you down.

632
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,339
We've been talking for so long.
Try our coffee.

633
00:36:52,618 --> 00:36:56,658
This is my collection of
Gesha coffee beans ground by hand.

634
00:36:56,899 --> 00:36:57,896
Let me try it.

635
00:37:00,178 --> 00:37:01,128
Smells good.

636
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:02,578
Nice.

637
00:37:02,578 --> 00:37:04,584
Please enjoy. I have work to do.

638
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:05,098
Okay.

639
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:05,698
Call me if needed.

640
00:37:05,698 --> 00:37:06,899
Alright, let's stay in touch.

641
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:07,880
Okay.

642
00:37:12,258 --> 00:37:13,459
Thank you.

643
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,658
No problem. I didn't do anything.

644
00:37:18,178 --> 00:37:20,578
And he's Ying's client.

645
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:22,459
Thank Ying if you want.

646
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:24,712
In fact...

647
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:26,538
I know your concerns.

648
00:37:27,218 --> 00:37:29,779
Don't worry. I won't say anything

649
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:30,658
pressuring again.

650
00:37:31,658 --> 00:37:33,258
Are we still friends?

651
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:35,419
Of course.

652
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,339
Good. So let's move on.

653
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:41,640
I have work to do. See you around.

654
00:38:02,258 --> 00:38:03,979
Steady, Xu Mingshi.

655
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,459
Miss Su, what's the plot
you'd like to discuss?

656
00:38:10,899 --> 00:38:12,339
Or you're here for the renovation.

657
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:17,224
Mr. Jiang, here's the thing.

658
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:20,299
I read in your novel

659
00:38:22,058 --> 00:38:24,819
that an old man died of heart failure,

660
00:38:25,299 --> 00:38:28,138
but it turned out
it was fabricated by his children.

661
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:30,258
But you still haven't

662
00:38:30,538 --> 00:38:33,738
told us how the protagonist
found out about it.

663
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:36,459
So you read my updates?

664
00:38:37,058 --> 00:38:37,960
Yeah.

665
00:38:38,218 --> 00:38:40,339
Honestly, I haven't figured out

666
00:38:40,939 --> 00:38:43,379
how to wrap things up here.

667
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:46,538
Details. The details matter.

668
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:49,256
I...

669
00:38:54,379 --> 00:38:55,336
I...

670
00:38:56,748 --> 00:38:57,644
(Editor Li)

671
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:01,459
You can pick it up first.

672
00:39:01,658 --> 00:39:02,504
Yeah, no rush.

673
00:39:02,504 --> 00:39:03,419
Yeah.

674
00:39:03,419 --> 00:39:04,979
It's okay. I bet it's the editor

675
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:06,538
asking me for updates.

676
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:08,488
Go on.

677
00:39:12,138 --> 00:39:13,578
I have an idea

678
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:15,419
if you don't mind it.

679
00:39:16,578 --> 00:39:17,480
I'm listening.

680
00:39:19,058 --> 00:39:23,138
So the children killed the old man
and called the police

681
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:26,459
to report it as an accident.

682
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:29,459
It was reported by the family,
so the emergency team

683
00:39:29,698 --> 00:39:30,779
only confirmed that

684
00:39:31,098 --> 00:39:33,019
the heart stopped working
with electrocardiography.

685
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:37,379
And the forensics proved
that there was no visible trauma.

686
00:39:37,618 --> 00:39:39,098
So it was ruled as a heart failure.

687
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:40,360
That's right.

688
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:44,379
I think you can add
a few pieces of information.

689
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:45,768
First.

690
00:39:47,299 --> 00:39:48,200
Wait.

691
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:50,696
Go on.

692
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:53,138
The body was purplish,

693
00:39:53,538 --> 00:39:55,379
which indicated a sudden death.

694
00:39:55,379 --> 00:39:58,859
A purplish body.
That's a perfect disguise.

695
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:03,738
So what killed the old man?

696
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:05,224
An electric shock.

697
00:40:09,779 --> 00:40:10,760
Why?

698
00:40:11,538 --> 00:40:13,939
An electric shock
breaks the capillaries,

699
00:40:14,258 --> 00:40:18,019
causes large areas of bruises,
and makes the body purplish.

700
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:25,299
Mr. Jiang, my boyfriend
is a cardiothoracic surgeon.

701
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,299
Really?

702
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,200
Yeah.

703
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,779
Go on.

704
00:40:28,779 --> 00:40:31,218
A person could have the heart dissected.

705
00:40:31,698 --> 00:40:34,578
As long as the old man's
coronary arteries

706
00:40:34,658 --> 00:40:36,819
are clear without any narrowing parts,

707
00:40:37,098 --> 00:40:39,299
we can rule out the possibility

708
00:40:39,618 --> 00:40:42,299
of insufficient blood supply
and acute hypoxia.

709
00:40:43,138 --> 00:40:45,578
You opened up a new world for me.

710
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:46,952
I can tell you.

711
00:40:47,379 --> 00:40:48,419
That's the detail.

712
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:49,899
Details matter.

713
00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:53,098
Mr. Jiang, I'm also an artist.

714
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:55,698
So I can totally relate.

715
00:40:55,899 --> 00:40:57,258
I've visited you twice.

716
00:40:58,218 --> 00:41:02,019
With all due respect,
the style of your house...

717
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:04,499
The colors are a bit unanimous.

718
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:08,178
It may hinder your innovation
if you stay in such an environment.

719
00:41:09,538 --> 00:41:10,568
Really?

720
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,178
Do you have any suggestions?

721
00:41:17,618 --> 00:41:18,536
Maybe

722
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,939
I should date a doctor.

723
00:41:25,738 --> 00:41:27,218
You can do that.

724
00:41:30,098 --> 00:41:31,578
Wait, let me think.

725
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:34,098
Listen, we came up
with a fundamental plan

726
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,019
for the renovation.

727
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:38,779
We believe that colors

728
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:40,339
serve as stimulants for brains.

729
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:46,339
Go on.

730
00:41:46,698 --> 00:41:49,738
Colors serve as stimulants
for human brains.

731
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:51,859
You have big rooms

732
00:41:52,258 --> 00:41:54,178
and plenty of space to adopt

733
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:57,138
different colors for different areas.
