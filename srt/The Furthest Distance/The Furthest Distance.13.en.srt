Go.

Be careful.

19
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:53,992
Sit up.

20
00:01:54,602 --> 00:01:55,528
Alright.

21
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:03,976
Mr. Yang.

22
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:02,243
I'm so dizzy.

23
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:08,520
Wine, baijiu, and whiskey.
Three kinds of liquor.

24
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:10,562
You mixed them all to drink.
You deserve it.

25
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:24,882
I'll go get you a towel.

26
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,328
Su Ying, come here.

27
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:31,603
- Su Ying.
- I'm coming.

28
00:03:33,402 --> 00:03:35,842
Don't rush me. You're sweating so much.

29
00:03:38,162 --> 00:03:39,763
Don't drink like this
in the future, understand?

30
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:40,616
Su Ying,

31
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,002
I don't like it.

32
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,882
I don't like you working with him.

33
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:48,882
I know...

34
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:51,483
I know I should be generous,

35
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,842
but I can't.

36
00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:58,408
Come here.

37
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:00,402
I want to tell you

38
00:04:01,682 --> 00:04:02,682
something.

39
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:05,002
That day, I went to him.

40
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:07,842
I told him...

41
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:11,962
To stay away from you.

42
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:18,920
Alright.

43
00:04:20,723 --> 00:04:21,963
I'll keep my distance from him.

44
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:49,603
So you're very jealous.

45
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:02,442
Time to get up, Dr. Qin.

46
00:05:09,723 --> 00:05:11,043
What the heck?

47
00:05:14,283 --> 00:05:15,176
Awake now?

48
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:17,288
Where's Su Ying?

49
00:05:17,403 --> 00:05:18,403
She left early in the morning.

50
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:19,963
She took care of you
all night last night.

51
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:21,736
Did you forget it?

52
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:22,920
Let me tell you.

53
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:26,403
Su Ying told me to make a cup
of honey water for you when she left.

54
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:28,008
She left.

55
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:31,002
It's good to be in a relationship.

56
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:33,202
Even when drunk,
there's a girlfriend to send you back.

57
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,363
Drink some honey water.

58
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:41,608
Let me ask you one thing.

59
00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:43,202
Yang Zhengwen likes Su Ying?

60
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:48,040
You know it?

61
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:49,672
Weren't you the one

62
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:51,483
who told me drunkenly last night?

63
00:05:52,283 --> 00:05:54,762
You didn't even tell me
about such a big thing before.

64
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:56,322
But don't worry.

65
00:05:56,762 --> 00:05:57,963
Even if he's a company's manager,

66
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,163
judging by the way Su Ying
took care of you yesterday, I can tell

67
00:06:01,803 --> 00:06:04,002
it's only you, and no one else
stands a chance.

68
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:07,723
I think you have no chance either.

69
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:09,363
You're just that confident.

70
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:14,322
I feel like vomiting.

71
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:15,163
Drink it.

72
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:21,002
Tian Mei, this is our firm's badge

73
00:06:21,363 --> 00:06:23,723
and some materials
I've sorted out for you to prepare.

74
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:24,648
Okay, thank you.

75
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:28,122
Tian Mei, here's a cushion for you.

76
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:29,442
We designers need to sit a lot.

77
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:30,843
It's good for your back.

78
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:32,163
For me?

79
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:33,483
No need.

80
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:35,043
Take it. Welcome to join us.

81
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,296
Take it.

82
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:37,483
Okay, thank you.

83
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:41,384
And me. Welcome to join us.

84
00:06:41,882 --> 00:06:44,122
This is too precious. I can't accept it.

85
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:46,122
It's your welcome gift.

86
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:49,642
And just relax in your daily work.

87
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,762
As long as we finish the tasks in time,

88
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:54,248
Ying usually leaves us alone.
It's very free.

89
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:58,082
Okay, thank you guys.

90
00:06:58,082 --> 00:06:59,043
Don't say that.

91
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:00,603
We're a family.

92
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,322
Right. With you here,

93
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:03,843
now we are...

94
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:05,736
- The Four Heavenly Kings.
- The Four Heavenly Kings.

95
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:06,984
The Four Heavenly Kings.

96
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:10,803
Coffee, desserts.

97
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:12,243
- Ying.
- Ying.

98
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:14,568
Here you are.

99
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:15,243
So much food.

100
00:07:15,243 --> 00:07:16,442
You've been working hard recently.

101
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:19,642
With everyone's efforts,

102
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:22,442
I've submitted all our plans.

103
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:24,562
So we're going to an island
together tomorrow.

104
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:26,322
- For vacation.
- For vacation.

105
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:29,963
- Thank you, Ying.
- Thank you, Ying.

106
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,016
Let's eat.

107
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:33,448
Tian Mei,

108
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,603
how is your first day of work?
Got used to it?

109
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,803
Yes, everyone is taking good care of me.

110
00:07:42,082 --> 00:07:43,016
Keep going.

111
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:44,488
I will.

112
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:03,784
(Qin Yunsheng)
(Thank you for last night.)

113
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:14,952
Dr. Qin,

114
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:16,923
thank me for what?

115
00:08:17,603 --> 00:08:20,243
Thank you for taking care
of me last night.

116
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:23,843
Will you drink a lot again?

117
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:28,163
It depends on
whether you're by my side or not.

118
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:31,432
What will we eat for lunch?

119
00:08:33,802 --> 00:08:34,922
I've got some good news for you.

120
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:38,002
I have submitted all the plans.

121
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:39,624
Really?

122
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:41,563
So you can leave work early today.

123
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,282
We'll go to an island tomorrow.

124
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,443
How about going shopping
for some stuff after you finish work?

125
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:49,672
Sounds good.

126
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,762
Think about what you need to purchase.

127
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:53,064
Make sure to bring them all.

128
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:55,203
It might not be convenient
to shop on the island.

129
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:57,762
I'll pick you up after work.

130
00:08:58,603 --> 00:08:59,528
Okay.

131
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,024
Bye.

132
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,002
(SU Interior Design Firm)

133
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,603
What do you think of my idea, Huixuan?

134
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,483
I think your idea is very good.

135
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,203
After this episode is aired,

136
00:09:11,363 --> 00:09:13,522
I'm sure you'll attract
a large number of female fans.

137
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:17,083
Since our preliminary plan
is already very mature,

138
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:21,162
why not join us for a trip this weekend?

139
00:09:21,882 --> 00:09:22,792
You are going on a trip?

140
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:23,762
Where are you heading to?

141
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,162
We're heading
to a small vacation island.

142
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:28,243
Sunshine, beach.
A two-day-one-night trip.

143
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:32,563
I find the sunshine
and beach very attractive,

144
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:36,443
but I still have things
to work on regarding the show.

145
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:37,882
You guys go. I'm not going.

146
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:39,762
You still need to work?

147
00:09:43,402 --> 00:09:44,328
How about this?

148
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:46,282
There's a new Thai restaurant nearby.

149
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:48,162
The taste is very authentic.

150
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:49,512
I'll take you there to eat.

151
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:53,282
Sorry. I got a phone call.

152
00:09:57,843 --> 00:09:58,760
Hello, Mr. Liu.

153
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:00,162
Where are you, Huixuan?

154
00:10:00,402 --> 00:10:02,402
I'm discussing the case
with the designer at SU.

155
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:04,712
That's great! Why don't you two
come over and chat?

156
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:06,363
I'm actually with the sponsor.

157
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:08,323
He's very interested
in the details of the plan.

158
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:10,243
But...

159
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:11,922
No buts. Come over here now.

160
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:15,528
Okay.

161
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:16,904
What's it?

162
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:20,402
I'm a director, not a barmaid.

163
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:22,002
Being asked to go drink.

164
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:25,032
Mr. Liu is asking you to drink?
I'll accompany you.

165
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:28,162
Fine, if you are free,
then come with me.

166
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,282
Alright.

167
00:10:29,282 --> 00:10:30,152
Let's go.

168
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:35,122
Miss Du and Miss Su

169
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:37,002
are in a meeting at their firm.

170
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:38,443
She must be on her way now.

171
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:40,762
She'll be right here. Please be patient.

172
00:10:43,112 --> 00:10:44,008
Mr. Liu.

173
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,323
Look, speak of the devil
and she appears.

174
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:50,443
Sorry for being late.
Bad traffic on the way.

175
00:10:51,203 --> 00:10:52,136
You're here.

176
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:53,384
We're here.

177
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:55,976
Just you guys?

178
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,963
Mingshi, Mr. Xu.

179
00:10:58,963 --> 00:10:59,402
Mr. Liu.

180
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:00,243
You've met before.

181
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:05,960
This is Mr. Xu.

182
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:07,402
No need. We've met before.

183
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:10,760
- Yes.
- Hurry and have a seat.

184
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:12,843
Please sit.

185
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,568
Here are the details
of the extra episode project.

186
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:19,683
Mr. Liu.

187
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:21,203
Look, how thoughtful.

188
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:22,683
The plan is ready.

189
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,700
(Extra Renovation Project Plan
of House Design)

190
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:29,723
Isn't Su Ying the designer
you're working with this time?

191
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:31,723
Yes, it's her firm.

192
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:33,922
But because this is an extra episode,

193
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:36,522
we want to involve
more emerging talents.

194
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,402
After all, discovering new designers

195
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:40,840
is the original purpose
of our show, right, Mr. Liu?

196
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:43,016
Yes.

197
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,922
Personally, I fully understand,

198
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:48,882
but I might not be able
to explain this to the group.

199
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:52,936
Mr. Liu, I've got other things
to do today, so I have to go.

200
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:54,056
Thanks for having me.

201
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:56,232
You just got here.
Let's stay a little longer.

202
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,563
- Let's chat a bit more.
- Hold there.

203
00:11:59,522 --> 00:12:01,282
No, everything is negotiable.

204
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:11,122
Can you explain it to me?

205
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:12,603
Explain what?

206
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:17,282
Am I not supposed to set the form
and content of this extra episode?

207
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:18,683
We've already agreed on this before.

208
00:12:19,122 --> 00:12:20,040
Was I talking about that?

209
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,642
I said the designer was Su Ying.

210
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:23,002
Why did it change to Xu...?

211
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:26,802
Mr. Xu...

212
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:28,922
I want to talk to her alone.

213
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:32,296
Okay, Mr. Liu, I'll leave you two.

214
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:33,480
I'll go over there, Huixuan.

215
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,402
Wait for me.

216
00:12:34,402 --> 00:12:35,336
Okay.

217
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:42,563
I appreciate him,

218
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,042
but the sponsor asked for Su Ying.

219
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:49,083
Without sponsorship,
how would our program survive?

220
00:12:49,443 --> 00:12:50,402
There are so many staffers.

221
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:53,042
I feel troubled and helpless too.

222
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:57,323
Didn't you mention that as long as
it came from their studio, it was fine?

223
00:12:58,203 --> 00:13:01,522
Moreover, we can't only rely on Su Ying.

224
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:02,963
Are we making a biopic about her?

225
00:13:04,323 --> 00:13:05,723
This is a good idea.

226
00:13:06,443 --> 00:13:07,882
Naming it after Su Ying sounds nice.

227
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:09,448
Or she wants other names?

228
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,762
As long as she suggests it,
I can apply to my leaders for her.

229
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,483
No problem. Aren't you good friends?

230
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:17,843
Go have a chat. She'll agree.

231
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:19,642
It really won't work, Mr. Liu.

232
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:22,723
Su Ying can't possibly be working on
our program every day.

233
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:24,968
My goodness.

234
00:13:26,162 --> 00:13:28,642
Du Huixuan, why are you always
on Su Ying's side?

235
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:31,816
Are you putting others before us?
Which side are you on?

236
00:13:31,963 --> 00:13:35,323
The ratings have been dropping
for six years. It's a steep fall.

237
00:13:35,443 --> 00:13:37,563
Don't you feel ashamed as the director?

238
00:13:38,882 --> 00:13:39,752
Liu Debiao.

239
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:40,882
What?

240
00:13:40,882 --> 00:13:41,736
What are you saying?

241
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:42,856
What did I say?

242
00:13:43,304 --> 00:13:44,162
Watch your words.

243
00:13:44,162 --> 00:13:45,323
What's wrong with my words?

244
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:47,522
Did I hit a nerve?

245
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:48,744
Are you too proud?

246
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:52,122
Do you have the nerve?
You are just too sensitive.

247
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:53,832
You just couldn't let go of your pride.

248
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,144
Or the deal would have been reached.

249
00:13:55,843 --> 00:13:57,443
Still looking for new designers?

250
00:13:57,843 --> 00:13:58,792
Who do you think you are?

251
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,882
A talent finder?

252
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,683
Without Su Ying, you are nothing.

253
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:03,882
Say it again.

254
00:14:03,882 --> 00:14:05,282
It's the same
even if I say it ten times.

255
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:06,642
Who are you insulting?

256
00:14:06,882 --> 00:14:07,784
You.

257
00:14:15,603 --> 00:14:16,520
What do you mean?

258
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:18,402
Miss Su is quitting House Design?

259
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:21,483
Yes, she is not the main person
in charge this time.

260
00:14:21,843 --> 00:14:23,802
It's a person named Mingshi
in her firm who is in charge.

261
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:31,323
Have all the projects assigned
to her been completed?

262
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:34,002
The finalized plans were just sent

263
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:35,080
by SU Design Firm.

264
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:36,968
All of them?

265
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:37,922
Yes.

266
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:39,243
They are all as per your instructions.

267
00:14:39,723 --> 00:14:42,203
Moreover, according to the contract,
this is the last time for amendment.

268
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:49,203
Yes, it's too easy for her.

269
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:52,723
Please sort out
the Seaview Garden project for me.

270
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,402
Alright.

271
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:55,304
Hurry up.

272
00:15:00,603 --> 00:15:01,683
You will look good in it.

273
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,042
Okay, I will put it on for you.

274
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:11,603
I have bought snacks
and daily necessities,

275
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,243
so there's nothing else to buy.

276
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:14,984
I guess so.

277
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:18,563
Islands are great.

278
00:15:19,243 --> 00:15:20,882
Sunshine and beaches are so romantic.

279
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:23,882
It's spice in a relationship.

280
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:26,642
Just you two together.
You must seize the opportunity.

281
00:15:27,282 --> 00:15:29,083
Don't waste
every precious moment of pleasure.

282
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:31,922
I forgot to buy something.

283
00:15:33,243 --> 00:15:34,152
Is it urgent?

284
00:15:36,963 --> 00:15:37,922
Yes, it is.

285
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:45,443
Hello, Mingshi.

286
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:48,162
Ying, it's bad.
We had a clash with Mr. Liu.

287
00:15:48,443 --> 00:15:49,443
We are at the police station.

288
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:50,664
What?

289
00:15:51,563 --> 00:15:52,762
The address. I'll be right there.

290
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,088
Yes.

291
00:16:01,642 --> 00:16:03,816
Huixuan, are you okay?

292
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:04,922
Were you hurt?

293
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,864
No, I'm fine.

294
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:06,984
Where's Liu Debiao?

295
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm here.

296
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:14,122
She is fine. I'm the one who got hurt.

297
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,120
It was your guy.

298
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:19,683
You people at SU are really something.

299
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:23,162
Great at martial arts.

300
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:28,040
Du Huixuan, remember what I said.

301
00:16:28,282 --> 00:16:29,522
Unless Su Ying comes to my show,

302
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:30,922
I will definitely not make peace.

303
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:31,944
This matter is not over.

304
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:32,843
Mr. Liu.

305
00:16:32,843 --> 00:16:34,083
What do you want to do?

306
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:36,402
(Shanghua Police Station)
Look where we are.

307
00:16:36,402 --> 00:16:37,963
A police station. I'm not afraid of you.

308
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:39,882
I was joking. I won't reconcile.

309
00:16:46,563 --> 00:16:47,762
You won't reconcile, Mr. Liu?

310
00:16:49,162 --> 00:16:50,024
That's easy.

311
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:52,723
Let's get the police to judge.

312
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:54,282
Let's tally up all the scores.

313
00:16:55,443 --> 00:16:57,802
Can I sue you for defamation
for malicious editing?

314
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,882
It seems that the matter
of the sea-view apartment

315
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:01,922
with the exploded glass
hasn't been settled yet.

316
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:04,282
There's actually no need.

317
00:17:05,362 --> 00:17:06,362
You don't know

318
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:09,042
how hard Mingshi's punch was.

319
00:17:09,723 --> 00:17:12,648
My head is buzzing now, really.

320
00:17:12,802 --> 00:17:14,243
But for your sake,

321
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:15,816
I'll let it go.

322
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:17,203
It's over.

323
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,842
Yeah, I don't mind.

324
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:20,002
But I won't let you off.

325
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:21,762
You can't get away.

326
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:23,802
You must write me
a public apology letter.

327
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,128
Write what?

328
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:26,123
You can't hear it?

329
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:28,362
A public apology letter.

330
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:30,403
Public apology.

331
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:32,042
If you don't write, I'm telling you,

332
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:33,802
you won't stay on the team.

333
00:17:34,123 --> 00:17:35,163
I'm going to fire you.

334
00:17:42,403 --> 00:17:44,243
Fine, I'm telling you.

335
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:46,056
I quit.

336
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:47,042
You...

337
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:49,002
You what? I'm telling you.
I'm choosing to fire you.

338
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,723
Good, you brat. How dare you...

339
00:17:50,723 --> 00:17:51,683
Mr. Liu.

340
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:52,883
What are you doing?

341
00:17:53,123 --> 00:17:53,963
Take it easy.

342
00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:55,483
Don't hit my face.

343
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:11,820
(Police)

344
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:13,576
You quit for real?

345
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:17,842
The show has been around for six years.

346
00:18:18,403 --> 00:18:20,403
Ever since Liu came,

347
00:18:20,842 --> 00:18:23,562
he's made it a complete mess.

348
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:24,923
I can't stand it anymore.

349
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:28,840
It's good. I'll be relieved.

350
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,483
Can you really leave?

351
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:35,042
You have worked hard
for six years to become the director.

352
00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:39,400
Honestly,

353
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:42,002
I really don't want
to work with him anymore.

354
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:47,112
Don't worry.

355
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:48,762
I'll sort myself out.

356
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:51,362
I know.

357
00:18:52,082 --> 00:18:53,443
Don't worry anymore.

358
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,872
Ying, I'm sorry.

359
00:18:57,256 --> 00:18:58,173
Sorry about...

360
00:18:58,173 --> 00:18:59,144
Great job today.

361
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,163
Send Huixuan home.

362
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:06,344
Okay.

363
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:08,403
Call me if you're in need.

364
00:19:08,602 --> 00:19:09,512
Goodbye, Dr. Qin.

365
00:19:10,002 --> 00:19:10,888
Bye.

366
00:19:11,522 --> 00:19:13,256
- Bye, Dr. Qin.
- Bye, Ying.

367
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:19,762
Don't you go accompany her?

368
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:25,923
No need. If I'm there,
she will pretend to be brave.

369
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:29,082
Let's go shopping.

370
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,360
Shop for what?

371
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:33,643
Didn't you just say

372
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,282
you wanted to buy something?

373
00:19:40,002 --> 00:19:42,088
Let's talk about it another day.

374
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:49,683
Huixuan, stop drinking.
You've already had too much.

375
00:19:50,683 --> 00:19:52,203
It's fine. Just a few cans.

376
00:19:55,602 --> 00:19:56,483
I'm sorry, Huixuan.

377
00:19:56,936 --> 00:19:59,042
I dragged you into it.

378
00:19:59,602 --> 00:20:01,768
You did a good job. Without you,

379
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:03,562
who'd know how much longer
I had to bear it?

380
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,923
But House Design
is your six-year effort.

381
00:20:06,243 --> 00:20:08,123
Should I go apologize to Mr. Liu?

382
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:09,864
Just a letter of apology.
I'll do it for you.

383
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,104
Don't even think about it.

384
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:14,723
Just the sight of his face
makes me sick now.

385
00:20:15,002 --> 00:20:15,944
And apologizing?

386
00:20:16,443 --> 00:20:17,288
In his dreams.

387
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:20,522
We can't be too stubborn.

388
00:20:21,963 --> 00:20:23,123
I'm not being stubborn.

389
00:20:24,842 --> 00:20:25,802
I've figured it out.

390
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:27,848
Leaving is good.

391
00:20:28,443 --> 00:20:30,562
But if you just leave like this,

392
00:20:31,403 --> 00:20:32,296
are you okay with it?

393
00:20:37,522 --> 00:20:38,683
Actually, it's not just today

394
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:40,683
that I'm thinking about quitting.

395
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:42,842
I've endured it for so long.

396
00:20:43,683 --> 00:20:45,362
My ideas and Mr. Liu's
never really aligned.

397
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:48,243
Some things just can't be forced.

398
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:51,522
For some time, I wanted

399
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:53,802
to find a balance
between him and the program.

400
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:56,842
But it's too much pressure.

401
00:20:57,443 --> 00:21:00,082
I'm losing track
of why I started this show.

402
00:21:02,322 --> 00:21:05,362
Okay, just quit it
if it makes you unhappy.

403
00:21:05,923 --> 00:21:07,002
I'll support

404
00:21:07,762 --> 00:21:08,680
any decision you make.

405
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,560
Thank you.

406
00:21:14,002 --> 00:21:17,403
Thank you for pushing me
to take a step out.

407
00:21:26,163 --> 00:21:28,802
Did I look really cool
when I told him I was quitting?

408
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:31,322
So cool, especially
when you splashed water on him.

409
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:33,802
You didn't even see his face turn green.

410
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:37,322
I was too shocked
to care about it back then.

411
00:21:37,322 --> 00:21:38,163
You were so cool.

412
00:21:38,643 --> 00:21:40,282
We really should've recorded it
with a camera.

413
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:41,608
We recorded it.

414
00:21:41,762 --> 00:21:42,664
It's all recorded.

415
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:43,848
Here it is.

416
00:21:45,683 --> 00:21:46,562
I'm serious.

417
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,282
After I accumulate enough stories,

418
00:21:48,643 --> 00:21:51,002
I want to write a biography for you.

419
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:52,483
I've thought of the title.

420
00:21:53,002 --> 00:21:54,322
The Biography of Huixuan?

421
00:21:54,883 --> 00:21:58,280
How about the Biography of Xuan'er?

422
00:21:58,923 --> 00:21:59,784
It's sure to sell well.

423
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:01,522
I agree.

424
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:02,443
I'll be your patron.

425
00:22:02,443 --> 00:22:03,400
My patron.

426
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:19,304
Gas out.

427
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,216
Here you are.

428
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:41,082
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

429
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,240
Then...

430
00:22:46,042 --> 00:22:46,952
Go in.

431
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:55,123
I'm sorry. My lipstick.

432
00:22:56,923 --> 00:22:57,883
Text me when you get home.

433
00:22:58,322 --> 00:22:59,176
Got it.

434
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:00,424
Bye.

435
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:01,762
Be careful.

436
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:02,632
Got it.

437
00:23:23,963 --> 00:23:24,872
Look.

438
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:28,163
(Badge)
My badges for the past six years.

439
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:29,602
I've kept all of them.

440
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:31,683
And on each badge,

441
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:33,723
there's a signature
from a guest each season.

442
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,243
It includes your senior's.

443
00:23:37,443 --> 00:23:38,408
Which one has hers on it?

444
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,620
(Qin Yunsheng, Su Ying)

445
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:43,016
They're all memories.

446
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,723
It's a pity that I wasn't there
during the first season.

447
00:23:46,403 --> 00:23:47,643
But I remember every later season.

448
00:23:48,082 --> 00:23:48,968
You remember all of them?

449
00:23:49,802 --> 00:23:51,883
What impressed me the most
was the fourth season.

450
00:23:52,322 --> 00:23:54,203
You made a breakthrough
by turning a quadrangle courtyard

451
00:23:54,362 --> 00:23:56,232
into a garden-style one.

452
00:23:56,443 --> 00:23:57,842
It was very standout.

453
00:23:58,282 --> 00:24:00,562
You were directly promoted
to the executive director on the site.

454
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:03,042
Then during the fifth season,

455
00:24:03,403 --> 00:24:05,802
you took the responsibility
of being the director of House Design.

456
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:10,243
In season six, Ying and I were
working on the glass house with you.

457
00:24:15,963 --> 00:24:17,123
Hearing you say that,

458
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:19,322
I doubt whether I should resign.

459
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,002
Huixuan, I'm telling you all this

460
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:23,203
not to upset you

461
00:24:23,883 --> 00:24:24,762
but to tell you

462
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:27,723
that you've been focused
on your work for so many years.

463
00:24:28,522 --> 00:24:30,522
Isn't it time to take a break
and love yourself?

464
00:24:31,944 --> 00:24:32,872
For example?

465
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:35,112
For example, you can do
some outdoor sports,

466
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:37,362
climb a mountain, travel,

467
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,203
swim

468
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,683
or...

469
00:24:43,602 --> 00:24:44,602
start dating.

470
00:24:45,643 --> 00:24:47,123
After all, you've got
some free time now.

471
00:24:48,762 --> 00:24:51,802
I just quit and you're already saying
I have too much free time.

472
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:53,123
Seriously?

473
00:24:53,123 --> 00:24:53,963
No, I would not dare.

474
00:24:54,683 --> 00:24:55,802
The elevator has arrived. Go.

475
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:56,648
Let's go.

476
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,148
(Congratulations to Miss Huixuan
on escaping the hardship)

477
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:05,544
She's out.

478
00:25:07,688 --> 00:25:08,616
Miss Du.

479
00:25:09,243 --> 00:25:10,152
You guys...

480
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:14,802
Congratulations on escaping hardship.

481
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:17,203
I resigned. It's not a promotion.

482
00:25:17,602 --> 00:25:18,522
Why the grand occasion?

483
00:25:18,923 --> 00:25:22,002
Now, Huixuan, I formally invite you
to join us for a trip.

484
00:25:22,243 --> 00:25:24,483
Two days and one night
for a comfortable trip.

485
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:27,883
But I didn't prepare anything.

486
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:29,256
Prepare what?

487
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,002
Flip-flops, towels,
toiletries, and clothes.

488
00:25:31,002 --> 00:25:31,842
I have the full set.

489
00:25:32,123 --> 00:25:33,602
I prepared everything you need
except a man.

490
00:25:33,802 --> 00:25:35,443
Mingshi prepared the rest for you.

491
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:42,203
If you put it that way,

492
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:45,362
it seems like I don't have
any reason to refuse.

493
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:48,282
Then let's go.

494
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:49,128
Let's go.

495
00:26:07,976 --> 00:26:08,883
Thank you, Dr. Qin.

496
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:09,736
Thank you, Dr. Qin.

497
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:12,282
Do you still call him Dr. Qin?

498
00:26:12,723 --> 00:26:13,963
- Yunsheng.
- Yunsheng.

499
00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:16,602
- Yunsheng.
- Yunsheng.

Ying, isn't this balcony too big?

512
00:27:03,562 --> 00:27:04,443
It looks nice.

513
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,163
The rooms in this row
have the best view.

514
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,208
You'll live here too?

515
00:27:12,243 --> 00:27:14,042
I'm okay. You don't have to
take care of my feelings.

516
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:15,683
You're overthinking it.

517
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:17,042
It was booked in advance.

518
00:27:17,322 --> 00:27:18,403
It's hard to book these days.

519
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,002
This was booked through a connection.

520
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:22,203
Alright, count me as thinking too much.

521
00:27:23,082 --> 00:27:24,680
I even made a special call to the hotel.

522
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,762
I told them to notify me immediately
if there were extra rooms.

523
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:27,976
But nothing came of it.

524
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,362
No worries. You can stay with Dr. Qin

525
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:33,042
for a few more days after we leave.

526
00:27:34,163 --> 00:27:35,080
Don't talk about me.

527
00:27:35,963 --> 00:27:36,840
Since you're here,

528
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:38,923
have a lot of fun, okay?

529
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:41,243
Don't worry.
I'll make myself comfortable.

530
00:27:41,443 --> 00:27:43,643
Just don't regret
your light wallet later.

531
00:27:44,002 --> 00:27:45,802
Enough. Go change your clothes.

532
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:51,322
This sea-view room is so awesome.

533
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,403
Oh, my God. There is
even a large round bed below.

534
00:27:55,562 --> 00:27:56,483
The view is very good.

535
00:27:56,683 --> 00:27:57,640
Yunsheng, you can stay.

536
00:27:58,403 --> 00:27:59,243
Go and tidy up.

537
00:27:59,602 --> 00:28:00,456
Okay.

538
00:28:01,643 --> 00:28:02,802
Ying sent a message

539
00:28:03,042 --> 00:28:05,362
in the group chat
telling us to change our clothes

540
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:07,203
and meet at the jetty in 15 minutes.

541
00:28:07,522 --> 00:28:08,403
Let's change our clothes.

542
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:09,243
Let's go.

543
00:28:09,243 --> 00:28:10,282
Hurry up.

544
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,324
(Director's Office)

545
00:29:27,562 --> 00:29:29,320
Mr. Yang, what brings you here?

546
00:29:30,243 --> 00:29:31,112
Where is Miss Su?

547
00:29:31,842 --> 00:29:33,362
They went on an island vacation.

548
00:29:34,243 --> 00:29:35,683
With her colleagues from the studio?

549
00:29:36,123 --> 00:29:36,963
Yes, team building.

550
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:38,762
As well as Dr. Qin.

551
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:40,360
Dr. Qin?

552
00:29:40,762 --> 00:29:42,602
I heard Ying had been working
overtime recently

553
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:44,403
just to be able
to spend time with Dr. Qin

554
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:45,483
when he was on vacation.

555
00:29:47,923 --> 00:29:48,840
Mr. Yang,

556
00:29:49,643 --> 00:29:51,562
do you have any case-related matters?

557
00:29:52,282 --> 00:29:54,042
It's okay. You can tell me.

558
00:29:56,643 --> 00:29:58,802
My name is Tian Mei.
I am a new employee here.

559
00:29:59,203 --> 00:30:00,842
I saw you when you came
for a meeting last time.

560
00:30:01,723 --> 00:30:02,664
Here is my business card.

561
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:06,376
Tian Mei, right?

562
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:07,240
Yes.

563
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,200
I'll remember it.

564
00:30:08,602 --> 00:30:11,082
But let's wait until Miss Su returns
to discuss the case.

565
00:30:11,163 --> 00:30:12,040
Thank you.

566
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,282
Okay. Mr. Yang, contact me anytime
if you have any needs.

567
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,123
What do you want to play?

568
00:30:35,362 --> 00:30:36,203
I want to play Rich Fish.

569
00:30:36,643 --> 00:30:37,544
I want to ride the jet ski.

570
00:30:37,643 --> 00:30:38,760
I want to play Flying Fish.

571
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,720
Banana Boat.

572
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:41,602
Let me think about it.

573
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,443
Let's start playing.

574
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:48,328
Let's go.

586

A lot of sand here.

587
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:36,680
It feels like a scrub.

588
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:40,123
Do you want me
to apply it over your back?

589
00:31:43,762 --> 00:31:44,802
You're so sweet.

590
00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:46,522
Huixuan, in that case...

591
00:31:47,304 --> 00:31:48,203
I'll do it.

592
00:31:48,203 --> 00:31:49,096
Come on.

593
00:31:49,683 --> 00:31:51,243
I'm coming, beautiful legs.

594
00:31:51,403 --> 00:31:52,360
Do it.

595
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:57,002
I'm so envious.

596
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:57,883
It's okay.

597
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:00,723
Don't be envious.
Chen, I'll do it for you.

598
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:01,960
Sure.

599
00:32:06,643 --> 00:32:07,883
Apply it yourself.

600
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:37,608
It's completely soaked.

601
00:32:37,762 --> 00:32:39,443
Yes, I took a few sips of water.

602
00:32:39,562 --> 00:32:40,456
It's too salty.

603
00:32:41,203 --> 00:32:42,088
Be careful.

604
00:32:47,403 --> 00:32:48,322
Let's go back and bathe.

605
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:01,163
Can I borrow your charging cable?

606
00:33:01,704 --> 00:33:02,632
I'll get it from the case.

607
00:33:02,632 --> 00:33:04,520
It's fine. I can get it myself.
You keep blow-drying it.

608
00:33:04,802 --> 00:33:05,704
Am I okay to open it?

609
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:06,683
Sure. It's inside.

610
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,136
Hello, Yisen.

611
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:18,963
There's something I didn't get a chance
to tell you because you left

612
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:20,243
in such a hurry this morning.

613
00:33:20,602 --> 00:33:22,683
Don't be too touched after hearing it.

614
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,163
What is it?

615
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:25,963
I got you a little gift.

616
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:28,602
I put it in the inside pocket
of your suitcase.

617
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:30,483
I'm sure you'll need it.

618
00:33:37,723 --> 00:33:39,082
I-I'll take it for you.

619
00:33:40,963 --> 00:33:41,896
Okay.

620
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:46,408
What is that?

621
00:33:46,522 --> 00:33:47,483
It's nothing.

622
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,456
Let me have a look.

623
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:49,864
It's nothing.

624
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:52,040
Nothing.

625
00:33:52,123 --> 00:33:53,000
You have a secret.

626
00:33:53,163 --> 00:33:54,056
I don't have any secrets.

627
00:33:54,403 --> 00:33:55,336
Then let me have a look.

628
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:01,243
Okay, look.

629
00:34:03,483 --> 00:34:05,042
No, you'd better not look.

630
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:05,992
Give it to me.

631
00:34:07,002 --> 00:34:08,002
Give it to me.

632
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:09,003
Don't look.

633
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:11,848
What is it?

634
00:34:18,282 --> 00:34:19,240
Ying?

635
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:20,552
Ying.

636
00:34:22,003 --> 00:34:22,952
What are you doing?

637
00:34:24,003 --> 00:34:25,243
I came to borrow the charger.

638
00:34:26,882 --> 00:34:28,643
Oh, your phone is dead, right?

639
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:31,362
I-I-I'm thirsty.

640
00:34:31,683 --> 00:34:33,192
I-I-I'm going back to my room.

641
00:34:33,192 --> 00:34:34,123
This is your room.

642
00:34:34,123 --> 00:34:35,083
I...

643
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:38,563
I'm hungry again.

644
00:34:39,282 --> 00:34:40,203
W-W-Wait for me.

645
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,064
I'm blind.

646
00:34:52,043 --> 00:34:52,936
It's all your fault.

647
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:00,844
(Bai)

648
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:05,762
Bai, you finally have time to call me.

649
00:35:06,683 --> 00:35:07,592
I miss you so much.

650
00:35:07,802 --> 00:35:10,683
I'm telling you. I'm so bored being
on my own every day.

651
00:35:11,203 --> 00:35:13,243
Why don't you go hang out with Yunsheng?

652
00:35:13,723 --> 00:35:15,282
Don't mention him, okay?

653
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:16,762
He is so happy now.

654
00:35:17,203 --> 00:35:18,362
He's got a new girlfriend.

655
00:35:18,762 --> 00:35:20,762
They just went to an island
for fun this weekend.

656
00:35:20,962 --> 00:35:22,802
I even prepared
a little surprise for him.

657
00:35:23,442 --> 00:35:24,402
He has a girlfriend?

658
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,163
I'm telling you.

659
00:35:27,362 --> 00:35:30,504
He's in a very wonderful, happy
and sweet relationship.

660
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,203
Let me tell you in detail.

661
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:11,628
(Photo)

662
00:36:12,322 --> 00:36:13,256
Please feel free to browse.

663
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:16,643
This Adzuki bean bracelet.

664
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:19,003
This one looks pretty good.

665
00:36:19,482 --> 00:36:20,643
These two seem to be a pair.

666
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,402
This is an Adzuki bean bracelet.

667
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,123
It's handmade.

668
00:36:24,603 --> 00:36:25,683
How much is this, sir?

669
00:36:25,962 --> 00:36:26,856
It's 300.

670
00:36:27,243 --> 00:36:28,203
So expensive.

671
00:36:28,203 --> 00:36:30,824
If it's for couples,
it's 520 for a pair.

672
00:36:32,762 --> 00:36:34,922
Okay, sir, I'll take a pair.

673
00:36:34,922 --> 00:36:35,848
Alright then.

674
00:36:36,723 --> 00:36:37,723
Wrap them up, please.

675
00:36:37,723 --> 00:36:38,664
Alright then.

676
00:36:42,043 --> 00:36:42,984
Paid.

677
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,003
Let me put it on for you.

678
00:36:47,402 --> 00:36:48,922
He's quite a man of business acumen.

679
00:36:49,402 --> 00:36:51,683
300 for one. 520 for a pair.

680
00:36:52,203 --> 00:36:53,723
I don't want to be an idiot.

681
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,003
I'd surely buy two, right?

682
00:36:55,723 --> 00:36:56,616
I'll pay you later.

683
00:36:57,203 --> 00:36:58,123
No need. It's not much.

684
00:36:58,523 --> 00:36:59,482
I don't feel it's good.

685
00:37:00,243 --> 00:37:01,282
Or let me treat you to lunch.

686
00:37:01,962 --> 00:37:02,824
Let's drink something.

687
00:37:24,123 --> 00:37:25,683
(Crazy Quet)
(You recommend an open wardrobe?)

688
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:27,802
(It's such a dust-collector.)

689
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,123
(It's simply stupid tax.)

690
00:37:31,603 --> 00:37:33,643
Huixuan, have a coconut drink.

691
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,683
Thanks.

692
00:37:34,683 --> 00:37:35,656
It's a bit heavy.

693
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:38,123
Let me ask you a professional question.

694
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:41,842
What do you think about
an open wardrobe?

695
00:37:42,322 --> 00:37:43,723
Open wardrobe.

696
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:46,723
It saves money and space
and is flexible in layout.

697
00:37:47,203 --> 00:37:48,123
But I don't recommend it.

698
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,256
Why?

699
00:37:49,256 --> 00:37:51,802
Because it's difficult
to clean it and it gathers dust.

700
00:37:52,243 --> 00:37:54,802
And the point is
that it's not very popular right now.

701
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:57,362
So you think so, too.

702
00:37:57,736 --> 00:37:58,600
What's the matter?

703
00:38:00,003 --> 00:38:00,904
Nothing much.

704
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:03,243
This is really comfortable.

705
00:38:17,723 --> 00:38:20,043
(Fight Hard to Win)
(You have a point. I'm open to it.)

706
00:38:20,282 --> 00:38:23,962
(But don't mistake sarcasm for humor
when making suggestions in the future.)

707
00:38:25,402 --> 00:38:26,322
(Crazy Quet)
(I'll do less.)

708
00:38:26,882 --> 00:38:29,003
(After all, I usually charge
for my advice.)

709
00:38:30,043 --> 00:38:31,144
(Fight Hard to Win)
(How vain.)

710
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:33,643
(Big talk from a boy.)

711
00:38:33,962 --> 00:38:35,163
(Crazy Quet)
(How can you be sure?)

712
00:38:35,762 --> 00:38:39,563
(Fight Hard to Win)
(How old can a nut-loving tree shrew be?)

713
00:38:41,523 --> 00:38:43,442
(Crazy Quet)
(You know this is a tree shrew!)

714
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:45,643
(Many people think it's a squirrel.)

715
00:38:46,523 --> 00:38:49,992
(Fight Hard to Win)
(I'm a hardcore fan of this cartoon.)

716
00:38:50,683 --> 00:38:52,882
(It is said that this creature
is the ancestor of primates.)

717
00:38:55,163 --> 00:38:56,442
(Crazy Quet)
(You've got something.)

718
00:38:57,922 --> 00:38:59,482
(Fight Hard to Win)
(So we're fellow fanciers.)

719
00:39:12,362 --> 00:39:13,256
Girl,

720
00:39:13,922 --> 00:39:14,856
are you alone?

721
00:39:16,482 --> 00:39:17,842
Fish therapy alone is dull.

722
00:39:18,282 --> 00:39:19,176
Let's do it together.

723
00:39:19,802 --> 00:39:20,744
Are you nuts?

724
00:39:20,922 --> 00:39:22,043
Can I add you on WeChat?

725
00:39:22,563 --> 00:39:24,520
Sorry, but I don't add strangers.

726
00:39:25,123 --> 00:39:26,056
Add me on WeChat.

727
00:39:27,922 --> 00:39:30,322
Bro, do you want to add me on WeChat?

728
00:39:31,762 --> 00:39:33,362
Why would I add a man on WeChat?

729
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,362
Then leave now.

730
00:39:34,362 --> 00:39:35,243
Disappointing.

731
00:39:35,402 --> 00:39:36,328
You rascal.

732
00:39:39,842 --> 00:39:41,043
Do you think I was cool?

733
00:39:41,842 --> 00:39:42,728
You're just so-so.

734
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:45,322
If you hadn't come so fast,
I would have taught him a lesson.

735
00:39:46,683 --> 00:39:48,402
With your puny size,
who can you teach a lesson to?

736
00:39:48,402 --> 00:39:49,523
Maybe just some fish.

737
00:39:50,842 --> 00:39:52,482
All my muscles aren't just for show.

738
00:39:52,762 --> 00:39:53,842
I hit quite hard, okay?

739
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:55,240
Does it hurt?

740
00:39:56,003 --> 00:39:57,442
Did I really hurt you?

741
00:39:58,603 --> 00:39:59,496
No pain at all.

742
00:40:00,123 --> 00:40:01,032
You dare trick me.

743
00:40:02,802 --> 00:40:04,322
Don't bite me.

744
00:40:53,003 --> 00:40:53,960
Taking secret pictures?

745
00:41:02,683 --> 00:41:03,683
I took really good pictures.

746
00:41:04,104 --> 00:41:04,962
Let me see.

747
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:05,864
Here.

748
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:15,402
Dr. Qin, I've finally discovered
something you're not good at.

749
00:41:16,322 --> 00:41:18,723
How could you make every single picture
of your beautiful girlfriend

750
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,683
look oddly proportioned like this?

751
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:22,984
Proportions?

752
00:41:23,723 --> 00:41:24,584
Look at this.

753
00:41:24,723 --> 00:41:27,043
I always do a good job taking CT scans.

754
00:41:28,123 --> 00:41:29,096
Am I a CT scan?

755
00:41:29,768 --> 00:41:30,643
Am I a CT scan?

756
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:31,563
No, you are not.

757
00:41:31,643 --> 00:41:32,922
You teach me.

758
00:41:33,643 --> 00:41:34,504
Show me.

759
00:41:35,482 --> 00:41:36,563
Show your skills.

760
00:41:37,482 --> 00:41:38,523
See how amazing I am.

761
00:41:38,683 --> 00:41:39,528
Taking a picture of us?

762
00:41:40,322 --> 00:41:41,256
Do it.

763
00:41:55,243 --> 00:41:56,104
Huixuan,

764
00:41:57,163 --> 00:41:58,120
smile.

765
00:42:01,723 --> 00:42:05,442
What do you think of filming an episode
about the renovation of a park?

766
00:42:05,762 --> 00:42:07,322
It'd be very interesting and topical.

767
00:42:07,882 --> 00:42:08,922
Park renovation.

768
00:42:11,922 --> 00:42:13,362
It's such an occupational habit.

769
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:15,080
Pretend I didn't say it.

770
00:42:16,282 --> 00:42:17,243
Let me look at the photos.

771
00:42:17,523 --> 00:42:18,408
