1
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:36,230
Dang, he's super strong. 

2
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,165
Did he really get past all of them? 

3
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,535
The rumors weren't wrong, Lee Geon-jae. 

4
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,678
From now on, it's just you and me. 

5
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,013
You with your shoulder, 

6
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:55,082
and me with my ankle. 

7
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,085
Fair, isn't it? 

8
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,544
Ah, crap. 

9
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:35,823
Does your shoulder hurt a lot? 

10
00:02:37,358 --> 00:03:09,356
What are we gonna do? It's just the beginning. 

11
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,691
You're nothing special, Lee Geon-jae. 

12
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,295
So why are you acting tough in front of me? 

13
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,630
It's annoying, damn it. 

14
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:43,624
Stop it. 

15
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,659
Don't act tough, you bastard, damn it. 

16
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:01,936
Let's finish this now. 

17
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,218
Ah, this is so tough, damn it. 

18
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:28,963
Hey. 

19
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,198
Figure it out yourselves. 

20
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,876
It might be uncomfortable,
but let's stay here for a while. 

21
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:44,345
Mom will find a small villa
first thing tomorrow. 

22
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,748
And Mom decided to go back
to work next week. 

23
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:49,583
You know Mom's capable, right? 

24
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,256
Is this okay? 

25
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:59,326
Of course, it's okay.
Mom wants to be with her son. 

26
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:04,732
From now on, Mom will
only think about our Uigyeom. 

27
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:12,139
Uigyeom. 

28
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,277
Mom 

29
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:18,512
wants our Uigyeom
to smile often. 

30
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,483
Find what you truly want to do,
and while doing that... 

31
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,856
Oh my, thinking about it now, 

32
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:32,793
it seems there's no need
to be so tied to grades. 

33
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:36,530
Hey, look at Mom. 

34
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:40,434
I was always first place,
but now I work under others. 

35
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:45,806
Uigyeom. 

36
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:49,243
Just get treatment here for a while, 

37
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:52,012
and once you get better,
then we can talk about 

38
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,648
your school problems again, okay? 

39
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,118
Yes. 

40
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:43,797
How about this? 

41
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:47,334
Does seeing this make you scared? 

42
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,874
You, 

43
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,911
have you heard of the
Law of Conservation of Violence? 

44
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:00,781
Violence 

45
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:04,385
returns in the same measure
it was dealt. 

46
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,723
It means I've used
that much violence, 

47
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:12,960
or 

48
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,831
maybe there's still more left. 

49
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,100
Headphones. 

50
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:21,802
How is he? 

51
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,437
Is he better? 

52
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:35,583
Hey, Kang Yoon-gi. 

53
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,074
Okay, the subtitle is important. 

54
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,309
Okay, 15.
'Mangjinja neun hoya nira'. 

55
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,111
What does it mean? 

56
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,247
I don't know. 

57
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,414
Uh... 

58
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:08,983
'Mangjinja'. 

59
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:12,887
It means 'the one who destroys the Jin Dynasty is Hu'. 

60
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:16,090
This 'Jin' was
a prophecy, 

61
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:18,826
and Qin Shi Huang was surprised
when he saw this prophecy. 

62
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,728
He wondered, 'Who could it be 

63
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:21,862
who will destroy our Jin Dynasty?' 

64
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,107
Was his name Yoon-gi? 

65
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,510
Have you called that friend? 

66
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:40,915
Not yet. 

67
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:45,085
Ah, that friend
was very worried about you. 

68
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:49,356
Should we call him over
for a meal this weekend? 

69
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,859
Mom will buy you something delicious. 

70
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,396
Okay. 

71
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:58,232
Uigyeom, do you have a girlfriend? 

72
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:00,301
No. 

73
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,270
Wasn't there anyone you liked at the academy? 

74
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,808
None of them are my type. 

75
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:17,918
Our, our son really 

76
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:19,854
has high standards, huh? 

77
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:24,058
Well, he does have the face
to have high standards. 

78
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,193
He's handsome. 

79
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:33,033
Then what about Yoon-gi? Does he have a girlfriend? 

80
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:37,304
He... 

81
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:40,107
talks too much, so
girls probably don't like him. 

82
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,275
Huh? 

83
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:43,777
I'm better than him. 

84
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,230
You just need a little bit
of my coaching, and 

85
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,398
you'll be amazing at fighting, seriously. 

86
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:05,766
Tomorrow,
how will you fight? 

87
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,168
What are you talking about? 

88
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:09,003
'I told you, I won't fight.' 

89
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:10,237
But don't worry too much. 

90
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:11,472
You have me. 

91
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:13,274
We are
the High School Super Heroes. 

92
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:14,875
Congratulations on your
successful debut! 

93
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:15,709
Loyalty! 

94
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:16,544
Loyalty! 

95
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,874
Ah, seriously, just one point. 

96
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:49,109
Oh, it's not working? 

97
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:53,981
Oh, here it comes!
Here it comes, here it comes! 

98
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:57,585
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes! 

99
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,019
It's over, it's over. 

100
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:00,788
Hey, Gisu. 

101
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,393
What is it? 

102
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,363
Give me back my friend's Walkman. 

103
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:15,936
This? 

104
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,340
But why did you come? 

105
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,575
Where's the Super Hero? 

106
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:25,579
You know this, though... 

107
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,084
It's broken, right? 

108
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,527
Is it broken? 

109
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:44,899
You're a truly unique guy. 

110
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:46,500
I know. 

111
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:48,736
So give it back. 

112
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,306
I don't want to. 

113
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,874
What are you going to do? 

114
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,080
You'll have to take it by force. 

115
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,472
Go on. 

116
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,228
Kang Yoon-gi. 

117
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,797
You're good with your feet, huh? 

118
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:53,801
Do more. 

119
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,236
Do more, yeah, do more. 

120
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:56,804
Do more, go on. 

121
00:13:57,438 --> 00:13:59,607
Go on.
Go on, huh? 

122
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:01,342
How, go on, do more. 

123
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:02,443
Do more, damn it. 

124
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:21,529
Hey. 

125
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,964
Are you done? 

126
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:24,932
No way. 

127
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,245
Kang Yoon. 

128
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:43,083
I'll make you remember
the old days, okay? 

129
00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:09,543
Kang Yoon-gi. 

130
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:11,612
You need to get up. 

131
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,282
Why? 

132
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,884
Are you going to run away again? 

133
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:18,886
If I was going to, 

134
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:21,088
I wouldn't have come. 

135
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:46,680
Come here. 

136
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:11,705
Hey. 

137
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,343
Who's that friend of yours? 

138
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:18,546
That, that guy who jumped alone. 

139
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:25,486
Lee Ji-seong? 

140
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,621
That guy woke up, I hear. 

141
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:30,424
Huh? 

142
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:34,628
Then you
need to put in more effort, huh? 

143
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,641
Ah, damn it! 

144
00:16:58,752 --> 00:16:59,587
Hey. 

145
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:02,590
Did you only come here to run away? 

146
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:09,163
Why, more? Huh? 

147
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,738
More, more? 

148
00:17:57,178 --> 00:17:59,814
The flight is booked for
the earliest one tomorrow morning, 

149
00:17:59,814 --> 00:18:01,749
and the hotel is... What? 

150
00:18:02,116 --> 00:18:03,317
Who are you? 

151
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,055
Grandpa. 

152
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,327
Uigyeom, pack your bags. 

153
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,162
Let's go to Grandpa's house. 

154
00:18:17,198 --> 00:18:18,199
No. 

155
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:22,269
What are you doing now? 

156
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,339
As you can see, our daughter-in-law 

157
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,208
is not
in her right mind. 

158
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:29,844
Even though she's been taking medication for a long time, 

159
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,112
her obsessive-compulsive disorder hasn't improved, 

160
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,582
and now she's even brought
the child out like this, 

161
00:18:34,582 --> 00:18:35,850
not sending him to school. 

162
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,553
A normal family life is impossible. 

163
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:41,856
No, no, Grandpa. 

164
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:43,290
What are you doing? 

165
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:45,426
My mom is perfectly fine, Grandpa. 

166
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,228
Uigyeom. 

167
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:50,931
Why wouldn't I know your feelings? 

168
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:53,334
Our hearts ache too, but 

169
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:56,036
we made a big decision. 

170
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,580
Mom. 

171
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,414
Mom, are you okay? 

172
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:09,383
Mom. 

173
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:11,185
Mom, what's wrong? Mom. 

174
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:12,253
I'm fine. 

175
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,055
What are you
doing? 

176
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:16,524
The child is in distress. 

177
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:18,692
Please transfer her quickly. 

178
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,962
Execute according to Article 24 

179
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:22,963
of the Mental Health Welfare Act. 

180
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,532
- Yes.
- Don't do it. 

181
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:25,366
Just a moment. 

182
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:28,135
- My mom is perfectly fine!
- Uigyeom! 

183
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:29,870
- Don't do it!
- Kim Uigyeom! 

184
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:35,943
Mom needs treatment. 

185
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:38,279
Uigyeom. 

186
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:43,384
Mom is truly fine. 

187
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:47,588
I'm fine. 

188
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,192
I'll just make one call, 

189
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:52,960
and then I'll leave on my own. 

190
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,504
Ah. 

191
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:05,573
Yes, Lawyer Seo. 

192
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,675
It's Myung Da-bin. 

193
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:10,744
Is it called a petition for habeas corpus? 

194
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:13,280
I need you to help me with that right now. 

195
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:16,650
I'll be waiting, trusting only you, Lawyer Seo. 

196
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:18,986
Yes. 

197
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,397
Uigyeom. 

198
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,399
Mom 

199
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,236
will definitely come to pick you up
again soon, so 

200
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:36,904
wait for Mom. 

201
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:38,639
Okay? 

202
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,377
Let's go. 

203
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:45,079
Mom. 

204
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,081
Mom, Mom. 

205
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:53,654
Uigyeom. 

206
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:58,259
Mom, 

207
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,628
if you get treatment, 

208
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,130
you'll get better quickly. 

209
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:12,239
The person who truly needs treatment 

210
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:15,843
is Dad. 

211
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:38,699
That was fun. 

212
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,935
Take it. 

213
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:42,603
It's broken. 

214
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:08,329
Ugh, damn it. 

215
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:18,739
Your mom 

216
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:22,209
seems to be trying to fight
by hiring a lawyer, 

217
00:22:23,978 --> 00:22:25,179
but it's useless. 

218
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:29,483
Do you know why? 

219
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:32,486
Because in this medical field, I'm 

220
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:35,856
the '갑' (gap/alpha), as you said. 

221
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:39,493
Uigyeom. 

222
00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:42,163
This is what power is. 

223
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:50,638
When you're a minor,
the environment is the most important thing. 

224
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:55,676
Your mom and dad
couldn't create an environment for you to study, 

225
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:57,444
that's why you're struggling now. 

226
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:03,384
Grandpa found a boarding school
in Boston. 

227
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:05,886
Until the admission process is complete, 

228
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:09,690
you'll stay at Grandpa's house for now. 

229
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:15,462
Uigyeom, if you
study hard in Boston, 

230
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,933
your mom will get better too. 

231
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:19,900
Huh? 

232
00:23:22,303 --> 00:23:24,371
No, I'll go now, okay? 

233
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,143
Who is it at this hour? 

234
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:30,678
A friend. 

235
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:32,913
Someone who's
going to America soon, 

236
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:34,682
what does he need a friend for? 

237
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:37,785
Uigyeom. 

238
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,460
Uigyeom! 

239
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:48,896
Uigyeom... 

240
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:26,867
Yoon-gi. 

241
00:24:37,945 --> 00:24:39,446
I'm sorry, Kim Uigyeom. 

242
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:43,250
Hey, Kang Yoon-gi. 

243
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:45,820
Are you okay? 

244
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:49,757
Of course. 

245
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:52,660
We're the Super Heroes. 

246
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:57,665
I saw your father
at school today. 

247
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,402
You're going to study abroad, right? 

248
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:09,076
We don't even know when we'll see each other again, 

249
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:13,280
I wanted to give this back to you 

250
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:17,351
and sincerely apologize. 

251
00:25:22,656 --> 00:25:23,591
Take it. 

252
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:37,371
I'm going. 

253
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:39,640
Stay healthy. 

254
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:49,884
Oh, and... 

255
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:54,054
I fixed the Walkman a bit. 

256
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,127
I watched a YouTube video; it was simple. 

257
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:05,232
'How to replace the rubber belt,
which causes 90% of cassette player malfunctions.' 

258
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,636
I learned thanks to you. 

259
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:14,642
I'm leaving. 

260
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,420
Listen to this. 

261
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,021
How is it? 

262
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:02,656
It's amazing, right? 

263
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,025
This is real. 

264
00:27:05,226 --> 00:27:06,360
Real music. 

265
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:08,395
- Hyung.
- Uigyeom. 

266
00:27:08,996 --> 00:27:10,631
Don't listen with your ears, 

267
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:13,200
feel it with your chest, with your heart. 

268
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:16,704
This isn't just music, it's a vibration. 

269
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:19,406
A living, breathing vibration. 

270
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:02,316
Child. 

271
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:06,587
Come here. 

272
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,566
What in the world
are you two doing? 

273
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,401
Huh? 

274
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:25,306
You called Uigyeom
last night, didn't you? 

275
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:26,974
Yes. 

276
00:28:27,174 --> 00:28:28,476
Where is Uigyeom now? 

277
00:28:31,412 --> 00:28:32,346
Huh? 

278
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:15,489
Hey, Super Hero. 

279
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:26,300
I didn't expect you to come to school. 

280
00:29:28,002 --> 00:29:28,903
Let's go. 

281
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,371
Go where? 

282
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,575
A student should be at school. 

283
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:50,891
Why do you keep carrying around
that broken thing? 

284
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,335
They're fighting! 

285
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:03,437
Hey, over here, over here! 

286
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:22,957
Beat him up, beat him up! 

287
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:40,274
Okay, yeah, come on. 

288
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:35,462
- He's not answering?
- No. 

289
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:40,267
You bastard, if anything
happens to our Uigyeom, 

290
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:41,836
you're dead, you punk! 

291
00:32:18,873 --> 00:32:19,907
Oh, oh. 

292
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:01,282
My stress
is completely gone, seriously. 

293
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:08,289
Hey, Super Hero! 

294
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:11,892
You're having fun too, aren't you? 

295
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:14,628
Fighting like this, huh? 

296
00:33:20,568 --> 00:33:22,336
Do you know why that is? 

297
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:25,973
Because both of us... 

298
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,074
Ah, here, here. 

299
00:33:27,775 --> 00:33:29,143
This part is broken. 

300
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:32,313
Both of us 

301
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:34,882
are just broken trash. 

302
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,106
You're laughing? 

303
00:34:06,347 --> 00:34:07,414
Don't make me laugh. 

304
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:08,682
Why would I 

305
00:34:10,017 --> 00:34:11,285
be the same as you! 

306
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:21,662
Oh, good. 

307
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:23,230
Do more! Damn it. 

308
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:29,670
What are you doing, hey! 

309
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:39,513
Get up. 

310
00:34:44,285 --> 00:34:45,319
Ah, damn it. 

311
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,603
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
It's over, it's over! 

312
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,441
Hey, blood, hey! 

313
00:35:40,674 --> 00:35:42,076
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey! 

314
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,684
Hey. 

315
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:52,620
I get why you always wear
that broken thing. 

316
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,422
You already feel it too, right? 

317
00:35:56,624 --> 00:35:58,526
That you're broken. 

318
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:00,461
It's easier if you admit it. 

319
00:36:01,162 --> 00:36:02,696
No one can fix us. 

320
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:10,271
Because we try so hard to fix it, 

321
00:36:10,871 --> 00:36:12,807
it gets even more broken. 

322
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,742
Like you. 

323
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,177
Kim Uigyeom. 

324
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:32,126
Kim Uigyeom. 

325
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:35,629
You were beaten at home too, weren't you? 

326
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:40,835
You're a truly pitiful bastard too. 

327
00:36:42,837 --> 00:36:43,704
Shut up. 

328
00:36:51,011 --> 00:36:51,912
I'm truly sorry. 

329
00:36:55,015 --> 00:36:56,183
I'm sorry, Uigyeom. 

330
00:36:59,153 --> 00:37:00,020
Kim Uigyeom. 

331
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:02,490
Did you finish
all the workbooks? 

332
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:08,095
You can do it like your brother, right? 

333
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,831
Don't disappoint me. 

334
00:37:22,209 --> 00:37:23,377
You have to be like your brother. 

335
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:39,426
Why are you stopping? 

336
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:42,329
Are you scared now? 

337
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:46,267
You have to see it to the end. 

338
00:38:24,438 --> 00:38:26,707
- Uigyeom! Kim Uigyeom!
- Why is he like that?! 

339
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,111
Uigyeom. 

340
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:39,220
Stop it, that's enough, huh? 

341
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:42,089
Uigyeom. 

342
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:46,393
Why are you like this? 

343
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,502
I remembered. 

344
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:57,204
My dream. 

345
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:09,850
I loved the blue sky. 

346
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:28,969
This 

347
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:31,906
is my first flight. 

348
00:39:58,065 --> 00:39:58,999
Uigyeom. 

349
00:40:02,636 --> 00:40:03,704
Why are you like this? 

350
00:40:07,408 --> 00:40:08,375
Huh? 

351
00:40:09,944 --> 00:40:11,145
Why, exactly? 

352
00:40:13,347 --> 00:40:14,748
Why are you doing this, why? 

353
00:40:18,385 --> 00:40:19,386
Dad. 

354
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:23,424
Only now 

355
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:26,794
are you asking why. 

356
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:20,214
Are you Kim Uigyeom, the student? 

357
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:22,149
Yes. 

358
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:23,951
Hello, Mother. 

359
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:29,323
I'm the student affairs head at Moomyung High School. 

360
00:41:29,723 --> 00:41:32,059
We will take good care of
and guide your son, so 

361
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:33,294
don't worry too much. 

362
00:41:34,261 --> 00:41:35,095
Yes. 

363
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:37,698
Please take good care of him. 

364
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:38,566
Yes. 

365
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:39,867
Let's go, Uigyeom. 

366
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:42,603
I'll be back. 

367
00:41:43,437 --> 00:41:44,405
Uigyeom. 

368
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:51,612
Bear with it even if it's hard, 

369
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,116
and do well. Mom will wait for you. 

370
00:42:09,263 --> 00:42:10,331
I'll do well and come back. 

371
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:15,002
Okay, my son. 

372
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:20,935
Are you the guy who goes crazy
if someone touches his cassette? 

373
00:43:21,302 --> 00:43:22,203
Yoon-gi. 

374
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:23,804
Anyway, I'm destined for forced transfer. 

375
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:30,211
Wouldn't it be better
if we're together anyway? 

376
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:32,713
Driver, let's go. 

377
00:43:42,556 --> 00:43:43,858
You all worked hard
to come all this way. 

378
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:34,175
We're a bit late,
so let's hurry and get off. 

379
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:36,744
Hurry up and get off. 

380
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,084
Hurry up. 

381
00:44:50,825 --> 00:44:52,126
Get off quickly. 

382
00:45:08,943 --> 00:45:10,277
What the hell? 

383
00:45:10,277 --> 00:45:12,847
This school looks really bleak. 

384
00:45:14,148 --> 00:45:15,349
Just like Moomyung High School. 

385
00:45:18,085 --> 00:45:19,487
This is Moomyung High. 

386
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:22,223
If you rank in the top 10 in fighting, 

387
00:45:23,224 --> 00:45:24,458
you can leave this place. 

388
00:45:29,296 --> 00:45:30,364
Here, 

389
00:45:31,499 --> 00:45:33,000
it seems there will be
more 

390
00:45:33,701 --> 00:45:34,935
interesting things. 

391
00:45:40,674 --> 00:45:41,675
Hurry up! 

392
00:45:43,611 --> 00:45:44,745
Let's go.
