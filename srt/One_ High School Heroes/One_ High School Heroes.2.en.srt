00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:41,402
Got some grit.

00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,577
(Eui-gyeom) Let's do it.

00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:00,448
Not bad.

10
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:02,183
Do it again.

11
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:04,118
(Eui-gyeom) Am I too slow?

12
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:06,120
Faster.

13
00:02:12,126 --> 00:02:12,961
[Groan of Eui-gyeom]

14
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:14,729
(Seung-jun) Again.

15
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:17,599
(Eui-gyeom) What's the problem?

Longer.

Again.

20
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:34,782
(Eui-gyeom) Ah, timing.

21

[Heavy breathing of Seung-jun]

26
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:53,501
Look at this bastard.

27
00:02:54,102 --> 00:02:55,236
Did you just hit me?

28
00:02:56,237 --> 00:02:57,405

I'm going to turn this school into hell for you.

36

38

If you stand in punching range, you're getting wrecked.

40
00:03:30,638 --> 00:03:32,907

[Seungjun's rough breathing]

111
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:29,517

(Yunki) Hey, I said wrestle together,
who wrestles on the stairs?

124
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:32,113
Hey, you could've actually died.
[Euigyeom's rough breathing]

125
00:07:33,314 --> 00:07:35,617
Wow, I knew he was a unique guy,

126
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:37,085
but I didn't know he was this much, really.

127
00:07:37,518 --> 00:07:39,454
Hey, Seungjun must've been so surprised.

128
00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:41,489
I thought he was a model student,
but he's a total psycho.

129

[Sigh]
[Yunki's laughter]

130
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:44,792
I knew it.

131
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:47,295
Yeah, fighting skills are a talent, after all.

132
00:07:48,796 --> 00:07:49,931
Why are you being like this to me?

133
00:07:50,832 --> 00:07:52,767
Um...

134
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:54,936
Personal curiosity?

135
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,307

at a glance?

[Soft sigh]
[Yunki's laughter]

137
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:04,112
(Euigyeom) You,

138
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,148
can't fight, can you?

139
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,652
Kind of just a big talker?

140
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:12,820
[Intriguing music]

141
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,691
Originally, the coach's
fighting skills aren't important.

142
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:19,494
It's the eyes, these eyes that are important.

143
00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:21,529
(Yunki) I have it too.

144
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:23,631
I've always hated those bastards who act up
because they have numbers on their side.

145
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:25,800
I really couldn't stand them.
[Cell phone vibrates]

146
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:28,436
Those thug bastards...

147
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:34,375
(Seoktae)Where are you?
You’re not answering your phone.
The academy called and said you haven’t come yet.
Call me immediately when you see this message.

148
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,209
[Sigh]

149
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:38,580
Hey, Kang Yunki.

150
00:08:38,947 --> 00:08:39,781
Yeah?

151
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:41,983
Can I ask you a favor?

152
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:44,185
Name it, I'll do 100 for you.

153
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:46,154
Let's switch clothes.

154
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,427
Thanks.

155
00:08:52,994 --> 00:08:54,329
I'm screwed if my parents find out.

156
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:56,998
Don't mention it, between us.

157
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:01,169
(Yunki) I watched a YouTube video
about how to get blood stains out,

158
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:03,404
and I'll clean it up tomorrow and take it to school.

159
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:04,372
Don't worry.

160
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,074
Thanks a lot, really.

161
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:08,543
Between us, what's with the formalities?
[Tap sound]

162
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:10,678
I'll head out first.

163
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:12,347
Already?

164
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:14,716
Hey, wanna grab some food together?
You're not hungry?

165
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:16,618
(Eui-gyeom) I'm late, I gotta hurry.

166
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:17,585
(Yoon-gi) Where are you going?

167
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:19,721
To the academy, I have to go study.

168
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:23,625
Right, you were the top student, weren't you?

169
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,426
The transfer student with both brains and brawn.

170
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:26,261
I'm off.

171
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:27,662
[Yoon-gi sighs in amazement]

172
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:29,297
Hey, Kim Eui-gyeom.

173
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:32,233
(Yoon-gi) Wait, just wait a sec.
[Rustling sound]

174
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:35,770
Take this.

175
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:38,039
It's BB cream.

176
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:40,742
If you get bruises on your face, just dab it on like this.

177
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:41,809
Your parents will be shocked.

178
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:46,481
Look at him, he's not even saying
thanks, jeez.

179
00:09:47,382 --> 00:09:48,983
What a weirdo.

180
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,590
Ah, shit, how embarrassing.

181
00:09:57,158 --> 00:09:58,026
What are we gonna do?

182
00:09:58,293 --> 00:09:59,961
Ah, shut up for a sec, let me think.

183
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:02,563
Think about what?

184
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:04,799
Ah, if they find out Seung-joon got his ass beat,

185
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,801
Those second-year hyungs
aren't gonna let us off the hook.

186
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:10,238
Before the hyungs find out,
we need to stomp them out first.

187
00:10:10,238 --> 00:10:12,740
Ah, then you should've stomped them out earlier,
why were you standing there like an idiot?

188
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,776
(Hong-il) Ah, you son of a bitch,
it was one-on-one back then.

189
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:16,811
It would've been cowardly to stomp him then.

(Seok-tae) [Yelling] Is the atmosphere
the problem, the atmosphere?

194
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:45,940
How many years have I been going to this academy?

195
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,809
Because of the short time,
I couldn't even solve a few problems.

196
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:49,510
And you're letting me go with kind words?

197
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,681
Then you could've given me more time
[Echoing sound effect]

198
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:55,316
Or let me do it one more time.

199
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,558
[Strained] Stop it.

200
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,360
(Eui-gyeom) I said stop!

203
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:12,767
Are you hitting me right now?

Why are you so surprised?

218
00:11:47,302 --> 00:11:48,336
Did you have a dream?

219
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:50,805
(Uigyeom) Yes.

220

[Click of a Walkman]

222
00:11:58,746 --> 00:12:00,081
Why are your lips like this?

223

And what's this bruise?

224
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,053
Ah, I got hit by a ball
while playing basketball yesterday.

225
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,858
[Uigyeom sighs]
(Dabin) You need to be careful.

226
00:12:13,494 --> 00:12:14,462
It's okay.

227
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:16,364
(Uigyeom) It's nothing.

Should I bring you more sausage stir-fry too?

(Uigyeom) Yes.

239
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:18,760
(Seoktae) It would be better to change academies.

240
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:22,764
If you drop to the intermediate class,
there's no merit in attending that academy.

241
00:13:23,932 --> 00:13:26,734
I'll schedule level tests at other academies,
so...

(Ji-hyuk) It's because you've got no guts,
you little shit.

00:18:22,497 --> 00:18:24,499
The top dog of the 2nd years is a guy named Choi Ji-hyuk,

347
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:27,135
And he uniquely fights with a bamboo sword.

348
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:31,172
He probably knows too
because you...

349
00:18:35,043 --> 00:18:36,044
[Heavy sound effect]

352
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:44,452
(Yun-gi) K, Kim Seung-joon...

353
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:46,154
K, Kim Seung-joon, you crazy bastard! Shit.

354
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:48,289
Hey, shit, hey, hey!

355
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:50,792
Hey, Eui-gyeom, hey, are you okay?

356
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:52,727
Hey, hey, snap out of it, hey, hey.

357
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:54,395
Aish, blood.

358
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:56,864
[Panicked breathing]
Hey, 911, 911.

359
00:18:56,864 --> 00:18:58,233
[In pain] I'm okay.

360
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:00,702
My parents will worry if they find out.

361
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:01,769
What?

362
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:03,972
What are you talking about?
Is worrying about that what's important right now? Shit.

363
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:05,406
If I tell you not to, then don't.

364
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:06,908
[Yun-gi's rough breathing]

365
00:19:08,776 --> 00:19:10,078
[Startled gasp]
(Yun-gi) Huh?

366
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:13,448
Ah, hey! Eui-gyeom!

367
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:15,216
Hey, snap out of it! Shit.

368
00:19:15,216 --> 00:19:17,819
Aish, 911, 911, 911
[Siren sound]

Hey, snap out of it! Shit.

[Urgent voices of paramedics]

375
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:40,108
[Sobbing]

376
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:46,247
(Dabin) Oh, what do I do, Soo-gyeom...

377
00:19:51,552 --> 00:19:53,421
Soo, Soo...

378
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:55,290
[Dabin's sobbing]

379
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:17,812

380
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:21,683
[Struggling breaths]
(Yoon-gi) Hey, Kim Eui-gyeom.

381
00:20:22,116 --> 00:20:23,551
Are you coming to? Are you okay?

382
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:24,586
[Eui-gyeom's sigh]
Huh?

383
00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:28,823
[Eui-gyeom's rough breathing]

384
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:31,593
Hey, why did you take this off?

385
00:20:31,593 --> 00:20:33,061
Wait, I'll go get a nurse, okay?

386
00:20:34,095 --> 00:20:35,496
Ah, where are you going?

387
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:37,198
[Frantic breathing]

388
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:38,199
Academy.

389
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:40,335
Academy? You crazy bastard.

390
00:20:40,335 --> 00:20:42,370
(Yoon-gi) Hey!
You can't go now, okay?

391
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:45,039
(Dabin) Eui-gyeom.

392
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,175
- Mom.
- (Dabin) Are you okay?

393
00:20:47,175 --> 00:20:48,343
[Dabin's gasp of surprise]

394
00:20:48,343 --> 00:20:50,111
Are you okay? Where...

395
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:52,280
No, what happened?

396
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,881

398
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,951
Oh, Eui-gyeom.

399
00:20:57,752 --> 00:20:58,820
Oh, Eui-gyeom.

400
00:21:00,722 --> 00:21:02,023
I'm sorry.

401
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:04,459
No, it's okay.

402
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,368
(Jin-woo) Aish.

403
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,236
This isn't going to turn into something big, is it?

404
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:20,375
(Hong-il) Ah, you hit him too hard.
Seung-joon.

405
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:23,878
There's such a thing as motorcycle speed.

406
00:21:23,878 --> 00:21:25,813
You should have calculated that before you hit him.

407
00:21:30,385 --> 00:21:31,552
[Sigh]

408
00:21:40,795 --> 00:21:42,196
(Nurse) You mustn't take it off again.

409
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:44,599
(Dabin) Thank you.

410
00:21:50,872 --> 00:21:51,839
[Dabin's sigh]

411
00:21:56,578 --> 00:21:58,479
Still, it's such a relief it's only this much.

412
00:21:59,213 --> 00:22:00,949
Do you know how worried your mom was?

413
00:22:02,884 --> 00:22:03,952
What happened?

414
00:22:11,326 --> 00:22:12,794
He slipped on the stairs.

415
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,834
What?

416
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:23,805
Ah, the, the bus stop for bus number 378
that Eui-gyeom takes to the academy from school

417
00:22:23,805 --> 00:22:25,039
is a bit far.

418
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,774
So, we take a shortcut.

419
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:27,942
There are stairs in the middle.

420
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,744
(Yoon-gi) But
the width of the stairs is really narrow.

421
00:22:29,744 --> 00:22:32,013
So, kids
frequently fall there.

422
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,749
I, I also fell about three times
during the first semester,

423
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:37,652
and broke my arm here,
so I had a steel rod put in it...

424
00:22:38,386 --> 00:22:39,220
[Quietly] Yes.

425
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:45,026
Yes.
[Clears throat]

426
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:57,939
What's your ranking in school?

427
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:01,209
Pardon?

428
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,078
What's your rank?

429
00:23:06,247 --> 00:23:07,982
(Yoon-gi) Ah, um...

430
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,524
I, uh, I'm not a good student.

431
00:23:10,785 --> 00:23:11,619
Hmm.

432
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,769
I'll head in first, then.

433
00:23:22,664 --> 00:23:24,132
(Da-bin) Okay, go carefully, student.

434
00:23:24,132 --> 00:23:26,034
- Thank you.
- (Yoon-gi) Yes, goodbye.

435
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:26,868
Goodbye.

436
00:23:30,638 --> 00:23:33,141
I should get going too.
I have to go to tutoring.

437
00:23:33,141 --> 00:23:35,376
(Da-bin) Is tutoring your concern right now?

438
00:23:38,346 --> 00:23:40,048
You've got a gash on your head.

439
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:41,616
Just stay here.

440
00:23:45,453 --> 00:23:46,521
I'm sorry.

441
00:23:55,863 --> 00:23:57,165
For worrying you.

442
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:00,635
I'm sorry.

Yes?

445
00:24:10,678 --> 00:24:12,113
You mustn't get hurt.

446
00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:15,617
Or be in pain.

447
00:24:20,088 --> 00:24:21,256
I'm sorry.

00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:40,682
(Dabin) Huh?

527
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:42,617
What is it?

528
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:46,020
I'm sorry.

529
00:28:47,255 --> 00:28:48,990
(Dabin) Oh, um...

530
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,692
[Sound of running footsteps]

531
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:57,999
[Seok-tae's sigh]

532
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:29,897
[ECG beeping]

533
00:29:35,203 --> 00:29:36,871
Why don't you get up now?

534
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,908
Doesn't your back hurt?

535
00:29:47,215 --> 00:29:48,049
I

536
00:29:50,418 --> 00:29:52,320
Just met a guy just like you.

537
00:30:11,606 --> 00:30:12,607
[Sound of car door slamming shut]

538
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:28,656
[Ui-gyeom's sigh]

539
00:30:30,592 --> 00:30:31,726
Hey, Ui-gyeom.

540
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:39,000
Do you want to talk to Mom for a bit?

541
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:42,036
About what?

542
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:46,541
I'm curious about your school life.

543
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:47,775
[Sound of inhaling breath]

544
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:50,478
Have you made any friends?

545
00:30:52,113 --> 00:30:52,981
No.

546
00:30:56,884 --> 00:30:57,885
Tomorrow

547
00:30:58,586 --> 00:31:00,688
You should probably take a day off school, right?

548
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,324
I'm okay.

549
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,594
(Dabin) No, let's just rest.

550
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:10,832
Uh...

551
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:14,235
Oh, something like this happened.
There's no way you can go to school right away.

552
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:17,205
Mom.

553
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,508
If I don't go, I'll fall behind.

554
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:26,114
(Dabin) Don't you want to talk to your mom?

555
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:28,182
[Ui-gyeom's sigh]

556
00:31:29,317 --> 00:31:30,952
Are you resenting your mom right now?

557
00:31:32,754 --> 00:31:34,923
You're resenting your mom right now, aren't you?

558
00:31:34,923 --> 00:31:35,890
Right?

559
00:31:36,524 --> 00:31:37,692
[Soft sigh]

560
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:52,173
Ui-gyeom.

561
00:31:54,876 --> 00:31:56,010
Mom's sorry.

562
00:32:01,282 --> 00:32:02,517
- For what?
- (Dabin) Um...

563
00:32:03,785 --> 00:32:05,520
It's not just Mom who's having a hard time right now.

564
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,788
You must be having a hard time too...

565
00:32:06,788 --> 00:32:07,956
- Mom.
- (Dabin) Um...

566
00:32:09,624 --> 00:32:10,892
I need to study.

567
00:32:12,794 --> 00:32:14,762
[Heavy music]

568
00:32:27,508 --> 00:32:29,611
[Music intensifying]

569
00:32:36,217 --> 00:32:37,218
[Coughing]

570
00:33:10,451 --> 00:33:12,387
(Yoon-gi) Ah, this guy's really crazy.

571
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:14,255
If it were me, I would've said, 'Sweet!' and

572
00:33:14,255 --> 00:33:16,190
Rested for at least three months.
Three months, huh?

573
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,059
[Yoon-gi laughs]
[Noisy chatter]

574
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,395
Hey, wasn't it genius how I lied
about slipping on the stairs yesterday?

575
00:33:20,395 --> 00:33:21,729
Wasn't that genius?

576
00:33:22,297 --> 00:33:24,532
I was so scared that your dad
would want to reconstruct the scene.

577
00:33:24,532 --> 00:33:25,800
I was freaking out.

578
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,569
He's the kind of guy who would.

579
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:31,105
Wow, your dad's aura is no joke.

580
00:33:31,105 --> 00:33:32,173
[Yoon-gi's slight laugh]

581
00:33:34,008 --> 00:33:36,511
(Yoon-gi) You, seriously, huh?
Growing up under a father like that,

582
00:33:36,511 --> 00:33:37,679
that's where your guts came from.

583
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,213
Kim Seung-jun.

584
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:42,317
(Jin-woo) You little punk, who do you
think you are to say his name?

585
00:33:42,317 --> 00:33:44,519
Kim Seung-jun, Kim Seung-jun, Kim Seung-jun.
Why can't I say it?

586
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,054
(Hong-il) This bastard, really.

587
00:33:46,054 --> 00:33:48,122
(Yoon-gi) Try hitting me.
Hitting someone with glasses is attempted murder.

588
00:33:48,122 --> 00:33:49,591
[Yoon-gi's laughter]
[Seung-jun's sound of restraint]

589
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:50,625
Why did you even come to school?

590
00:33:51,526 --> 00:33:53,695
If you're beat up, you should be lying down quietly.

591
00:33:56,397 --> 00:33:58,833
I won't bring up how you
cheap-shotted me yesterday.

592
00:33:58,833 --> 00:33:59,667
But...

593
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:03,004
(Ui-gyeom) Please, just end it here.

594
00:34:03,004 --> 00:34:04,072
[Hong-il's scoff]

595
00:34:06,341 --> 00:34:07,609
If you have any pride,

596
00:34:14,682 --> 00:34:15,516
Kim Ui-gyeom,

597
00:34:20,121 --> 00:34:21,789
don't you dare mess with us again,

598
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:25,760
and live like a dead mouse.

599
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:30,031
Got it?

600
00:34:37,305 --> 00:34:38,139
(Seung-jun) Let's go.

601
00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:40,375
(Hong-il) What? Hey, are we really just leaving?

602
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:41,976
Is that okay?

603
00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:43,845
Hey, Seung-jun, you're going to die if you keep this up.

604
00:34:45,513 --> 00:34:47,482
Damn it, are we going to be
the only ones getting beat up again?

605
00:34:47,482 --> 00:34:50,051
[Sigh]
I'm going crazy, seriously.

606
00:34:50,351 --> 00:34:52,287
(Yoon-gi) Ugh, you pathetic guys.

607
00:34:52,987 --> 00:34:54,222
(Ui-gyeom) It's for the best.

608
00:34:54,923 --> 00:34:56,090
It's all over now.

609
00:34:57,492 --> 00:34:58,393
[Ui-gyeom's sigh]

610
00:35:01,796 --> 00:35:02,664

Hey, Kim Seung-jun.

[Seung-jun's labored groan]

614
00:35:09,103 --> 00:35:10,705
Didn't I tell you to bring Kim Ui-gyeom?

615
00:35:10,705 --> 00:35:11,906
[Seung-jun's labored breathing]

616
00:35:11,906 --> 00:35:14,008
Are my words meaningless to you, huh?
[Seung-jun coughs]

617
00:35:14,976 --> 00:35:17,145
Are you trying to test whether
you're more afraid of Kim Ui-gyeom or me?

618
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:18,079
[Coughs]

That...

622
00:35:27,388 --> 00:35:28,256
I...

623
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:31,492
I completely crushed him yesterday,

624
00:35:32,026 --> 00:35:33,995
(Seung-jun) so that bastard
will never mess with us again...

625
00:35:35,897 --> 00:35:37,231
Lead the way, you punk.

[Students chattering]

627
00:35:56,084 --> 00:35:57,051
Hey, Kim Eui-gyeom.

628
00:35:57,852 --> 00:35:58,820
(Ji-hyeok) Who's Kim Eui-gyeom?

629
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:00,121
(Hong-il) That's him, bro.

630
00:36:02,991 --> 00:36:04,892
(Bully 5) Lower your eyes, you son of a bitch.

631
00:36:11,032 --> 00:36:12,233
Are you Kim Eui-gyeom?

632
00:36:17,705 --> 00:36:19,474
A senior is asking you a question, answer him.

633
00:36:20,241 --> 00:36:21,943
- Hey, Hong-il.
- (Hong-il) Yes?

634
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:23,511
Is this punk always this unresponsive?

635
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:25,480
He usually answers well.

636
00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:27,448
(Ji-hyeok) Take off your headphones, you little shit.

637
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:31,986
(Yoon-gi) Um, seniors
[Yoon-gi clears throat]

638
00:36:33,821 --> 00:36:35,256
Ah, doing this here...

639
00:36:35,823 --> 00:36:37,759
I'll have to tell our homeroom teacher.

[Yoon-gi laughs]

641
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,229
Who are you? What, are you his lawyer?

642
00:36:41,229 --> 00:36:42,163
Why are you answering for him?

643
00:36:42,597 --> 00:36:43,831
Ah, I'm not his lawyer.

644
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:45,900
I'm his helper, hyung.

645
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,935

(Ji-hyeok) Aren't you gonna get up?
[Sound of chair scraping]

652
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:07,755
You're letting guys like this
beat you up? How embarrassing.

to be scared of your seniors, huh?

let's really mess him up today.

- (Bully 4) Ha, seriously.
- (Ji-hyeok) Now you answer well.

when your senior asked you?
