tucking their tails between their legs right now.

355
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:39,840
Why?

356
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,141
Were you expecting something?

357
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:43,290
What did they say?

358
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:48,984
We

359
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:51,419
(Yoon-gi) It's not over.

360
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,054
It's just getting started.

361
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:56,056
What is?

362
00:20:58,092 --> 00:21:01,962
Ah, there are just too many
bad guys in the world.

363
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:03,364
[Sound of phone being operated]

364
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,601
(Yoon-gi) For example, here.

365
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:08,680
You said you transferred from Seomun High, right?

366
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,655
Kim Nam-hyeop, 2nd year at Seomun High.

368
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:14,975
[Laughter]

369
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:18,445
(Nam-hyeop in video) Hey, you little
earthworm, what is this, huh? What is this?
[Laughter from bullies in video]

370
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,293
Hey, I told you not to film, you bastard.

371
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:22,883
(Bully 5) Okay, jeez.
Your face just looks like the devil's.

372
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:25,152
Ah, hurry up and delete it, jeez, damn.
[Sound of door opening]

373
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:26,487
(Teacher) Hey, you guys still haven't left?

374
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:28,756
(Nam-hyeop) Ah, yes, we were
working on our performance assessment, teacher.

375
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:30,457
(Teacher) Oh, really? Go home early.

376
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,026
- (Nam-hyeop) Yes.
- (Teacher) Lock up well.

377
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:33,727
- (Nam-hyeop) Go in safely.
- (Teacher) Yeah.

378
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:34,929
[Sound of door closing]

379
00:21:36,997 --> 00:21:38,866
[Sniffling]
(Nam-hyeop) You heard what the teacher said, right?

380
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,801
Let's get this over with quickly.

381
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,837
Hey, peel this bastard's socks off.
I'm gonna pour this on him.

382
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:44,271
[Seung-beom's terrified sound]

383
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:46,073
Alright, let's see what happens.
[Heavy music]

384
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:48,042
(Seung-beom) Nam-hyeop, Nam-hyeop, don't do it.

385
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:49,643
[Sobbing] Nam-hyeop,
don't do it, don't do it.

386
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:50,878
(Nam-hyeop) Shh, shh, shh.

387
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:52,947
Hey, Seung-beom's gonna scream, shut his mouth.

388
00:21:52,947 --> 00:21:54,215
(Seung-beom) Don't do it, don't do it.

389
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,850
[Seung-beom's labored groan]
[Bullies chuckle]

390
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:01,589
[Nam-hyeop's laughter]

391
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:05,392
[Nam-hyeop's laughter in the video]
[Seung-beom's groan in the video]

392
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:08,696
(Yoon-gi) This Kim Nam-hyeop is a total psycho
sadist, huh?

393
00:22:08,696 --> 00:22:10,631
He says he's relieving the stress he gets from studying.

394
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:13,601
He bullies kids who are easy targets for no reason.
He's a real son of a bitch.

395
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:15,402
This isn't the first time this has happened?

396
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:17,137
But his dad covers it all up.

397
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:19,573
He's a med school professor, so he must have a lot of power.

398
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,851
So, what are we gonna do?

399
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:25,794
Let's catch him.

400
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:27,281
What?

401
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:28,629
You like it, right?

402
00:22:29,383 --> 00:22:31,085
Punishing bad guys.
[Intriguing music]

403
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:36,423
We're now

404
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,926
Going on a true education expedition.
[Laughter]

405
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:43,397
Huh?

406
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:46,167
[Cell phone vibrating]

407
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:59,038
[Sigh] Phone Caller: Father

408
00:22:59,046 --> 00:22:59,880
What are you doing?

409
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:03,284
You should do what you want to do,

410
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,853
Not what your old man tells you

411
00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:07,955
Are you crazy?

412
00:23:08,689 --> 00:23:10,491
[Tense music]
[Yoongi's slight chuckle]

413
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:12,889
Playing rough, huh?

414
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,496
You gonna hit me too?

415
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:18,232
Kang Yoon-gi.

416
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:21,435
You wanna die?

417
00:23:24,872 --> 00:23:26,273
[Laughter]

418
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:34,089
[Music intensifies]

419
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:35,215
Sorry.

420
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:42,623
[Doorbell rings]

421
00:23:43,827 --> 00:23:45,062
(Student 2) Oh, hey, Ui-gyeom.

422
00:23:52,132 --> 00:23:53,099
Thanks.

423
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:55,363
Who are you?

424
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,139
We go to the same school.

425
00:23:58,472 --> 00:23:59,306
(Student 2) Class 2.

426
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:03,577
After you beat up Hong-il last time,

427
00:24:04,411 --> 00:24:06,814
they don't bully me anymore.

428
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:08,082
Ha.

429
00:24:08,716 --> 00:24:10,351
(Student 2) So, I really wanted to say thank you.

430
00:24:10,351 --> 00:24:12,253
[Yoongi scoffs]
I wanted to say that.

431
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:15,656
(Yoongi) Hey! No need to thank him.

432
00:24:16,223 --> 00:24:18,359
He didn't do it for you, okay?

433
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:21,896
Our dumb valedictorian
doesn't have a heart for others.

434
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:24,532
He's just fighting to relieve
his pent-up stress.

435
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:26,100
Since he can't lash out at his dad.

436
00:24:27,274 --> 00:24:28,108
Go on.

437
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,737
Guess my judgment of people is off.

438
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,475
(Student 2) Oh, this...

439
00:24:36,782 --> 00:24:38,851
(Yoongi) Ah, I'll eat it.
Ah, thanks.

[Calm music]

442
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:49,690
(Seok-tae) Meeting professors in advance
and familiarizing yourselves

443
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,225
is good even after you go to university later.

444
00:24:52,873 --> 00:24:55,175
That's why Grandpa sent the invitations.

445
00:24:56,096 --> 00:24:56,931
Yes.

447
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:03,504
there are many who are preparing for or have gotten into medical school.

00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:07,708
Go and build relationships, learn some know-how.

(Staff) This way, please.

454
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:44,212

Oh, Director.

Oh, it's been a while.

- (Director) How are you doing?
- Oh, I'm...

458

Just a moment, let me say hello to the Center Director.

Yes.

You're as beautiful as ever.

465
00:26:07,468 --> 00:26:09,170
It's because CEO Kim takes good care of me.

(Seok-tae) How could a young person
think of something like that?

00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:27,014
Ah, I hurt my leg once.

497
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:30,317
(Nam-hyeop) I realized that there weren't enough
wheelchair facilities at school.

498
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,219
Yeah, so I created it.

It's horrible that he supposedly crippled someone.

518

It's terrible.

00:28:59,707 --> 00:29:00,541
Actually,

525
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,745
our eldest son

526
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:06,947

00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:09,450
committed suicide in that room.

528
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:12,787
(Seok-tae) Are you out of your mind?

529
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:15,756
Bringing up school violence at such an important and respectable event.

530
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:18,392
(Eui-gyeom) Sunbae,

531
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:22,040
he's a thug who beats up kids and steals their money.

532
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,198
[Seok-tae's hollow laugh]

533
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:26,333
Eui-gyeom,

- I saw it myself, Kim Nam-hyeop...
- (Seok-tae) Kim Eui-gyeom!

535
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,707
Successful people

536
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:36,510
are always followed by strange rumors.

537
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,845
It's not a rumor.

538
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:41,344
I saw it myself.

539
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:46,320
Eui-gyeom,

540
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:50,024
(Seok-tae) Do you think there are only two types of people in the world:
those who steal money and those who get their money stolen?

541
00:29:50,157 --> 00:29:51,892
No, you fool!

542
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,761
The world is so complicated and cold.

543
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,506
Look at Nam-hyeop.

544
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,104
See how admirably he handles such rumors?

545
00:29:59,475 --> 00:30:01,444
The reason I brought you here is
to learn that kind of attitude, huh?

546
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:05,764
Let's go, go and

547
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:09,210
apologize to Nam-hyeop.

548
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:11,679
Your place is here.

549
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:14,815
Do you understand?

550
00:30:18,285 --> 00:30:19,253
Why should I?

551
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:25,059
Why Should I become

552
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:30,624
a bad person like him?

553
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:35,104
554
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,636
I don't want to become the same kind of person.

554
00:30:36,436 --> 00:30:37,604
Kim Eui-gyeom!

555
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,539
Dad, do you wanted me to be like my

556
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:45,777
want me to be like my brother?

557
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,214
What?

558
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,417
Even after what happened to him?

(Dabin) That too,

566
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:42,837
Only a month after getting into med school.

567
00:31:46,874 --> 00:31:47,975
[Sigh]

568
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:50,244
Now that I think about it,

569
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:53,647
During that one month,

570
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:56,317
[Sobbing] My eldest son,

571
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:01,214
I think he sent me signals asking for help
countless times.

572
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,192
Ah, but I,

573
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:09,263
Didn't notice it at all back then.

574
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:15,101
[Trembling breath]

575
00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:16,336
If only,

576
00:32:19,474 --> 00:32:22,143
I had realized it then,

577
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:25,212
It would have been so much better.

Let's go.

(Bully 7) Hey, no matter what,
is a human being, shit.

591
00:34:17,424 --> 00:34:20,060
Why would he sit on the toilet during lunchtime
wasting time?

592
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:22,396
Doesn't it stink like hell in here?
[Bully 7's laughter]

593

Ah, because of this bastard,

Aigo, here he is.

My mood is really shitty right now.
