[Sigh]

4
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,193
(Seok-tae) It wasn't that the competition there was tough or anything.

5
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:35,496
[Meaningful music]
Eui-gyeom was always
a kid who only aimed for the top.

(Homeroom Teacher) Ah, yes.
[Homeroom teacher's light laughter]

7
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:41,936
Oh, the vice principal also
complimented Eui-gyeom a lot.

8
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,573
Oh, he won a gold medal
at the International Science Olympiad,

9
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:48,709
And, well, he has many
awards in various other competitions too.

10
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:52,913

specifically asked us to pay special attention to him.

[Homeroom teacher's laughter]

12
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:55,983
Ah, and for us too,

Oh, Eui-gyeom,

16
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:08,262
This place will be
quite different from Seomun High.

17
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:10,764
Because there are more diverse students here.

18
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:14,168
The atmosphere will be a bit different as well.

19
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,036
The atmosphere will also be different.

20
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,706
You know what I mean?

21
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,476
(Seok-tae) Eui-gyeom
will adapt well.

22
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,446
He's a kid who's good at everything.

24
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,017

To our school.

can't I try taking it too?

Why?

99

115
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:03,117

00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:09,697
(Hong-il) Giddy up, giddy up.

179
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:19,173
Giddy up, giddy up, run faster.

180
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,808
Number 1 horse, number 1 horse.

181
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,376
Hey, this punk,
Why are you so weak, huh?

182
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:23,978
Hey, hey, we filled you up with gas yesterday.

183
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:25,546
Hey, you...
[Min-seop's groan]

184
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,281
[Exploding] Jeez!

185
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:28,349
(Jin-woo) Ah, Min-seop.

(Hong-il) Ah,
Why are you so weak, huh?
[Sound of repeated kicking]

187
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:32,186
Hey!

188
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:34,221
You said you ate breakfast, right?

189
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,023
Then why are you so weak?

190
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,226
You punk, huh?
[Min-seop's whimpering]

191

[Hong-il's heavy breathing]
[Min-seop's groan]

193
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:44,265
Get up, you.

194
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,801
[Hong-il's deep breath]

195
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,738
What did you do yesterday?

196
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:53,107
You watched porn yesterday, didn't you?

197
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:54,775
No, I didn't.

198
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,177
[Sarcastically] 'No, I didn't.'

199
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,647
Then why are you so weak?

200
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,082
You pervert.

201
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,584
(Hong-il) Huh?

202
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:06,687
I heard you ate dinner like a pig last night, too.

203
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,156
Didn't you?

204
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:16,797
You little shit.

(Hong-il) Hey, are you crazy?
[Groan]

215
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:54,835
Are you out of your mind?

216
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,705
Did you yell?

217
00:13:57,705 --> 00:13:58,739
Did you yell?

218
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:00,508
You gonna yell, punk?

219
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:02,910
[Straining] You son of a bitch, hey.

220
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:07,348
Shut your mouth.
How dare a bastard like you, you...

nerdy little prick, seriously.

Who do you think you are, screaming here?

226
00:14:16,157 --> 00:14:17,391
(Jin-woo) Hey, hey, hey, Hong-il.

227
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:18,526
Stop it, the teacher's gonna come.

228
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:21,629
Ugh, seriously,
that pathetic little bastard is acting up.

229

[Hong-il's laughter]

230
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:24,899
(Hong-il) Wow, I'm so speechless.

231

[Eui-gyeom's labored breathing]
Ugh, this...

232
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:29,270
Get up, you bastard.

(Jin-woo) Hey, stop it,
you bastard, now.

234
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:32,406
Alright, I won't hit you.

235
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,842
[Laughing] I said I won't hit you.

236
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,847
You're on my shit list, you little punk.

237
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:41,248
[Eui-gyeom's labored breathing]

238
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,316
Get lost, back to your seat.

239
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:44,485
(Hong-il) Aren't you gonna get up?

240
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:45,486
Do you want to get beat up more?

241
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:55,496
What are you looking at, you bastards?

242
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,468

[Motorcycle engine sound]

244
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,483
No, this bastard
suddenly started screaming.

245
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:17,451
I almost had a mental breakdown.

246
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,687
'What is this? Is it a dream?'

247
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:21,755
[Laughing] Seriously,
is this guy a complete psycho?

248
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,257
Here comes the crazy bastard.

249
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,559

250
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,795
(Hong-il) Yo.

251

[Dog barking]

254
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,976
(Euigeom) I was sorry earlier.

255
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:44,311
- I actually...
- (Hongil) Yeah, yeah, whatever, tsk.

256
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:46,847
I was, like, temporarily out of my mind earlier.

257
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,650
But I'll fix that
for you slowly.

258
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,485
Pay me first.

259
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:52,853
Pay?

260
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:56,157
(Jinwoo) Dude,
You gotta pay for talking back, you little punk.

261
00:15:56,157 --> 00:15:58,159
You ruined my mood.

262
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,527
(Hongil) Because of you.

263
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,968
Wow.

264
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,403
You have a lot of money.

265
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:11,505
Are you a silver spoon?

266
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:13,107
Is that what's going on, huh?

267
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:15,843
Here's ten thousand won for you.

268
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:18,312
(Jinwoo) Why
would I give you ten thousand won, you bastard?

269
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,848
[Laughter]

270
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:22,883
Hey, get your phone out.

271
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:24,318
Why?

272
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,387
I'm not gonna take it, man, am I a gangster?

273
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,589
(Hongil) He's gonna put my number in.

274
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:37,231
Unlock it and give it to me, you son of a bitch.

275
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:38,465
I don't have one of those.

276
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:39,733
Is that so?

277
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:42,570
(Hongil) Yeah.

That's when I'm at the academy, and

282
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:57,785
[Hongil sighs]
(Euigeom) When I come home and study,
I can't look at my phone...

[Intense music]

284
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:06,427
If I don't get an answer within 10 seconds,
you're getting hit once every second.

285
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:09,029
Go on.

286
00:17:16,337 --> 00:17:17,905
[Hongil laughs]

287
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,342
Wanna go to karaoke?

288
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,945
You don't seem that scared.

289
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:28,015
He's freaking terrified.
Didn't you see him shaking?

290
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:31,418
Guess not.

291

(Seoktae) The academy called.

296
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:25,172
If your test scores aren't good this time,
you'll have to drop to the intermediate class.

[Cell phone vibrates]

298
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,077

no way that would happen.

304
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:54,869
(Hongil) Hey, you little bastard!

305
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:57,071
Do you think I'm joking?

306
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:58,939
I told you to bring the bread.

307
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:00,574
You wanna die, huh?

308
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:03,043
Sorry.

309
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:04,111
I forgot.

310
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:06,113
(Hongil) There are things you don't forget.

[Hongil sighs]

312
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:10,317
Did you eat breakfast?

313
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:11,852
Yeah.

314
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,188
Did Mom make you a nice spread?

315
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,323
Yeah.

316
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,628
But this son of a bitch, while your older brother's talking to you,

317
00:19:20,628 --> 00:19:22,963
you got your headphones on, huh?

318
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,134
What?

319
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,869
Why won't it come out?
[Sound of grabbing]

320
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,538
Isn't this from 'Guardians of the Galaxy'?

321
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:31,972
How do you turn it on?

322
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:32,807
Give it here.

323
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:34,675
(Hong-il) What?

(Jin-woo) It's not working.

326
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:41,415
What, huh?

327
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:42,716
(Hong-il) Ah.

00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,605
It's important to me.

336
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:07,208

Hey, if it was such an important item,
you should've said so sooner.

353

This isn't just music.

536
00:32:35,723 --> 00:32:36,924
It's a vibration.

537
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:42,129
A living, breathing vibration.

538
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,001
Hyung.

[Sound of door clicking open]

541
00:33:15,663 --> 00:33:16,797
Why are you standing here like that?

542
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:21,602
What page are we on today?

543
00:33:23,404 --> 00:33:25,339
Page 193.

[Students chattering]

545
00:34:07,581 --> 00:34:09,450
Did you sleep well last night? Huh?

546
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:13,254
(Hong-il) I couldn't sleep a wink because of you, you piece of shit. I was so embarrassed.

547
00:34:15,356 --> 00:34:16,790
I'm sorry about yesterday.

548
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:19,026
(Hong-il) What?

549
00:34:19,793 --> 00:34:21,795
[Hong-il's dumbfounded laughter]

550
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:23,731
This guy's a total psycho.

551
00:34:24,365 --> 00:34:25,232
Sorry?

552
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:26,700
(Eui-gyeom) Yeah.

553
00:34:28,102 --> 00:34:29,069
I'm really sorry.

554
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:31,272
Ah, goddamn it, you piece of shit.

555
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:33,507
(Hong-il) I'll see you later.

556
00:34:35,976 --> 00:34:37,311
(Jin-woo) What are we gonna do about that bastard?

557
00:34:37,611 --> 00:34:38,679
(Hong-il) What else?

558
00:34:38,846 --> 00:34:39,980
We gotta stomp him good.

559
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,881
[Hong-il chuckles]

560
00:34:41,115 --> 00:34:43,918
I never even imagined you'd grab my hair and push my head down.

561
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:47,354
My dad's already balding, so I'm super sensitive about it right now, ah.

562
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:50,791
I told you, didn't I? It starts today.

563
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:54,895
Probably a guy named Kim Seung-joon wearing a beanie will come looking for you.

564
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:57,064
He acts like the king of the freshmen because he knows some boxing.

565
00:34:57,064 --> 00:34:58,465
He's not that big of a deal.

566
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:01,569
[Intense music] When the fight starts?

567
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:03,904
You'll get wrecked if you stand in his punching range.

568
00:35:04,038 --> 00:35:05,973
Just close the distance, and grapple with him.

569
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:08,609
You seem stronger, right? At least, that's what I think.

570
00:35:08,843 --> 00:35:10,311
Could you not stand so close?

571
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:12,046
And...

572
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,782
I'm really not gonna fight.

573
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:21,322
Just because you don't want to fight doesn't mean you won't have to.

574
00:35:21,322 --> 00:35:23,724
Ha, what a dumbass, seriously.

(Hong-il) Hey, get out of here, all of you!

578
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:32,566
[Seung-jun sighs]
(Jin-woo) Hurry up and get out!

Hurry, hurry, get out quickly.

(Yoon-gi) That's right.
Quick, hurry up and get out.

Who are you?

585
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:49,083
Not leaving?

586
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:50,718
Me? Just a spectator.

[Yoon-gi chuckles]

(Hong-il) Wanna die?

589
00:35:54,088 --> 00:35:55,923
(Yoon-gi) Hey, but,
yesterday was so much fun.

590
00:35:55,923 --> 00:35:57,424
Is your jaw okay?
[Hong-il's disbelieving laugh]

591
00:35:57,424 --> 00:36:00,227
Hey, it really went right into his jaw,
and he just collapsed.

592
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:02,129
[Hong-il huffing]
Choi Hong-il, you pathetic bastard.

593
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:04,265
Ah, he's calling for you.

594
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:07,735
(Seung-jun) It's because you're acting like an idiot.

595
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:10,571
That's why those lowlife punks are picking a fight.

596
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:14,408
Ah, lowlife punk? That's
a bit harsh.

(Seung-jun) Wanna die?

598
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:19,246
Ah, no.

(Ui-gyeom) Hey.

600
00:36:25,386 --> 00:36:26,620
Why are you doing this to me?

601
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:34,228
Did you mess with Hong-il?

602
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,066
I apologized for yesterday, and...

Are you in a gang?

If you use your fists anywhere just because
you learned to fight,

that makes you a gangster, you son of a bitch.

lauched a fist earlier, didn't you?

Hey, I told you,
you can't handle him in punching range.

650
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:30,738
You gotta grapple him no matter what.
You gotta stick to him and roll around, got it?

651
00:39:30,905 --> 00:39:34,542
You almost launched a fist earlier?
You'd get your ass kicked for real, got it?

you'd be a damn good fighter, for real.

Hi.

712
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:15,763
(Hong-il) Just you wait.

713
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,331
Once Kim Ui-gyeom's done, this...

714
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:19,600
I'm gonna give you some character
education today, damn it.

[Yoon-gi laughs]

716

Please take care of me.

[Suspenseful music]

720
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:39,253
Come and get it.

721
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:41,455
Before I smash it to pieces.

722
00:43:56,437 --> 00:43:57,304
(Yoon-gi) Bring it.

723
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:03,611

(Jin-woo) Don't kill him!

725
00:44:12,553 --> 00:44:13,821
Give me back my Walkman.

726
00:44:22,296 --> 00:44:23,364
Who said I wouldn't give it to you?

727
00:44:24,098 --> 00:44:24,999
I'll give it.

728
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,101
(Seung-jun) If you beat me in a fight,

729
00:44:28,135 --> 00:44:29,136
Simple, right?

730
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,405
Why do I have to fight?

731
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:32,873
Take off your bag.

732
00:44:32,873 --> 00:44:33,941
I said I don't want to fight...

[Eui-gyeom groans]

734
00:44:36,377 --> 00:44:38,212
My mood is really
foul today, because of you.

Oh, really.
[Eui-gyeom panting]

747

Now you feel like it?

749
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:15,082
Hey, Kim Seung-jun.

750
00:45:15,683 --> 00:45:17,685
You guys started it first,

751

[Eui-gyeom's groan]

763
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:44,078
(Seung-jun) It's because
you keep sticking your nose in things.

764

Get up, you.
