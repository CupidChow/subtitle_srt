00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,466
If you’re sorry,

363
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:03,504
lend me some cash.

364
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:05,272
(Seung-sik, amused) I’m broke lately,

365
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:08,342
lots of bills to pay.

366
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:11,779
Help the needy, yeah?

[Quiet chuckle]

368
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:18,853
This enough?

369
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:21,989
Now you’re talking.

370
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:26,827
But do me a favor—

[Tense music] [Bills rustle]

372
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,398
I want a quiet life here.

373
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:35,503
Help me out?

374
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,542
Yeah?

375
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:44,078
Okay.

376
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:46,747
Then cough up ₩100 000 a week.

377
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:49,683
(Seung-sik) No cash?

378
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:52,520
Work it off.

[laughs] Damn.

390
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:27,521
Now I’m pissed.

391
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,190
Enough.

[Seung-sik sighs]

393
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:31,325
I’m asking you.

394
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:32,593
Can’t do that.

395
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:34,762
I’m in a mood today—

396
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,997
a really bad one.

Better count yourself lucky.

406
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,296
Nam Seung-sik, Lee Geol-jae—both of you,

407
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:11,799
follow me to the staff room, now.

(Yun-gi) Ui-gyeom-ah.

432
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:42,056
A third-year transfer supposedly fought Nam Seung-sik.

433
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:43,757
Why?

434
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:44,792
(Hong-il) Why d’you think?

He wants to take over the school.

If he floors Nam Seung-sik,

437
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:50,898
next is Kim Ui-gyeom—that’s you.

If you mean to rule the school, forget Nam Seung-sik—

451
00:24:43,217 --> 00:24:44,985

No way… Lee Geol-jae of Mu-myeong High?

00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:17,318
Must be a misunderstanding.

I’ve no intention of fighting.

458
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:22,756
Then why fight Nam Seung-sik the moment you arrived?

Please?

470
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:52,853

00:25:54,255 --> 00:25:55,523
I don’t intend to fight.

472
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,525
Don’t touch me.

About today—my apologies.

478
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:17,044
Ui-gyeom and I weren’t picking a fight. We just…

479
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:20,147
thought you were another fist-happy thug.

480
00:26:22,283 --> 00:26:23,284
I’m sorry.

481
00:26:26,353 --> 00:26:27,788
So tell me—

482
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:29,890
(Geol-jae) How’s what you do any different from thuggery?

483
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,791
(Ui-gyeom) It is different.

484
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:32,860
We only beat the bad guys.

(Yun-gi) Can it for a sec. [Geol-jae chuckles]

(Geol-jae) That’s funny.

487
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:38,699
And who decides who’s “bad”?

00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:41,702
Am I bad, or good?

You’ll learn once you live through it.

I almost wet myself—seeing Lee Geol-jae for real.

497
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:19,707
That’s insane.

00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:22,276
Is that guy really that strong?

500
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,778
Even ten Kim Ui-gyeoms together couldn’t beat him.

501
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:26,981
When people figure out who Senior Geol-jae is,

502
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:29,416
no one at our school will dare act tough.

503
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:32,019
The whole place will finally quiet down.

[Yoon-gi whistles in awe.]

508
00:27:41,595 --> 00:27:42,496
(Seung-sik) So,

509
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:44,031
you didn’t fight him?

510
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:45,266
(Hong-il) Right.

511
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:47,168
Yeah, that transfer student

512
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:50,204
said he had zero intention of fighting.

[Seung-sik scoffs.]

What the…?

515
00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:55,442
Since when did everyone start

516
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,379
respecting other people’s feelings?

517
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:01,982
[Seung-sik snorts.][Awkward laugh from Hong-il.]

00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:02,883
(Seong-wook) Seung-sik.

519
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:06,587
You think this is funny?

520
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:10,457
Word’s out that you got stomped by a freshman.

521
00:28:12,126 --> 00:28:12,960
(Seung-sik) That so?

522
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:16,797
But nobody’s heard how you got wrecked by one too?

523
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:19,700
(Ui-gyeom) Mumyeong High?

524
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:23,904
(Yoon-gi) Yeah. Hardly anyone’s heard of it,

525
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:27,908
it’s some kind of pilot school—totally messed up.

526
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:30,611
Juvenile crime got so bad,

527
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:32,913
detention centers couldn’t handle it.

528
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,316
They gathered all the bad kids in one place,

529
00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:36,584
so they just learn to be even worse.

530
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:37,518
Wouldn’t you?

531
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:41,055
So they said, “We need rehab, not more ex-cons,”

532
00:28:41,055 --> 00:28:42,556
and the Justice Ministry

533
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:44,992
set up this weird experimental school.

534
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:46,894
[Ominous music] There are a few of them nationwide.

535
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:50,331
It’s not exactly juvie, but it’s not really a school either.

536
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:52,766
Anyway, the teachers there

537
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:55,069
actually egg the fights on,

[sounds of scuffling] ranking the kids by fight scores.

539
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,042
You know the Samcheong Re-education Camp, right?

540
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:03,144
Yeah.

541
00:29:03,144 --> 00:29:04,678
(Yoon-gi) Back in the day they’d round up gangsters

[student groans]

551
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:24,365
—he was top dog there and got out.

552
