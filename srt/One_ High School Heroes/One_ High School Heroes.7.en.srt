1
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,731
Hey. 

2
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,500
Did you guys hit our younger ones? 

3
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,704
You shouldn't do that, huh? 

4
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,173
Hey, get up, get up, huh? 

5
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,242
Our younger ones, huh? 

6
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,377
Stand straight, you punks. We need to collect money. 

7
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,913
You can't demoralize them, you bastards! 

8
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,651
Hey, you guys,
who are supposed to be the best in 2nd grade, 

9
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:58,752
you got beaten up in the classroom? 

10
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,254
Huh? 

11
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:01,922
I'm sorry. 

12
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,526
Join us as our subordinates and we'll forgive you. 

13
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:08,496
Otherwise, you'll be beaten up
until we graduate. 

14
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,365
What are you going to do? Be our subordinate? 

15
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,368
I'm sorry. 

16
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,371
You don't want to? 

17
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,974
Hey, hey, hey, hey! 

18
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:23,477
You're not answering? Huh? 

19
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,580
Hey, answer again.
What did you say, huh? 

20
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,482
I don't want to. 

21
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,117
Oh, look at these punks. 

22
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,587
Ugh, remove your hand, you bastard. Answer me, you don't want to? 

23
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,055
Huh? 

24
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,124
Yes. 

25
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,259
'Yes'? 

26
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,393
Oh, this bastard. 

27
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,629
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come out, come out, come out. 

28
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,197
Huh? 

29
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,999
- Brazilian kick!
- Oh, oh. 

30
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,800
Stand still, exactly. 

31
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:48,769
Stand straight. 

32
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,137
Good. 

33
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,507
Brazilian kick! 

34
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,911
Ah, hey.
It's not going high enough. 

35
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:59,046
Ah, a bit more, it has to go
a bit higher. Stand still. 

36
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,815
Ah, stand still, right, just stand. 

37
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:02,650
Oh, put strength here, huh? 

38
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,984
Strength! 

39
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,719
Low kick! 

40
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,191
Hey, a kick is a low kick! 

41
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,696
We'll cover you from behind, so 

42
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,566
extort money from kids
and give us 100,000 won a week. 

43
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,634
You keep the rest. 

44
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:22,803
Okay? 

45
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,140
No, I don't want to. 

46
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,475
No, I... 

47
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,410
No, you bastard, huh? 

48
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,846
Stand, stand, what? 

49
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,548
Hey, huh? Huh? 

50
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,250
Ah, come here, all of you, you bastards. 

51
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,384
Stand here. 

52
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:41,255
You don't want to? You don't want to?
Remove your hand, you bastard, you're resisting? 

53
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,829
Ah, these bastards,
seriously, damn. 

54
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,665
Stand, stand straight.
Ugh, this bastard, seriously. 

55
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,336
Remove your hand, you bastard, remove your hand. 

56
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:56,937
I said remove your hand, you bastard. 

57
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,708
Ugh, it hurts. 

58
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:08,315
Hey. 

59
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:10,284
You endured it well though. 

60
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:14,321
What's the point of dealing with kids like them, damn it.
You know I let you hit me, right? 

61
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,623
Damn it, damn it! 

62
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:19,527
Idiot. 

63
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,363
He's not even
a handful... 

64
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:23,264
Ah, damn. 

65
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,035
I almost died, seriously. 

66
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,103
Are you okay? 

67
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,441
Ah, this bastard. 

68
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,377
Look at your face. 

69
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:39,713
Damn it, cunning bastards. 

70
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,782
Ah, these bastards. 

71
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:45,553
I told them to collect money,
but they keep avoiding it. 

72
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:49,356
Even when I tell them to come,
they don't show up, they just hide. 

73
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:51,058
But what? 

74
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,394
You were playing games at the PC room? Huh? 

75
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,530
Ah, seriously, damn. 

76
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,200
Are you crazy, you bastard? Huh? 

77
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:00,835
Are you crazy? 

78
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,771
Hey. 

79
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,874
You played games with the money you collected, didn't you? Huh? 

80
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,543
Give me the money you collected, hurry up. 

81
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:14,949
Hurry. 

82
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,120
One, two. 

83
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,023
24,000 won? 

84
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:24,859
How much? 

85
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,528
Hey, he
only has 24,000 won? 

86
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:30,197
- Cute.
- Hey. 

87
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,732
Did you collect properly? 

88
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,033
Is it your money? 

89
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:35,069
No. 

90
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,037
Are you sure? 

91
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,405
Yes. 

92
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,307
Hey, what about you? 

93
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:43,878
I don't have any. 

94
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:47,414
What? 

95
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,516
You don't have any? 

96
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,985
I didn't extort anything. 

97
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,755
Wow. 

98
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:56,557
Wow. 

99
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:59,093
Hey, you've got guts. 

100
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,932
Hey, are you crazy? 

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,135
He's completely insane, this bastard, huh? 

102
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:09,403
Are you messing with me? 

103
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:11,939
Ah, damn. 

104
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:17,444
Hey. 

105
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,580
Yes? 

106
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:20,781
You, go. 

107
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:22,550
Yes? 

108
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:24,685
I'll let you go, so go. 

109
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:29,523
Ah, just go. 

110
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,764
Let's go. 

111
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,100
Oh, oh. 

112
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:43,771
Only you. 

113
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,584
Why? 

114
00:06:58,185 --> 00:06:59,320
Do you want to stay instead? 

115
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:06,994
Go. 

116
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:11,565
Ah, get lost quickly. 

117
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,171
It's okay, go. 

118
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,706
Ah, get lost quickly! 

119
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,625
Ah, that loser. 

120
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38,826
He actually left. 

121
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,478
Huh? 

122
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,651
One, two, three. 

123
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:13,921
Ah, damn it, ah. 

124
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:42,983
Not running away today? 

125
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,486
You should leave when I let you. 

126
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,421
Huh? 

127
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,316
Ah, damn. 

128
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:20,521
You still run away well. 

129
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:21,989
As always, huh? 

130
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:34,668
Oh. 

131
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:36,971
How is it? 

132
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,038
How is it? 

133
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,608
Doesn't it remind you of the old days?
Huh? How is it, damn it? 

134
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:45,880
Huh? Hey, we had so much fun like this, didn't we, huh? 

135
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,348
Ah, damn, this is boring. 

136
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,723
Hey, just lie down, huh? 

137
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:58,058
Why are you struggling to get up? 

138
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:58,959
Hey! 

139
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:06,600
Stop it. 

140
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,338
Superhero. 

141
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:15,376
I came because I was curious about you. 

142
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:17,578
No, I also have some things to ask. 

143
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:20,648
Why are you 

144
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:22,716
beating up our guys? 

145
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,219
Did he ask you to 

146
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,321
help him get his revenge or something? 

147
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:28,989
Huh? 

148
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,225
You're going to become
a cripple today because of that. 

149
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:32,726
You know that? 

150
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,965
This bastard doesn't know anything, huh? 

151
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:39,600
Hey, Kang Yoon. 

152
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:42,770
Aren't you too shameless? 

153
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,071
Huh? 

154
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,974
Your friend is going to become
a cripple today. 

155
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:49,143
You should at least explain why. 

156
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,645
I'm not interested in your situation. 

157
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,649
You just look annoying, 

158
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,621
so I just want to hit you. 

159
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:18,038
Block, block. Are you blocking, blocking? 

160
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:25,479
Ah. 

161
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,026
Wow. 

162
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,529
Hey, this is fun, huh? 

163
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:43,030
Is it my turn now? 

164
00:12:55,543 --> 00:12:57,478
Oh, are you blocking? Huh? 

165
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:59,046
Blocking, blocking? 

166
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:00,281
Blocking? 

167
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:07,421
Blocking, blocking, blocking, blocking? 

168
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,168
Hey. 

169
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:23,170
Get up, get up, get up. 

170
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,105
Get up, huh? 

171
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:29,577
Block, damn it! 

172
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:47,862
Hey. 

173
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:49,363
Your... 

174
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:50,865
Your shoulder's broken. 

175
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:52,433
I had a strong feeling. 

176
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,801
Huh? 

177
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:07,081
It's broken. 

178
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:08,682
Hey. 

179
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:12,386
That's why you need to
choose your friends wisely. 

180
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:16,357
Otherwise, you'll end up like this, a cripple. 

181
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:21,328
Kang Yoon. 

182
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:27,935
Revenge is 

183
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:31,906
for those with power. 

184
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:39,880
Because of you, 

185
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:42,616
a friend is going to become a cripple today. 

186
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,418
Stop it! 

187
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,030
Lee Geon-jae? 

188
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,099
Ah, long time no see. 

189
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,902
I didn't even know you were at Yeonseong. 

190
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:04,438
Stop it. 

191
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:06,140
That's enough. 

192
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:15,015
What if I say I can't? 

193
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,053
I'll make you do it. 

194
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:43,844
Hey, superhero! 

195
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:49,450
See you again. 

196
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:01,162
Come get this. 

197
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,711
You guys should stop now too. 

198
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:23,717
Kang Yoon-gi. 

199
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,654
Don't bother me anymore. 

200
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:31,926
I've repaid my debt. 

201
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:57,418
No. 

202
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:00,387
Why do you keep making the same mistakes? 

203
00:17:03,157 --> 00:17:03,991
Huh? 

204
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:07,428
Aren't you going to focus? 

205
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:08,829
Not focusing? 

206
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,898
Again. 

207
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,634
- Yes.
- Tsk, again. 

208
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,004
Turn. 

209
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:24,078
I'm not hitting you because I hate you,
so don't be upset. 

210
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:31,085
The college entrance exam
isn't far off now. 

211
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:35,923
Your future life depends on
how you act now. 

212
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:37,625
You must never live
like your dad, 

213
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:39,860
being disrespected. 

214
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,030
You understand, Dad? 

215
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,100
Yes. 

216
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:50,070
I love you. 

217
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:28,175
Uigyeom. 

218
00:18:29,677 --> 00:18:31,178
Uigyeom. 

219
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,281
How difficult it is for me, huh? 

220
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,450
You know. 

221
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:38,686
Uigyeom, huh? 

222
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:40,988
- Don't come, oh, don't come.
- You know. 

223
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:42,523
Mom! 

224
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,458
Sugyeom, what's wrong? 

225
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:47,862
You 

226
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,731
didn't intentionally try to
hurt your brother, did you? 

227
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:52,066
Right? 

228
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:56,604
Uigyeom will understand everything. 

229
00:18:58,973 --> 00:18:59,874
It's okay. 

230
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:03,677
It's okay. 

231
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:08,916
It's okay. 

232
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:12,019
Sugyeom. 

233
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:15,623
You're almost there
to achieving your goal, aren't you? 

234
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,225
Just a little more, okay? 

235
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,360
You're almost there. 

236
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:22,596
It's really the end now. 

237
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,372
- Ui, Ui, Uigyeom.
- Blood. 

238
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,408
- Are you okay?
- Don't come. 

239
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:36,644
Uigyeom, I'm sorry.
I, I... 

240
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:37,711
I just lost my mind for a moment... 

241
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:38,746
Go away! 

242
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:41,715
Hey! 

243
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,884
Why is it so loud? 

244
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:45,920
What time is it now? 

245
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:53,460
Sugyeom. 

246
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,529
Go to your room quickly. 

247
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,740
Your brother is just very sensitive right now. 

248
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,142
Hm? 

249
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,878
It's not much longer. 

250
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,751
- Come on, Sugyeom.
- Yes. 

251
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,287
Well done. 

252
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,756
Congratulations, Sugyeom. 

253
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:24,492
Mom knew you could do it. 

254
00:20:24,492 --> 00:20:27,328
Congratulations on entering
Seomun High School, Uigyeom. 

255
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:28,362
Thank you. 

256
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:29,196
Cheers! 

257
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,199
To our family! 

258
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:33,400
To our family! 

259
00:20:36,437 --> 00:20:37,271
Congratulations, Hyung. 

260
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,107
I'm really proud of you, Hyung. 

261
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:48,849
Mom. 

262
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:49,683
Yes. 

263
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:55,656
Can I quit school? 

264
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,898
What are you talking about? 

265
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,068
- Mom, I...
- Sugyeom. 

266
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:12,206
Mom has a mountain of work today.
I have to finish this by today. 

267
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,281
I 

268
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:23,517
am too tired. 

269
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:32,893
You're quitting medical school? 

270
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:35,362
Why? 

271
00:21:36,864 --> 00:21:38,265
Are you in your right mind? 

272
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:40,601
It's just the beginning, why?! 

273
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:49,643
Uigyeom. 

274
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:51,345
Are you sleeping? 

275
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,247
This... 

276
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:29,783
I want to give it to you. 

277
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,988
Because it's the most precious thing to me. 

278
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:38,792
But... 

279
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:43,164
it broke after Dad
threw it last time. 

280
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:46,500
There's no sound. 

281
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:57,144
But even without sound,
when I wear this, 

282
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:06,387
my mind becomes peaceful. 

283
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:09,990
If I wear this, 

284
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:16,630
I can enter a world
where Dad isn't there. 

285
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:32,246
Uigyeom. 

286
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:40,221
I'm sorry for everything. 

287
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:17,158
You again? 

288
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,260
- Did you roll down the stairs again?
- Uigyeom. 

289
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:22,229
It's all my fault. 

290
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:24,431
Uigyeom, are you okay? 

291
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,268
Are you feeling better now? 

292
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:30,070
Uigyeom. 

293
00:24:31,172 --> 00:24:32,206
Who did this? 

294
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:33,507
Huh? 

295
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:37,178
These bastards,
they're like gangsters. 

296
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:38,445
They made the kid like this? 

297
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:40,014
Who is it? 

298
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:42,116
I'll make them
all eat prison food, so, huh? 

299
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:43,284
Who is it? 

300
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:48,255
You know too, right? 

301
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:49,123
Who is it? 

302
00:24:49,256 --> 00:24:50,291
- Huh?
- Honey. 

303
00:24:51,926 --> 00:24:53,494
Uigyeom woke up. 

304
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:55,596
Let's take care of Uigyeom first. 

305
00:24:56,831 --> 00:24:57,698
Huh? 

306
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:01,101
Kim Nam-hyeop. 

307
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:05,673
Who? 

308
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:19,019
Kim Nam-hyeop sent them. 

309
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,425
Why would Nam-hyeop...? 

310
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:28,996
Because I almost killed that bastard. 

311
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:33,734
He's a very bad bastard
who beats up kids and takes their money. 

312
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,111
- You...
- Dad. 

313
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:47,882
Are you sure? 

314
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:53,254
He's the son of the doctor
at the hospital you supply to. 

315
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:57,825
Prison food. 

316
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:00,327
Can you make him eat it? 

317
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,704
Hey, Kang Yoon-gi. 

318
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:13,908
Huh? 

319
00:26:15,176 --> 00:26:16,677
Aren't you sorry to me? 

320
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:21,515
I'm sorry. 

321
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:26,353
Because of your revenge,
I even fought. 

322
00:26:28,322 --> 00:26:30,191
Because of your revenge, I... 

323
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:34,094
I even pretended to be
a childish hero. 

324
00:26:36,564 --> 00:26:37,565
Uigyeom. 

325
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,601
Don't be sorry to me. 

326
00:26:42,536 --> 00:26:44,038
I told you, didn't I? 

327
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:48,209
I'm really not interested in your situations. 

328
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:52,246
That bastard from Jinil High. 

329
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:56,951
He just looked annoying,
so I wanted to hit him. 

330
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:06,727
And that bastard told me
to come get the Walkman. 

331
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:08,128
Uigyeom. 

332
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:09,930
No, you can't go to him. 

333
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:11,966
Let's stop, okay? 

334
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:17,872
Hey, Kang Yoon-gi. 

335
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,979
You knew it wouldn't work, but 

336
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,282
what was your reason for starting? 

337
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:50,137
Huh? 

338
00:27:58,212 --> 00:27:59,213
Hello. 

339
00:28:03,818 --> 00:28:05,119
I'm, I'm sorry. 

340
00:28:07,888 --> 00:28:08,989
Ah, Uigyeom, 

341
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,127
how is he doing? 

342
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:19,800
Uigyeom took a leave of absence today. 

343
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:24,605
He'll go to study abroad in America right after being discharged, so 

344
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:27,408
don't contact him anymore. 

345
00:28:41,155 --> 00:28:42,156
Kang Yoon-gi. 

346
00:28:47,962 --> 00:28:49,163
Is Uigyeom okay? 

347
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,567
I don't know. 

348
00:28:56,136 --> 00:28:59,573
You tricked that goody-two-shoes
and incited him to fight. 

349
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,009
So now that it's like this, 

350
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:03,777
are you satisfied? 

351
00:29:08,015 --> 00:29:09,817
Are you even a friend? 

352
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:27,835
Jiseong. 

353
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:31,071
What, you're sitting?
Are you okay now? 

354
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:33,941
Who are you? 

355
00:29:37,144 --> 00:29:37,978
Ah... 

356
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:48,889
- Ah, this bastard.
- Ah, damn. 

357
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:50,424
Ah, this bastard,
look at his expression. 

358
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:52,626
- Ah...
- Why is your face like that again? 

359
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:53,727
Did you fight again? 

360
00:29:53,727 --> 00:29:56,197
Ah, damn, you startled me.
Ah, seriously. 

361
00:29:56,363 --> 00:29:58,065
Why is your face like that? 

362
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:00,701
What, are you okay now?
Can you walk? 

363
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:02,203
Not yet. 

364
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:04,138
The nurse helped me up. 

365
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:08,108
Ah, damn, hey, get well soon.
We have to make up for all the fun we missed. 

366
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:09,777
I was so bored, damn it. 

367
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:16,517
But aren't you angry at me? 

368
00:30:16,517 --> 00:30:17,718
Huh? Why? 

369
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:19,954
It's because of me. 

370
00:30:20,554 --> 00:30:22,356
Because I cowardly ran away. 

371
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,092
You've been thinking that all this time? 

372
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,729
I was so sorry to you. 

373
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:30,731
I should have been by your side. 

374
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:34,301
You tried to, though.
I saw you coming back. 

375
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,044
That bastard is coming back. 

376
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:45,980
Hey, Lee Gi-yoon, you won. 

377
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,748
See, I told you he'd come back. 

378
00:30:47,748 --> 00:30:50,084
Ah, that son of a bitch
is coming back to die. 

379
00:30:50,084 --> 00:30:51,785
Ah, seriously, I'm so pissed. 

380
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:53,187
Hey, Lee Ji-seong. 

381
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:55,389
You're lucky today, huh? 

382
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:57,825
I'm going to beat that bastard up instead of you, damn it. 

383
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:03,430
I told Yoon-gi I'd let him go. 

384
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,733
Is this bastard crazy, seriously? 

385
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,303
Ah, this bastard,
why is he suddenly like this, huh? 

386
00:31:09,303 --> 00:31:11,205
Hey, hey.
Let go, let go, let go. 

387
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:12,406
Grab him, grab him, grab him. 

388
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:13,808
- Grab him.
- Grab him. 

389
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:16,043
Let go!
- Wow, damn. 

390
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:17,411
He's going up. 

391
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:19,079
He's going! 

392
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:22,917
Let go! Let go, you sons of bitches! 

393
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:26,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 

394
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,354
Hey, hey.
Let go when I say one, two, three. 

395
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:29,356
- Let go, let go.
- Hey, he'll die if you let go. 

396
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:30,624
I said let go, it's okay. 

397
00:31:30,624 --> 00:31:32,259
- Hey, you sons of bitches!
- Do it. 

398
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:33,994
Let go when I say one, two, three.
One, two, three. 

399
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,464
One, two, three, then. 

400
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:39,767
Hey, let go when I say one, two, three.
One, two, three. 

401
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,335
Hey! 

402
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,039
I said let go, let go. 

403
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:54,748
Ah, damn. 

404
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:55,749
Hey, what do we do? 

405
00:31:57,318 --> 00:31:58,886
Gisu, damn it. 

406
00:32:00,554 --> 00:32:01,555
Understood? 

407
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:04,658
It's not because of you
that I ended up like this, dummy. 

408
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:07,428
This big brother saved you. 

409
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:11,465
You said you went to the police station
and gave a statement and all that, right? 

410
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:16,036
Because of that,
my dad said he'll formally press charges. 

411
00:32:16,904 --> 00:32:19,240
Even though Kim Nam-hyeop's dad
is pretty powerful, 

412
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:22,176
because you gave a statement,
it seems like we have a chance. 

413
00:32:25,646 --> 00:32:27,348
You must have been scared and lonely, 

414
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:30,117
I'm grateful to you. 

415
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:34,688
Thank you, Yoon-gi. 

416
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:52,173
Uigyeom. 

417
00:32:53,274 --> 00:32:54,275
Uigyeom. 

418
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:56,310
Sleeping? 

419
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:15,296
Hyung? 

420
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:23,838
This... 

421
00:33:26,607 --> 00:33:28,175
I wanted to give it to you. 

422
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:33,147
Because it's the most precious thing to me. 

423
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,631
Hyung. 

424
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:54,101
Hyung. 

425
00:33:57,271 --> 00:33:58,239
Hyung. 

426
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,018
Hyung. 

427
00:34:36,143 --> 00:34:37,144
Huh? 

428
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:49,023
Uigyeom. 

429
00:34:58,866 --> 00:34:59,867
Uigyeom. 

430
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,511
Uigyeom! 

431
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:21,522
What are you doing there? 

432
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:23,757
It's dangerous. 

433
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,061
Please, huh? 

434
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,597
Come to Mom. 

435
00:35:29,597 --> 00:35:30,598
Uigyeom. 

436
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:33,567
Mom. 

437
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:38,139
I think I can
understand Hyung now. 

438
00:35:41,575 --> 00:35:42,643
Uigyeom. 

439
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,745
Uigyeom, Mom is sorry. 

440
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:47,114
Mom is sorry. 

441
00:35:47,114 --> 00:35:48,449
Mom did everything wrong. 

442
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,618
Because of Mom's greed, 

443
00:35:51,118 --> 00:35:54,021
even though I knew you and Sugyeom
were suffering, 

444
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:56,524
even though I knew your dad
was too harsh, 

445
00:35:57,258 --> 00:35:58,459
because of Mom's greed, 

446
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:01,095
I just hoped
you would both endure it well. 

447
00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:03,430
Uigyeom, I'm sorry. 

448
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:05,533
Uigyeom, I'm truly sorry. 

449
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,001
It's all my fault. 

450
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:09,203
Mom's greed was excessive. 

451
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,038
Uigyeom. 

452
00:36:11,472 --> 00:36:13,607
Uigyeom, come down. 

453
00:36:14,108 --> 00:36:15,409
Please come down. 

454
00:36:16,477 --> 00:36:17,545
I'm sorry. 

455
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:22,416
It's too much for me. 

456
00:36:24,752 --> 00:36:25,920
I don't think I can 

457
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:29,990
do it anymore. 

458
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:53,180
Uigyeom... 

459
00:36:54,482 --> 00:36:55,649
Uigyeom, Ui... 

460
00:36:59,854 --> 00:37:00,855
Uigyeom. 

461
00:37:08,262 --> 00:37:10,264
Uigyeom, Ui... 

462
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,093
Uigyeom. 

463
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:42,196
Uigyeom. 

464
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,499
Uigyeom, thank you. 

465
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:47,868
Thank you, Uigyeom. 

466
00:37:50,471 --> 00:37:52,506
Ah, thank you, Uigyeom. 

467
00:37:57,344 --> 00:37:59,113
Mom will do better. 

468
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:03,050
Thank you, Uigyeom. 

469
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:05,986
Uigyeom. 

470
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,088
Mom will do better. 

471
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:11,492
I'm sorry, thank you. 

472
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:15,062
Uigyeom. 

473
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,398
Thank you. 

474
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:25,039
Thank you. 

475
00:38:26,106 --> 00:38:26,974
Uigyeom. 

476
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:29,109
Mom will protect you. 

477
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,078
Uigyeom. 

478
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:44,959
Uigyeom. 

479
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,961
You're here? 

480
00:38:47,294 --> 00:38:48,395
Let's talk. 

481
00:38:49,363 --> 00:38:51,165
I just finished talking with Grandpa. 

482
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:53,567
You're going to America as soon as you're discharged. 

483
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:56,637
You'll transfer to a high school
in Boston. 

484
00:38:57,204 --> 00:38:58,405
What are you talking about? 

485
00:38:58,806 --> 00:38:59,640
Wait a minute. 

486
00:39:00,574 --> 00:39:01,542
Sit. 

487
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:09,984
Grandpa was right. 

488
00:39:10,551 --> 00:39:13,921
Transferring to that school
in the first place was a mistake. 

489
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:14,788
Dad. 

490
00:39:14,788 --> 00:39:15,723
Uigyeom. 

491
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:17,992
It's all for your own good. 

492
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:20,728
This time, in a completely different environment... 

493
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:21,729
Honey. 

494
00:39:23,364 --> 00:39:24,832
Talk to me for a moment. 

495
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:26,834
Honey. 

496
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:28,969
Kim Seok-tae. 

497
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:32,173
I said, let's talk first. 

498
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:44,451
Just now,
I almost lost our Uigyeom. 

499
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:46,587
What are you talking about? 

500
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:49,156
Your son, 

501
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:52,159
my son, tried to jump. 

502
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:54,895
What? 

503
00:39:58,098 --> 00:39:59,133
Why? 

504
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:01,402
Not you. 

505
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:05,673
For Uigyeom's sake? 

506
00:40:06,207 --> 00:40:07,341
You? 

507
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:09,777
No. 

508
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:12,680
You'll never know what that means. 

509
00:40:15,049 --> 00:40:17,284
From now on, I'll protect
my son. 

510
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:43,410
Hey, Bucket Hat! 

511
00:40:43,744 --> 00:40:44,912
Hey, Bucket Hat. 

512
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,982
Is this bastard deaf? 

513
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:50,518
He's not answering, damn it. 

514
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:57,525
Are you Lee Geon-jae? 

515
00:40:58,592 --> 00:40:59,927
Lee Geon-jae from Moomyung High? 

516
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:02,363
This bastard isn't answering, damn it. 

517
00:41:56,484 --> 00:41:57,418
Huh? 

518
00:41:58,352 --> 00:41:59,453
Hello. 

519
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:01,956
Oh, you're here? 

520
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:09,930
Oh, don't, don't, don't
mind what's behind us. 

521
00:42:11,065 --> 00:42:12,132
Let's play with us. 

522
00:42:15,436 --> 00:42:18,172
Hey, can you even see in front of you? Huh? 

523
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,227
Hey! 

524
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:42,863
Ah, damn it! 

525
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,765
Ah! 

526
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:16,931
Ah, that rat-like bastard
is incredibly persistent. 

527
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:21,001
Ah, damn. 

528
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:28,042
Hey. 

529
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:29,710
His shoulder is out. 

530
00:43:30,744 --> 00:43:31,579
Finish it. 

531
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:12,853
Hey. 

532
00:44:13,354 --> 00:44:14,355
He's so strong. 

533
00:44:14,955 --> 00:44:16,357
He got past all of them? 

534
00:44:17,558 --> 00:44:19,593
The rumors weren't false, Lee Geon-jae. 

535
00:44:26,934 --> 00:44:29,003
From now on, it's just you and me. 

536
00:44:30,104 --> 00:44:31,071
You with your shoulder, 

537
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:33,274
and me with my ankle. 

538
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:36,277
Fair, isn't it?
