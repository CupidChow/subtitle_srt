- What are you, you punk?
- (Yun-gi) Hey.

176
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:30,971
He won fair and square
in a one-on-one fight.

177
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,174
You're not gonna jump on him as a group out of embarrassment, are you?

Ah, if my respected seniors
intervene,

I was planning to go to the faculty office today anyway
to see you.

00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,636
...must have sustainable power.

349
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:30,971
Understand?

350
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:33,474
Yes.

351
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:37,578
(Ui-gyeom) Dad,
where are we going?

352
00:19:39,313 --> 00:19:40,915
(Seok-tae) Let's get you a suit.

353
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:47,755
[Sigh]

354
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:55,162
(Chief Moon) Ah, it's Professor's birthday this week.

355
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:56,764
That's right.

356
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:58,966
Around the time it starts getting chilly,

357
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:01,769
I remember it being Professor's birthday.

358
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:04,171
(Seok-tae) Yes.

359
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:07,808
So, I was going to dress him neatly and take him this weekend,

360
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:11,278
and I asked Chief Moon for help at this late hour.

361
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:14,081
Because of us, you can't even leave work at this hour.

362
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:16,317
(Chief Moon) Oh, you're too kind.

363
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:18,686
If it's something for our Professor's house,

364
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:21,455
I'd come out in my sleep to help.

365
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,993
My family owes a lot to Professor.

366
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,929
Is Professor in good health?

367
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:30,331
(Seok-tae) Oh, of course.

368
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:33,067
He's probably healthier than I am.

369
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:34,568
(Chief Moon) Oh, no, what are you saying?

370
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:37,738
You, the CEO, need to be healthier. [Chief Moon's laughter]

371
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,241
Hey.

372
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:42,977
Oops-a-daisy.

373
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:46,780
Wow, you've grown so much taller,

374
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,016
and your shoulders are broader.

375
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,784
You're all grown up now.

376
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:54,155
I wouldn't recognize you if I saw you outside.

377
00:20:54,822 --> 00:20:58,559
I heard your eldest son got into
Seomun University Medical School this time.

378
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,962
Is your eldest son doing well too?

379
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:04,198
[Meaningful music]

380
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:11,205
Of course.

381
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:13,040
He's doing well.

382
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:14,909
[Mr. Moon's faint smile]

00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:29,323

[Ui-gyeom's heavy breathing]

386
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:34,328
[Ui-gyeom, Ji-hyeok's straining sounds]

387
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:39,066
(Ui-gyeom) I want to go to school soon.

388
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:42,102
When I go to school,

389
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,406
there are so many fun things to do.

390
00:21:58,152 --> 00:22:00,921
(Yun-gi) What?
Nam Seung-shik came all the way to the academy?

391
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:03,257
(Ui-gyeom) Yeah, but I don't think he came
to fight.

392
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:04,892
[Yun-gi's dumbfounded laugh]
(Yun-gi) Then what?

393
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:06,460
He went all the way to the academy just to see your face?

394
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:08,996
Hey, fighting's no big deal.

395
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:11,799
It's just when fists start flying
that the fight begins, oh right.

396
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,901
(Ui-gyeom) He didn't seem all
that impressive.

397
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:17,638
(Yun-gi) Your condition's
not normal, is it?

398
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:19,073
You fought yesterday too.

399
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:23,077
Hey, you have to avoid fighting
until your body's fully recovered.

400
00:22:23,077 --> 00:22:26,013
Only fight in top condition.
That's what a warrior does.

401
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,348
Uh-huh?

402
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:35,556
[Tense music]

403
00:22:38,993 --> 00:22:39,827
They're here.

404
00:22:44,265 --> 00:22:46,300
Let's go to the classroom so you can see the teachers.

405
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:47,935
(Seong-wook) If you run away,

406
00:22:48,335 --> 00:22:49,970
all your classmates will die.

407
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:52,740

[Seung-shik exhales]

00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:02,950
(Seung-shik) Ugh, shit.

[Seung-shik exhales]

411
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:07,488
(Seong-wook) What's this?

412
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:11,158
Is it something really expensive?

413
00:23:12,493 --> 00:23:14,261
[Ui-gyeom's shaky breath]
[Tense music]

414
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:19,567
Don't worry.

415
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,338
I'm not interested in things like that.

416
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,007
Let's hang out.

417
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:30,344
I like you.

418
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,550
Then we don't have to fight.

419
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:39,320
Let's hang out.

420
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:41,088
What do you say?

421
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:43,891
What do you mean by hanging out?

422
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:48,529
[Chuckles] Look at those guys.

423
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,066
(Seung-shik) They can't even come in
at my word, damn it.

424
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:57,104
You don't want to live
cowering like that, do you?

425
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:01,842
School can be your playground too.

426
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:05,279
Everyone will move the way you want them to.

427
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:10,417
Are you proud of that?

428
00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:13,254
Feels good, right?

429
00:24:13,721 --> 00:24:14,788
It's a privilege.

430
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:17,758
If you have power, you can be free,

431
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:19,760
and you can dominate.

432
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:22,563
It's the same no matter where you go.

433
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,168
You're making it sound grand,

434
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:30,404
but you're just a thug.

435
00:24:38,612 --> 00:24:40,314
Ugh.

Aren't you thirsty?

441

You held it in well.

Are we just going to let that bastard get away with that?

461
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:20,447
What, you want me to beat him up?

462
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,083
It'd be fun to mess with him.

463
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:24,785
Isn't he a piece of work?

464
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,453
He's got no manners.

465
00:26:27,054 --> 00:26:29,223
If a guy like that joins, the kids won't have any discipline.

466
00:26:29,957 --> 00:26:32,626
We need to fix his attitude to some extent.

467
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,195
Alright, alright.

468
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:48,676

- (Older aunt) Let's shake hands.
- (Younger uncle) Welcome.

479

(Younger aunt) Come on, eat some spinach too.

480
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,605
You have to eat kimchi too.

[Older aunt's faint smile]

484
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:27,481
What's the point? I'm treated like an outcast at home.

485
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,349
[Younger uncle's laughter]

486
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:31,952
(Older aunt) Dad is someone who doesn't care
about what his daughter does.

487
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:35,022
Still, it's a relief that
Oppa didn't become a doctor.

488
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:36,790
If Oppa

489
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:40,561
had become a doctor too, along with me he would've been outcast too

490
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:41,595
ain't that right

491
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:50,571
(Younger aunt) I heard Oppa
signed a contract with Hanjin Hospital?

492
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:51,639
Yeah.

493
00:27:53,174 --> 00:27:54,074
Father did.

494
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,077
- (Seoktae) He helped make the connection.
- (Younger aunt) Hmm.

495
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:58,946
- With Director Shim...
- (Grandfather of Uigeom) Uigeom, you...

496
00:27:59,146 --> 00:28:00,681
How's the school you transferred to?

497
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:02,082
Is it okay to go to?

498
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:04,251
Yes.

499
00:28:04,952 --> 00:28:07,988
(Grandfather of Uigeom) Compared to Seomun High,
the level must be much lower.

500
00:28:08,756 --> 00:28:11,158
Why send him to a new school
at this important time?

501
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:13,394
I still don't understand.

502
00:28:13,794 --> 00:28:15,930
(Dabin) I thought it would be
a better environment for Uigeom.

503
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,864
Father.

504
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:19,400
It will be more advantageous for his GPA as well.

505
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,669
(Grandfather of Uigeom) Of course,
you have to do well.

506
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:25,372
Competition is scary, so you left that good school...

507
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:28,909
And sent him to that dump school
full of delinquents?

508
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:31,946
(Uigeom) Grandpa.

509
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:34,348
I like my current school.

510
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,328
Um, Father.

511
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:51,599
(Seoktae) Director Moon said to tell you
happy birthday.

512
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:53,300
Uigeom went to Director Moon's shop
to get the clothes he's wearing today.

513
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:55,603
Uigeom went to Director Moon's shop
to get the clothes he's wearing today.

514
00:28:57,838 --> 00:28:58,672
(Grandfather of Uigeom) Is that so?

515
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,376
No wonder Uigeom's clothes look so good.

516
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:04,245
Director Moon...

517
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:09,116
He tailors clothes to fit
perfectly, without any errors.

518
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,585
Not too much, not too little.

519
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:14,188
[Grandfather of Uigeom's faint smile]
He knows his place well.

520
00:29:14,722 --> 00:29:16,290
He only does that much.

521
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:20,227
Director Moon is a really decent person.

522
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:34,241
One phone call from me,

523
00:29:35,376 --> 00:29:39,346
and your father's company's
supply routes will be completely cut off.

524
00:29:40,347 --> 00:29:42,216
Do you know what that's called?

525
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:44,418
Uh...

526
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:46,921
Abuse of power? Power abuse.

527
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:53,494
[Laughter]

528
00:29:57,231 --> 00:29:58,332
(Eui-gyeom) Grandpa...

529
00:29:58,632 --> 00:30:00,167
I'm still a minor.

530
00:30:00,534 --> 00:30:02,603
You learn to drink from your elders.

531
00:30:11,378 --> 00:30:13,547
You drink the cup your elders offer.

532
00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:39,306
[Eui-gyeom's exhaling sound]

533
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,348
[Sound of lid closing]

534
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:48,382
[Sound of bottle being placed]

535
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:56,557
That's right.

536
00:30:56,957 --> 00:30:58,025
I am the boss.

537
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:03,764
Your father never understood that.

538
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,267
[Tense music]

539
00:31:06,267 --> 00:31:07,868
He thought it was harsh,

540
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,339
(Eui-gyeom's Grandfather) He ran away thinking
he'd forge his own path,

541
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:14,675
but look where he ended up.

542
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,579
He could have gone so much higher.

543
00:31:19,847 --> 00:31:21,048
Look at him now.

544
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:25,252
He can't do anything without
this old man's help.

545
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:29,423
In moments when you want to run,

546
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:31,692
you have to endure.

547
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,431
Your father and your brother both
failed to endure that moment.

548
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:42,736
You have to endure that moment
to become the boss.

549
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:48,375
Now, this old man has
nobody left but you.

550
00:31:49,777 --> 00:31:50,911
You, Euigeom.

551
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,348
Go back to Seomun High School.

552
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:56,517
Huh?

553
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:01,021
All I have to do is make one call
to the director of Seomun High.

554
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,327
(Euigeom's Grandfather) A person
doesn't live alone.

555
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:10,531
No matter how fierce the competition,
you have to survive there.

556
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,833
That's how you can go to a higher place.

557
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:15,336
What are you lacking?

558
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:22,943
You used to like that school too, didn't you?

559
00:32:23,978 --> 00:32:25,513
It's where your brother went.

560
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:29,617
[Euigeom sighs]

561
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:31,318
Grandfather.

562
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:37,658
If I go back there...

563
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:41,529
I think I'll die.

564
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:46,667
What?

565
00:32:54,608 --> 00:32:58,810
Your father
is ruining even you.

566
00:33:01,044 --> 00:33:02,513
(Aunt) What did you do coming back?

567
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,016
You didn't do anything.

568
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:05,951
You just did everything your dad told you to do.

569
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,020
Abjectly.

570
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,355
You should have endured.

571

[Eui-gyeom's trembling breath]

575
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:07,081
(Eui-gyeom) Hyung.

576
00:34:16,357 --> 00:34:17,291
Hyung.

[Seok-tae's urgent voice]

Eui-gyeom-ah.

584
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:45,085
Eui-gyeom-ah.

585
00:34:47,288 --> 00:34:48,122
What's wrong?

586
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:49,557
What's wrong with you?

587
00:34:49,557 --> 00:34:50,991
What's wrong, what's wrong?

588
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:52,459

What's wrong?

593
00:35:04,738 --> 00:35:06,807
How could you give him alcohol?

594
00:35:06,807 --> 00:35:07,875
He's underage.

595
00:35:08,142 --> 00:35:10,077
A man needs to be raised strong.

596
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:12,313
[Snapping] Eui-gyeom's
not a little kid anymore!

597

(Da-bin) Father!

598
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:16,150
Both the mother and father are weak.

599
00:35:16,484 --> 00:35:17,918
(Eui-gyeom's grandfather) Can't even watch over your son.

600
00:35:18,152 --> 00:35:19,687
You sent Soo-gyeom away like that too!

601

(Ui-gyeom) Yeah.

640
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,633

I thought you wouldn't pick a fight with me.

652
00:37:52,907 --> 00:37:54,108

leave the classroom one more time during break,
