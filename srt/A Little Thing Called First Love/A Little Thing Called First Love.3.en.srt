6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,650
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7

Episode 3

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,110
Did you get hit in the eye?

28
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,540
What?

29
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,800
You seem to be in a good mood today.

30
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,240
♪ Just give it to me ♪

31
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,010
Why are you copying Lin Kaituo's homework?

32
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,530
I'm helping him copy.

33
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,310
How can that be? I've never even written his homework for him.

34
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,490
What about it? I told her to do it. What does it have to do with you?

35
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,520
My aunt told me to give this to you.

36
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,610
I don't want to eat it. So stop bothering me.

37
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,330
This lunch is more nutritious than those take-outs you eat.

38
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,650
Anyway, Aunt said that you're still growing,

39
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,640
so stop eating unhealthy and junk foods.

40
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,810
Here.

41
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,440
Eat it.

42
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,310
I... I've already eaten. You should eat—

43
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,840
Do you want me to tell everyone

44
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,260
that you backed me up in the forum under the username Shui Lingling?

45
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,370
Xia Miaomiao!

46
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,340
What? Eat it!

47
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,740
Aunt woke up extra early this morning to make these dumplings.

48
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,060
You've already given it to me, so it's mine.

49
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,320
I can give it to whomever I want. Why should you care?

50
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,650
Eat it!

51
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,290
I—

52
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,880
Fine. I can't do much about this specific situation,

53
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,470
but regarding the fact that she's doing your homework for you,

54
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,360
as the Math class's representative, I can do something about that.

55
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,530
Come on. To the teacher's office.

56
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,490
Wait, He Xin.

57
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,470
- He Xin!
- Let me explain. I really didn't copy his.

58
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,070
- He Xin!
- Please don't go to the teacher.

59
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,600
He Xin, are you crazy?!

60
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,070
What's wrong with me trying to catch those who copy other's homework?

61
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,120
Then catch me, since I was the one who copied hers.

62
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,030
Liar! She's so bad at math.

63
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,730
You don't need to be so loud.

64
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,280
What's wrong?

65
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,930
She copied Lin Kaituo's homework.

66
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,190
I didn't. I was only doing his homework for him.

67
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,350
You're still lying?

68
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,100
Xia Miaomiao didn't lie. The handwriting in both notebooks are the same.

69
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,340
Her workbook also has signs that she erased and rewrote them, while his notebook has nothing.

70
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,070
What?

71
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,450
The good student is here to save the world again.

72
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,500
Let's go.

73
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,840
Where?

74
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,850
You haven't finished writing it.

75
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,160
He Xin...

76
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,030
What about He Xin?

77
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,400
Water!

78
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,270
Sorry.

79
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,270
Why are you apologizing to him?

80
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,460
N-Nothing, it's just...

81
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,760
You... Did you threaten her?

82
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,810
Why do you care?

83
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,320
Actually, things like copying homework

84
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,180
isn't really that serious, right?

85
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,920
Yes.

86
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,320
Xia Miaomiao volunteered to help me.

87
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,970
You can ask her.

88
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:51,460
I... I think I really did volunteer.

89
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,980
I really don't understand why you've changed into the person you are now.

90
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,420
Let's go. Continue copying.

91
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,770
You know how to do it, don't you?

92
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,970
I only asked you to help me by copying yours because I didn't want to waste my own time.

93
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,210
But you rank lowest for every exam.

94
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,610
What does that have to do with you?

95
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,220
Hi, everyone. Take out your textbooks.

96
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,730
We will now start.

97
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,720
Help me turn it in.

98
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,180
Why can't I open Excel?

99
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,560
Why don't you use my computer? I am done.

100
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,530
Kaituo, it seems like you've been done for a while. Can you switch with me?

101
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,260
Dream on.

102
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,080
Don't.

103
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,790
I am not done yet.

104
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,940
Students, class is ending soon.

105
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,200
Please finish up your Excel file as soon as possible

106
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,770
and send your work to my email. If I still haven't received them by the end of class,

107
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:53,640
then you'll receive a zero in this term's computer class.

108
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,770
Let's switch.

109
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,360
Thank you.

110
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,130
You're welcome.

111
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,420
The Unchanging Lin Kaituo
President of Lin Kaituo's Fan Club

112
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
All right, class is over.

113
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,000
Students, who haven't finished, also stop doing it already

114
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,200
In addition, your head teacher forgot to tell you something in the class meeting,

115
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
and wanted me to specifically remind all of you.

116
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,600
The High School Unified Examination (for graduation) will be occurring soon.

117
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,000
Everyone should be prepared to review well this weekend.

118
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,800
- Okay?
- Okay.

119
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,610
Are you buying a pen?

120
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah. The unified exam is coming up soon.

121
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,400
I have to choose some good pens and I can use them to study for the geography one as well.

122
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,200
Do you think that you'll be able to write down the answer even if you don't know it, simply because of buying better pens?

123
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,600
Kaituo really didn't threaten you in today's copying issue?

124
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,800
Because you are my obsessive fan.

125
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,300
Pardon?

126
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,200
Don't think that I don't know that you're the one who's posting comments on the school forum.

127
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,900
If you don't listen to me, I'm going to tell everyone.

128
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,400
I'm sorry. I can't disclose that.

129
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,600
You can't disclose it? Did he bully you again?

130
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,100
No, no, no. He's not that mean.

131
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,000
Uncle.

132
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,300
- Anything else?
- No.

133
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,900
Ten yuan. ($1.50 USD)

134
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,800
- This one.
- Okay.

135
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,100
Senior. Are you going home?

136
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,870
Oh, right. If Kaituo bullies you, you must remember to tell...

137
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,100
Thank you, Senior.

138
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,400
Why are you thanking me?

139
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,000
Didn't you just say that if Lin Kaituo bullies me,

140
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I must remember to tell...

141
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,100
You must remember to tell the teacher.

142
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
I'm not following you.

143
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,000
Our houses are in the same direction.

144
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,400
Oh, right. I saw you in the morning today.

145
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,100
You also smiled at me.

146
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,740
It was quite funny because one of your eyes was red.

147
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,900
Senior!

148
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,800
Why did you buy so many pen refills?

149
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,200
Wait until you're in Year 12, then you'll understand.

150
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Do you use that many in Year 12 because you have to do a lot of work?

151
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,200
Do you have to stay up all night till dawn every day?

152
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,800
Senior, this is me.

153
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,200
Okay. Then, good luck studying for the exam.

154
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,000
Thank you, Senior.

155
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,900
Goodbye, Senior.

156
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,600
The doll clothes.

157
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,200
I haven't finished them yet.

158
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,800
Not possible. You were really fast before.

159
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,600
It's been a few days already. Do you not want to do it?

160
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,000
Ten pieces of clothing. Where will I get the fabric?

161
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,400
I don't care.

162
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,300
Then, there's nothing I can do about it.

163
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,720
I have an idea.

164
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,400
Where did you get all these fabric? Huh?

165
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,400
I remember right after we moved in, you also gave me a piece of this fabric.

166
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,400
Just do it. Why are you asking so many questions?

167
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,100
Oh. All right then.

168
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,000
Look.

169
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,200
How is it?

170
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,100
It's pretty!

171
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,900
- Is your sister good?
- Very good.

172
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,600
Oh, this is a rare sight!

173
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,800
The two of you have been hanging out for so long, but you haven't fought yet.

174
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Here, have some fruit. It's time too for a beauty treatment.

175
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,000
Mom just washed them.

176
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,200
I'll eat it in a little bit.

177
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,800
What are you doing?

178
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,600
Making a wedding dress.

179
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,900
Is it pretty? I made it.

180
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
My darling daughter is clever and deft with her hands.

181
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,000
Not only is she pretty,

182
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,400
but she's also skilled in making things.

183
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,900
Why does this fabric look so familiar?

184
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,300
My curtains!

185
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,200
Xia Liushui (Miaomiao), Xia Santu (Yaoyao),
(Santu - three earths / 1 "Yao" has 3 characters for earth).

186
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,400
I was wondering why my curtains were getting shorter and shorter.

187
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,800
Speak. Which one of you did this?

188
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,000
Come with me downstairs. Come on.

189
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Come on, come on. Tell me.

190
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,700
Why didn't you tell me this was from the curtains?

191
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,800
What should we do?

192
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,200
I will go to Haicheng University

193
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
Blessings of the Scholar Tyrant.

194
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,800
Can't you hurry up? What are you fooling around with?

195
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,000
Okay. I'm coming, I'm coming.

196
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,400
Today is the graduation exam. Why aren't you here?

197
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,000
I already passed the test last year. Don't send me any more messages.

198
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,500
How did I end up getting placed at the same testing center as her?

199
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,810
He Xin...

200
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,800
What's wrong?

201
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,000
My pencil bag has disappeared.

202
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,600
Don't panic.

203
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,800
Use mine.

204
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,000
Thank you.

205
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,800
No problem.

206
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,200
Stop talking. The test is about to begin.

207
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,000
He Xin, He Xin. Here.

208
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Earlier... thank you.

209
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,500
It's nothing.

210
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,400
Oh, your pen.

211
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,800
Isn't this Liang Younian's umbrella?

212
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,400
N-No, it's not.

213
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,240
This umbrella is very common. I can buy it anywhere.

214
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,400
It's not.

215
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,400
But... Look I scratched it here when I used it last time.

216
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,900
There's also a face drawn inside, right?

217
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,500
Sorry.

218
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,200
Actually, this umbrella... Senior lent me this umbrella when it was raining one time.

219
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,000
I forgot to give it back

220
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,200
and... I was afraid you'd misunderstand, so I lied.

221
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,800
Misunderstand what?

222
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,000
What kind of relationship do you think I have with Liang Younian?

223
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,400
Nothing, nothing.

224
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,800
I just thought the two of you...

225
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,200
What are you saying? He's my cousin!

226
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,500
Our entire class knows.

227
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,200
You just transferred here.

228
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,000
Right, I just transferred. No one told me.

229
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,800
Moreover... you also know his father.

230
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,500
Who?

231
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Younian!

232
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,300
Younian!

233
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,800
What is it, Teacher Liang?

234
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,400
What "Teacher Liang"? So cheeky.

235
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,100
Hurry, pick up the phone.

236
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,600
Hello?

237
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,000
Hello?

238
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,700
Hello, how are you?

239
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,400
Who was it? There's no voice.

240
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,800
Still pretending.

241
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,900
Must be the girls wanting to hear your voice.

242
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,000
What are you doing?

243
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,800
I think it's really broken. The connection is bad.

244
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,800
Why do I feel like my cold has gotten a lot better?

245
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,000
Your voice doesn't seem that hoarse anymore, either.

246
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,700
Really?

247
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,600
We've arrived at my house.

248
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
This is my home.

249
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,400
All right, then. I've walked you back as well, so I'll be leaving now.

250
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,500
- Bye-bye.
- Wait.

251
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,900
Do you want to come in and play?

252
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,000
You... Because earlier, didn't you say you wanted to teach me math?

253
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I-I just thought it would be nice to teach me at home.

254
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
The main thing is, I just transferred schools.

255
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,200
I don't really know or understand much.

256
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,000
So, I don't really have friends.

257
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Okay! Let's go then.

258
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
- Really?
- Miaomiao.

259
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,200
Is she your friend?

260
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,600
This is my mom.

261
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,800
Hello, Aunt. My name is He Xin.

262
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,200
Oh, she's so pretty!

263
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,400
This is the first time Miaomiao's brought a friend home after moving to Hai City!

264
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,600
Quick, quick, come in!

265
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,500
Aunt will make you delicious food! Quick, come in!

266
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Come, come, come in!

267
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,200
If Miaomiao were only half as pretty as you, that would be great.

268
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,900
Sit here, Aunt will just go tidy some things up!

269
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,600
Look, AE is perpendicular to plane ABC.

270
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,000
So, AE is perpendicular to BC.

271
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,800
So, SA is perpendicular to BC.

272
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,600
Also, because SA and AE are equal to A...

273
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,200
Your explanation is a bit unclear.

274
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,300
I can't understand it.

275
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,800
It's still unclear? Which part?

276
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,700
All of it.

277
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,250
Then how should I say it?

278
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,400
If you use this method to explain,

279
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,600
I will understand it a lot more.

280
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,300
What's this?

281
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,000
Actually, you explained it pretty well, too.

282
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,200
- Maybe it's—
- No way!

283
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,000
This is Liang Younian's handwritten scratch paper,
(scrap paper)

284
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,400
you really wrapped it in plastic wrap to save it?

285
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,200
How do you know he wrote this?

286
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,000
Please. I grew up with him.

287
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,300
How could I not recognize his handwriting?

288
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,300
That's true.

289
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,600
About this plastic wrap—

290
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,600
But his method is pretty good.

291
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,200
In the future, I'll use Lin Kaituo's method as well.

292
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So you think that with his method, you'll understand?

293
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,300
Yes. I think his explanation is even clearer than the teacher's.

294
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,000
You're looking at this through the eyes of a fangirl, aren't you?

295
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,400
No, really!

296
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,600
Look. Even though he only explained two kinds of problems to me,

297
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,300
during this afternoon's math test, I already felt like inspiration was just flowing from my pen.

298
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,600
Then get him to teach you directly.

299
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,600
No way. Senior is in Year 12 now. He must be very busy.

300
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,000
Besides, he probably wouldn't agree.

301
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I'll call him and ask.

302
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,700
You have Senior's phone number?

303
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,000
I'll say it again.

304
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
He is my older cousin. I'm his younger cousin.

305
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,400
It's justified for me to have his phone number.

306
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,400
Don't call him. Don't call him.

307
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,000
Why not?

308
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,000
Or is it that you want to call him yourself?

309
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,800
It's just that if I suddenly call him to ask him to tutor me...

310
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
That's too weird.

311
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Then I'll give you his number. You can call him when it doesn't feel like it's just out of the blue.

312
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,700
No, that won't do, either.

313
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,790
Why not?

314
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,200
If he doesn't initiate it first and give me his number,

315
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,800
it will be weird no matter when I called him.

316
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,000
139 838—

317
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,800
- Stop!
- 139!

318
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,200
- 139!
- Stop!

319
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,400
139 848 4576!

320
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,000
- 139 848—
- Stop!

321
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,200
- 139 4576 8383 8383!
- Stop!

322
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,100
"Like inspiration was just flowing from my pen"?

323
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,200
It's not my fault that you didn't pass math.

324
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,400
It's pointless to take it out on me.

325
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,600
Then can you stop rubbing it in my face?

326
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,800
Fine, fine, fine.

327
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Then accompany me to the bathroom. I've been holding it in for almost an entire class.

328
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,000
I am not going. Mr. Lu told me to go to his office.

329
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,400
Good luck.

330
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,800
I don't want to go.

331
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,600
I heard that there were only two people in our whole grade

332
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,000
who didn't pass math, and I'm one of them.

333
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,200
Yeah and the other one had to miss the exam because they got into a car accident.

334
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,600
What do I do?

335
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,200
I've never done this badly. What do I do?

336
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Just tell Mr. Lu and promise him that you'll study hard next time,

337
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,600
then aim to do well on the re-test.

338
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,400
All the teachers in our school are very understanding of us, students.

339
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,000
Besides, it's not like you're unwilling to learn. They won't be mad at you.

340
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,600
Really?

341
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,800
Really.

342
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Hurry and go. I'll wait for your victorious return.

343
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,100
Then I'll go.

344
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,600
Good luck!

345
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,900
Teacher.

346
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,900
Wait a minute, Miaomiao.

347
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,400
Let me first get this door to...

348
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,300
Let's go over here.

349
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:54,150
Look, this place is quite open

350
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,000
and the air is very fresh as well, don't you think?

351
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,800
I called you here

352
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,400
mostly because I want to talk to you about the math test.

353
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,790
This time, at our school's unified examination,

354
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,800
there were only two that did not pass math and you were one of them.

355
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,300
Did you know?

356
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,600
I know.

357
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,000
Only knowing is not enough. Next, you have to put in more effort.

358
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,200
With your current grades,

359
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,400
if you want to get into a good university,

360
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
I'm afraid it will be very difficult.

361
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,900
You're not going to cry, are you? I didn't yell at you.

362
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm not crying.

363
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,800
Take out your exam paper and I'll go over the incorrect questions with you.

364
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,600
Teacher, I'm sorry.

365
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,300
It's really nothing, you don't need to be so serious.

366
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,500
I'll let you in on a secret, but you can't tell anyone.

367
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,200
Actually, when I was in Year 11,

368
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,800
I got only 19 points on a math exam once.

369
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,200
Look! I still got into Haicheng University as a Math Major

370
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
and became a math teacher.

371
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,800
My point is, that in life,

372
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,200
you will never know what's in store for you.

373
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,000
You... are your own god.

374
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,800
Me?

375
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,100
I made up this golden quote myself. Is it a little too much?

376
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,400
No.

377
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,600
I am glad you're laughing.

378
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,300
Let's get serious and talk about the exam paper.

379
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,700
How did you get this one wrong?

380
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,600
This one is actually very easy.

381
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,600
Did the teacher really criticize you? Was it bad?

382
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,400
No.

383
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,200
He just helped me analyze the questions I got wrong.

384
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Then, he told me not to feel stressed learning math

385
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,800
and that he will help me get my math grades up.

386
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,900
How come you look like you're about to cry?

387
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,800
The more Teacher isn't mad at me, the more apologetic I feel.

388
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,200
You scared me to death!

389
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,700
It's okay. Let's think of some other solutions.

390
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,200
What do I do, I have to re-take it soon.

391
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,100
If I fail this one too, I will have to take it again in Year 12.

392
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,800
Let's go to the snack store. Let's go!

393
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,100
What?

394
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,600
They have this brand of biscuits that's really good.

395
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
Boss, these two.

396
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,100
That'll be 7.50 yuan. ($1.00 USD)

397
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,500
Thank you, Brother.

398
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,100
How come you're here? Why are you here?

399
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,800
It's fate that we meet here. I have something I need you to help me with.

400
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,000
What thing?

401
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,800
- You have to take responsibility for her.
- What?

402
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,600
She's a young lady in the prime of her youth.

403
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,000
What?

404
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,800
Come out.

405
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,290
So you're saying...

406
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,590
You failed your math exam?

407
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,200
Never mind the fact

408
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,400
that she failed her math exam.

409
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,000
The main thing is that failing her match exam has caused a chain reaction.

410
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,900
She's doesn't even have an interest in shopping now.

411
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,000
Okay, fine.

412
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,800
Tell me, what do you want me to do?

413
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,400
She said you taught her math before and that you taught her really well, too.

414
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,500
So when I saw you just now, I had a sudden inspiration

415
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:53,100
to ask you, Top Student, to tutor our Miaomiao and to intensely patch up her math.

416
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,800
No! There's no need to bother Senior.

417
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,200
What are you talking about? He should be helping you with this.

418
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,700
Who told him to teach you and you were still unable to pass?

419
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Brother.

420
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,700
This could become a stain on your record that lasts your whole life.

421
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,400
Okay. Then, find me at the lighthouse after school.

422
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,400
Brother, you're truly a selfless and mighty Top Student.

423
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Such a good young person!

424
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,000
See you later!

425
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,400
What do you think? Aren't I a good friend?

426
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,200
But... Senior won't find me annoying, will he?

427
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,200
He won't! He has a great temperament.

428
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,600
How about I also give you his number so you two can communicate?

429
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,000
No, no, no... It's fine.

430
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Got it. You want to get it yourself.

431
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,200
I will just wait for him at the lighthouse directly after school.

432
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,400
What am I going to do with you?

433
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,800
Do you want chips? My treat.

434
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,400
Yes.

435
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,800
Boss, give me two bags of chips.

436
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,600
Okay.

437
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,800
I want the lime flavor!

438
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,000
Sit.

439
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,200
Senior, you really don't have to.

440
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,200
I don't want to bother you.

441
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,500
I know time is precious when you're in Year 12.

442
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,650
It's okay, sit down.

443
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,200
By helping you review, I'm also helping myself review.

444
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,000
It works out pretty nicely.

445
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,200
The things they test in the unified exams are actually all pretty basic.

446
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,600
Tell me, apart from what we worked on last time,

447
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,900
what other things do you think you need to work on in math?

448
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,410
I think they all need to be worked on.

449
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,940
To what degree?

450
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,100
Uh... about the point where math has put seventy locks on me,

451
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:15,000
Uh... about the point where math has put seventy locks on me,

452
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,400
and I don't have the keys to any of them.

453
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,600
It seems like math has given you many worries.

454
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,000
Okay, let's start with the basics then.

455
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,500
Do you understand this?

456
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,600
The bottom one...

457
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,100
This one?

458
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,370
I am not sure where this is from...

459
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,200
Do you get this one?

460
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,640
- You have trouble with the third one?
- Yeah.

461
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,100
What about it?

462
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:45,600
This one is x less than a, and the square of x is less than a.

463
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,200
It actually means the same thing.

464
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
