A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,600
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,200
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,200
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,200
♫ I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,600
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,600
♫ I want to know what you're now up to ♫

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
♫ You're all that I can see ♫

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
♫ You're in my heart every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,200
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,600
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of
a love like this ♫

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
♫ You're all that I can see ♫

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600
♫ You're in my heart every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,200
♫  I must control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,600
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,600
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,200
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,600
♫ Stretch out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,200
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,000
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,400
A Little Thing Called First Love
♫ Is the result of Heaven's favor ♫

Episode 11

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,200
Which is the station that goes to Haicheng Affiliated High School?

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Excuse me, Parent. Today is Saturday. How did you get in here?

29
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,600
Excuse me, Parent, the one that has sunglasses on?

30
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

31
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,800
You're the parent. So I look like a parent to you?

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,900
I'm not a parent, I'm a teacher.

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,600
Then you know Teacher Lu Peng, right?

34
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,400
Teacher Lu? I do.

35
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,200
That's great! Give me his phone number.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't think that's a good idea.

37
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,800
Who are you?

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
I... I'm his girlfriend!

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,200
- His girlfriend?
- Yes.

40
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,000
His girlfriend doesn't know his number or address?

41
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,000
I just came back from abroad! I changed the SIM card and lost all the numbers.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,400
I wanted to come surprise him at school, but he's not here.

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,800
So give me his number, all right?

44
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,770
Hurry up and give it to me.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,040
Come on, I'm not lying.

46
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,050
Thank you.

47
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,400
Oh! That's right! What was your name again?

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,600
My last name is Ye.

49
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,200
I'll ask Lu Peng to treat you to some meal later.

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
- Yeah!
- Bye, bye.

51
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,700
Teacher Lu's girlfriend is a bit...

52
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,300
Well, that's hard to say.

53
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,750
I'm sorry, Senior...

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,970
I'm really sorry. Sorry, I'm so sorry.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,600
It's all right.

56
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,600
It's a poor-quality scale ruler.

57
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,200
Not only is it low quality, but even the proportion is wrong, also.

58
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,100
I have a new one here. Use this instead.

59
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:35,400
Also your copy drawing is too detailed.

60
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,200
You wasted a lot of time on unnecessary details.

61
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,400
You don't have the time nor the need right now.

62
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,800
You have to pick and choose what you copy.

63
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
What should I pick then?

64
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,300
Functional building subdivisions, spatial organizations, and logic books.

65
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,600
You should be focusing on them.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Start off with this. I can show you what you can skip later.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,500
Okay.

68
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,600
Okay.

69
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,370
You have to be very careful.

70
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,200
Snapback from a tape measure is very scary.

71
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,800
All right, let's continue.

72
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,800
How come it's not retracting?

73
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,200
This happened to me before, too. It's fine after shaking it.

74
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,100
- Shaking it?
- Yeah.

75
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,700
Hold this then.

76
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,400
Be careful, Senior.

77
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,700
Watch out!

78
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,000
Xia—

79
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,270
Xia Miaomiao.

80
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,270
Xia Miaomiao!

81
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,700
Have you finished drawing it?

82
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,100
It's getting late, you should head back to the dorm soon.

83
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,600
So are Liang Younian's hands fine?

84
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,000
The school doctor said it's not serious but I think it's very serious.

85
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,580
You'll think it's serious even if just a piece of his hair that falls off.

86
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,200
The wound is really deep.

87
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Let's not talk about it.

88
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,100
Are you back at school? It's almost twelve o'clock.

89
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,800
I'm not sure if the warden will let you in or not.

90
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,200
I was at the prison for the whole day

91
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,400
and now that I am back at school, I still feel like I am being followed.

92
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,400
- Miaomiao! There's someone following me.
- What?

93
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,600
What did you say? I didn't hear clearly.

94
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,600
Hello? Hello?

95
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,200
Xinxin?

96
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,740
Hello?

97
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
Are you still up?

98
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,170
What is it?

99
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600
Kaituo.

100
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm in the B1 lecture hall. Someone is following me.

101
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,400
Following you?

102
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,100
Go outside if you have a call, I need to sleep.

103
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,000
How many times are you going to use this tactic? I am hanging up.

104
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,700
Kaituo! Kaituo!

105
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,700
Cousin.

106
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,200
Hello, the number you've dialed is out of the coverage area. Please...

107
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,600
Hello, the number you've dialed is out of the coverage area...

108
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Something happened to He Xin!

109
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,200
Let's go through by the water pipes.

110
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,500
Let's split up.

111
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,200
Xiao Xin, it's me.

112
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,800
There really was someone following me.

113
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Why didn't you believe me?

114
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,600
Why didn't you believe me?

115
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
I was so scared.

116
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,100
It's all right. It's all right. I'm sorry.

117
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,600
So you followed me because you wanted my plastic bottle?

118
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,400
Yes.

119
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,200
I saw that you were on the phone, so I didn't want to interrupt.

120
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,600
Then why did you follow me into the academic building?

121
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,800
I saw that you got scared,

122
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,200
so I wanted to come explain.

123
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,800
I couldn't find you but thanks to that student,

124
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
or else I would have thought I saw a ghost.

125
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,200
You— Why are you not going home so late at night?

126
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,800
I am just trying to earn some money.

127
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,600
I am sorry that I scared you.

128
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,600
You guys can scold me if you want.

129
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,000
It's okay, it's okay.

130
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,800
As long as you're fine. Let me send you back.

131
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,900
Okay.

132
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,200
This is the in-depth report, that you've been working on for months now?

133
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,000
Yes, and it's a headline story.

134
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,300
Good job, my XinXin.

135
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,800
It was hard.

136
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,200
"Club Friendship Gathering"?

137
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,500
Come take a look! There's a Club Friendship Gathering this weekend.

138
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,400
A club friendship gathering...?

139
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,200
What is that?

140
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
How can you not know.

141
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,000
It's being organized by the Logistics Club.

142
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,700
Will Kaituo be one of the staff members?

143
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,400
And all the club presidents are going to attend.

144
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,300
Miaomiao, your Senior Younian must attend, too.

145
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,200
- Then...
- Sign up!

146
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,800
- But...
- There's no buts!

147
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,600
There's usually a lot of good food in these types of gatherings.

148
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,600
I hereby announce that all three of us will attend!

149
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,700
Aren't you on a diet right now?

150
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,800
You got to balance between work and play.

151
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,600
I've already eaten carrots for so many days now,

152
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,000
and the results are showing. It's time to reward myself.

153
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,200
Results. Where?

154
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,770
From head to toe.

155
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,600
But if I attend, would Senior think I am only there because of him?

156
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,500
But if I attend, would Senior think I am only there because of him?

157
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,200
- You are!
- You are.

158
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,600
Don't you think I'm right? Where are you going?

159
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,200
- Going to class.
- Going to class.

160
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,800
Miaomiao, I thought you're going to study fashion on your own.

161
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,900
Do you still want the textbooks you asked me to borrow for you?

162
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,370
Okay, Class. That'll be all for today.

163
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,600
- Xia Miaomiao, don't leave first. I need to talk with you.
- Okay.

164
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,000
Are you secretly reading the fashion design textbooks

165
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,600
while attending my classes?

166
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,200
No, that's because my friend lent this to me.

167
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Did you read it or not?

168
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,000
I only flipped one page.

169
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,890
Teacher, I promise that I only read one page.

170
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,400
The notes in there were too interesting,

171
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,200
so I couldn't control myself.

172
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,800
Who's notes is it that's so interesting?

173
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,600
Let me see it.

174
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
"Fashion Design- Getting Started With Pattern Making and Sewing"

175
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,000
Jia Yin.

176
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,670
Why is she everywhere?

177
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,000
Nothing, I am very unhappy with your attitude.

178
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,400
Nothing, I am very unhappy with your attitude.

179
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,000
Make sure you do well on the big assignment.

180
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,400
Otherwise, you'll have to retake the course.

181
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,600
I am sorry, Teacher.

182
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,200
It's all right. I'm just trying to scare you.

183
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,600
But you really need to do it well and be more serious. Okay?

184
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,400
At least learn from Lin Kaituo.

185
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,200
Both of you came here around the same time and have similar scores, right?

186
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,500
You two also sit together in every class,

187
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,500
but Lin Kaituo's current level is much higher than yours.

188
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,280
How about you ask Lin Kaituo to tutor you?

189
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,100
Okay.

190
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,000
All right, ask me if you have any questions.

191
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Thank you, Teacher.

192
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
- Goodbye, Teacher.
- Okay.

193
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,200
Goodbye, Teacher. 
- Goodbye.

194
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,400
The teacher complimented me, right? Now you know how great I am.

195
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,200
Yes, you're the best. The best in the world.

196
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
What else did the teacher say?

197
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,300
Teacher said to have you tutor me.

198
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,200
But you will definitely say that I'm too much trouble and won't agree,

199
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,400
so don't worry. I will think of something. I'm off.

200
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,400
I didn't even say anything.

201
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,000
Hello, the number you've dialed is out of the coverage area...

202
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,800
Why does it keep telling me it's a dead number?

203
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,800
No way, it's been so many days.

204
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,000
Even if Mr. Liu didn't pay the bill, he would have by now.

205
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,400
Was I given the wrong number?

206
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,400
1- 2- 3- 4- 6- 7- 8- 9- 10...?!!

207
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
- I'm so sorry, so sorry!
- That's all right...

208
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
- I'm so sorry, so sorry...
- 8, 9, 10...

209
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
I'm really sorry.

210
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,600
The number is wrong.

211
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,300
Jia Yin.

212
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,600
It's you again.

213
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,600
It's you again? It's none other than the head of the Architecture Department,

214
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,800
the one who splashed water all over me.

215
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,400
How many times do I have to tell you, I wasn't the one who did that.

216
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,600
I just happened to be on the balcony. I had no idea who threw a bucket of water right on top of you and now

217
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,200
- you think that—
- I don't care.

218
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,800
What an unreasonable woman.

219
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,790
Lu Peng.

220
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,400
Hey, Old Uncle.

221
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,000
What do you mean by "Old Uncle"?

222
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,400
Just because I'm a generation higher than you, don't call me that. It makes me feel old.

223
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,200
I'm only a few years older than you.

224
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Okay, Little Uncle. Is that okay?

225
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,600
What are you doing?

226
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,700
What do you think?

227
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,800
- Did you go buy the groceries?
- I did.

228
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,200
- Did you cook?
- I did.

229
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,200
- Did you sweep the floor?
- Yes, I did and I did the laundry, too.

230
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,000
Go on.

231
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,600
Wait, Lu Peng.

232
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,600
You're living under my roof. So behave like it.

233
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,900
Understood?

234
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,600
Go!

235
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,800
Who pissed him off?

236
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,200
Ask Liang Younian to tutor you.

237
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,400
You can improve your studies and your relationship with him at the same time.

238
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,200
It's much better than you going around with no direction.

239
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,200
I can't keep relying on him all the time.

240
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,200
I need to learn to be independent.

241
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,400
Book.

242
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
- What kind of a book is that?
- Let me see.

243
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,200
"First method, read about the name of your crush nine times in one breath.

244
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,400
"First method, read about the name of your crush nine times in one breath.

245
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,600
He or she would show up. Call out their name once more,

246
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,600
and they will fall for you."

247
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,000
That's a superstition. Don't believe it.

248
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,800
No way...

249
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
It's that easy?

250
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,000
Don't tell me you actually believe it?

251
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,600
Did you forget what happened in high school when you ate five red eggs?

252
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
This is more effective than red eggs.

253
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,200
This book was translated from Thailand. It's no longer in production.

254
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,400
If I hadn't seen it online, I wouldn't have known about such a magical book.

255
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
How is it magical?

256
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,800
Supposedly, a girl in Thailand managed to win over her boyfriend

257
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,800
- by following the methods in this exact book.
- Really?

258
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,800
You're such a liar. Which website did you read it from?

259
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,300
It's on this website.

260
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,200
Look.

261
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,500
What was that sound earlier?

262
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,200
Say his name.

263
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,200
Liang...

264
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,300
Senior.

265
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,750
Hello.

266
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,400
Are you here to do your assignment?

267
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,600
Yes, I needed these books.

268
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,370
C-Could I call...

269
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,000
for takeout here?

270
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,640
What do you think?

271
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,200
I also think I can't.

272
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,200
What's the matter with Xia Miaomiao?

273
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,600
She just had to say his name. What's so hard about that?

274
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,800
She's always called Liang Younian "Senior."

275
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,400
It's hard for her to suddenly change the way she addresses him, too.

276
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,800
That's true.

277
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Anyway, do you agree that my book is magical now?

278
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,000
You wouldn't believe me earlier.

279
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,200
I still don't believe it, okay?

280
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,800
That was just a coincidence. Stop trying to take credit.

281
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,600
You're just too stubborn. Don't try it secretly later.

282
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,500
I will not.

283
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,200
Whatever, I'm out of here.

284
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,400
Where are you going? Aren't you going back to the dorm?

285
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,200
I'm going to find out more about the gathering.

286
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Remember to help me ask the logistics department if they'll send Lin Kaituo.

287
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,000
Bye-bye.

288
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,800
Lin Kaituo! Lin Kaituo! Lin Kaituo!

289
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,660
Hi!

290
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,080
What's wrong? Do you have something to ask me?

291
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,500
No.

292
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,000
Liang..

293
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,980
How do you calculate the beam structure?
(The "Liang" in his name is the same pronunciation as 'beam")

294
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,300
Cross-sectional area multiplied by the length.

295
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,030
Thank you, Senior.

296
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Liang Younian.

297
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,300
Did she just call my name just now?

298
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,380
W-Weren't you just looking at beam ("Liang") structures?

299
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,000
"Liang Younian looking at liang (beam)". Doesn't it sound like a tongue twister?

300
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,400
Concentrate when you're studying.

301
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,600
Don't think about things like tongue twisters or jokes.

302
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,780
The flow of activities you planned is too frivolous.

303
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,000
Frivolous?

304
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,700
Senior Sister, which era did you come from?

305
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,600
Isn't this the effect we want from a Club Friendship gathering?

306
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,600
Hey, Kaituo. Here are the prizes you asked me to purchase.

307
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,100
Senior Sister, let's take a look at the prizes first.

308
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,200
Hey, you know what.

309
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,800
There was a lipstick on that prize list that took me a really long time to find.

310
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,000
I had to go to numerous stores to get it. Shouldn't you pay me more?

311
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,200
Do you want to have my life?

312
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,800
I'm wrong.

313
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,600
Come help move the chairs.

314
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Haicheng University Club Friendship Gathering

315
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,600
Your face is going to touch the paper.

316
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,600
I just took out my contacts, I don't feel so good.

317
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,200
When are you going to go get your new glasses?

318
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,900
This weekend.

319
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
"Nine ways to get him to fall in love with you"?

320
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,900
That's so funny.

321
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,540
Ah Xia, this is for you.

322
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,500
Just come if you want to. You don't have to bear gifts, too.

323
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,000
What are you drawing?

324
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,400
I am doing homework.

325
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,000
- I'll be leaving now.
- Okay.

326
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,200
Office of the Department Head

327
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,400
Xia Miaomiao, what is it?

328
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,900
Teacher, I want to ask you to help me have a look at my work first.

329
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,220
- Work?
- Yes.

330
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,600
M-Maybe it's not fit to be called a work yet.

331
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:31,400
I... j-just wanted you to please review these papers.

332
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,000
We usually call this homework.

333
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,300
- Redraw it.
- Huh?

334
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,660
I'm not making you redraw it because it's bad but

335
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,200
because it can be better.

336
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,400
Come have a look. This roof of yours,

337
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,200
it's a bit cumbersome... The plane and facade are asymmetrical.

338
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,600
And the windows here, and how these doors open.

339
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,100
Just redraw it.

340
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,400
But I must compliment you.

341
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,700
This drawing is pretty good this time, a lot of improvement.

342
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,800
Thank you, Teacher. Then I'll redraw it.

343
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,900
- Goodbye, Teacher!
- Okay, work hard!

344
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,600
Hey, your assignment!

345
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,800
Chinese Style Tea House Restaurant

346
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,400
Let me show you how well this new sunscreen I got works.

347
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,800
Let me try.

348
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,900
Oh, you're right!

349
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's quite moisturizing.

350
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,600
Yeah.

351
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,600
Right?

352
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,800
Linyan, that's Liang Younian's spot, he just stepped away.

353
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,600
I'll wait for him here.

354
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,400
I was just using this seat.

355
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,800
- You can't eat cold things in winter.
- Pardon?

356
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,600
It's not good for your health.

357
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,000
You do... have a partner for the model project yet?

358
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,800
I haven't found one yet.

359
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,400
Good then, I can be your partner.

360
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,400
Um, but I haven't thought about what I'm going to make.

361
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,200
It's okay. I already have it all set.

362
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,800
B-But I'm in the same dorm as Fangxu,

363
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,000
it'll be easier to do work together.

364
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,300
R-Right, Fangxu?

365
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,000
What? Make what?

366
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
The model homework.

367
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,800
I don't want to. You're better off with your long-time partner,

368
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,500
Fang Xiaoyue. I can't deal with your perfectionism.

369
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,500
I have no problem with that.

370
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:21,020
Then... Do you want to come down to plan on what we should do?

371
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Your face...

372
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,200
It's probably just the sunscreen not applied evenly. Is it okay now?

373
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
- Do you want some?
- Yes.

374
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,400
Then I'll help you open it.

375
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,100
I want one, too.

376
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,000
I want one, too.

377
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,600
There's no more.

378
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,500
The gathering is this afternoon. Whether you succeed or not is all on this. You guys better put in some good efforts.

379
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,000
Teacher, how do we put in good efforts?

380
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,600
Be more serious.

381
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,700
You are too amazing.

382
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,600
This is a basic for us, cosplayers.

383
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,500
Why do I think there's something lacking?

384
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,400
Hold on a second. Let me put on one last finishing touch.

385
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,970
Perfect!

386
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,700
- Miaomiao, you jealous? Your eyes are even turning red.
- What?

387
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,000
It's just that my contacts are getting very uncomfortable. There might be an allergy.

388
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,800
Then, I won't do your makeup for now. My makeup products aren't really good.

389
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,000
Let's wait until I earn some money and buy some safe and natural Lansur makeup to do your makeup.

390
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,600
No way, I also want to use safe and natural Lansur.

391
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,600
My skin is also very delicate, okay?

392
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,000
You really dare to use this type of low-quality makeup product on your face?

393
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,400
My skin is pretty thick and resilient, all right?

394
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,800
Li Ran, why are you here? Don't you have a girlfriend?

395
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
I'm the president of the music club.

396
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,200
What's the big deal about being the president of the music club?

397
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,600
Why did you only just arrive?

398
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,100
I was hungry. I just went to grab something to eat.

399
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,200
Why did you come?

400
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,400
I came to keep an eye on you.

401
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,200
Kaituo, don't you think there is something different about me today?

402
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,500
I don't.

403
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,590
Take a look again.

404
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,800
Don't you think my eyes are sparkling today?

405
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,400
It's like a delicate and pure girl.

406
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,800
You should first wipe the gunk off the corner of your eyes.

407
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,300
This is a beauty mark. A beauty mark, do you understand?

408
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,800
I don't.

409
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,300
Everyone, quiet down please.

410
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,600
Everyone, welcome to the sponsored event

411
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,000
by Chow Tai Fook Jewelry, Hai University's Student Club Friendship Gathering.

412
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,400
The main purpose of today's social is to increase the friendships amongst students,

413
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,800
and to enrich your extra-curricular life.

414
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,800
Chow Tai Fook jewelry is a witness to touching moments.

415
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,400
Okay, back to our event. Today's event will be split into two parts.

416
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Fun and games, as well as independent socializing.

417
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,000
Chow Tai Fook also prepared generous prizes for the winners. As there are prizes, there are also punishments.

418
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
The games are about to start. Please pick lots to form your teams.

419
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,400
I hope everyone has fun!

420
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,500

A Little Thing Called First Love
