A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,570
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,130
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,070
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,080
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,620
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,110
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,950
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:40,590
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,580
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,640
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,110
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,550
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,550
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,580
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,070
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,660
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,590
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,150
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,090
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,120
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,580
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,130
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,640
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:00,020
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,900
Episode 29

27
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,550
Do you want to wear it?

28
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,190
Yes.

29
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,420
Let me put it on for you.

30
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,790
Okay.

31
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,050
Senior.

32
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:56,980
Actually, I thought you'd turn me down.

33
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,670
Why?

34
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:10,050
Because you told Senior Da Chao, I have nothing to do with you studying abroad.

35
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,090
And you asked me to give you time to think about it.

36
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,230
Then, you kept hiding from me.

37
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,310
I didn't expect you'd think that way.

38
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,440
Okay, Teacher. I'm coming right now.

39
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,170
Hey, are you going or not?

40
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,860
So you got the first place prize in the competition?

41
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,990
What? Any problems?

42
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,640
Great. So Great!

43
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,990
Brother Liang, you're awesome!

44
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,780
This way, Xiao Yue will be staying here with me.

45
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,490
Congratulations.

46
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,380
Congratulations to both of us.

47
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,820
Aren't you preparing to confess your feelings to Miaomiao, too?

48
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,350
That's right.

49
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,760
What about Miaomiao if you go abroad?

50
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,030
What does studying abroad have anything to do with Miaomiao?

51
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,380
So you're going to give up academics for love?

52
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,450
How could it be? I won't give up either of them.

53
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,860
Senior.

54
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,850
I have something to tell you.

55
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,470
No way. Are you gonna confess to me?

56
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,970
I like you.

57
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,100
I jinxed myself.

58
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,080
Senior, thank you.

59
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,390
What about my confession then?

60
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,980
How can you jump the queue?

61
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,320
Can you give me some time?

62
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,230
I'll give you my answer.

63
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,410
Let me design the necklace first.

64
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,620
I'll get it done soon.

65
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,840
Senior.

66
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,020
What is it?

67
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,720
My sister just sent Niannian's photos to me.

68
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,580
I just ran into you, so I thought of showing them to you.

69
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,870
It's quite cute.

70
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,630
What else?

71
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,370
Nothing. I'll get going.

72
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,470
I don't eat food from strangers.

73
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,990
Am I a stranger?

74
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,150
No.

75
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,810
Have you thought about it?

76
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,200
What does your sister like?

77
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,710
Why did you ask about it?

78
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,740
Mainly because of...

79
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,660
My sister's hobby is a little strange.

80
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,200
I'm afraid you won't believe it.

81
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:02,000
Try me. I'll try to believe it.

82
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,430
She has a very strange drawer.

83
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,610
Where she keeps some chalks, plastic and other things inside.

84
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,720
There's a long-expired cup of Eight Treasure Congee, too.

85
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,040
Eight Treasure Congee?

86
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,550
She likes Eight Treasure Congee?

87
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,590
Maybe. Otherwise, why would she hide it from me?

88
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:31,270
Your sister's hobby is indeed a little strange.

89
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,180
Eight Treasure Congee.

90
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:55,050
So you designed this necklace?

91
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,950
Then what about the time?

92
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,660
9:30 p.m.

93
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,180
Why is it 9:30 p.m?

94
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,830
Because the design looks nice that way.

95
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,510
Ah...

96
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:36,760
This is for you. Don't let it expire again this time.

97
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,100
Hello, Mom.

98
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,800
I a-am on my way home. I'll be right there.

99
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,950
My mom asked me to get back home.

100
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,980
Okay, I'll send you back.

101
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,950
You go in first, I'll watch you go in.

102
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,990
Or you leave first, I'll watch you go.

103
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,910
I think neither of us can go any further then if we continue like this.

104
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:43,550
Actually, you don't have to go now.

105
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,750
I don't mean you going abroad.

106
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,550
I'm confident in my feelings.

107
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,450
I don't think that going abroad will change anything between us.

108
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,900
But now, I have to ask my girlfriend's opinion.

109
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,350
No matter what you decide, I will support you.

110
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,800
♫  In my heart, you imprinted a thought of care called love  ♫

111
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,360
It's just that...

112
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,410
When I think of you going abroad right away,

113
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,580
I'm hesitating a bit.

114
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,880
Not right away, there's one more year.

115
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,850
I thought you were leaving next semester.

116
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,190
♫  Just let my oath  ♫

117
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,610
So that's why you confessed ahead of me?

I never thought that you'd like me.

122

You should go in, or your mom will call you again.

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,790
Okay.

124
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,660
Then I'll be going.

Can I pinky swear with you?

128

Pardon?

129
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,760
I'm afraid you'll regret it.

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,390
Come on, tell us the details again. I'm so envious.

135
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,340
Okay, calm down.

136
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,560
What are you pretending for?

137
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,330
Your smile has probably already reached the back of your head.

138
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,340
If you don't believe me, just touch it yourself and see.

139
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,540
Why are you acting like this in the middle of the night? Are you crazy?

140
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,870
Xia Miaomiao's gone crazy!

141
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,390
She's gone crazy!

142

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,870
Isn't it obvious, Teacher Liang?

148
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:47,600
Younian, I want to discuss something with you.

149
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,080
Let's go to Hangzhou to celebrate the New Year.

150
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,080
We can also celebrate the fact that you won first place in the competition.

151
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,380
I'm not going.

152
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,400
Why not?

153
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,470
Because Kaituo didn't want to go, last year's trip to Harbin was a failure.

154
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,460
Kaituo already agreed this year, so why are you being like this?

155
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,480
Anyway, I'm not going to go.

156
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,540
I have my own things to do.

157
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,310
What things do you have to do?

158
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,600
You have so many opinions, do you think you're Lin Kaituo?

It wasn't easy for Little Tuo to accept our family.

164
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,870
Please be more understanding.

165
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,270
Okay.

166
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,580
Mom, I already said I don't want a strawberry milkshake.

167
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,340
If you really want to try out your new blender, go find Liang Younian.

168
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,630
He loves milkshakes.

169
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,560
Thanks.

170
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,700
I've already tried the strawberry and papaya milkshakes.

171
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,440
Just the word "milkshake" really suits your temperament.

172
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:44,260
I heard you promised to go to Hangzhou for the New Year.

173
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,900
Yeah, whatever. Why, you don't want to go?

174
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,190
If you don't want to go, then we can both say no.

175
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,610
That's not really it, either.

176
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,460
I actually came to tell you something.

177
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,310
What is it? You even came over just to tell me?

178
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,620
I confessed my feelings to Miaomiao today.

179
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,910
She definitely said yes, right?

180
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,350
Fine, I know.

181
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,170
My teammates are too noob.

182
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,860
They can't even protect me for two seconds. So useless.

183
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,070
- Kaituo.
- How about you play, too?

184
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,800
Nevermind, you're probably even worse.

185
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,190
Would you believe that I'd be able to protect you flawlessly?

186
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:44,470
Yeah, right. Go, go. Go away, go away.

187
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,620
You're so annoying, don't interfere with my gaming.

188
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,050
Aunt, Kaituo said he wants a strawberry milkshake.

189
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,920
Get lost!

190
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,630
Isn't that great?

191
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,980
- Have you seen Fang Xiaoyue?
- No.

192
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,290
Why isn't she here yet?

193
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,810
Student, are you here to receive an award?

194
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah. Did you see Fang Xiaoyue?

195
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,710
- Which place prize?
- 1st place.

196
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,100
Then you must be Liang Younian.

197
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,330
Hello, I've been paying attention to you for a long time.

198
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,010
Why are you paying attention to me?

199
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,630
I want to invite you to work at our company after you graduate.

200
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,390
Let's talk again after graduation, there's still plenty of time.

201
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,750
Remember to come to my company after you graduate.

202
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,540
I'm giving you special permission to skip the interview process.

203
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,290
Just say my name when you come.

204
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,380
My secretary will arrange everything for you.

205
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,630
It's okay. I'm usually not too interested in those small companies that let you skip the interview process.

206
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,070
What kind of student—

207
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,780
Do you know that guy?

208
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,990
What's up with Liang Younian?

209
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,320
He wouldn't not make it, will he?

210
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,870
Senior just said he's on his way.

211
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,170
So you haven't seen him since he confessed to you?

212
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,260
Yeah.

213
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,710
My Uncle is really something, he probably doesn't know what sin he's committed.

214
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,110
It was so hard for their family to smooth over all their feelings.

215
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,380
It's understandable that they'd want to spend the vacation together.

216
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,910
Our Miaomiao is so understanding.

217
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,300
Here!

218
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,070
I'm back.

219
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,040
I thought you'd be late.

220
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:31,600
The flight was delayed, but CTRIP’s airport cabs has free waiting for an unlimited time.

221
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,440
Then that's good.

222
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,560
- I'll go receive the prize.
- Okay.

223
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,890
Since you're here, I better get to work, too.

224
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,130
College Students Architectural Design Competition

225
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,660
Let's congratulate the students who have won awards.

226
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,370
Moving on, let's welcome the sponsor of

227
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:18,330
the International College Student Architectural Design Competition, the president of Fang Corporation,

228
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:25,490
Mr. Fang Zongze to come on stage and distribute the awards to the winning students.

229
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,950
With those looks, he can still be the president of a big company?

230
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,510
- So you're Liang Younian?
- Yes.

231
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,540
Do you know me?

232
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,410
I met the wrong person earlier. That's great.

233
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,750
Congratulations.

234
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:34,380
Okay, then moving on, we'll invite President Fang

235
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,780
to say a few words to the Haicheng University Architecture Department.

236
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,030
Hello students.

237
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,990
I'm Fang Zongze. I'm honored to be here at the awards ceremony today.

238
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:05,720
Firstly, I want to proudly announce that my daughter, Fang Xiaoyue,

239
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,710
won the third-place award based on her own efforts.

240
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,330
Let's all give her a round of applause.

241
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:19,470
Did I hear wrong? They don't look anything alike.

242
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,430
No way, Fang Xiaoyue is the daughter of the Fang Corporation's boss?

243
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:28,580
I suddenly feel like she's the only one who's good enough to be with Senior Liang Younian.

244
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,580
Let's have everyone give a round of applause.

245
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,730
Senior, I'll wait for you at the model classroom.

246
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,110
During this competition, we saw...

247
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:04,410
- Younian, congratulations on receiving first place.
-  very outstanding projects. Haicheng University Architecture Department...

248
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,350
Thank you.

249
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:10,250
Last time, we were all present when Fang Xiaoyue got confessed to.

250
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:14,510
So are you two a couple?

251
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,820
No.

252
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,090
Then, I'll see you at The University of Edinburgh.

253
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,790
What do you mean?

254
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,370
I applied to be a paid exchange student. It's already been approved.

255
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,630
So, we'll continue being schoolmates.

256
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,090
At that time, I'll ask you to please take care of me.

257
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,900
I think that will be inconvenient to do so.

258
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,370
Our current architectural industry is in desperate need of these talents.

259
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,380
Xiaoyue.

260
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,370
Xiaoyue!

261
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,780
- Xiaoyue!
- Can you stop following me?

262
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,420
My Little Princess, what did I do wrong? Tell Daddy.

263
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,470
Can you stop calling me "Little Princess"?

264
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,450
You've made it so awkward for me announcing it on stage like that.

265
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,350
How will the other students see me now?

266
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,510
Can't you be more low-key?

267
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,640
You know I obviously don't like it when I'm the center of attention.

268
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,190
I couldn't help myself.

269
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,180
I want everyone to recognize how outstanding my daughter is.

270
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,950
I've made an appointment with your principal, department head and a few other professors

271
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,880
who are all authoritative figures, to have a meal together.

272
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,200
Actually, it's quite necessary to get to know them.

273
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,270
You used to stop me from doing so, but I need to take this good opportunity of you receiving an award to get together with them.

274
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,550
Uncle, nice to meet you.

275
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,870
I'm Wang Yichao. I'm a friend of Xiaoyue's.

276
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,700
Why is it you again?

277
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,300
You were just pretending to be Liang Younian, and now you're pretending to be Xiaoyue's friend.

278
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,700
What are you trying to do? What's your motive?

279
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,460
I—

280
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,020
My motive is to be your daughter's boyfriend.

281
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:16,900
Xiaoyue, how will you inherit my company if you're with this kind of person?

282
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,850
I didn't want to inherit your company to begin with.

283
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:24,020
I just want you to find a dependable boyfriend.

284
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,790
That first place winner, Liang Younian, seems not bad.

285
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,530
Okay. Wealthy President Fang,

286
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,670
this is my boyfriend.

287
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:56,010
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

288
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,780

♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

295
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,800
What are you thinking about?

296
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,830
Nothing much.

297
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,420
♫ I'm afraid to look up ♫

298
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,440

312
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,110
The model classroom is a professional space. I hope you guys can respect that.

313
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,390
Miaomiao, let's go.

314
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,620
Liang Younian, I'm so disappointed in you.

315
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:58,140
I've always thought we were the same type of people. We both have our firm goals,

316
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,270
and would choose the most outstanding paths and the most compatible partners.

317
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,480
I'm a different type of person from you.

318
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,560
If... your choice was Fang Xiaoyue, then I'd have nothing to say.

319
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,010
If... your choice was Fang Xiaoyue, then I'd have nothing to say.

320
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,870
But you chose Xia Miaomiao.

321
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,990
I really cannot understand that.

322
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,780
Xia Miaomiao is very outstanding and doesn't need your understanding.

323
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:34,180
And there is a limit to my patience and manners!

324
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,180
Please do not challenge me again.

325
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:58,310
What's wrong? The cafeteria food isn't up to the standards of Miss Lady Fang?

326
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,870
What are you trying to say?

327
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,060
Why are you being so serious? It's not a big deal.

328
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,870
I want to be a rich second-generation too, but my dad wasn't cooperative.

329
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:16,360
Being a rich second-generation is not as great as you think.

330
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,650
No way! It's even better than what I expected?

331
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,940
Since you were small, you didn't have to chew bubblegum.

332
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:34,550
Right? You used the hand-turning sharpener and your pencil case was three stories high when you opened it.

333
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,190
Doesn't your family own a stationary store?

334
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,490
Yes, but haven't you heard before?

335
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,400
Whatever the family sells, the child lacks.

336
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,870
The things my dad gave me to use were those crappy pencils.

337
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:57,370
My dad... has always forced upon me everything that he thought was best.

338
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,990
No matter whether I needed it or not.

339
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:05,220
And no matter whether it would give me pressure or not.

340
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:17,610
I'm sorry I used you in my anger towards my dad today.

341
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:24,150
It's okay. I really welcome this extent of being used.

342
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,310
- Eat.
- Okay.

343
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,410
Then let me eat this.

344
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,260
Just one.

345
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,990
- Oh right, Xiaoyue.
- Yes?

346
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,530
There's something I want to confirm with you.

347
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,930
What is it?

348
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,160
Were the barbie dolls you played with as a child the real ones?

349
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,190
Just eat.

350
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,830
I don't agree. Why do we have to sneak around when dating?

351
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:19,190
Is it because of what just happened?

352
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,390
Not entirely.

353
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:28,070
I just feel that she has a point.

354
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,430
I really should work harder.

355
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,820
Can you wait for me? Until I'm ready.

356
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,390
You're great as you are. There's nothing to get ready for.

357
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,800
Senior...

358
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,340
What?

359
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,370
Don't be mad.

360
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,590
Whatever.

361
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,400
Look at how pretty it is up here.

362
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,560
It's not good to be mad.

363
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,950
Is it pretty up here?

364
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:22,270
Not as pretty as you.

365
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,750
Today's class is about residential high-rise architectural design.

366
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:55,350
Everyone knows that "residence" means a place for people to live on a daily basis.

367
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,210
Then following the development of society and aesthetics,

368
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:05,780
residential high-rises have slowly become the most common and preferred residential form.

369
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:11,570
The height of the high-rise residence is usually more than 27m.
[Xia Miaomiao]

370
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:18,230
Clothing patterns is what people usually refer to as designs on clothing or apparels.

371
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,170
Then, according to the crafting...

372
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,310
Are you done with class yet?

373
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:26,190
It can be divided into printed patterns.

374
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,860
Not yet.

375
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:32,350
So when everyone is designing residential high rises...

376
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,940
Then let's go to the cafeteria together later.

377
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,240
I'll meet you at the entrance of the second cafeteria.

378
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,550
Before you guys were admitted into the fashion major, you all had a foundation in fine arts.

379
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,120
Okay.

380
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,100
Don't bring Lin Xia along.

381
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,850
Hand-painted, watercolor, and material clothing design.

382
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,970
Watercolor designs will allow the design to be...

383
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:03,290
But Lin Xia said she wants to go to the second cafeteria to have deep-fried chicken.

384
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,620
You must be aware of...

385
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,710
I'll buy ten of them, you can take them back for her.

386
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:11,980
Spacing and factors like the design of the set.

387
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,510
Liang Younian.

388
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,930
You're playing on your phone in my class?

389
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,590
Do you think that since you've gotten a first-place prize in the competition

390
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:27,920
and that you'll be off to Edinburgh, that you're very amazing?

391
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,340
No, no. Without your guidance, Teacher, I wouldn't be able to go to Edinburgh.

392
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,130
Stop flattering me.

393
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,620
No more playing with your phone in my class.

394
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,430
Yes, Sir.

395
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,180
We were just talking about...

396
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,100
[Other person is currently typing... ]
The copying of hand-draws.

397
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,950
The first step in the design of clothing patterns.

398
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,740
Fellow students, good afternoon.

399
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,390
I am Haicheng University's broadcaster, Hexin.

400
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,900
We're quickly approaching International Children's Book Day.

401
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,690
To help with this campaign, the News Club and Arts Club will be collaborating

402
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:07,600
on making hand-made children's coloring books.

403
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,900
We'll gift the books to children in need.

404
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,900
Senior came with Senior Sister Xiaoyue.

405
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,640
Senior Sister is so intelligent. I'll definitely let something slip.

406
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,860
Let's finish quickly and get out of here.

407
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,110
What are you scared of?

408
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:29,480
We'll collect them and send them off to places in need.

409
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,180
Senior Sister Miaomiao.

- Long time no see.

What, do you see me often then?

412
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,990
Long time no see, Senior Sister Lin Xia.

413
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,420
Senior Sister Miaomiao, how was your break?

414
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,430
It was pretty good.

- Hello, Senior Brother.
- Hello, Senior Brother.

Hello, Senior Brother.

417
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,700
Sister Xia, Miaomiao said you like chicken legs so I got an extra one for you.

418
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,670
Okay. Senior, you sit here.

419
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:12,360
This seat is facing north, gets plenty of sunshine and the view is nice.

420
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,520
The view is good indeed.

- Senior Sister!

Thank you, Senior. I'll transfer money to you later.

426
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:06,040
Okay. Then will you use WeChat Pay or Alipay?
(The two most popular payment systems in China)

00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,030
WeChat Pay.

Okay.

429

Do you eat this?

- Yes?

How many coloring books can the arts club finish before the end of the event?

442
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,870
About fifty different kinds.

443

In order to finish them more quickly,

444
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,070
we've changed the drawing rooms to the model classroom

445
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,310
so that people can draw 24/7.

446

Well, I'll reserve some space and time for you.

There's just one more thing,

I want to ask you guys to help us decorate the truck with promotional drawings and slogans.

00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,050
No problem. I'll let Younian know later.

So why haven't you picked up my calls?

455
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,720
Whose phone are you using to call me now?

456
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,390
I'm busy, I don't have time to talk. I'm hanging up.

457
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:02,160
Wait a second. I heard about your book donation event.

458
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,290
How did you hear about that?

459
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:06,030
Did you send people to spy on me again?

460
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,310
I just want to support you.

461
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:12,120
How about I donate a hundred iPhones to your event?

462
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,470
No need! Why are you donating a hundred iPhones?

463
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,860
The young kids can't even make use of them.

464
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,300
How about iPads? Or Apple Watch?

465
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,250
I heard that recently there's a brand of hoverboards that are not bad.

466
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,240
It can be used by children instead of walking.

467
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,120
Or let me give you some funds.

468
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,810
Whatever you need is okay.

Okay. How many should I buy?

478
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:56,920
Is ten thousand units enough?

479
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,350
Ten thousand...

480
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,380
One hundred. My car can't fit so many.

481
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,920
Just buy one hundred first.

482
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,150
I'll send the contact info to your secretary later.

483
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,900
I'm hanging up now.

484
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,950
Senior Sister, that's awesome!

485
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:17,430
One hundred point reading pens— solved. I can eat in peace now.

486
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,870
Xiao Lizi!

487
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,720
Your Xiao Lizi is still lining up at the cafeteria.

488
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,390
Why are there so many people at the cafeteria today?

489
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:33,370
Jingjing, when are you leaving?

490
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:37,210
I need to put pants on just to go to the bathroom.

491
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,750
Shut up.

492
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,980
Here.

493
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,750
I don't want to eat anything coming from you.

494
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:47,360
Just eating the dog food from you two is more than enough.
(Dog food refers to displays of affection)

495
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:50,400
Who told you guys to be single?

496
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,420
If you have a girlfriend, you are welcome to show off in front of me every day.

497
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,910
- Can you take this?
- No, I can't.

498
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:56,190
Let's make a move on her!

499
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,290
These are Liran's!

500
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:05,820
I have one, but I'm not allowed to show it off.

501
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:13,490
A Little Thing Called First Love

♫ Regarding what love feels like ♫

511
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:22,000
♫ I only heard about it from friends ♫

512
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,390
