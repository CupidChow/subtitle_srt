A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,630
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,080
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,050
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,090
♫ I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,600
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,080
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,150
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,650
♫ I want to know what you're now up to ♫

10
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,580
♫ You're all that I can see ♫

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,600
♫ You're in my heart every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,200
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,620
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of
a love like this ♫

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,580
♫ You're all that I can see ♫

15
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,700
♫ You're in my heart every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,150
♫  I must control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:13,590
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,660
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,160
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,170
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,100
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,640
♫ Stretch out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,130
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,860
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,180
A Little Thing Called First Love
♫ Is the result of Heaven's favor ♫

Episode 12

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,350
Haicheng University Student Club Social

28
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,690
Thank you.

29
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,270
For the students who haven't gotten a prize yet, don't be discouraged. We still have the upcoming segment!

30
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,930
- You said you bought it for me.
- You also said you would give it to me.

31
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,300
H-How about... I'll keep it first. It'll stay with me first.

32
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,190
Teacher Li, our department head said he's already settled it with you that we can use some of the model classrooms.

33
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,100
He wanted me to come over and get your signature, so could you sign it?

34
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,490
Let me say, Teacher Jia.

35
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,820
Is this the appropriate attitude to have when asking for a signature?

36
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,780
Then what do you want?

37
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,100
Do you want me to kneel?

38
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,060
Look at you, a t-teacher.

39
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,290
Why do you speak in such an eccentric manner?

40
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,310
You're the one who speaks in an eccentric manner.

41
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,900
You don't have the air of a department head at all.

42
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,560
Fine. With your attitude, I won't sign today.

43
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,240
If you don't sign, you will still sign!

44
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,660
- Why are you using your hands on me?
- Sign.

45
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,850
You sign it for me!

46
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,140
Stop it with your hands.

47
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,500
I forgot my keys, could you help me—

48
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,030
I didn't come in during a good time, did I?

49
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,930
Give me the keys, and I'll leave immediately.

50
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,000
Let go, let go!

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,640
It hurts!

52
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,960
Teacher Lu, do you still remember me?

53
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,900
You... you are?

54
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,700
- Our school's—
- Right.

55
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,620
When I visited the school I met you.

56
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,750
That's right!

57
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,320
I'm called Jia Yin, a teacher in the fashion department.

58
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,540
Lu Peng, nice to meet you.

59
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,290
Hello, hello.

60
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,290
Hurry up, Uncle.

61
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,190
Teacher Lu, what's your relationship with Department Head?

62
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,900
He's my uncle.

63
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,100
Uncle?

64
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,320
Yeah. He's my nephew.

65
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,650
Who do you think you are?

66
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,600
Xia Miaomiao?

67
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,390
Uncle, how is Xia Miaomiao?

68
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,260
I taught her in high school.

69
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,300
She's quite a diligent student.

70
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,170
She's all right, I guess.

71
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,180
It's just that she's always reading the fashion major's books during my classes.

72
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,960
I think this Xia Miaomiao has the best taste of the entire architect major.

73
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,900
You're the one with no taste.

74
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,550
Uncle, how can you speak to a girl like that?

75
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,970
I can't bear to watch it any longer.

76
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,560
Exactly! He doesn't have the elegant demeanor of a gentleman at all!

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,950
What is this? Tell me about it.

78
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,140
This?

79
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,340
Xia Miaomiao drew it, right?

80
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,620
Do you guys think this is a cafe where you can chat?

81
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,830
Go out and chat.

82
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,300
If you won't sign it, how will I leave?

83
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,210
It's so pretty, tell me about it.

84
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,390
Go, go, go. Leave!

85
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,920
Keys?

86
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,970
Get out, get out.

87
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,250
The two of you, leave. Hurry, hurry.

88
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,000
Get out!

89
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,810
Don't mind it too much.

90
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,730
My uncle is a good person.

91
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,150
It's just that his temperament is a little weird.

92
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,340
I won't mind.

93
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,000
His male menopause came early, it's okay.

94
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,710
But I really didn't think that you'd live in the teacher's apartments, too.

95
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,520
I live just below you.

96
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,600
When you have time, we can visit each other.

97
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,550
That... after I've picked up my things, I'll be heading back to HDFZ.

98
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,750
Then leave your contact info.

99
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,260
Here's what happened.

100
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,500
One of my relative's kid wants to get into your school.

101
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,250
If there are any questions, I can consult you.

102
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,430
So that's the case.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,830
Here's my number.

104
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,320
If there are any questions, feel free to consult me at any time.

105
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,380
Okay.

106
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,850
- I'll get going then.
- Bye.

107
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,830
Department Head signature: Hurry up and leave.

108
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,830
Department Head Signature: Hurry up and leave

109
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,060
Coming up, we'll start drawing the names for the second game.

110
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,810
The boy is... Liang Younian!

111
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,440
Let me see who the lucky girl is. Lin Yan!

112
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,980
Have you found a partner for the modeling assignment?

113
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,960
Not yet.

114
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,570
That works. I'll be your partner, then.

115
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,650
But I haven't decided what I wanted to do.

116
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,230
It's fine. I already thought of it.

117
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,030
But Fang Xu and I are in the same dorm.

118
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,220
It's more convenient to work together with him.

119
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,250
Right, Fang Xu?

120
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,170
What? Do what?

121
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,920
Modeling assignment.

122
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,740
I don't want to.

123
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,040
You're better off with your usual partner, Fang Xiaoyue.

124
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,550
I can't deal with your perfectionism.

125
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,640
Fine with me.

126
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,340
Then do you want to come down to discuss what we should do?

127
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,800
I don't want to be in a group with Younian.

128
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,210
Because I don't think Liang Younian will have any good opinions of me,

129
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,490
so there's no need to waste my time.

130
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,510
There's no need to undervalue yourself.

131
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,330
But it's okay, I can pick another one.

132
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,080
- Who will be picked?
- He Xin.

133
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:41,600
Then should I say... Since Liang Younian won't like me anyway,

134
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,400
there's no need to waste my time.

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Lin Yan, didn't you used to say that you liked Liang Younian quite a bit?

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,890
What happened?

137
00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:00,430
I think Liang Younian prefers Fang Xiaoyue, so I've willingly stepped down.

138
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,070
All right. Then I will pick the next group.

139
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,670
The next group is Lin Kaituo and Xia Miaomiao.

140
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,820
Just looking at your appearance, I already know we're going to lose.

141
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,440
You better not make me suffer punishment.

142
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,460
It's all your fault.

143
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,520
If you didn't jump down from the newspaper, would we be locked in here right now?

144
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,490
How is it my fault?

145
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,260
If you hadn't offended Zhao Peng Fei, would we be stuck in here?

146
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,490
Either way, it's all your fault.

147
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,310
You can do it!

148
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,690
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

149
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,760
Why are you looking at me?

150
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,730
Why are you crying?

151
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,130
Who's crying?

152
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,440
It's just that my eyes are a little bit allergic to my contacts.

153
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,880
Why are you still staring at me?

154
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,660
I am not staring at you.

155
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,620
I am just thinking about how we should get out.

156
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,360
Then think.

157
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,180
If thinking works, then why aren't you thinking?

158
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,420
LIang Younian, open the door.

159
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,920
Liang Younian, open the door.

160
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,550
Liang Younian, open the door.

161
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,010
Are you done drawing your big assignment?

162
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,590
No, Teacher Li told me to redraw it.

163
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,690
Why don't you hurry and draw it then?

164
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,590
That fast? There's clearly still three minutes left.

165
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,220
Senior, where are we going?

166
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,720
To work on the term project.

167
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,200
Where are we going to draw it?

168
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,060
Model classroom.

169
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,850
Senior Brother, there's no more room at the first year model classrooms,

170
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,780
can I go use your model classroom?

171
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,570
Sure. Since I'm not the only one using it anyway.

172
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,960
I'll go back to the dorm to pick up some stuff.

173
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,670
See you at the classroom.

174
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,290
Senior is the only one here.

175
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:21,300
Then... it's just the two of us?

176
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,410
What are you doing? Sneaking around?

177
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,690
Senior Da Chao, why are you here?

178
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,250
Why can't I be here? You only permit your Senior Younian to study here?

179
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,590
I am also working hard, okay?

180
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,120
Senior, I am here.

181
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,800
Senior, I have been here for a long time.

182
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,490
Put down the work at hand! Look here.

183
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,570
Let me tell you, if it weren't for me,

184
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,110
do you think you two could have such a big classroom to yourselves at such a tense time in the semester? Nope!

185
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,590
In such a big classroom, why am I the only handsome one here?

186
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,630
Don't you want to know the truth?

187
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,150
Miaomiao, ask me. Ask me why!

188
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,760
What is it?

189
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,850
On this dark and windy night, the study room in the fashion department was packed with people.

190
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,900
I dearly wanted to do my homework, so I came to freeload and use your model classroom.

191
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:13,230
But when I opened the door, the scene was full of gongs and drums, firecrackers, flags fluttering, and so many crowds of people—

192
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,930
Can you be quiet and not disturb me with my drawing?

193
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,690
I'd only eaten one of your burgers and drank one of your drinks.

194
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:26,290
Is there a need to interrupt my conversation and interrupt my speech?

195
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,730
You ate one burger and finished one drink

196
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,800
so why won't that mouth just shut up?

197
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,700
It won't shut up. What are you going to do about it?

198
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,570
The more you want me to stop, the more I want to talk.

199
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,670
Junior Sister, let me tell you. Once I entered the model classroom,

200
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,120
it was busy, bustling with a crowd—

201
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,210
Senior Brother, you've said it once already.

202
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,530
Anyway, there were a lot of people.

203
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,870
Since there were so many people, it was the perfect opportunity to do sales!

204
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,700
I promoted my products to everyone and they all went fleeing.

205
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,140
The spending habits of the architecture major really sucks.

206
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:14,400
What do you mean by that? The expression in your eyes seems like they're disrespecting me.

207
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,550
Let's chat some more. Let's chat some more!

208
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:28,600
Let's chat a bit. Boring!

209
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,870
You only know how to draw. Draw. Draw!

210
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,170
Let's see what flower you end up drawing.
("Flower" and "to draw" are both "hua" in Chinese)

211
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,080
What are you looking at? Instant noodle head.

212
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,450
Aren't you one, too?

213
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,970
Me?

214
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,560
No, I can't stand it anymore. Too sleepy.

215
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,470
Why don't we go eat spicy numbing hotpot?

216
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,300
Eating spicy numbing hotpot in the middle of the night?

217
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,190
Go looking for some excitement?

218
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,730
Not going.

219
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,130
You're worried that I'll make you treat us, right?

220
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,530
Am I that kind of person?

221
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,980
You are.

222
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,050
If you don't want to go, then fine.

223
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,560
I'll go by myself. Let me tell you guys.

224
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,760
I won't bring you guys any take out.

225
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,330
Goodbye. Bye-bye!
(He actually said "886," which is Chinese text slang for "bye-bye.")

226
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,760
You must be sleepy, too.

227
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,840
My brain is not working anymore.

228
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,300
Let's go. I'll bring you to refresh yourself.

229
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:36,050
♫ At the street corner, my footsteps stopped ♫

230
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,950
♫ Your emergence made the whole city seem fuzzy ♫

231
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:47,610
Liang
♫ Your face feels a little bit more foreign now ♫

232
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:54,550
Liang Younian
♫ I was like a log, standing there without moving ♫

233
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,460
The cool breeze makes you feel more awake instantly, doesn't it?

234
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,290
Liang Younian

235
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,500
What are you doing?

236
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,310
Nothing.

237
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,640
I saw it clearly.

238
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,710
You saw it wrong. I wasn't writing your name.

239
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,990
You wrote my name?

240
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,680
Why did you write my name?

241
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,110
I...

242
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,590
There's a legend.

243
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,140
As long as you write someone's name in the starry sky, you can make a wish for them.

244
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,490
- Really?
- Really.

245
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,210
Then what did you wish for me?

246
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,920
I...

247
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,920
I wish that you won't need to redo your term project.

248
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:51,970
♫ And return to our unforgettable and beautiful chance encounter ♫

249
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:59,600
♫ I pray to the heavens that right now, you'll be able to come with me ♫

250
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,710
Senior. What are you doing?

251
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,440
Miao

252
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,490
- Writing your name.
- Pardon?

253
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,090
I wish you won't have to redo your project. That makes more sense.

254
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,460
- Why?
- Because I've never had to redo any of my term projects.

255
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,790
♫ The corner of your lips have started to tremble slightly ♫

256
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:35,290
Miaomiao

257
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:41,490
I'm done writing. Whether it comes true or not, I don't know.

258
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:49,090
♫ I hope I'm not dreaming ♫

259
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:55,770
♫ This fate has made me wait for so long ♫

260
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:02,670
♫ Luckily, you've been waiting for me all this time as well ♫

261
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:09,820
♫ We have returned to the pure moments that we yearned for ♫

262
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:16,650
♫ We have returned to the unforgettable and beautiful chance encounter of before ♫

263
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,790
I finally finished drawing.

264
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,150
Miaomiao. What's wrong with your eye?

265
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:58,500
Eye? I've had an allergic reaction to my contacts for a number of days now.

266
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,990
It's so red. Are you okay?

267
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:06,090
It's okay. After I submit my final project, I'll go back to the dorm and change into glasses.

268
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,680
Okay. Then hurry and go to the dorm to catch up on some sleep.

269
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,020
Okay.

270
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:18,350
Liang Younian! You really suck at basketball!

271
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,510
Even scolding me in his sleep, is he?

272
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,380
Hey!

273
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,000
Let me borrow that lipstick that you won in the contest.

274
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,900
- Pardon?
- Hurry.

275
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,350
Okay.

276
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,510
Senior, what are you going to do?

277
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,080
I'll show you something funny.

278
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,300
Hurry and hide it.

279
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,850
Big Chao! I bought you back some breakfast.

280
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,070
I'll eat it later...

281
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,940
Don't laugh.

282
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,170
Are you able to refrain from making any noise?

283
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,670
Hurry and go.

284
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:54,500
What are you laughing about? Was it that funny?

285
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,690
You've already been laughing the entire time.

286
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,490
You Nian.

287
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,060
You Nian?

288
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,180
Why are you here?

289
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,900
I came to draw.

290
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,820
Oh, it's already daytime.

291
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,900
So it's like that.

292
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,430
Your hand and face.

293
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,470
Liang Younian!

294
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,660
Use this. It'll wipe it clean.

295
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,180
Thanks.

296
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:21,350
Can you help me see which parts I missed?

297
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,470
You have some on your neck.

298
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,790
Help me wipe it. I can't see it.

299
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,150
All right then. Come here.

300
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,460
Here?

301
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,630
There is a little here.

302
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,100
Turn a little.

303
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,680
Lift your head.

304
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,740
Hi.

305
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,580
Speak. Where did you go?

306
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:34,290
Didn't I message you both on WeChat saying that I was drawing in the model classroom?

307
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:39,990
So you really stayed with Liang Younian the whole night?

308
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:44,970
There was also Senior Big Chao.

309
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,260
Is that the main point?

310
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,440
Then what's the main point?

311
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,110
Where's my lipstick?

312
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,960
Miaomiao.

313
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,380
Listen to sis. Get someone else.

314
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,820
Find me a cotton swab, I can still dig some out to use.

315
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,230
Hello, Everyone.

316
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,600
This is the school's broadcasting station.

317
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,520
Just a special reminder to all students that the electives system will be live in half an hour.

318
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,400
Just a special reminder to all students that the electives system will be live in half an hour.

319
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,010
Everyone should hurry and choose the courses they're most interested in.

320
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:55,790
If there are no more spots left for the class...

321
00:28:55,790 --> 00:29:01,670
Let's go!

322
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,610
Hey? Why are you here?

323
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,610
Why are you here? How did you know I was here?

324
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,030
I was just finding a classroom to review, that's all.

325
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,180
Don't you normally study at the library?

326
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,260
There aren't any seats in the library.

327
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,550
Then what about you? What are you doing?

328
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,830
I'm reviewing as well.

329
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,890
You know how to review?

330
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,030
Didn't you say that you're gifted and you can pass with your eyes closed?

331
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,180
I can pass school with my eyes closed,

332
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,480
but if I want to get a scholarship, I still need to open my eyes and review from time to time.

333
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,420
You want to get a scholarship?

334
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,320
Why not? Moreover, I'm paying my own tuition.

335
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:03,270
Does your mom not pay for your tuition?

336
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,990
Younian, here. Eat more.

337
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,080
It's high school entrance exams.

338
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,390
He must be under a lot of stress. Let's not say anymore.

339
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,680
Moreover, he's not eating a lot these days.

340
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,890
He's not eating a lot because he's too picky.

341
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,070
He hasn't liked eating fatty meat ever since he was young, yet you keep making it these couple of days.

342
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,540
Sorry. Sorry.

343
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,970
Mom, why are you apologizing to him?

344
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:38,960
You feel like my mom hasn't served your son properly, right?

345
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,750
That's not what I meant.

346
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,560
What I mean is that Younian is too picky.

347
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,160
Xiaotuo, you are thinking too much.

348
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,750
Younian, what do you want to eat?

349
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,910
Mom will go make it for you.

350
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:02,430
Oh. Auntie. Auntie will go make it for you.

351
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,750
You really think you're his biological mom?

352
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,930
He hasn't even acknowledged you.

353
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,040
Wages (crossed out). Rent

354
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,950
I don't need their family's money.

355
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,080
Oh, I see.

356
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,830
Okay. You review, then.

357
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,500
Hey! Where are you going?

358
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,600
To find a classroom to study in.

359
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,280
You didn't look at the class schedule before coming out this afternoon?

360
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,960
This classroom is the only one that doesn't have a class going on this afternoon.

361
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,420
Okay.

362
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,700
- Write it properly.
- So annoying.

363
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,350
Dummy. Take a good look at this.

364
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,340
Dumb.

365
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,790
Why are you hitting me?

366
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,670
What's the largest existing wooden structure from the Tang Dynasty? Think again.

367
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,670
Isn't it the Dule Temple in Tianjin?

368
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,440
It's the Nanchan Temple on Mt. Wutai.

369
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,730
- With your brain, you're definitely going to fail the Chinese and Foreign Countries Exam on Friday.
- Really?

370
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:30,500
What are you looking at? Aren't you going to change it quickly?

371
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,150
Senior.

372
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,690
It's the Great Hall of Foguang Temple on Mt. Wutai.

373
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,600
Your answer is wrong, too.

374
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,680
If Senior Brother says it is, then it is.

375
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,380
There's no way he'd be wrong.

376
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,540
It's all rote memorization, what's the big deal.

377
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,080
You're going to have an exam on Chinese and Foreign Architectural History?

378
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,470
The exam is actually not until Friday.

379
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:07,210
But Teacher Li didn't tell us what's going to be on the exam so there's too much that needs to be memorized.

380
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,110
Last year, I did my own study guide and it all ended up being on the exam.

381
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,510
I'll mark it down for you.

382
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,960
- Who needs your notes?
- Okay!

383
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,380
Thank you, Senior.

384
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,440
I'll mark it for you. Senior, give it to me.

385
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,520
I don't want it!

386
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,840
- Give it to me.
- Give me the book!

387
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,950
Let go!

388
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,710
If you don't mark it down, how will you get your scholarship?

389
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:52,100
Look at this.

390
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,430
There will definitely be easy questions about the special characteristics of the four great Buddhist caves of China,

391
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,200
- so you must memorize these five special characteristics.
- Okay.

392
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:06,560
Oh, right. He'll definitely make you do a cross-comparison between Daming Palace, Beijing's Forbidden City, and Shenyang Imperial Palace.

393
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,090
So you must memorize the special characteristics of those three.

394
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,070
Okay.

395
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,860
Immature.

396
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,850
What did you say?

397
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,810
Why did you hit me? Why are you always hitting me?

398
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,900
If you don't want to listen, then get out of here.

399
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,960
Senior is teaching me. Can you listen properly?

400
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,500
- I won't listen.
- If you won't listen, get out.

401
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,590
I'm not leaving.

402
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,420
Is there something wrong with you?

403
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,190
- Give me back the book!
- I'm doing this for your own good.

404
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,110
I'm marking it down out of the good of my heart. I'm not going to return it to you.

405
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:34,540
Students, here is the end of our radio program, Youth Talk, for this semester.

406
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:39,070
I hope everyone has a good winter holiday. We'll see you next term.

407
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,470
Senior Sister, you're amazing.

408
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,910
You did a great job on this week's subject.

409
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,620
Especially the segment about interviewing Senior Huang Ningquan.

410
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:57,050
Even I want to go to that cafeteria to eat braised pork.

411
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,860
Thank you, Senior Sister.

412
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,900
But whenever I remember that I will be hosting the Youth Talk next semester, I feel nervous.

413
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,430
It'll be fine once you get used to it.

414
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:12,320
Prepare a meaningful topic over the winter break.

415
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,080
I really look forward to your first broadcast. Fighting!

416
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,500
Okay. I will work hard.

417
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:36,270
I never thought that our Kaituo's appearance

418
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:39,400
would look even more dashing in photos.

419
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,220
If I knew, I would have gotten them printed much earlier.

420
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:49,390
Say, for the topic of next school term's opening broadcast,

421
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:53,600
why don't I do a comparative evaluation of the cute guys and girls in school?

422
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:59,360
At that time, the broadcasting station will collaborate with the school newspaper to create an even bigger report topic!

423
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,750
Miaomiao, I'm going to have a bite of your drumstick, okay?

424
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,500
I'm just having one bite!

425
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,430
No way. When your sinful chopsticks pointing at calories,

426
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,090
I'm your last line of defense.

427
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:17,130
Just one bite.

428
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,300
You asked me to keep an eye on you.

429
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,780
You even told me not to be softhearted even if you beg me.

430
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,990
Lin Kaituo.

431
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,660
Don't use that trick on me, it's useless.

432
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,390
It really is Lin Kaituo.

433
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,300
Kaituo! Here! Sit here, there's an empty spot.

434
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,900
Hey!

435
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,030
There's still one more (photo)!

436
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,290
Then, why don't you help her keep it. I'm going to have a bite of the meat.

437
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,740
Students, here's the exam. Pass them backwards.

438
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,180
Here.

439
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,710
Pass it backwards.

440
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,550
Close your books. It's time for the exam.

441
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,430
Terrace Classroom

442
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,420
Okay, Everyone. Time's up.

443
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,200
I know Xia Miaomiao is always the last one to hand in her paper.

444
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,750
Lin Kaituo, is your butt also stuck to the chair with gum?

445
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,060
I need to get a scholarship.

446
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,420
The time's up. Hurry and hand in your papers to the front.

447
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,270
Your book fell.

448
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,750
It's not mine, I didn't bring my book.

449
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,820
If it's not yours, why is your photo inside?

450
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,470
Xia Miaomiao.

451
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:37,470
That book seems like it's mine.

452
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,700
Oh, my.

453
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,380
Do you still want this lousy book of yours?

454
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,670
Don't misunderstand.

455
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:55,140
I picked up this picture. I'll return it to you.

456
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,740
I didn't misunderstand.

457
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,420
That's good. I'm leaving.

458
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,500
A Little Thing Called First Love

459
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,080
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

460
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,790
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

461
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:37,230
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

462
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:42,860
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

463
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:47,420
♫ My heart... ♫

464
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:59,290
♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

465
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:12,110
♫ I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

466
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,380
♫ Regarding what love feels like ♫

467
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,390
♫ I've only heard about it from friends ♫

468
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:27,710
♫ I never thought about when it would be my turn ♫

469
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,820
♫ You are so dazzling and outstanding ♫

470
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,970
♫ I'm just a faint breeze blowing ♫

471
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:39,670
♫ But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

472
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,890
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

473
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,630
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

474
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:52,190
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫
