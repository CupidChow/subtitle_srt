[A Little Thing Called First Love]

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,570
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,100
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,130
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,070
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,610
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,180
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,020
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,600
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,550
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,540
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,120
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,630
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,540
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,220
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,630
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,590
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,080
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,100
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,020
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,590
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,110
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,950
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,290

Episode 14

27
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,390
With Haicheng's current weather, you've brought back a down jacket?

28
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,610
What can I do? They made me.

29
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,310
My mom's the same. She made me bring back half a kilogram of preserved sausages. Where would I even hang them?

30
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,550
Previously, you've hanged those cured pork tongues all semester-long.

31
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,400
During the monsoon season, they looked disgusting with the water dripping from them.

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,960
You ate a lot.

33
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,380
It's Xiaoyue.

34
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:39,990
Hello?

35
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,780
Xiaoyue, come wipe down Younian's bed boards.

36
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,430
Lu Jingjing is already here helping Lichang.

37
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,420
What are you talking about? Do girls have to do chores?

38
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,500
Okay. I know. I'll go over later.

39
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,870
So sweet. Xiaoyue and Younian are going on a date.

40
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,430
Don't spread these kinds of rumors.

41
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,370
Younian, are you going to the canteen? Bring something back for me.

42
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,900
I'm not going, I have to head over to the club.

43
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,780
- To do what?
- Date.

44
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,140
The last fine arts club president is coming back to film a short clip. He asked for my help.

45
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,610
I need to go back to the club for a meeting.

46
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,060
Off you go.

47
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,050
Hey, Lu Jingjing.

48
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,570
Aren't you also part of the fine arts club? Don't you have to go?

49
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,490
Why is it your business?

50
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,120
Don't want to eat anymore.

51
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,220
Senior Huang Ningqu said coming back to film this time,

52
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,160
he'll need at least ten workers.

53
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,380
Okay. Then why don't we respectively choose ten, and then we'll go over our lists.

54
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,160
Then ask them if they have time.

55
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,470
Okay.

56
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,500
Why did Senior say you owe him a favor?

57
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,940
Because last time Hexin wanted to interview him so I connected them.

58
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,580
That's considered owing him a favor?

59
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,890
He obviously really likes the spotlight.

60
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,240
Let's not include Jingjing.

61
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,850
What?

62
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,080
It's not like you don't know. They always argue when they get together.

63
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,460
But I still think they're quite compatible, and they have chemistry.

64
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,290
Anyway, let's not include her.

65
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,510
Okay.

66
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,280
- You're eating this again?
- Yeah.

67
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,990
Yours look a bit too vegetarian.

68
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,790
- Little Angel.
- Angel.

69
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,610
You came.

70
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,200
- Did you figure out the broadcasting station topic?
- Yes.

71
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,910
It's called "Confession Topic".

72
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,360
You're really doing confession? Then you should give me a fee for coming up with the idea.

73
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,490
I'll reward you with chocolate later.

74
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,630
Why chocolate?

75
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,530
- Miaomiao.
- Yes?

76
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,430
Aren't there some people who love someone else more than they can say?

77
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,080
Towards these people, we recommend that you gift them chocolate.

78
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,500
We already liaised with the food and nutrition major.

79
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,590
Their classrooms will be open to the entire school this week.

80
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,330
Miaomiao, get ready.

81
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,420
What does it have to do with me?

82
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,850
What if no one participates? I can still write an essay by using you as an example.

83
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,230
Why don't you confess yourself?

84
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,460
I will definitely confess.

85
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,710
Hey. But... when do you plan on confessing to Liang Younian?

86
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,150
Miaomiao, hurry.

87
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,510
Then, I'll also try.

88
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,470
What do you mean try? You have to succeed.

89
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,190
Just leave it to me.

90
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,420
I don't think you need oil, it's not like we're pan-frying anything.

91
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,460
It's not needed? Then I'll need water.

92
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,620
A Xia, help us research it.

93
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,390
You need water to temper it.

94
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,980
Be careful.

95
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,800
Period Tracker

96
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,270
Pour it in.

97
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,230
- Okay.
- I'll do it.

98
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,330
Boiling water.

99
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,570
Now what?

100
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,590
Hey, hey, A Xin! It's boiling.

101
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,820
What?! What should we do?

102
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,580
A Xia, what do we do?

103
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,470
Just pour it into the mould.

104
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,140
Okay. This one, this one.

105
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,350
Hey!

106
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,650
Is this a pot of chocolate soup?

107
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,250
You were the one who said I needed to add water.

108
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,010
I meant to melt the chocolate over water.

109
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,360
You didn't say it clearly.

110
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,770
Even if you were to pour water, you can't pour this much. Otherwise, how would it solidify?

111
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,750
Aren't you the smartest out of us?

112
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,020
But even so, I haven't made this before!

113
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,600
The question is, now what do we do?

114
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,870
What do we do with this pot of chocolate?

115
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,230
And also, we don't have anymore ingredients.

116
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,980
Then I can only undertake the difficult task of drinking it.

117
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,020
Hot chocolate. It's the best healing drink for winter.

118
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,660
Miaomiao, you go check the materials, and I'll go buy ingredients.

119
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,460
Then I can only, start drinking.

120
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,980
Then I can only, start drinking.

121
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,840
What's this Campus Confession Week?

122
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,180
Chocolate?

123
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,240
How much longer do we have to wait for it to solidify?

124
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,090
I don't know.

125
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,930
Why don't we go back first and come back tomorrow?

126
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,500
No.

127
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,240
The school's social media platform is going to promote the event starting tomorrow.

128
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,410
There will definitely be a lot of people here making chocolates.

129
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,500
We have to finish it tonight.

130
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,490
Did you decide what to write on the chocolates?

131
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,290
I already thought about it. It's going to say "I like you a lot".

132
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,770
Okay. You?

133
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,910
I don't plan on writing.

134
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,340
Why?

135
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,420
I'm scared to.

136
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,980
Miaomiao. Miaomiao.

137
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,920
Chocolates are done.

138
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,320
Hey, let Lin Xia wrap it.

139
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,960
Those from the fashion majors are really good at making complicated and beautiful bows.

140
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,290
Yeah.

141
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,310
Okay.

142
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,730
I have to go to the bathroom.

143
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,400
- Come with me.
- Let's go.

144
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
Senior Sister, you're back?

145
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,400
I'm back. Hey.

146
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Are you hungry? Do you want to eat anything?

147
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,100
No, I'm good.

148
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,000
Ah Xia will definitely say that she's hungry when she gets back.

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,200
The person who says she has to diet eats all day long.

150
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,400
What are you looking at?

151
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm looking at the method to make chocolates.

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
They're saying that this week is Campus Confession Week.

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,600
Campus confess Week?

154
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,900
Yeah, you can take a look at the schools' public social media page.

155
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,400
We're back.

156
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,600
Miaomiao, Ah Xia, great timing. I brought back sushi for you guys.

157
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,200
I'm a little full. I just drank a huge bowl of hot chocolate.

158
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,800
- What?
- No way...

159
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,000
You're also making chocolates to give to someone?

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,600
What? We're not allowed to?

161
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,800
It's fine. I hope you succeed.

162
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,600
Miaomiao, what take-out are you holding?

163
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,400
This box is so pretty.

164
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,000
This isn't a take out.

165
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,900
It's chocolate.

166
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,800
Who are you giving it to?

167
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,700
Liang Younian.

168
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Miaomiao?

169
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,000
You are giving them to Liang Younian, too?

170
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,600
Of course, not. She's sending it to someone in her class.

171
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
Liang Younian is the gentle type and not interesting at all.

172
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,700
Good girls like her tend to like bad boys, right?

173
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,700
Yeah.

174
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,800
Even though it's Campus Confession Week,

175
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,800
not everyone who confesses will get results.

176
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
What do you mean?

177
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,000
People should know their limits.

178
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,800
Speaking of knowing one's limits,

179
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,600
you should put on earphones before watching your videos.

180
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,400
I won't sit. I'm gonna walk around.

181
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,200
Haicheng University.

182
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,800
Is that so?

183
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,600
Do you still remember today's mission?

184
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,000
Of course. Take attendance in place of Yan Xiaozhen in your class.

185
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,800
Not that.

186
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,400
After class, you have to find Liang Younian and confess.

187
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,400
This, let's forget it.

188
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,200
Besides, I haven't thought about how to say it.

189
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't even know if Senior likes chocolates.

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,600
Guys normally don't like to eat sweets, right?

191
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,200
Just because they don't like eating sweets,

192
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,000
doesn't mean that they don't want to receive chocolates.

193
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,500
Really?

194
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,200
If you don't know, ask him.

195
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,900
Lin Kaituo!

196
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,600
Do you want to receive chocolates from girls for Confession Week?

197
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
- Confession?
- Are you crazy? Why would you ask him?

198
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,800
Xia Miaomiao.

199
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:04,200
Th-That book seems like it's mine.

200
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,400
Why is he still so impolite?

201
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,200
Asking him is pointless.

202
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,600
Even if he likes it, it doesn't mean that Senior will like it.

203
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,400
I can conveniently scope out whether He Xin will succeed.

204
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Xinxin doesn't care if he likes it.

205
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,800
She will give it to him either way.

206
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,600
True.

207
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,200
Hurry up, it's time for class! We're going to be late!

208
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,000
Let's go!

209
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,130
Why are you in such a rush?

210
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,600
The teacher's not even here yet.

211
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,980
It's my first time taking a class from your department.

212
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,400
I'm a little excited.

213
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,800
When you see our teacher later, you'll find out

214
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,000
that she's the most excited person in this world.

215
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,200
Good morning, my precious students!

216
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,600
Are you guys excited for today's color-printing and tie-dying class?

217
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Why does your teacher look kind of familiar?

218
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,200
She's the one who blanked out last time.

219
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,800
Have you guys prepared everything I've asked for?

220
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,400
Yes.

221
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,600
Okay, let's check attendance.

222
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,200
- Liu Wanjun.
- Present.

223
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
- Liu Cui.
- Present.

224
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,600
- Zhong Haiying.
- Present.

225
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,000
- Liu Xuan'er?
- Present.

226
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,800
- Zhang Xueli.
- Present.

227
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,200
- Lin Xia?
- Present.

228
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,800
- Tang Mengfei?
- Present.

229
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,600
Yan Xiaozhen.

230
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,800
Yan Xiaozhen?

231
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,300
Present.

232
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,400
- Zhong Peihua.
- Present.

233
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,900
De Shuli.

234
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,400
Even though your looks are just average

235
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,200
and you might not smell that great, either.

236
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,000
I trust that you can definitely overcome those shortcomings.

237
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,600
Lin Kaituo, I don't mean anything by it.

238
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,700
It's just that everyone is gifting chocolates for Confession Week.

239
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,380
I don't mean anything by it, either. I just don't want to accept it.

240
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,200
I still need to go to the broadcasting station.

241
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,400
Why don't you wait a little longer?

242
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,300
Try doing it further down.

243
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,400
Be careful of this part.

244
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,200
Teacher, I'm doing it.

245
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,400
I've already noticed you for awhile now.

246
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,800
Your tie-dye is totally different from everyone else's.

247
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,000
They just followed my instructions.

248
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,900
But you totally added your own style.

249
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm too touched.

250
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,400
What is your name? I'm going to give you bonus points.

251
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,800
Thank you, Teacher.

252
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,600
I'm called Xia Miaomiao.

253
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,800
Xia Miaomiao.

254
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Xia Miaomiao?

255
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,600
Do I have someone called Xia Miaomiao in my class?

256
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,800
No.

257
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,600
Teacher, she's an architecture major.

258
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh, my goodness.

259
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,600
You're Li Sichen's student.

260
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,100
How did you come... come to this classroom?

261
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
Teacher, she's my friend.

262
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,600
She heard that your class is extremely interesting,

263
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,000
so she begged me to bring her here.

264
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,300
And there are a lot of other students who want to take your class too, right?

265
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah. They're wracking their brains on ways to get in.

266
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,800
That's right.

267
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,600
Really?

268
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,200
My class is that popular?

269
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
It's especially popular.

270
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Low key, low key.

271
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,200
Don't boast after you leave here.

272
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,300
If they all come to attend my class, I won't be able to handle it.

273
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,400
- Xia Miaomiao, is it?
- Yes.

274
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
Come here.

275
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,000
Even though I really despise your teacher, Li Sichen,

276
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,200
don't you worry, I won't take it out on you.

277
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,400
And you're so talented, you're welcome to attend my classes any time.

278
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,000
From today onward,

279
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,400
you're my secret student.

280
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Really?

281
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,400
Absolutely.

282
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,200
Thank you, Teacher.

283
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,000
- Go.
- Yes.

284
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,600
Do you think Teacher is pretty?

285
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
Pretty.

286
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,000
Let me tell you, eyes are the window to the soul.

287
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I used to be near-sighted just like you.

288
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,450
I'll introduce an optometrist to you later.

289
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,600
You just need to do a tiny surgery

290
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,000
to make your eyes beautiful.

291
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,100
Thank you, Teacher.

292
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,000
- I'm going now.
- All right.

293
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Your teacher is too interesting.

294
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
That's just how she is.

295
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,000
Then do you think I should listen to her and go to the hospital for a consultation?

296
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,500
Don't look for excuses. Hurry and find Senior Liang Younian.

297
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,800
I don't even know where he is. How am I supposed to find him?

298
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,400
I knew you were going to say that.

299
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,200
I already asked Senior Dachao. He's in the model classroom.

300
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,600
Miaomiao?

301
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,000
- Miaomiao?
- Senior Sister.

302
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,900
How come you came?

303
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,600
I... I-I just—

304
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,800
Hello? Hello? Hello?

305
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,000
- Senior Sister, did you turn on the microphone?
- I did.

306
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,200
Oh, my! Why did you turn on the microphone? Turn it off.

307
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,000
This He Xin...

308
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,390
I-I was just passing by.

309
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,400
That... it's the first time He Xin is doing a live broadcast,

310
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,300
so she wanted me to help her find a spot and record it.

311
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,700
Then I'll get going first, Senior sister.

312
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,400
Bye-bye, Senior Sister.

313
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,000
Bye-bye.

314
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,200
Be careful.

315
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,860
Bye-bye.

316
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,470
Why is Miaomiao acting so weird?

317
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,010
Younian, Senior Huang Ning Qun is already here.

318
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,000
He asked us to see him.

319
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,000
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

320
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Picking up a package.

321
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,600
What is it that's so precious?

322
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,700
N-Nothing much.

323
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,000
It's not...

324
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Student, your package.

325
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,800
Hello, everyone. This is Haicheng University's broadcasting station.

326
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,800
I am your new broadcaster for today's "Youth Talk," He Xin.

327
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,200
After a warm and merry winter break,

328
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,200
I welcome everyone back to the big family of Haicheng University,

329
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,400
to start a new job and to study.

330
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,000
A new term, a fresh look.

331
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,600
Our broadcasting program, "Youth Talk,"

332
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,000
has been thoroughly updated and revised.

333
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
We're looking to plan more outstanding activities.

334
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,200
to enrich every student's life on campus.

335
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,800
When did she become the main broadcaster?

336
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,000
She has been saying that she's going to be the main broadcaster for this school term for a long time now.

337
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,300
Can you care about her just a little bit?

338
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Why should I care about her?

339
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,200
This week's segment on the broadcast, "Youth Talk,"

340
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,600
will be collaborating with the school newspaper and social media platform

341
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,200
to create Campus Confession Week.

342
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,600
This week, please express your love to your beloved,

343
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,400
your friends, or family, and tell them how you feel.

344
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,900
What mess is she creating?

345
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Let chocolates represent the many words you have to say

346
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,400
to give to the person you like.

347
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,200
You can't be so dumb as to have made chocolates, can you?

348
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,960
Or did someone give you chocolate?

349
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,600
No.

350
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,000
Then what are you hiding behind you?

351
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,840
Let me have a look!

352
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,800
There's nothing.

353
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
- Just a look! Hurry, hurry.
- Hey.

354
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,700
What are you doing?

355
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,800
Sorry, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

356
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,220
Do you not know how to look where you're going?

357
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,800
Don't you know how to speak?

358
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,800
How am I supposed to speak? You bumped into me first, what am I supposed to say?!

359
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,200
Senior.

360
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,500
Don't bully your juniors right upon coming back to school.

361
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,800
What happened?

362
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,200
But you guys saw it.

363
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,000
She almost ran into me and she's the one being all fierce.

364
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I didn't.

365
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,800
Who's being fierce. You're the one being unreasonable.

366
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,000
So when A Xia said you liked bad people, it was true?

367
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,190
I don't.

368
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,600
These days, campus confessions are really getting tackier.

369
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,800
There's even a school confession day.

370
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,400
Simply gifting chocolate means you like someone?

371
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
And even creating a confession day. Seriously!

372
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,400
Senior, stop being so cynical.

373
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,300
- Didn't you want to look at the view? Let's go.
- Let's go.

374
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,300
Liang Younian, what are you waiting for?

375
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Xiaoyue, help me grab my luggage later.

376
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,900
Okay.

377
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,100
- Where are you going?
- None of your business!

378
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,000
It's cloudy, it's going to rain the next few days.

379
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,800
But this rooftop patio is really great.

380
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,300
Look at how it faces the ocean.

381
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,200
So when A Xia said you liked bad boys, it was true?

382
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,600
We'll film it here.

383
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,590
You received that many chocolates?

384
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,000
How is it?

385
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,600
Did you decide where to film yet?

386
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,400
This rooftop patio is pretty good. Let's film the last scene here.

387
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,100
Oh, okay.

388
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,100
Okay. Then we'll head back to the art club for a meeting and to delegate tasks.

389
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Will everyone be there?

390
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,200
Most of them.

391
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,400
Let's hurry back. Don't you have to go back for a meeting in the afternoon?

392
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,600
- Where are we going?
- To treat us to a meal.

393
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,000
Why do I have to be the one who treats?

394
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,800
You get so much scholarship money.

395
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,200
Give me some financial aid, donate to the arts.

396
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,800
Do you know what WeChat message Teacher Jia Yin sent to me?

397
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,200
She said she already helped you make an appointment to see the eye specialist tomorrow afternoon.

398
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,000
She's so passionate that it's frightening.

399
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,820
What's wrong?

400
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,400
I didn't get to give him the chocolates.

401
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,500
You're both sisters in distress.

402
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,000
Why didn't you give yours out?

403
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,600
I didn't dare to.

404
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,800
I can understand why Miaomiao failed the first time.

405
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,200
But He Xin, you've really disappointed me.

406
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,400
You're usually so shameless.

407
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,600
Every time you see Lin Kaituo, you're nearly clinging onto his neck.

408
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Yet you're too scared to give him chocolates?

409
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,900
That's because you didn't see how he rejects people.

410
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,500
He's really too cruel.

411
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,800
"I don't mean anything by it,

412
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,500
it's Confession Week, everyone is gifting chocolates."

413
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,600
"I don't mean anything by it, either,

414
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,000
I just don't want to accept it."

415
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,800
Just because he rejected other people, it doesn't mean that he'll reject you, okay?

416
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,000
Are you sure?

417
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
My chocolates won't get thrown away?

418
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
What should I do?

419
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,400
What about... we just forget about it?

420
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,000
Forget about it?!

421
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,110
Xia Miaomiao, when you go to the art club for the afternoon meeting,

422
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,800
find another opportunity to give them to him.

423
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,890
You can't keep on secretly crushing on him.

424
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,600
You have to let him know how you feel.

425
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,400
As for He Xin, you get rejected by him daily for so many times.

426
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,800
Will once more be any different?

427
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,700
Be more serious, you can't let him always treat you like this.

428
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,400
She hasn't been in a relationship before, yet she likes analyzing them so much.

429
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,610
Do I like to analyze relationships?

430
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,400
It's because you guys keep on asking me!

431
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,200
- We'll give it to them.
- We'll give it to them.

432
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,400
Senior, everyone has pretty much arrived. How about we get started?

433
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,100
Let's start.

434
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,000
Everyone, first of all, let's welcome our very hard working senior with many achievements,

435
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,800
Everyone, first of all, let's welcome our very hard working senior with many achievements,

436
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,600
Senior Huang Ningqun, to share his learning experience.

437
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,200
Xiaoyue, why do you still speak in a scripted manner?

438
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,000
Let him say it.

439
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,200
Okay, then you say it.

440
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,600
It's like this. Senior is preparing a short clip for a competition,

441
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,600
and this short clip will be filmed at the school.

442
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
Why?

443
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,000
Because our senior is stubborn, cheap and weird.

444
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:29,000
It's because Senior's finances are tight, so he hopes that our art club can assist him with this time's filming.

445
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,090
It'll be this weekend.

446
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,600
Interested students should come get a registration form,

447
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,800
so that Senior can delegate tasks.

448
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,400
Okay, I'm done speaking.

449
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,200
Meetings should be simple and to the point, right?

450
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,400
Okay.

451
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,000
Registration forms are with me.

452
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,200
Students who are interested can come get the form from me.

453
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,200
If you're not interested, you can head back first.

454
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,900
I want one.

455
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Senior Sister, thank you.

456
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,700
What are your specialities?

457
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,800
Drawing.

458
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,870
It's the art club, everyone's specialty is drawing.

459
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,600
Think again, is there anything else you know how to do?

460
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,400
Liang Younian knows how to film, so he can be my cameraman.

461
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,200
Fang Xiaoyue can do makeup, so she can help me do the makeup for the actors.

462
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,970
What can you do?

463
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,600
I...

464
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,700
I can move things.

465
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,400
Okay, then you can be a production worker.

466
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,800
What do production workers do?

467
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,000
They move things.

468
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,020
That..

469
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,680
How come Lu Jingjing didn't come?

470
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,000
She can be the my assistant director.

471
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,200
She doesn't have time.

472
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,500
- Ah, I see.
- Okay.

473
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:21,880
New Community

474
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,110
Senior.

475
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:51,420
Senior, this is chocolate that I made personally for you.

476
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,580
No, thank you.

477
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,950
Right, Senior probably doesn't like sweets anyway.

478
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,340
He's colder than Lin Kaituo.

479
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,060
Senior...

480
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,640
Lin Kaituo?

481
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:28,420
Senior, d-do you like...

482
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,480
I need to go.

483
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:38,710
...like eating chocolate?

484
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,300
You're back.

485
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,380
Go look at your chocolates.

486
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,630
Where are you going?

487
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:19,850
I'm going to the model classroom to work on my final project.

488
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,230
You're going to pull an all-nighter again?

489
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,350
Hello, Students. Welcome to this broadcast, "Youth Talk."

490
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:33,450
I am your main broadcaster, He Xin. I would like to give my thanks to

491
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:40,270
all the love everyone has given to our school's Confession event. Here, I will read of the comments I have received,

492
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:45,800
From what I've heard from the doctor, the lasik eye surgery seems trustworthy.

493
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,880
You always seem to get into trouble when wearing your thick glasses,

494
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,170
maybe you can try out the procedure.

495
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,590
The only thing is that it's a bit expensive, will your mom agree to it?

496
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:59,660
My dad is still at home. As long I want to do it, my dad will convince my mom to do it.

497
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,540
Although, I am a little scared.

498
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,940
Why are you scared of everything?

499
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,990
The doctor said you're suitable for the Lasik procedure.

500
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:14,630
But... I am still scared.

501
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:20,140
The grass is producing its seeds while the wind is blowing its leaves.

502
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:24,020
Just standing without speaking is perfection.

503
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,010
People who stand and don't speak, Xia Miaomiao.

504
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:31,020
- It's totally you.
- You! You can't say that about me.

505
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,650
You were originally like that, anyway.

506
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,630
Let's go.

507
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,350
From the already graduated Senior Huang, he said to Jingjing,

508
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,980
"I didn't make fun of you because I didn't like you."

509
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,700
- Hello, Teacher.
- Hello.

510
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,270
That's not possible. This is weird.

511
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,420
Professor Wu, what's wrong?

512
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,040
Liang Younian just told me now in class that

513
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,290
he's not finished with his design drawing, and that he'll turn it in tomorrow.

514
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:01,890
Liang Younian? The Liang Younian who always completes every task?

515
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,400
Exactly. You also think it's weird, right?

516
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,830
I don't know what's gotten into this group of kids.

517
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:10,460
When I was teaching the freshmen theoretical course this morning,

518
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,160
Lin Kaituo kept on sitting there smiling like a fool.

519
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,050
He gave me the creeps.

520
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,180
Maybe it's because it's confession week,

521
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,700
so they all want to start dating.

522
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,780
But Liang Younian wouldn't be like that, would he?

523
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:37,120
True. Say, it's normal for the students in our architecture department to turn in assignments late.

524
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,630
Since Liang Younian entered our department, his assignments have all been not only on time, but also the most well done.

525
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,320
He's like a robot.

526
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,670
Exactly the same as his mother back then.

527
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:50,580
Yes, Senior Sister Chen Hui is a legend in our architecture department.

528
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,740
Professor, do you still remember?

529
00:38:54,740 --> 00:39:00,550
One time Senior Sister Chen Hui got into a fight with Liang Gang and even tore up the drawing.

530
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,050
That time she didn't hand in her homework.

531
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,310
The entire architecture major was in a frenzy.

532
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,820
I think there was something like that.

533
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,060
Oh, yes. Why did you come looking for me?

534
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,810
You're the Department Head.

535
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,350
The old professors have been talking about doing an event.

536
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,770
Okay.
 [Office of the Department Head]

537
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,750
You have so many chocolates here.

538
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,780
Are you sure you don't want to eat any?

539
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,830
I don't want to eat them.

540
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:43,740
Oh, right. Did Xia Miaomiao give you chocolates, too?

541
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,060
No.

542
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,940
Could it be that it was for Kaituo then?

543
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,640
It's just that while I was at the fashion department that day,

544
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,450
I saw Xia Miaomiao ask Lin Kaituo if he wanted to receive chocolates.

545
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,970
I thought it was for you.

546
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,940
Who knew it was for Lin Kaituo?

547
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,990
You're thinking too much.

548
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,970
You're tearing it up again?

549
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,530
You're so not environmentally friendly.

550
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:31,430
I mean it takes so much effort for a tree to grow and become paper, and you tear it up just like that.

551
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,330
You're too environmentally unfriendly.

552
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:40,500
Do whatever you want. Keep on tearing, and I'll keep on eating.

553
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,920
This is really good.

554
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,730
You should have one, too.

555
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,440
I'll introduce your outstanding design to everyone.

556
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,480
All girls come over to take a look. This is your Senior Sister.

557
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,230
When she first joined the arts club, her skills were especially good. Draw this well, okay?

558
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,920
Everyone get ready. Get ready well.

559
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,150
Director, Director.

560
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,940
Where should I put this?

561
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,050
Director, I want to film the angle like—

562
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,890
This one, don't put it on the small table.

563
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,810
Put two on this small table. The big table doesn't need it.

564
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:14,710
- Film this and this, and the ocean like this.
- Okay, okay, good.

565
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:19,700
And about the rest of it, I think we have to look at the equipment to determine the angle.

566
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,050
See if you can turn it around.

567
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,950
The fruits have already been placed.

568
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:30,040
We'll focus on this first.

569
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,130
Okay.

570
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,890
Is everyone ready?

571
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,380
- Yes!
- Ready.

572
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,850
Come, okay.

573
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,110
We'll pan over here.

574
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,430
What are you doing standing there? Hurry, hurry.

575
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:02,150
Okay, three, two, one, start.

576
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,920
Yesterday, your entire department kept on sending me congratulations messages one after another.

577
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,670
Do you still want me to sleep?

578
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,140
Tengteng, listen to me explain.

579
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,550
With 200 people sending you messages, don't you feel very important?

580
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,200
Don't you feel very touched?

581
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,490
Touched, my foot!

582
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,060
Haicheng University

583
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:37,100
What happened?

584
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,010
Why did you guys bring two balls?

585
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,190
A Little Thing Called First Love

586
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:11,720
