A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,600
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,200
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,200
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,200
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,600
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,800
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,200
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,600
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,200
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,000
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,800
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,200
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,100
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,200
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,600
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,200
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,200
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,400
A Little Thing Called First Love
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

Episode 6

27
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,300
Are you ready?

28
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,300
- Yes, yes, we're ready.
- I'm going to take a picture now.
-

29
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,000
- Coming, coming.
- We have to commemorate this moment. Okay, get ready.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,600
Look at the camera. Look here.

31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,100
Here. Three, two, one.

32
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,400
Liang Younian, pose properly. Okay, one more.

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,800
One, two, three.

34
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,200
You two, mother and son. Neither of you acted seriously.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,600
If the upper beam isn't straight, the lower beams will be slanted.
 (If the elders don't act properly, the youngsters won't, either)

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Let's go out and eat tonight to celebrate fully.

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,400
I'm not going. I want to eat a-at home.

38
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,000
You're so much older now, yet you're still picky about your food. The outside dining halls can't handle you, can they?

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,600
Today is my birthday. Can I not relax?

40
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,400
Exactly.

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,600
- Mom.
- Not listening, not listening... I'm a monk reciting my Buddhist sutra.

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,200
Chen Hui, hurry and make a wish and blow out the candles.

43
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,300
I wish today, I can make pork and cabbage dumplings for my son.

44
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't even think about it.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
This birthday girl will not be stepping foot into the kitchen today.

46
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,600
I wish today, I can give my son—

47
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,000
I wish that my son will no longer be picky about his food.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,500
Time to cut the cake!

49
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,700
- Here, eat some cake!
- I'll cut a big slice for you.

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,200
Cut.

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,800
Mrs. Xia's Private Kitchen
[Open]

52
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,800
Why are you up so early? Even those who are taking the college entrance exam aren't even up yet.

53
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,000
Who's going to buy it?

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,600
I must wake up earlier than him.

55
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,900
Senior. Good morning.

56
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,600
Xia Miaomiao, good morning.

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,000
Did you eat breakfast?

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,700
Breakfast?

59
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,800
My dad did gave me breakfast, but I forgot to bring it.

60
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm going to be late as well. I don't usually eat breakfast anyway.

61
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
I made breakfast for you!

62
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,900
You made breakfast for me?

63
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,200
No.

64
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,600
W-We sell breakfasts. Do you want to buy one?

65
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,400
Xia Miaomiao, you're forcing people to buy.

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm treating you.

67
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,000
"Good luck on the college entrance exam."

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,300
You made this especially for me, didn't you?

69
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
No.

70
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,000
That... It's just a "kindness" meal for those taking the college entrance exams.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
My... My mom told me to write that to promote sales.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,800
What did I tell you to write?

73
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,000
This.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,400
Why did you stick something on it?

75
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
Student, that will be 10 yuan ($1.50 USD).

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,700
You get the money.

77
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,900
S-Senior.

78
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,000
There's no need. There's really on need.

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,200
10 yuan, Senior.

80
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,400
Thank you, Student Xia Miaomiao.

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,100
Thank you, S-Senior. Good luck on the college entrance exam!

Younian!

85
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,000
Younian!

86
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,980
Younian! Liang Younian!

87
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,600
- Younian.
- Aunt.

88
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,400
Aunt, how come you came?

89
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,600
Your dad said that you didn't take your breakfast.

90
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,800
Aunt, it's fine. I'm not hungry. I just—

91
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,800
I made them just this morning. They're extremely fresh.

92
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,000
I heard that you love to eat dumplings.

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,600
I got up especially early this morning.

94
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,310
Aunt!

95
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
I... I'll eat them when I get home.

96
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,800
That won't do.

97
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,200
If you take the exam while you're hungry,

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,200
it'll affect your performance. Here.

99
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,800
Eat one.

100
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,460
Hurry.

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,200
Then you won't be hungry during the exam. Quickly.

102
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Even eating just two is good.

103
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Thank you, Aunt.

104
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,800
Do well on the exams! Don't be nervous!

105
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,300
Fighting!

106
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,500
After the College Entrance Exam

107
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,400
I must have given at least 20 dumplings to Senior for breakfast.
 [Hai City Daily: "The Touching Love of a Mother! Mother feeds dumplings to physically exhausted son"]

108
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:24,010
He also ate his mom's dumplings. How many must he have eaten?

109
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,200
That must have been so humiliating for Liang Younian.

110
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,400
Aunt did beautifully.

111

"The Touching Love of a Mother"?

112
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Nowadays, people will do anything to become someone's mother.

113
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,460
If you're jealous, just have your mom make you some as well.

114
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,400
Try saying that again!

115
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,800
Don't say anymore. Hurry and apologize. Apologize, apologize.

116
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,600
Why?

117
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Come on.

118
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,600
No, I just find it strange. Why is it that every time I mention Senior's mom,

119
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,200
No, I just find it strange. Why is it that every time I mention Senior's mom,

120
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,000
you get so agitated?

121
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,700
I-Is your mom...

122
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,100
What?

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,200
Is she still alive?

124
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,500
Don't talk anymore.

125
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,000
You!

126
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,400
Did I say something wrong again?

127
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,900
Yes.

128
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,500
What did I say wrong?

129
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,560
Thanks, Boss.

130
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,810
Thank you.

131
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,510
Why are you thanking me?

132
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,110
I should be thanking you instead, you helped me all day today.

133
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,390
Oh, right. How do you feel about the exam?

134
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:11,400
I don't know yet... but I did my best.

135
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,930
No way.

136
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,170
I think Mr. Liang is already coming up with all sorts of ways to celebrate.

137
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,690
Have you figured out which university and major you'll be applying to?

138
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,890
Architecture at Haicheng University.

139
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,200
Not bad.

140
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,900
When Mr. Liang finds out, he should be very pleased, right?

141
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,910
Not necessarily.

142
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,280
Why?

143
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,470
My dad... doesn't want me to study architecture.

144
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,400
The two of us argued over this once before.

145
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,010
So, I often think...

146
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,270
if he's that much against it, shouldn't I listen to his opinion?

147
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,270
Kid, if it's something that you really want to do,

148
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:05,210
don't ever be swayed by someone else's dissenting opinion.

149
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,620
But my dad, he...

150
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,500
Is it your life or your dad's?

151
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,360
But it's true that your father is paying the tuition.

152
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,740
You've got a point there. Worst comes to worst, I'll go get a scholarship every year.

153
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,700
I like this idea of yours.

154
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,610
But let me remind you, scholarships from Haicheng University are very hard to get.

155
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,530
But let me remind you, scholarships from Haicheng University are very hard to get.

156
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,690
But the amount you get is also a lot.

157
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,890
How do you know?

158
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,940
On this point...

159
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,190
I have a very long history with Haicheng University.

160
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:46,070
- May your dreams come true.
- Thank you.

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,000
Senior?

162
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,530
D-D-Didn't you finish your college entrance exam?

163
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,760
Why are you still drawing to relax?

164
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,860
I still have to hurry and finish one of my drawings.

165
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,710
Why do you have to hurry?

166
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,910
Then... Then when can you finish?

167
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,330
Then... will you be here all the way up until you finish it?

168
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,420
Which question do you want me to answer first?

169
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,020
I think I have too many questions.

170
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,150
You don't have to answer me.

171
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,560
Until I finish this drawing, I'll be here.

172
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,480
When will that be?

173
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,560
You're so good. Wouldn't you finish this by tomorrow?

174
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,110
Before the 28th of June.

175
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,420
June 28th.

176
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,630
Why the 28th?

177
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,280
Oh, I know why. He Xin told me before.

178
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,980
June 28th is when your college entrance exam results come out. Am I right?

179
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,210
June 28th is when your college entrance exam results come out. Am I right?

180
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,650
Not bad. Not bad, not bad.

181
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,700
I always knew that Younian had good grades regularly.

182
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,900
But I never thought that you would score first in the entire city this time.

183
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,990
First in the entire city!

184
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,600
Look at how happy you are.

185
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,540
Madam, why don't we all go out tonight as a family to celebrate?

186
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,930
We can eat whatever you like. Pick the expensive stuff, okay?

187
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,710
Why don't you ask Younian?

188
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,970
Younian, where do you want to celebrate?

189
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,870
I don't want to celebrate today.

190
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,540
Then... what do you want to eat?

191
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,180
I'll buy it and make it for you.

192
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,060
Let's eat out. Let's eat out.

193
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,860
No need to save money for me.

194
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,810
Oh, your homeroom teacher is calling.

195
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,360
Calling me at this time... Is it that he wants to discuss

196
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,330
educational philosophies with me?

197
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,270
I never thought I would raise a top scorer in the college entrance examination in the sciences (as opposed to humanities).

198
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,210
Hello? Yes, I'm Liang Gang!

199
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,380
Lower your voice! Don't disturb the kids.

200
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,350
Liang Younian!

201
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,740
Your homeroom teacher called me and said on the college entrance exam's aspirations form,

202
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,740
you wrote down the Architecture major at Haicheng University.

203
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,690
- You left everything else empty, is that right?
- Yes.

204
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,850
Didn't I tell you that you're not allowed to apply for architecture?!

205
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,790
Go! Fix it!

206
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,730
- I won't fix it.
- Will you fix it?

207
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,020
- No.
- You!

208
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,000
I've told you long ago that I won't support you studying architecture.

209
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,820
Even until now, you're still drawing random blueprints for this lousy, unfinished building.

210
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,340
Give me back my drawing.

211
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,520
I'll let you draw... I'll let you draw!

212
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,050
- Give it back!
- I'll let you draw!

213
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,740
If you have something to say, say it nicely.

214
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,700
Why are you so angry with your child?

215
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,350
You need to respect what he wants to apply for.

216
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,580
You don't need to protect him, you're only hurting him like this!

217
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,030
Overprotective mothers will only produce useless sons! Don't you know that?!

218
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,600
Aren't all mothers like this?

219
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,320
Then am I supposed to scold him with you? Will he be able to bear that?

220
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,990
That year, it was because his mom studied architecture at Haicheng University and that's why—

221
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,130
So you actually still remember my mom?

222
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,070
How could I have forgotten that?

223
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,210
Forgotten what?

224
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,780
Today... is his mother's birthday.

225
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,810
June 28th.

226
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,880
When I was a first year in high school,
(Equivalent of 10th grade)

227
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,860
my mom passed away.

228
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,760
The one that you call the teacher's wife right now,

229
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,250
is actually Lin Kaituo's mom.

230
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,310
Back then, my mom had only left us for a year

231
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,030
and my dad already said that he wanted to marry Lin Kaituo's mom.

232
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:49,150
I really can't understand why he would want to re-marry in such a short amount of time.

233
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,200
So when Kaituo found me to protest together,

234
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,960
I didn't even think about it and just agreed.

235
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,310
But it seemed that my dad felt awful.

236
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,860
- Dad.
- Yes?

237
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,470
You're back? You still haven't eaten, right?

238
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,830
Dad will go make it for you, okay?

239
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,840
- Dad!
- Yes.

240
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,580
I'm fine. It will be ready soon.

241
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:02,950
So I think... Forget it.

242
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,070
I'm glad that my dad was able to get out of that.

243
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,340
But I realized... I think I was wrong

244
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:20,260
since my relationship with Kaituo has become like this.

245
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,900
Even my mom...

246
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,990
Actually, today is my mom's birthday.

247
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,420
But apart from me,

248
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,890
no one else remembers.

249
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,650
Even my dad—

250
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,290
Why are you crying?

251
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,350
I'm not even crying, so why are you crying?

252
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,600
I-I-I won't cry anymore. I-I'll hold it in.

253
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,600
I'll hold it in.

254
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,240
I-I-I'll be fine in a little bit. I'll hold it in.

255
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,210
Dad.

256
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,060
- You know to come back?
- Yeah.

257
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,330
What are you "yeah-ing" for? You little brat.

258
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,920
You only know to fight against me every day.

259
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,580
Go inside and eat.

260
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,860
What? You still want to set yourself against me?

261
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,010
Dad.

262
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,150
I didn't apply for architecture just to go against your will.

263
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,370
You already ramble on so much at such a young age.

264
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,350
Younian, you must be hungry.

265
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,180
I kept this especially for you. It's still hot.

266
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,350
Your dad said that we had to wait for you to come back to eat together.

267
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,110
Thank you.

268
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,820
Younian, today, your mom...

269
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,370
Your dad didn't forget it on purpose.

270
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:58,160
I'm talking too much. It's fine, it's fine. Let's eat.

271
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,700
Drink some soup.

272
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,030
Dad.

273
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:24,690
Can you give me the box that mom used to store her designs in?

274
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,440
Eat first.

275
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,390
Students.

276
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:50,450
Teacher Liang will be gone for a couple of days, so I will looking after the art studio during this time.

277
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,990
You can call me Teacher Xiao (little) Liang.

278
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,910
Teacher Xiao Liang.

279
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,540
No need to clap. Keep on drawing.

280
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,300
Miaomiao, let me use your white paint for a bit.

281
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,520
Xia Miaomiao.

282
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,910
Let me use your white paint for a bit.

283
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,420
Hey, Miaomiao, I can't squeeze out the paint.

284
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,900
I'll do it.

285
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,080
Let me try.

286
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,850
It's not easy indeed.

287
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:09,880
Maybe I didn't screw the cap on tightly, so it dried out?

288
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,900
I'll try again, hold this for me.

289
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:32,200
It's fine, it would have broken too if I had done it.

290
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,670
I'll b-buy you a new one.

291
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,550
N-No need. I have a lot at home. I have a lot, it's fine.

292
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,020
Here. Sorry about that.

293
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,830
It's really fine, Senior. It's fine.

294
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,690
You came?

295
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,150
You're still working so hard even though the exam has ended.

296
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,030
Uncle, I want to buy some paint.

297
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,500
Do you have the entire set of Marie's (Brand name)?

298
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,460
Marie's? You didn't use to use this brand.

299
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,110
It's a gift for someone. I'm afraid she might not adjust well to a new brand.

300
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,720
If it's a gift, then they must use the expensive one.

301
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,710
I just got a new batch and they're pretty good. Just... See there, that girl has been looking at them all day.

302
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,110
Money.

303
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:45,060
Can't my mom just give me a little bit more allowance?

304
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,560
Uncle, give me a box of the brand that she's holding.

305
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,160
Okay, I'll go to the back and get it.

306
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,690
She just had to make me take this exam.

307
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,600
If I don't pass the fifth level, she won't let me study Fine Arts.

308
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,380
She doesn't give me an allowance and doesn't even send me off to the exam.

309
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,460
Mom really does have a heart of stone.

310
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,560
Xia Miaomiao.

311
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,830
Senior?

312
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:46,600
Why... Why are you here?

313
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,570
To repay a debt.

314
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,350
I...

315
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,080
No, no, no. No need.

316
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,660
I have a lot of paint, and...

317
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,550
and this one is too expensive. I can't accept it.

318
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,790
I broke your paint tube so it's only right for me to give you a new one.

319
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,070
N-No.

320
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:14,030
I have a lot of boxes of this brand.

321
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,480
Xia Miaomiao.

322
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,340
You like this paint's brand, don't you?

323
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,060
Take it.

324
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,800
Thank you, Senior.

325
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,430
I will definitely work hard with these paints and get a good score.

326
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:46,830
Okay. Then I'll wait for your good news.

327
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,590
Hurry and go in. Fighting.

328
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,020
Fighting!

329
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,900
You think there's nothing I can do if you won't let me deliver?

330
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,710
You locked my motorcycle again! Are you mental!

331
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,820
Admissions Letter

332
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:29,020
Haicheng University

333
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,630
I obviously pushed the "Stop receiving orders" button,

334
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,700
so why is the platform still giving me delivery orders so late at night?

335
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,940
Okay, okay. I know.

336
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,780
I'm so unlucky today.

337
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,790
Fine Arts Standardized Exam Certification - Pass Grade: 8

338
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,890
Stop smiling. Hurry and help me with my homework.

339
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,690
Don't you have one more week before school starts? Why are you in such a hurry?

340
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,570
I didn't do any of it.

341
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,860
I also have to do my arts and crafts homework.

342
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,430
I have to make a shell necklace and I really don't know how to do it.

343
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,250
Why don't you help me make a shell necklace?

344
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:05,460
I don't have time to pick shells anyway.

345
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,950
You're reaping what you sow. Who told you to play every day this summer?

346
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,710
You're my older sister.

347
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,770
It's only one shell necklace.

348
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,190
You're so petty.

349
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,670
I'm very busy.

350
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,060
Teacher Liang.

351
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,490
It's Xia Miaomiao.

352
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,800
What's up that you are so happy?

353
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,450
What level did you get? Let me see.

354
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:44,400
- Level 8.
- Really?

355
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,860
Not bad. Not bad, not bad.

356
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,060
Under my guidance,

357
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,030
Student Miaomiao has improved dramatically.

358
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:59,620
But... you can't be arrogant. Continue to work hard, okay?

359
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,450
Okay? Here you go.

360
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,660
Thank you, Teacher.

361
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,090
Hurry and go in.

362
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,960
Oh, you're here?

363
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,720
I'm here.

364
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,980
So you haven't seen Liang Younian all this time?

365
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,500
Yeah, I thought I would see him in the art studio today.

366
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,260
Don't you have his phone number? Just call him and invite him out.

367
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,900
I don't dare to.

368
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,830
Eat your red egg.

369
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,330
Hey, you're eating my food and staying at my home, yet you still have so much to say. You can't eat any of this.

370
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,540
Okay, okay.

371
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,960
I am only saying this for your own good.

372
00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:00,670
Honestly, if you still don't have to guts to do it, he'll be leaving for college soon.

373
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,240
What do I do?

374
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,320
Go look for him.

375
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,910
Don't be scared.

376
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:24,590
You came here only to tell Senior that you passed at Level 8.

377
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,370
Can't you just call him and tell him?

378
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,100
But Senior gifted me the paint.

379
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:43,640
It's more polite to tell him in person, right?

380
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,620
You just want to see him!

381
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,060
What are you going to say when he comes in a little while?

382
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,870
Then I'll just... Then I'll just say...

383
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,500
I am here to pick up shells?

384
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,620
How can you be so shameless?!

385
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,090
Can you stop forcing me?

386
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,780
Don't force me. Don't force me anymore...

387
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,890
Xia Miaomiao.

388
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,620
Senior?

389
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,150
Senior?

390
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,960
Why are... you here?

391
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,150
I came to draw.

392
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,850
So who...

393
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,720
...made you do this?

394
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,630
My little sister.

395
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,660
My little sister is forcing me to make her a shell necklace.

396
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,580
It's part of her arts and crafts class homework for the summer.

397
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:26,260
