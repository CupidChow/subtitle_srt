A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,620
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,200
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,060
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,120
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,670
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,100
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,700
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,540
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,640
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,140
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,620
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,540
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,520
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,140
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,560
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,620
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,180
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,140
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,090
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,610
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,180
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,090
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:00,160
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,880
Episode 24

27
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,120
- You go inside first. I'll wait for you here.
- Okay.

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,370
If your mom refuses to adopt it, we'll think of another way.

29
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,940
Okay. It shouldn't be a problem.

30
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,060
Heres your change. You can keep it.

31
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,060
- Come again.
- Bye, Aunt.

32
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,320
Goodbye!

33
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,920
Mom, I'm back.

34
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,740
- What happened?
- Transfer of department.

35
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,320
Mom. You see, Yao Yao and I are at school most of the time.

36
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,610
And leave you alone at home. I think you're probably bored sometimes.

37
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,840
I was thinking that I would gift you a dog to accompany you. Look at it.

38
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,310
I was thinking that I would gift you a dog to accompany you. Look at it.

39
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,530
Xia Miao Miao, do you still treat me as your mother?

40
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,330
Why are you suddenly saying this dramatic line?

41
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,680
Of course, I treat you as my mother.

42
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,500
That's why I thought, I should give you this puppy.

43
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,820
Mom knows that you've transferred to another department.

44
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,890
When did it happen?

45
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,700
The beginning of this semester.

46
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,480
If I didn't find out about this, were you just not going to tell me?

47
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,040
- No, Mom—
- Don't call me "Mom".

48
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,470
Adopting a puppy. Transfer of departments.

49
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,750
Such serious matters and you didn't even discuss it with me beforehand?

50
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,670
When did you become so headstrong?

51
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,530
You definitely wouldn't have agreed if I had told you.

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,080
Also I'm grown up now.

53
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,460
And I have my own thoughts now.

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,060
You're right. I forgot.

55
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,960
You've grown up.

56
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,350
It's good to grow up.

57
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,430
It's true that I can't do anything about the transfer issue.

58
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,680
But Xia Miao Miao, I can at least have a say in whether we own a dog in this house, right?

59
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,410
I will tell you seriously right now.

60
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,510
You're not allowed to have a dog in my household! Send it away right now!

61
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,350
Mom, can you first let me finish what I'm saying?

62
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,990
Mom.

63
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,270
It's okay. I'll think of another idea.

64
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,800
Follow me.

65
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,330
Okay.

66
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,190
What's wrong?

67
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,370
Isn't it time to feed Nian Nian now?

68
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,190
What's going on?

69
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,880
You were scolded because of the puppy?

70
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,970
No.

71
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,920
My mom found out about my transfer off the department. She was so angry.

72
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,860
I don't know what I should do.

73
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,120
You transferred departments and you didn't even tell your mom?

74
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,630
If I told her, she definitely wouldn't have agreed.

75
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,250
Also last time, she didn't discuss with me and changed my major.

76
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,190
That's just how she is.

77
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,740
Then you should explain it to her and help her understand you.

78
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,810
My mom isn't the kind of mom that would understand me.

79
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,180
Then you can yield to her.

80
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,980
Like when she would always yield to you when you were a kid.

81
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,120
What are you doing?

82
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,410
Digging the wall?

83
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,880
The wall is a bit dirty.

84
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,410
Okay. Let's go home now. It's a little late now.

85
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,940
I have to make a dog house for Nian Nain tomorrow morning.

86
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,560
Okay. Then I'll bring it for a walk early morning tomorrow, too.

87
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,160
We've got to go now.

88
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,570
Did you text your sister to come back for dinner?

89
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,220
Yeah, I did.

90
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,960
Then why is she not home yet?

91
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,760
She must be finding a place for the puppy.

92
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,730
Because you didn't allow her.

93
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,440
Are you sure she didn't cry when she was leaving?

94
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,330
She didn't cry. There was a handsome guy waiting for her.

95
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,310
It was Mr. Liang's son.

96
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,800
Don't tell me she's dating?

97
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,860
This naughty girl. Why doesn't she tell me anything now?

98
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,190
Turn the TV's volume down for me, please. It's so annoying.

99
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,240
- Okay I'm doing it
- Annoying

100
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,640
Mom, I'm back.

101
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,600
Mom.

102
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,680
I'm sorry.

103
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,360
The thing about transferring departments, I should've discussed it with you first.

104
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,630
But I wasn't being headstrong this time.

105
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,870
I really wish to study Fashion Design.

106
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,570
To prepare for the transfer exam,

107
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,800
I haven't really slept for almost a month.

108
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,900
But it didn't feel hard at all.

109
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,460
Because I think it's something I love doing.

110
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,280
I didn't tell you because I was afraid you wouldn't agree.

111
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,810
Because I knew even if you wouldn't agree,

112
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,310
I will still transfer departments.

113
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,240
So my opinion now doesn't seem to matter all that much anymore, is that right?

114
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,540
No, Its not that.

115
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,170
It's precisely because your opinion is really important.

116
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,840
That made me afraid, that your opinion might affect my preparation for the transfer exam.

117
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,120
I was worried if I didn't pass my exam, I would've blamed you.

118
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,150
I didn't want that to happen.

119
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,770
Mom, can you stop being angry with me?

120
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,200
Xia Yao Yao, how am I going to watch the TV with low volume?

121
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,940
Turn it up.

122
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,790
All you know is to eat and not to work.

123
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,410
Trim the vegetables.

124
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,180
Okay.

125
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,440
What would you like to eat tonight? Speak, okay?

126
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,830
Don't just watch the TV.

127
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,680
Little Tuo, are you hungry? Do you want something to eat?

128
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,170
- Mom will cook for you.
- No

129
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,110
What about fruits? I'll peal a pear for you.

130
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,770
No.

131
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,780
Do you have any dirty clothes for laundry?

132
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,410
No.

133
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,080
I heard you've got into the first round of the design competition.

134
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,180
- How is the preparation going? Are you tired?
- Yeah.

135
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,930
Then... Have a good rest. I will go out first.

136
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,350
- Mom.
- Yes?

137
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,060
What's the matter?

138
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,920
Have you heard from my father?

139
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,310
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

140
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,670
Did your father contact you?

141
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,590
- Did he—
- No, he didn't. It just came to my mind all of a sudden.

142
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,350
Your father is busy doing business out there.

143
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,350
He has no time to contact us. Let's not disturb him.

144
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,110
Then, I will go out first.

145
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,040
Put it to the side.

146
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,600
How long will it take to finish that shirt?

147
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,330
I'm still waiting for you to make clothes for my doll.

148
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,890
Don't worry. I'm sure I'll finish this by tonight.

149
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,360
Who is that for?

150
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,640
Is it for the senior I saw last time?

151
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,950
You're just a little kid. Why do you have to know so much?

152
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,860
I don't want to know that much, either.

153
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,020
It's tacky to give homemade clothes.

154
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,860
- Is that tacky?
- Yes.

155
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,830
Come and eat some fruits.

156
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,240
Thank you, Mom.

157
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,270
- Hello.
-  I'm at the alley near your house.

158
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,240
Come out. I have something to discuss.

159
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,760
Okay. Wait a moment.

160
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,570
Mom, my classmate is looking for me. I have to go out for a while.

161
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,680
You don't have to tell me so much, I can't control it anyway.

162
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,360
What does that say?

163
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,690
Can you see clearly?

164
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,080
Yes, I can.

165
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,690
But he is not Mr. Liang's eldest son, who sent her home last time.

166
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,120
He is Mr. Liang's second son.

167
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,750
This silly girl.

168
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,450
Making clothes from good material.

169
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,050
It is hard to keep a daughter at home.

170
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:38,950
I'm sorry about that. My mum and sister are too excessive.

171
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,470
Why were you looking for me?

172
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,480
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

173
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,950
You're not going to ask me to help you do something bad, are you?

174
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,660
Lin Kaituo.

175
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,560
What's the matter?

176
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,960
My dad is back.

177
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,470
That's a good thing.

178
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,530
Xin Xin told me me that you've always wished for your dad to come back.

179
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,750
What's actually going on?

180
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:34,250
But it seems like he doesn't want to see me.

181
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,420
When I was a kid,

182
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,190
there was a time when my dad was out in the sea for more than half a year.

183
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:58,660
The day that he came back, I kept on hiding behind the door and didn't dare to come out and meet him.

184
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,780
It had been a long time since I saw him,

185
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,690
so it was normal to feel strange towards him.

186
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,430
After my parents got divorced, my dad disappeared from my life.

187
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:24,030
I kept comforting myself that Dad was out for work.

188
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,360
He didn't want to disturb us, but he really wanted to see me.

189
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:38,270
But when I saw him this time, he didn't even want to tell me his phone number.

190
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,740
It just makes me feel...

191
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,950
If I don't take the initiative to find him now...

192
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,220
It'll get...

193
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,440
Don't look at me with sympathetic eyes.

194
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,380
I'm not. I really didn't look at you sympathetically.

195
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,810
Why would I look at you with sympathy?

196
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,530
I just... had an eye surgery before,

197
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,350
and my eyes aren't that good.

198
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,880
It's true. My eyes had no sympathy at all just then.

199
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:29,480
My eyes just then... were heartless.

200
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,720
They are quite heartless indeed.

201
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:49,510
I think that if you really miss your dad,

202
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,300
you should go look for him.

203
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,550
Just think of it as yielding to him this time.

204
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,130
Could you give my dad a call for me?

205
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,440
Me?

206
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,590
That delivery man that you and Lin Xia wanted to complain about,

207
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,860
named Lin Wei Guo, is my dad.

208
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,580
Hello. Good Day.

209
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,300
Hello. I received the express you delivered,

210
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,220
but the stuff inside was broken.

211
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,050
Did you want to go through the return procedure?

212
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,890
Yes, at around 10 a.m. tomorrow.

213
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,440
Please pick the goods up near Haicheng University Lake. Is that okay?

214
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,820
Yeah, That's fine.

215
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,940
Senior.

216
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,060
This... is for you.

217
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,510
Last time I got your shirt dirty.

218
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,790
So I made a new one for you.

219
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,550
I don't know whether you'll like it.

220
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,440
Thank you. I like it very much.

221
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,260
Where is the puppy? You didn't bring it here for a walk?

222
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:45,330
Isn't the puppy here?

223
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,370
The puppy's gone?

224
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,240
You search near the seafood market. I will search near our campus.

225
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,920
Okay

226
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,790
Dad.

227
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,030
Little Tuo, why are you here?

228
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,840
I'm here to look for you. The person who called you yesterday is my classmate.

229
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,930
I see.

230
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,810
The package won't need to be returned then, right?

231
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,850
I still have other things I need to do. Anyway, you already have my phone number.

232
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,570
Let's keep in contact.

233
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,290
Don't leave in a hurry just yet!

234
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:24,080
I want to ask you some questions. It won't take up too much of your time.

235
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:28,790
Little Tuo, that's not what I meant.

236
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,740
Didn't you say that you went somewhere else in the country to do business?

237
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,050
When did you return to Haicheng?

238
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,880
Why are you delivering packages?

239
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,910
I've been back for only a few days. Some problems occurred with my business,

240
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,040
so I found a temporary job to do.

241
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,650
Why did you have to lie to me last time?

242
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,670
I...

243
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:12,120
I still have to deliver my packages. I'll slowly explain it to you later.

244
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,760
Dad, tell me now.

245
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,670
Little Tuo, I'll explain it clearly to you later!

246
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,180
Explain it clearly now!

247
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,690
- Little Tuo!
- Dad!

248
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:22,120
- Go back to class.
- Tell me!

249
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,400
- I'll tell you. Don't worry about it yet.
- What's really going on?

250
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,590
I will tell...

251
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,830
Dad!

252
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,830
Help! Someone fell in the water!

253
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,410
Call 120( 911)! Hurry up and call! Hurry up and call!

254
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,710
Help! Someone fell in the water!

255
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,820
Is Uncle okay?

256
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,880
The school nurse says he's all right now,

257
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,410
but he still needs to stay at the hospital and be checked for a while.

258
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,590
I'll stay at the dorm tonight. I won't come home.

259
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,200
I'll tell Aunt.

260
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,050
- That...
- I know.

261
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,190
I won't let Aunt know what happened.

262
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,420
How's you foot now?

263
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,510
It's already been taken care of.

264
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,450
You didn't injure your bones or whatever, right?

265
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,130
I didn't. I just scraped some skin off.

266
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,480
That's good then.

267
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,890
Then I'm going to head home.

268
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,520
Thank you.

269
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,390
What did you say?

270
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,070
Shut up.

271
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,270
This is your attitude towards your lifesaver?

272
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,880
Get out.

273
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:36,230
Pick either "Lifesaver" or "Brother" to call me.

274
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,380
When did he change his clothes?

275
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:18,430
Senior. Where did you go? Why is your phone turned off?

276
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,670
Have you found Nian Nian?

277
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,690
My phone turned off after water got into it.

278
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,440
I haven't found anything about Nian Nian. Have you?

279
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,920
I couldn't find him, either.

280
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,340
My sister just called me telling me to come home for a surprise.

281
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,560
But I found no one when I came back here.

282
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:43,560
Senior... You're wearing...

283
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,150
A little accident happened earlier and my clothes got all wet.

284
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,370
So I changed into the shirt that you gave me.

285
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,920
What happened? Are you all right?

286
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,690
I'm fine. I just got splashed with water by some people upstairs.

287
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:06,470
This shirt looks really great on you.

288
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,760
It's a parent child outfit.

289
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:08,700
Senior... I'm sorry. I was out all day today.

290
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,890
And my mom must have used the rest of the cloth to make all these.

291
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,140
I'm really sorry.

292
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,420
It's all right.

293
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,580
Also I wasn't aware my mom brought Nian Nian home.

294
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,340
Sorry for wasting your time to look for it.

295
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,620
Since Nian Nian has been found, I'll get going now.

296
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,130
Don't go. I've only just started preparing lunch for you.

297
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,200
Stay for lunch and then go, okay? Try my cooking.

298
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,340
Aunt, I...

299
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,730
I'm sorry but I have to go home for something else.

300
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,980
I might have to try your cooking next time.

301
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,250
Is that so? Then you must remember to come next time.

302
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,440
Okay. Thank you, Aunt.

303
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,480
I'll see him off.

304
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,490
So Mom, you like the older brother?

305
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,630
The older brother is quite nice. He looks so kind.

306
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,920
He's just like our family.

307
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,920
What are you talking about?

308
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,290
You won't understand even if I told you.

309
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,760
Oh, my goodness.

310
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,600
Terrace Classroom

311
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,090
First of all, I want to congratulate everyone sitting here. Everyone...

312
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,530
Why didn't you pick up my call?

313
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,730
- Call me back when you see this.
 - According to the school's requirements,

314
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:44,320
before the final competition, we need to hold two weeks of...

315
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,850
I want to be able to contact you right now.

316
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,950
I don't approve of the school gathering that everyone is up to train.

317
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,000
Architecture is a form of art.

318
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,920
How can you gather everyone up to train a form of art?

319
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,780
Teacher, why did we come here then?

320
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,530
You're the only troublemaker.

321
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,520
We're just running through the procedures.

322
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,880
Everyone, open your books.

323
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,520
I'll introduce some previous works that you should definitely look to for reference.

324
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,250
First, flip to page 43 in your books.

325
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,550
Look at "The Vertical Village."

326
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,210
Then, flip to page 57 in your books.

327
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,770
Look at "The Big box Landscape".

328
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,860
Then flip to page 73 in your books.

329
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,260
Let's look at "Urban Lens".

330
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,180
You guys are all people who have entered the finals.

331
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,590
There's no need for me to analyze these works to you.

332
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:44,070
Everyone should learn from these works, and really try to get a good grasp of them.

333
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:48,370
Look at how they have combined art and functionality together.

334
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:52,280
I can only help you all up to here. With the rest of the time, self-study.

335
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,210
I still need to grade the first year's homework.

336
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,360
All right, self-study now.

337
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,430
Dad

338
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,620
Why are you here again?

339
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:40,200
I didn't come to look for you. I came to look for Younian.

340
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,940
Right?

341
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,880
Who are you? I don't know you.

342
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,280
Then I'm actually here to look for Kaituo.

343
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,040
He says he knows you. Here you go then.

344
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,360
I also don't know you.

345
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,160
You guys made up?!

346
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,310
Can you be a bit quieter?

347
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:24,270
Don't affect other people studying.

348
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,720
You two give me a reasonable explanation.

349
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,910
You didn't even tell me?

350
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,500
You two reconciled yet I wasn't even notified.

351
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,870
Do you even consider me a brother?

352
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:49,190
- I'm mad.
- Continue being mad then.

353
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,250
I also think you should continue to be mad.

354
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:55,780
Great, you guys are already ganging up to bully me.

355
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

356
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,880
You guys have finally reconciled after so much difficulty.

357
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,270
The three of us can start playing basketball together again.

358
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,750
Say, is it true that ever since that intercollegiate competition in high school,

359
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,730
we haven't played together again?

360
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,750
How about we go play now to celebrate? How about it?

361
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,520
- No.
- No.

362
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,180
Why aren't you going?

363
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,320
I have to prepare for the competition.

364
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,730
Competition. Competition, competition.

365
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,130
You're busy preparing for the competition all day and night.

366
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,150
Is there a cash award?

367
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,780
- Yes.
- ¥20,000.

368
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,740
¥20,000? ($3,000 USD)

369
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,180
How about you guys invest that cash reward into my business?

370
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,580
I never invest in non-profitable businesses.

371
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,550
Who said I don't profit?

372
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,700
You think I don't profit?

373
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,530
Fine, don't invest in it.

374
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,820
- I'm not wrong dude.
- Hey!

375
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,250
The classroom is being disinfected.

376
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,770
The school wants us in a boot camp and now the classroom is close.

377
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,740
What's wrong with them?

378
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:10,240
I heard there's a flu going around recently.

379
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,100
I don't know what they're disinfecting.

380
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,220
Then let's go in first.

381
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,080
We can leave when they come disinfect it.

382
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,410
- There's someone inside.
- No, I was the one who closed it.

383
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,910
I just saw something inside move.

384
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,420
Brother, let's go play basketball. Come on, let's go play.

385
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,580
Yes, yes, basketball is your—

386
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,320
There's definitely someone inside.

387
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,950
- What are you doing?
- It doesn't matter.

388
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,020
Basketball is most important. Let's go.

389
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,130
We haven't played in so long.

390
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:53,270
Xia Miaomiao, you better disinfect quickly.

391
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,710
Hurry, hurry, we're running out of time.

392
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:21,030
I feel like the scenario earlier was a bit strange.

393
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,200
I feel like the scenario earlier was a bit strange.

394
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,690
What's strange?

395
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,930
They've reconciled!

396
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,370
No way.

397
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:35,660
Our Kaituo was actually so generous to forgive Liang Younian?

398
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,030
Then he can definitely forgive me.

399
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,120
Since I only acted liked a cripple.

400
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,860
Senior didn't even do anything wrong, what was there to forgive?

401
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,310
Xinxin, did you bring thumbtacks?

402
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,580
I have to pin these up.

403
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,800
I know where to buy it, I'll go.

404
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,040
You, come here and take a look at the positioning.

405
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,380
Big Brother Chen, why are you taking so long to get a drink?

406
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,600
Hurry up, we still need to ambush him.

407
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,220
What's the use of rushing?

408
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,970
Since we can't enter the campus grounds, let's go have lunch first.

409
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,460
If we get a chance to sneak in in the afternoon,

410
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,530
we'll just go directly to the Architecture Department to wait.

411
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,640
You have so many excuses to be lazy.

412
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:22,500
What's the name of Lin Wei Guo's son? I forgot it again.

413
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,370
Lin Kaituo.

414
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,530
Later, you'll be in charge of scaring him.

415
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:38,130
I'll be in charge of taking the footage and sending it to Lin Wei Guo.

416
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,680
Okay, don't get so much.

417
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,620
Boss, ring these up for me.

418
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,630
And two of these.

419
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,120
Why is Liang Younain so bothersome?

420
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,320
He has to have a designated brand for tea.

421
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,450
The school supermarket is out of stock and we even have to go off campus to get it for him.

422
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,770
We came out already anyway, why are still speaking so much nonsense?

423
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,010
Just where do they sell it?

424
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:05,870
There's another supermarket in front there. If they don't have it either, then I have no idea.

425
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,760
Let's get going then, I'm so thirsty.

426
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,820
What are you in such a rush for?

427
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,870
So stingy, you only let me buy a bottle of water.

428
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,630
What are you in such a rush for?

429
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,550
What are you doing?

430
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,940
You have to pay for the drinks today, let me tell you.

431
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:40,600
Senior Dachao, you came to pick me up, right?

432
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,590
Senior Dachao? Did she just call my name?

433
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,520
Why did she drag him away?

434
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,090
Wait for me!

435
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,500
I was so frightened earlier.

436
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,780
S-Sorry. It was an emergency just now.

437
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,520
What are you two doing? Didn't you just call my name?

438
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,370
Yeah, what exactly is going on?

439
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:21,590
What do you mean? I can't listen?

440
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,010
You two have a little secret?

441
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,030
No.

442
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,440
It's okay, just say it.

443
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:34,660
I just went to buy thumbtacks and I heard two people said they wanted to ambush you.

444
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,360
It seems like it's something to do with your dad.

445
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,320
What are you doing? You want to go fight?

446
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,600
I can't get in touch with my dad right now. I need to ask about the situation.

447
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,440
Fine, I'll go with you.

448
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,250
Then I'll come, too.

449
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,610
Don't come.

450
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,740
You don't even know what those two guys look like.

451
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,980
You need to bring me with you.

452
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,280
It seems like they've already left.

453
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,200
She's obviously scared yet she's still pretending.

454
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,850
Then what do we do now?

455
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,490
Nothing. If we can't find them, then just drop the matter.

456
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:36,320
It means it wasn't meant to be, so don't force it, right?

457
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,450
Then if there's nothing else, you should head back first.

458
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,770
Xia Miaomiao, don't tell Hexin about this matter.

459
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,150
She'll make a big fuss out of nothing.

460
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,870
Okay.

461
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:56,730
A Little Thing Called First Love

462
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,180
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

463
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,990
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

464
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:21,370
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

465
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:27,060
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

466
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:30,890
♫ My heart... ♫

467
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:43,430
♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

468
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:55,520
♫ I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

469
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,460
♫ Regarding what love feels like ♫

470
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,600
♫ I've only heard about it from friends ♫

471
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,700
♫ I never thought about when it would be my turn ♫

472
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,930
♫ You are so dazzling and outstanding ♫

473
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:18,030
♫ I'm just a faint breeze blowing ♫

474
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:23,900
♫ But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

475
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,980
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,720
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

477
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:36,200
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

478
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,810
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

479
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:45,670
♫ My heart... ♫

00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:56,800
A Little Thing Called First Love
