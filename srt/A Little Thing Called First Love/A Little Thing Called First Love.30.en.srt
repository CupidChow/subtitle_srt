00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,620
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,110
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,040
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,170
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,620
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,110
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,970
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,580
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,550
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,490
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,030
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,560
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,630
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,590
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,190
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,560
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,540
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,130
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,060
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,050
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,660
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,120
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,860
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,990
♫  Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

26
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,650
Episode 30

27
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,660
This competition, your main disadvantage is that

28
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,120
the size and ratio of the section view are not appropriate.

29
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,840
When you draw pictures, your biggest problem is that you rush too much.

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,820
It might have something to do with your personality.

31
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,520
If you are not skilled with fundamental things and just want to be fast,

32
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,970
it's not the right route. Do you understand?

33
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,770
I understand.

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,570
Also...

35
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,370
What are you doing?

36
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,470
I was worried that the roll-up banner might hit you. Don't over think it.

37
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,270
You must have watched too many TV shows.

38
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,050
This kind of thing...

39
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,930
even if it hits me, would it hurt?

40
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,750
Kaituo, what are you doing?

41
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,330
Miss, I just saw the promotion of your activity.

42
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,360
When the art club borrowed the model classroom of the architecture department,

43
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,350
is it for this activity?

44
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,660
Yes. We are working together with the art club.

45
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,230
We are painting some coloring books for kids.

46
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,730
It's very meaningful.

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,720
“A charity campaign that everyone should join.”

48
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,450
"Everybody can be part of it."

49
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,880
It's good. Hey, Miss.

50
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,340
I want to do my share, too.

51
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,480
How can I participate?

52
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,310
Teacher, as long as you give the item that you want to donate

53
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,440
to the news club, we will pack them

54
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,760
and send them to places where they are needed.

55
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,390
The detailed form of where these items go

56
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,500
will be published on the school newspaper.

57
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,930
Oh, I se. Then what do you need the most?

58
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,560
Normally things like clothes and stationery.

59
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,930
Okay. I will give you some children's clothes.

60
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,190
Thank you, Teacher.

61
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,270
Do you have any requirement for things that are donated?

62
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,360
Good looking and comfortable then.

63
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,820
Kids like good looking clothes.

64
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,890
Good looking?

65
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,140
I don't know what kids like.

66
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,630
This... I might even need an advisor.

67
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,540
Teacher, I'll go first.

68
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,370
Okay, you can go.

69
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,320
Why are you so polite all a sudden?

70
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,590
Thank you, Miss. Thanks.

71
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,100
Where are you? I'm already waiting for you by the lake.

72
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,850
Let's go to the model classroom together to paint the coloring books.

73
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,090
Okay. I'll be there in a minute.

74
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,100
I'm here.

75
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,760
Let's go quickly.

76
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,010
Hello, take a look.

77
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,990
All of our clothes are made of pure cotton.

78
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,070
They are very comfortable and they won't stretch no matter how you wash them.

79
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,500
How can pure cotton not stretch? I know by touching that they have 5% spandex.

80
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,650
How about other styles?

81
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,220
This one looks good. Pretty elegant.

82
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,140
Teacher Li! What do you think of this one?

83
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,320
It's good.

84
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,080
Then 20 for each size.

85
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,890
Okay.

86
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,470
Miss, do we have any discount if we buy so many?

87
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,920
Sorry, we don't have any discount.

88
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,560
Okay. We'll go somewhere else then.

89
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,030
Wait a second. I'll call my boss to ask about it.

90
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,310
Then thank you for your hard work.

91
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,590
I never thought that our Chief Lin would be so generous.

92
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,990
Would my buying so many make you become broke?

93
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,530
I just got my paycheck yesterday.

94
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,820
Look! I should have enough for 200.

95
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,060
What are you bragging about? 200?

96
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,510
So the salary for Chief of the department is so much different from our teaching assistants?

97
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,430
I am earning money with my ability.

98
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,240
Then what's the monthly paycheck for a high school teacher?

99
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,830
Why are you asking this?

100
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,430
I'm concerned.

101
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,970
I'm wondering if the salary of Teacher Lu and myself can hold up a family.

102
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,450
Then should I raise both of you?

103
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,050
Lu Peng never gives me the rent.

104
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,120
He eats and drinks my things and he acts like he is part of me.

105
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,900
Then it wouldn't work. How can you live with your uncle after getting married?

106
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,170
He should live with me.

107
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,180
You... are so brave.

108
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,230
You dare to marry him. Do you know how stingy Lu Peng is?

109
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,660
He uses my money to eat and buy clothes and other things.

110
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,370
Even when he goes to the swimming pool of Haicheng University, he goes to the public one.

111
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,670
I think he would not necessarily let you spend his money even if he has it.

112
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,730
Wait a second. Are you saying that

113
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,780
he goes to the swimming pool of our Haicheng University?

114
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,730
Right. He will never go to any place that he needs to pay.

115
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,900
Then what is his money for?

116
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,650
Financial Management.

117
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,880
Awesome! He knows how to save for a family!

118
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,770
- How is it?
- Our boss agreed.

119
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,250
Thank you so much!

120
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,400
Miaomiao!

121
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,040
Morning.

122
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,870
Senior Sister? Hello.

123
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,570
Hello.

124
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,500
Oh, Senior. What do you plan to paint on your coloring book?

125
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,870
I plan to do twelve Chinese zodiacs first.

126
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,240
Twelve Chinese zodiacs?

127
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,650
Then why don't I do the twelve horoscopes?

128
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,420
Okay. Keep working!

129
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,190
Come on!

130
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,940
I remembered that I have brought it.

131
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,610
Senior. For you. I have a lot.

132
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,390
Thank you.

133
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,720
Junior said that he has a lot—

134
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,600
Come back next time!

135
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
How is it, Teacher Jia? Have you counted everything?

136
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,600
Almost.

137
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,400
Waitress, send it back to Haicheng University in a minute.

138
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,200
Sorry, we don't provide a delivery service.

139
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,000
We have more than 200. How do you expect us to take them back?

140
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,800
I'll call and complain about you.

141
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,300
No.

142
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If you don't mind, after I go off work and settle my kids,

143
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,400
I'll deliver it for you.

144
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,200
The weather forecast says that it might rain.

145
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,500
If you don't want to wet the case, I'll send it tomorrow.

146
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,600
How about this?

147
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,400
I'll ask a few students to help me.

148
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Okay. Thank you very much.

149
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,900
I will send a message in the chat group and more than a dozen students might come.

150
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,600
You find a few small cases and put the clothes in.

151
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,800
When they come, they can deliver them separately.

152
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,400
Okay.

153
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,200
Your architecture students are more hard-working than our designing students.

154
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,600
Or is it because you are the chief?

155
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,300
I'm not that lucky. They never come when I ask them to help.

156
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,200
How many students did you say?

157
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,000
Where are all the others? Why is it just you?

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,400
Others are pretending that they didn't see it.

159
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,600
You don't look so active yourself.

160
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
Didn't Shen Kai say that he is going to come?

161
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,800
He suddenly had something to do.

162
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Teacher Li, do you want me to carry it or not? I'll go if not.

163
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,700
Carry, carry.

164
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,400
To the newspaper club?

165
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,800
- Yes. To that...
- He Xin?

166
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,400
Right. He Xin. Give it to her.

167
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,400
Teacher Jia, don't move. Let me do it.

168
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Senior, are you mad?

169
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm wrong. I'll only use your pens from now on.

170
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Senior, just turn back and look at me.

171
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,400
- Xia Miaomiao.
- Yes?

172
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,300
Come and help me take things from my pocket.

173
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,000
Hurry.

174
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
What is it?

175
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,200
What's in the pocket?

176
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,600
There is nothing.

177
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,000
You are lying to me. There is nothing in your pocket.

178
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,700
I do have something. But it's in the other pocket.

179
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,800
One, two, three, four.

180
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,400
Thank you. What is it?

181
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,200
Two hundred children's clothes from Teacher Li Sichen.

182
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,400
Okay. Put it on the floor. I'll count it later.

183
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,600
You can go if you are done carrying it.

184
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,900
Aren't you going to count it? I'll go after you have counted it.

185
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,500
It's up to you.

186
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,600
It's going to rain. Do you have an umbrella?

187
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,800
There is no need for your help.

188
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,200
You can go. It's going to rain.

189
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,800
It's been so many times.

190
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,200
When I say that I don't need your help, it means that I don't need your help.

191
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,600
Which word do you not understand?

192
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Okay. Put them together yourself.

193
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,500
I'll help even if it's a stranger in this kind of situation.

194
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,200
Don't worry. If I worry about you again, I'll write my name backward.

195
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,500
Your name has nothing to do with me.

196
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,400
But don't shelter the rain with my poster.

197
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,400
Keep cleaning up, or all of your posters will be wet.

198
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Everybody is gone. Why are you standing so far away?

199
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,670
Give it to me.

200
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:56,020
♫ This familiar melody ♫

201
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:01,250
♫ I want to hide you in my embrace ♫

202
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,360
♫ Holding your hands and go traveling ♫

203
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,230
♫ And the time is pausing just like that ♫

204
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,540
♫ I want to live in your heart on the left side ♫

205
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:21,100
♫ I want to talk to you until the sunrise ♫

What is it?

212
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,990
Somebody is there.

213
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,860
♫ We won't be afraid of losing our directions ♫

♫ I want to live in your heart on the left side ♫

215
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,860
This way, they won't be able to see us.

216
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,750
♫ I want to talk to you until the sunrise ♫

217

♫ I want to see the sunset with you ♫

221
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,740
♫ The wish that we make together and the wilderness that we experience together ♫

00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,780
♫ We won't be afraid of losing our directions ♫

223
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:41,340
♫ The wish that we make together and the wilderness that we experience together ♫

♫ We won't be afraid of losing our directions ♫

List of exchange students from Haicheng University to Birmingham City University

226
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,850
Freshman, sophomore or junior students of undergraduates or freshman or sophomore of graduate students

227
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,520
Miaomiao, have you seen the notice from the department?

228
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,380
Xia Miaomiao!

229
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,000
What are you doing?

230
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,300
- We held hands!
- No way!

231
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,910
You are so awesome!

232
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,960
Chubby Xia! Can you lower your voice?

233
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,260
I know. Go back to sleep.

234
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,330
Really?

235
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,480
How do you feel holding hands?

236
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,510
Just...

237
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,380
Very real.

238
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,810
What do you mean, very real?

239
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:02,200
Actually, I always think that the senior might be crazy.

240
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,180
But after today, I realized that

241
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:10,450
I'm really together with him.

242
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:14,230
Look how happy you are! I have good news for you.

243
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,910
- Our department has positions for exchange students to go to Britain, too!
- Pardon?

244
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,100
Really?

245
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,680
Can you lower your voices?

246
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,800
Go back to sleep.

247
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,000
Haicheng University

248
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,060
Morning, Seniors.

249
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,110
- Morning.
- Senior, why are you here so early?

250
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,930
Early?

251
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,030
Senior, how much have you painted?

252
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,350
One.

253
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,030
You are doing it so fast. I have only painted most of the first book.

254
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,250
Senior, do you have any tricks for painting so fast?

255
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,860
Not really.

256
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,860
Girls' Dorm

257
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,830
Are you waiting for me?

258
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,420
I know that you are busy painting the coloring book, so I painted one as well.

259
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:08,700
See if it would work. If it works, I'll keep painting for you.

260
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,490
You always think about yourself as an artist. When did you become so modest?

261
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,060
You said that you like low-key.

262
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,910
Tell me if it works. I'll keep painting if it does.

263
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,260
It's good. You are so much better than me.

264
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,660
Then I'll go back to keep painting.

265
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,330
Where are you going?

266
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,550
I‘m going back to my dorm.

267
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,780
Let's go to the modeling classroom together. Everybody is there.

268
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,120
Modeling classroom?

269
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,660
Did you just say that you are going to be low-key?

270
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,780
To the modeling classroom.

271
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,310
Let's go.

272
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,340
Senior, I have brought this.

273
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:26,060
Senior, what is that?

274
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,180
Antipyretic paste. (Anti-fever)

275
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,450
Are you uncomfortable, Senior? Do you have a fever?

276
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,560
This is to wake you up.

277
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,490
Wake you up? Does it work?

278
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,850
I'll buy it and try sometime.

279
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,750
You can try this.

280
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,700
- Thank you, Senior.
- It's okay.

281
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:01,780
Senior, the antipyretic paste seems to be working.

282
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,390
Oh, Senior. I have another question for you.

283
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,960
We have the tie-dyeing class this semester, but I'm not doing very well.

284
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,490
I heard from Teacher Jia Yin that

285
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,840
you were attending the tie-dyeing class as an auditor before you transferred to the department.

286
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,480
And you were doing great. Senior, how did you do it?

287
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,370
I don't really remember.

288
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,680
It's a little sour.

289
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:35,450
Senior, do you have time to instruct me?

290
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,430
Is somebody asking our Miaomiao to instruct him?

291
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:47,100
- This looks familiar. Would it be—
- It wouldn't.

292
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,430
He is a junior student.

293
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:54,290
Junior student? Just like a little brother, nothing more, right?

294
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:03,100
It feels really familiar. Right, Liang Younian?

295
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,070
You are so loud. I'm going somewhere else.

296
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,970
Take your things and come to the rooftop to draw.

297
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,780
Where are they?

298
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,330
Teacher Lu!

299
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,430
I thought Li Sicheng was lying to me. You are really swimming here!

300
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,780
It's so coincidental, Teacher Jia.

301
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,510
Here is the water for you.

302
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,080
Thank you.

303
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,480
Do you want anything?

304
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:22,050
Last time you promised to come to the cultural week.

305
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:27,020
But Li Sicheng said that you had something emergency and couldn't make it. Is it true?

306
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:33,030
I had some parents come to visit me that day, so I didn't come. Sorry.

307
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:38,450
It's okay. It's just that there is an accident every time.

308
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:44,840
So I think we shouldn't pick the day. I'm here to ask you if you have time for dinner today.

309
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,650
Dinner?

310
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,490
Swimming trunks.

311
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:58,490
Our relationship begins with swimming trunks.

312
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:04,010
I just remembered it. I still have exam papers to grade in my office,

313
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,710
so I can't have dinner with you. I'll go to work.

314
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,030
Are you not swimming then?

315
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,150
The... the swimming pool is so cold. I won't do it today.

316
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,030
- Cold?
- Yes.

317
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:07,100
Senior, I want to draw a straight line. Please hold the ruler.

318
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,160
Okay.

319
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,310
Draw.

320
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,770
What are you two doing here?

321
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,840
Drawing pictures.

322
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,440
I'm going to clean the lawn. You should go.

323
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,130
Okay.

324
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,620
Wait a second. You carried this desk upstairs, right?

325
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,570
Take it down.

326
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,070
Don't put it up here anymore.

327
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,300
You are messing with the grass.

328
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,460
Then we should draw, back in the modeling classroom.

329
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,410
No.

330
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,850
Put it down. I got this.

331
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,440
It's okay. I can do it.

332
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:42,110
But your boyfriend wants to carry it for you. Can't he?

333
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,670
Thank you, Senior.

334
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,370
I don't believe that this whole school, other than the patio,

335
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,800
has no place for us to hide.

336
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,020
I will find it.

337
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,640
Since you don't like me,

338
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,000
why didn't you just say it clearly earlier?

339
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,860
Actually, I didn't find a good time to say it.

340
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,950
Actually, I didn't find a good time to say it.

341
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,840
Sorry.

342
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,350
Don't say sorry to me.

343
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:38,960
If you have told me earlier, I wouldn't pursue you like that.

344
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,500
I'm really busy, okay?

345
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:46,300
I-I'm not.

346
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,890
I don't know how to refuse a girl.

347
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,190
I understand.

348
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,710
An outgoing girl like me

349
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,320
is not bearable for most men.

350
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,090
Actually, you—

351
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:12,760
Don't say things to me like, "Actually you're really good. It's just that we're not a good fit."

352
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,930
It's so cheesy.

353
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,670
Actually, you are really good.

354
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:28,750
But somethings, your nerves are too thick.

355
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,030
Don't you know that my uncle has always liked you?

356
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,790
Hey!

357
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,920
If you have something to say, just say it nicely! Don't accuse me!

358
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,150
Is it that bad?

359
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:45,750
- My uncle—
- Stop it!

360
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:50,070
I'm really miserable. Can you say some good things?

361
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:57,130
Let's go. I'll buy you dinner. Is it good enough?

362
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,630
Let's go.

363
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,350
You go first.

364
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,750
You first.

365
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:29,260
The swim classes have not started yet. It should be pretty empty before the classes start.

366
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,670
Oh, my god! I have never been here.

367
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,790
It's so big.

368
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,900
Let's keep drawing here.

369
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,150
I'll bring a table here.

370
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,910
Do you train here normally, Senior?

371
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,770
Do you know how to swim?

372
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:59,370
Yes. My dad is a sailor.

373
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,570
So he likes to take us to the sea to swim.

374
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:06,270
Then is Uncle not home a lot?

375
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:14,600
I haven't seen him for six months.

376
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,710
I really miss him.

377
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,390
Actually, we have been separated for many times.

378
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,060
But I've never gotten used to it.

379
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,380
Every time he leaves,

380
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,820
my sister and I were depressed for days.

381
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:40,500
I will only be separated from you this once. I'll be right back.

382
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:46,760
Maybe we don't have to separate at all.

383
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:54,390
Our department has quotas for exchange students in Britain. I'm going to apply for it.

384
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,990
- Really?
- Yes.

385
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:01,590
Then I will collect all of my IELTS materials and give them to you.
 (International English Testing System)

386
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,610
Good luck to you!

387
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:06,410
It's a deal then!

I was going to help you tie your shoes.

392
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,190
What did you say?

393
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:48,470
I... I-I didn't have ulterior motives.
