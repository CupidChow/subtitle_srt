A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,600
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,200
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,200
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,200
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,600
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,600
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,200
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,600
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,200
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,000
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,800
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,200
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,200
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,600
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,200
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,200
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,200
A Little Thing Called First Love
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,900
Episode 7

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

28
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,400
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:28,000
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,600
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,500
♫ My heart... ♫

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,400
♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,400
♫ My heart restlessly beats ♫

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,000
Xia Miaomiao.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,200
Is this enough?

36
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,800
That's enough.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Thank you, Senior.

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,800
If you didn't help me,

39
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,500
I don't even know when I would've been finished.

40
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,000
My sister would've surely had a fit if there's not enough when I went home.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,700
How old... is your sister?

42
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,800
She's a little kid. She's still in elementary school.

43
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,740
What do you usually do when elementary schoolers have fits?

44
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,600
If Yaoyao has a fit,

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
my mom will usually not go against her for a moment

46
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,400
and later, she'll try to explain what she did wrong when her temper has passed.

47
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,600
But if it's really serious, my mom will just hit her.

48
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Then is there a way without any hitting,

49
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,000
a way without using force?

50
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,290
A way without using force?

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,200
Try a radical method.

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,400
For example, when Yaoyao didn't like eating bitter melons,

53
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,000
my mom would purposely not let her eat them and that made her want to eat it very much.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Little kids are all like that.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,400
The more you want them to do something, the more they want to resist.

56
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,700
If you want them to do this, they insist on doing that.

57
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,600
Senior, why are you asking?

58
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,400
My relative has a kid that's hard to take care of.

59
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,650
Senior.

60
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,000
What's up? Are you not feeling well?

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,400
- Can you first promise me that you won't laugh later?
- What?

62
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,800
- Can you first promise me that you won't laugh later?
- What?

63
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,600
You said you wouldn't laugh.

64
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,000
How did it get hooked to it?

65
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,400
I couldn't find the scissors

66
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,400
so I thought I'll just bite off the string with my teeth.

67
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,000
Then it just got hooked onto my braces.

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,200
Don't worry, let me take a look.

69
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,300
No, it'll hurt if you pull.

70
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,200
How can I help then?

71
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's go to the hospital.

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,600
What are you laughing at?

73
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,800
Don't worry, I'll find a way.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Don't worry, we're almost there.

75
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,800
Student, it's you again. How come you always come here in a hurry?

76
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,200
We were closing and your friend here wouldn't let us close.

77
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,000
Our doctors need to rest, too.

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,900
Take away your hands so I can examine it.

79
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,100
I won't laugh. Take your hands away.

80
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,900
I will examine it thoroughly.

81
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,000
Open your mouth.

82
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,200
There's good news and bad news.

83
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,400
- Which do you want to hear first?
- Pardon?

84
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,600
And then, the doctor said,

85
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,000
"There's good news and bad news. Which do you want to hear first?"

86
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I said, “I'll listen to the bad news first.”

87
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,800
He said, "Since your braces got pulled, they are now deformed."

88
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,500
So I thought, "That's the end of me. My mom will kill me since the braces were so expensive."

89
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,400
Then he said, "Do you want to listen to the good news?"

90
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,300
I said, "T-Tell me."

91
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,400
Guess what he said? He said I can take my braces off!

92
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,800
Really? So you already got your braces taken off?

93
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes!

94
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,200
Can't you notice by how I'm talking now?

95
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,800
Okay, bye-bye.

96
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,000
Senior.

97
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,700
I am sorry.

98
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:31,300
He Xin called you but I was on the phone the whole time.

99
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,800
It's okay.

100
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,800
He Xin only called me to find Kaituo,

101
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,300
but it's the first time I've seen you so...

102
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
...so lively.

103
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,600
Senior?

104
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,140
Can you wait for me for a bit?

105
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,000
Senior, thank you for today.

106
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,400
You're welcome.

107
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,380
The rent for the place.

108
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,800
House for Rent

109
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Who said you could come into my room?

110
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,100
Who said this is your room?

111
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,000
Thirty.

112
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,810
If we remove your bed, the length is enough for me to put in a workstation.

113
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,400
Liang Younian, what are you trying to do?

114
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,500
What do you think I want to do?

115
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,400
Since I am planning on being an architect,

116
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,320
I will need a workroom.

117
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,560
Your room seems like the perfect size.

118
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,750
You've been in our house for a while now. When are you planning on leaving?

119
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,600
What right do you have to make me leave?

120
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,750
I have my right as your older brother.

121
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,400
It's annoying seeing my younger brother letting me down like this.

122
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,000
Are you sick in the head, I 'm not your younger brother.

123
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,400
Whoever lives in my house is my younger brother.

124
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,280
Who wants to live in your house?

125
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,200
I've wanted to move out for a long time anyway!

126
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,700
You want me to leave? I am not leaving then!

127
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,000
You're pretty shameless.

128
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I learned it from you.

129
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
Fine.

130
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,800
This room will become my workroom sooner or later, anyway. You can stay for now.

131
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You win for now. Congrats.

132
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,600
You just got some stupid awards.

133
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Do you need to show them off?

134
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,400
Only those who haven't received one will use words like "stupid awards".

135
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,200
Only those who haven't received one will use words like "stupid awards".

136
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,000
Don't think you're all that, like I wanted to receive one.

137
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,200
Then try it.

138
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm not like a certain someone here who only knows how to talk.

139
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,400
He said he'll get a higher score than me and get into the Architecture major at Haicheng University.

140
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,600
Look at you now, you're the last place in your year,

141
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,400
but that's good, too.

142
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,800
I won't be seeing you at Haicheng University and you can continue to lay there.

143
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,000
I won't be seeing you at Haicheng University and you can continue to lay there.

144
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,400
Don't you dare think that I can't get in.

145
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,000
I hope that you don't.

146
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
Wait and see!

147
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,300
Elementary schooler.

148
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,400
He's worse than an elementary schooler.

149
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,000
Mom,

150
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,600
I will be attending Haicheng University's Architecture Major.

151
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,400
Don't worry.

152
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,000
I will finish those sketches you couldn't finish.

153
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,750
Wang Yichao

154
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,400
Hello?

155
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,200
Hello, Liang Younian.

156
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,400
Do you still have your notes from your third year?

157
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Yeah, I still have them. Why?

158
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,800
I've thought of a new idea, we're about to make a fortune.

159
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,600
I am planning on using your notes from your third year classes,

160
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,800
make copies of them, put them in a binder, and sell them in my father's store.

161
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,200
I'll sell them to the juniors.

162
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,400
One binder can be around ¥20 ($3 USD).

163
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,200
With your reputation of placing first in the city for the college entrance exam, those binders will sell like crazy in Hai City.

164
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,400
When we've become sensational, we'll reach the pinnacle of our lives!

165
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,200
I am talking to you. Are you listening?

166
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,480
I'm coming over to get them.

167
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,000
You need to report to the university tomorrow, so it's better to get them sooner.
[Good luck on your college exam]

168
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,600
I'm not selling.

169
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Dad, I am going out for a bit.

170
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,800
Okay.

171
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,200
Oh, yeah. I will be reporting to Haicheng University with Yichao tomorrow morning.

172
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
Are you?

173
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,800
Do you want me to take you there?

174
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,000
If you can't get all of your things, I can take a day off—

175
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,500
No need, Da Chao's dad will take us there tomorrow.

176
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,600
- All right, remember to thank them.

177
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay.

178
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,200
The sectional view drawing needs to be based on—

179
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,700
- Take a look, I need to pick up this call.
- All right.

180
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Hello?

181
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,600
Si Chen, this is Liang Gang calling.

182
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,000
Oh, Senior!

183
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,200
Hello, I haven't heard your voice in a long time.

184
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,800
What's up?

185
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,400
Yes. Right, about that.

186
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,800
My son, Liang Younian, got admitted to the Architecture major at your school this year.

187
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,390
My son, Liang Younian, got admitted to the Architecture major at your school this year.

188
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,800
Liang Younian?

189
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,400
I know, I know.

190
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,000
The highest scorer of this year's Architecture students.

191
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Senior, your son takes after you.

192
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,800
Thank you.

193
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,000
I called today to ask a favor from you.

194
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,600
Senior, you know I am only a teacher.

195
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Senior, you know I am only a teacher.

196
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,600
I can't control the administrative side of the school.

197
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,100
If you want to change him to a better dorm room, I can help you—

198
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,010
No, no. Don't misunderstand.

199
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,000
That's not what I meant.

200
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,400
I hope that you can be stricter with Younian.

201
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,000
Don't give him a passing grade if he doesn't deserve it.

202
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,600
For the times you can scold him, don't compliment him.

203
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,200
Be stricter with him and be critical. Give him a harder time.

204
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,800
Try to force him into changing his major.

205
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Senior, i-is Liang Younian your real son?

206
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,400
Senior, i-is Liang Younian your real son?

207
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,200
Don't push me.

208
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Be more gentle.

209
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,900
I already finished the shell necklace for you.

210
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,260
I finally finished.

211
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,800
Thank you, my dear sister.

212
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Oh, yeah. Sis. Someone called you during dinner.

213
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,000
Who?

214
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Someone called something Nian. He told you to go to the lighthouse. He has something to give you.

215
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,600
At what time?

216
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,100
Seven o'clock.

217
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,600
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

218
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,700
You had to help me with homework.

219
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

220
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,400
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

221
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,800
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

222
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,000
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

223
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,600
♫ always watching over ♫

224
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,900
♫ My heart... ♫

225
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:49,200
♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

226
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:59,650
♫ I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

227
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,500
Good luck! Genius will protect you.

228
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,600
Senior, I won't disappoint your expectations for me.

229
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,300
Five Years College Exams, Three Years Mock Exams: College Exam Language
(Very popular studying material for Chinese College Exam)

230
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,000
I will definitely get into Haicheng University.

231
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,400
♫ You are so dazzling and outstanding ♫

232

233
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,200
[Notice Board]
♫ But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

234
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Senior looks so handsome in this picture.

235
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,600
Why else do you think I'm here with you?

236
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,900
Class 5, Grade 3

237
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,000
Our classroom really is Senior's old classroom!

238
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,600
- Why don't you hurry up and sit in Liang Younian's seat then?
- You're right!

239
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,820
Xia Miaomiao what are you doing?

240
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,800
Do you really want to sit with me that badly?

241
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Who wants to sit together with you?

242
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,800
Then go sit elsewhere.

243
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,400
What about you going to find a seat elsewhere?

244
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,600
You'll be sleeping, anyway.

245
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,600
I think that the seat beside Xinxin is pretty good.

246
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Who said I'll be sleeping?

247
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,430
What are you doing?

248
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,800
How come you look different today?

249
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,210
Where are your braces?

250
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,900
- She got her braces taken off.
- Right.

251
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,400
Didn't Liang Younian give you all of his notes?

252
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,200
Can you give me a copy?

253
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,400
No problem, I'll photocopy them for you right after school.

254
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,800
But...

255
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Liang Younian gave his notes to you and not me.

256
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,400
Pr-Probably because Senior thought that with my grades, I would need them more.

257
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,300
Pr-Probably because Senior thought that with my grades, I would need them more.

258
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,100
That makes sense.

259
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,200
Abandon. Abandon.

260
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,600
A-b-a-n-d-o-n.

261
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,800
Abandon.

262
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Abandoned. Forsaken.

263
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,600
Ability. Ability.

264
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,000
A-b-i-l-i—

265
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,800

Class 5 Grade 3

00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,200
Unite, advance, develop and innovate

270
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,200
When will I be able to meet Senior again?
[Goodbye]

271
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,400
Senior's handwriting is so nice.

272
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,800
His lines are confident and powerful.
[Liang Younian]

273
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,000
His strokes are smooth like water.

274
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:01,130
Students, we will learn about Arithmetic progression today.

275
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,200
Please open your textbooks to page 11.

276
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,600
You can all see that

277
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,400
I have copied the examples from the textbook on the blackboard.

278
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,200
What is this question asking for?

279
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,400
The question is asking about the arithmetic progression's general formula, right?

280
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,200
a_n = a + (n-1)/d

281
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,400
Let's take a look at this equation.

282
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,000
So that's why a_8 = 1/3...

283
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Your idol is actually listening to the lecture

284
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and also taking notes. I'm scared.

285
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,900
cos (2*a_8) = cosine (2/3 * pi)

286
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,000
So let's look again at this problem

287
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,800
to see how we can solve it.

288
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,500
2a, right?

289
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,200
So when you take the exam,

290
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,800
most of the arithmetic progression questions tend to be multiple choice.

291
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,200
Aunt said he's been like this recently, please understand.

292
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,600
Grade 3 really is scary.

293
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,000
Even Lin Kaitou has changed.

294
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,200
I wonder what Senior is up to right now.

295
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,200
Grade 3 has officially started.

296
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,790
The results for the mock exam are out.

297
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,900
I believe everyone already knows their results.

298
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,600
I want to compliment two students today.

299
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,000
First is Xia Miaomiao.

300
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,000
Xia Miaomiao managed to make top three for English in our class

301
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and her scores for math are also in the high middle.

302
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,400
In addition, her overall ranking has gotten better every single time.

303
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,300
I hope everyone here can learn from her.

304
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,900
I have also been very surprised by Lin Kaituo's performance.

305
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,400
Other than a failing the English mark,

306
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,200
he managed to make top ten for all his other subjects.

307
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,400
Kaitou, you're awesome!

308
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,500
Can you help teach me?

309
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,800
You are first in the class and you want him to teach you?

310
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,600
If you teach me math,

311
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,400
I'll teach you English. How does that sound?

312
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,630
Okay.

313
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,200
Students, please take out your exam papers.

314
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,900
In today's class, we will analyze the questions from the exam.

315
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,410
Boss, how's business today?

316
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,600
You just have a sweet mouth.

317
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,880
Kaitou!

318
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,300
Boss, I'm taking a bottle of water.

319
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,200
I want a bottle, too.

320
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,700
Get it yourself.

321
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,400
Xinxin, you also wanted a box of pencil leads, right?

322
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,800
Yes.

323
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,900
Wait, I have something to tell you.

324
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,900
Are you really not going to consider my suggestion?

325
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,200
Think about it. Last time when Aunt saw your English score,

326
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,000
she already secretly signed you up for tutoring.

327
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,800
If she still doesn't see improvement this time,

328
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,800
there might be a tutor already waiting for you when you get home.

329
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,200
Think about it. If I go to Aunt and tell her I will tutor you in English,

330
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,800
she will definitely be relieved

331
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,400
and not hire another tutor.

332
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,400
That being said, tutors are so expensive

333
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,200
That being said, tutors are so expensive

334
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,000
and you won't have to have Aunt spend the money on it.

335
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,600
Which means you will need to work for a long time.

336
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,000
Right?

337
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,600
I have a condition.

338
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,100
I agree!

339
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,800
I haven't said anything yet.

340
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,000
No matter what you say, I'll agree.

341
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,600
Can't I sit by your side and teach you?

342
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,200
No.

343
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,900
Then I'll tutor you after school.

344
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,600
You agreed to my condition.

345
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,100
Not to study with you alone, right?

346
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,600
Didn't think you'd be the conservative type.

347
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,200
What is it?

348
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,560
What's the difference between "Try to do something" and "Try doing something"?

349
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,400
Doing means giving something a try.

350
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,200
To do is to use effort to accomplish something.

351
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,800
For example,

352
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,600
I will try to be your best friend.

353
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,230
I will work hard to be your best friend.

354
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,100
Okay, I'll be serious.

355
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,100
There's also a difference between "Stop to do" and "Stop doing".

356
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,800
As you can see here.

357
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,000
If I could study with Senior,

358
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,200
how great that would be.

359
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,800
Students, today is not just an ordinary day.

360

There's only 100 days left until the next College Entrance Exam.

362
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:07,440
These 100 days will also be one of the most important 100 days in your life.

363
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,260
In 100 days, you can study all the books you have learned once more.

364
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,210
So annoying. How long is he going to ramble on for?

365
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:24,140
Right? If they have the time to talk, they could have just let us practice some more.

366
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,880
Then why aren't you leaving?

367
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,380
Should we dash?

368
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,280
...full of opportunities...

369
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,310
Up to you.

370
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,490
I'll follow you.
("Up to you" and "follow you" have the same pronunciation)

371
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:41,040
Come join me later. It'll be too noticeable otherwise.

372
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:47,670
Bring out the courage to face reality and challenge life.

373
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:53,130
That's how you will be able to take the final victory in this fierce battle.

374
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:58,060
In these last 100 days, I suggest all students to:

375
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:03,740
First: set a goal and find out which schools you want to get into.

376
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:08,930
Second: be confident that you will be successful.

377
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:13,740
Third: have a positive and good attitude.

378
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:19,690
Devote a sincere heart to the tense revision of the exam.

379
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:25,220
Lastly, I wish all of our third-year students

380
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:30,470
to score well and be successful.

381
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:36,140
And now, I'd like to welcome the first place of our last entrance exam, Student Liang Younian, to give his speech.

382
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,850
Long time, no see.

00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:04,780
Today, I am honored to be standing here as the Graduate Representative.

387
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:10,100
There are only 100 days until the next College Entrance Exam.

Take a look.

391
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,730
How much longer do we have to wait?

392
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:45,960
- I'll go check.
- Stay and sit here. Where are you going?

Xia Miaomiao...Total: 612

396
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,600
Mom, is 612 points good or bad?

397
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:15,680
Xia Miaomiao, tell Mom the truth.

398
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,810
Did you cheat on your College Entrance Exam?

399
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,880
I don't think I did...

400
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,490
Did you write the wrong name?

401
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,270
This is my name.

402
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,840
Oh, my goodness!

403
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,480
This is so much higher than what I had expected!

404
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,900
Xia Miaomiao!

405
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,870
You can get into the best Architecture Department in Haicheng University!

406
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,650
Mom, Mom, I want to get into the Fashion major. My art scores are very high, too.

407
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:54,560
You— What do you know? You got this score because of your ability.

408
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,810
How you'll use that score to apply will be my ability.

409
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:02,550
Just wait. I have to have a good talk with your classroom teacher.

410
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,380
Don't worry, I won't waste a single point of your score and help you get into the best majors, okay?

411
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,990
- Mom, but—
- It's fine. No buts.

412
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,580
Your father has always been worried about your exam results.

413
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:17,950
This time, your dad and I will call your classroom teacher and have a good talk.

414
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,780
By the way, Haicheng University will have an open house in a few days,

415
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,450
go have a good look with your classmates.

Welcome to Our Model Classroom.

418
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:18,200
Who was the last one here? Did they forget to turn off the light?

419
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,640
Liang Younian?

420
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:14,550
I was just drawing and then I fell asleep.

421
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,090
D-Do you have a fever?

422
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,360
This...

423
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,300
No, it's to refresh my mind.

424
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,780
It's so late already. Aren't you going back?

425
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:39,670
Tomorrow, the building structure selection homework is due. I wanted to check it over again.

426
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,060
There's no more coffee beans as well.

427
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,080
You're so serious about your electives, too?

428
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:51,020
I'd always thought they made the first years take this course to build a good foundation for next year's compulsory courses.

429
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,850
I'm just making some simple calculations.

430
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,560
- I'm leaving first then.
- Okay.

431
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,300
Bye.

432
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,900
Student Liang Younian may be a first-year,

433
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,600
but he performed the best among all the students this time for this assignment.

434
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,540
His design of the roof support structure perfectly combined the concepts

435
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,540
behind structure and aesthetics together.

436
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,650
Most importantly, he paid attention to the safety aspects,

437
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:49,030
which is something many students neglect.

438
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,410
In the front here, you can see that I've drawn a picture.

439
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:56,850
Last class, we talked about the concept of superposition

440
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,400
and how to use it to draw bending moment diagrams.

441
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,420
Soon, I'm going to ask a few students to draw a bending moment diagram.

442
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,220
I know you guys really dislike this structural engineering course.

443
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:15,460
You feel like once you become an architect, there will be a structural engineer to assist you.

444
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,240
This type of attitude is unacceptable.

445
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:21,300
That is because this course in structural engineering needs your complete attention and focus.

446
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,330
That is because this course in structural engineering needs your complete attention and focus.

447
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:31,430
Regarding this, I hope that everyone can learn from Liang Younian.

448
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,700
Oh, Liang Younian.

449
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,530
Are you making it harder for me to praise you?

450
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:44,510
I didn't have time to eat breakfast, so I'm a bit hungry.

451
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,140
Did you spend the night at the structural model room again?

452
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,510
The dorm was locked, so I couldn't get in.

453
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,960
- No, you—
- Professor, the bending moment diagram.

454
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,710
Liang Younian, come to the front. I want you to draw the bending moment diagram.

455
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,880
Well done. You drew it extremely well!

456
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,590
Professor, I promise that I won't eat cookies in your class anymore.

457
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,600
Then what are you going to eat?

458
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,500
Mmm... bread.

459
00:42:55,110 --> 00:43:00,010
Okay, next time don't sleep in the structural model room. Go have a seat.

460
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,630
Younian, even if you're going to sleep elsewhere, you should sleep closer to the cafeteria next time.

461
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:10,220
Okay, let's resume class. Everyone look at this.

462
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,300
Liang Younian's bending moment diagram is very well done.

00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,170
♫ You are so dazzling and outstanding ♫

475
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:44,510
♫ I'm just a faint breeze blowing ♫

476
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:50,370
♫ But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

477
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,440
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

478
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,170
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

479
00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:02,740
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

480
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:08,180
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

481
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,200
♫ My heart... ♫
