A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,560
♫  I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,100
♫  To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,070
♫  I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,130
♫  But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,550
♫  Pretending that I don't care  ♫

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,150
♫  Pretending to be busy every day  ♫

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,970
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it  ♫

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,570
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now  ♫

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,550
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see  ♫

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,600
♫  My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,190
♫  I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,620
♫  Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,540
♫  At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,470
♫  My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,080
♫  I want to control myself and forget you  ♫

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,420
♫  But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,580
♫  If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,190
♫  Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,090
♫  Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,060
♫  Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,630
♫  Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,130
♫  And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,930
♫  According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,160
♫ Is the result of Heaven's favor  ♫

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,090
Episode 34

27
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,190
Walking around and around, so annoying.

28
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,920
I still need to do my homework.

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,820
I'll be done soon.

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,990
Hey, you're not allowed to take that photo.

31
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,120
Why not?

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,740
It's mine.

33
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,700
You can't take that, either.

34
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,860
Good luck with the IELTS Exam! - Liang Younian

35
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,090
- Did your boyfriend give you this?
- Yes.

36
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,760
Then it's also mine.

37
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,980
Hey, how did the things Senior gave me become yours?

38
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,870
This skirt is also mine.

39
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,950
Mom said that when I grow up, I can wear this.

40
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,080
Xia Yaoyao, are you trying to nitpick on purpose?

41
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,640
Darling, how's your packing?

42
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,220
Nearly done.

43
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,300
What time is your flight tomorrow morning?

44
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,690
It's 11:00 in the morning.

45
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,250
Oh my, then we would have to leave at 8:30 a.m.

46
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,450
I already booked a cab.

47
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,870
Okay.

48
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,440
Santu, you need to wake up a bit earlier tomorrow morning.

49
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,840
If you wake up late, we're not waiting for you.

50
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,040
If I'm not going, then I'm not going.

51
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,130
I don't want to go, either.

52
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,860
Are you actually not going?

53
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,950
I'm telling you.

54
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,890
For you to see your sister again, it'll be after a year.

55
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,820
For you to see your sister again, it'll be after a year.

56
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,520
My precious! It's okay.

57
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,120
Mom was just joking. It's okay.

58
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,460
It's fine. It's fine.

59
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,290
I don't want Sister to go.

60
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,110
You're not allowed to go.

61
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,120
I'm not letting you go.

62
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,280
It's okay.

63
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,770
One year passes by really quickly.

64
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,550
I'll be back very soon.

65
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,900
No, I'm not letting you go. One year is very long.

66
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:47,250
I promise you. When I come back, I'll bring dolls from England, okay?

67
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,080
Really?

68
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,330
Really.

69
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,520
What did you say?!

70
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,310
Don't be mad, speak properly.

71
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,430
I'm not planning on going.

72
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,090
You tell me clearly.

73
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,890
Why won't you go overseas?

74
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,720
Before, we didn't let you choose architecture, but you never listened.

75
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,180
Now when there's a good opportunity, you give it up!

76
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,780
Your grades aren't good enough to go, huh?

77
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,030
Don't be so mad. If you have something to say, say it properly.

78
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,610
- Younian—
- Mom.

79
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,850
Let's go out. Let them two have a talk.

80
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,820
Mom, let's go out.

81
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,070
Don't be mad, okay?

82
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:51,580
Dad, I hope you can listen to me speak properly.

83
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,290
Sure! Say it, I'll have a listen.

84
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,120
What excuse do you have?

85
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,620
My mom's final incomplete project... has restarted.

86
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,470
So I hope I can handle these things well,

87
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,800
then think about going overseas after.

88
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,230
I've always known why you're so against me learning architecture.

89
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,280
More or less,

90
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,510
it's because of my mom's incident.

91
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,860
You're probably the same as me, having a psychological shadow.

92
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,750
But I promise you that these type of things will never happen to me.

93
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,070
I will definitely be careful.

94
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,740
About going overseas... I hope you can understand me.

95
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,560
Because my mom once told me,

96
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,710
this project is very important to her.

97
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,520
It seems like...

98
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,780
You've really grown up.

99
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,150
Since that's the case,

100
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,460
then I respect your decision.

101
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,420
Thanks Dad.

102
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,260
Although I left the architecture field,

103
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,330
but if you have any problems with design in the future,

104
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,960
you can discuss it with me.

105
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,310
Never underestimate your dad.

106
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,500
I am still skilled.

107
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,490
Fine then. I'm still worthy enough to shovel dirt for you.

108
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,720
Okay, hurry and eat.

109
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,060
I'll go and call them in.

110
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,860
We're a family, what is there to conceal?

111
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,020
Senior, I'm leaving home tomorrow at 8:30 a.m.

112
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,140
Let's see each other at the airport.

113
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,310
Okay, thanks!

114
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:36,030
Okay, that's enough. Stop dawdling, the two of you.

115
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,540
I brought you two bags of food to eat on the plane, okay?

116
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,240
- Okay.
- Hurry and get in the car.

117
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,230
Slow down. Sit properly.

118
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,340
Miaomiao.

119
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,880
A Xia, you're really not going to come and send me off?

120
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,890
I'm not going. One by one you guys are leaving me alone.

121
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,480
I'll feel too sad if I send one of you off again.

122
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,900
Don't say that.

123
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,540
I'll come back soon.

124
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,890
It's okay, I'm just a little reluctant to see you go.

125
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,080
Don't cry.

126
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,560
I promise you, I'll come back soon.

127
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,630
I'll bring you a bunch of delicious food.

128
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:27,300
Departures

129
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,190
Young man, I didn't expect you to stay true to your words.

130
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,430
Don't just sit there. Get to work.

131
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,120
Here, take this.

132
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,260
Hello, Miaomiao.

133
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,030
Senior, I'm at the airport.

134
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,010
Have you checked in yet?

135
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,660
Not yet, I'm waiting for you, so we can do it together.

136
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,970
You should check in first.

137
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,660
What's wrong? Will you arrive much later?

138
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,810
I'll tell you when you're on the plane.

139
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,760
D-Did something happen?

140
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,440
Young man, stop talking on your phone.

141
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,870
Go and scrub the floor near the swimming pool.

142
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,150
Senior, where are you?

143
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,000
Listen to me. Board your flight quickly.

144
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,010
I won't.

145
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,990
You're not coming anymore, right?

146
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,590
What exactly happened?

147
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,030
I'm sorry.

148
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,830
You're probably already on the plane right now.

149
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,880
Senior.

150
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,870
Why are you here?

151
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,180
Tell me first.

152
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,550
Why were you not at the airport?

153
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,020
Did you change the time of your flight?

154
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,880
Why didn't you tell me?

155
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,850
I'm not going anymore.

156
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,180
Why?

157
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,320
When you have settled down in the UK,

158
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,500
I'll tell you.

159
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,540
What exactly happened, that you can't tell me right now?

160
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,200
I don't wish to influence you with my personal matters.

161
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,580
But... you always have influenced me.

162
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,180
I'm sorry.

163
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,870
I don't want to hear you say that you're sorry.

164
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,540
Whatever happens, I'm willing to face it with you.

165
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,580
But you won't tell me anything.

166
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,900
Why?

167
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,540
It's enough that one of us is staying.

168
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,640
I hope you can keep moving forward.

169
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,400
So...

170
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,710
You're still not going to tell me, right?

171
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,190
Just leave first, okay?

172
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,590
Once I've handled the matters here,

173
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,830
I'll go find you.

174
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,750
Senior.

175
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,190
Please tell me right now!

176
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,710
Did you know?

177
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,130
After I confessed to you that day,

178
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,030
I kept thinking that you would surely reject me.

179
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:35,420
But I... I didn't expect you to confess your feelings to me.

180
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,260
I- I really find it unbelievable.

181
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,910
Therefore up until this moment, deep in my heart, I still think that,

182
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,900
this is a dream that I would wake up from at anytime.

183
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,510
That's why I was scared to tell everyone about our relationship.

184
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,150
I'm afraid that one day, you'll suddenly regret it.

185
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,430
So... the reason that you can't tell me...

186
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,020
Is it because you regretted it?

187
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,140
It's not like what you think.

188
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,310
Such an outstanding person like you,

189
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,750
surely can't understand how I feel, right?

190
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,530
I- I know that I'm...

191
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,860
I'm quite insignificant— I'm also very ordinary.

192
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,300
But, I think that...

193
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,850
Being in a relationship, means...

194
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,740
We should mature together and share our troubles.

195
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,510
Therefore, no matter how insignificant I am,

196
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,970
I also hope to become someone who you can share your troubles with.

197
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,610
Even if it's just a little.

198
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:00,550
But now... You won't even give me a chance.

199
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:10,790
We should... Break up.

200
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,830
- Miaomiao.
- Don't come any closer.

201
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,090
This is my fault. I'm not good enough.

202
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,890
I'm still not qualified enough to stand by your side.

203
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,330
Xia Miaomiao.

204
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,270
Don't come any closer.

205
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,520
I will leave.

206
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,850
Let go of me! I can handle it!

207
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,930
Don't come looking for me and don't follow me, either.

208
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,320
I'm going to the airport now.

209
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:56,350
♫ Still remembering your smile ♫

210
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,150
♫ As if we only met yesterday ♫

211

Miss, why are you so drenched?

212
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,120
Here, dry yourself.

213

♫ Immobilized in the middle ♫

214

♫ With you ♫

253
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,550
Why are you eating so much meat?

254
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,880
What about your diet?

255
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,020
If it's not meat that I take from others, it doesn't taste as good.

256
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,780
- He Xin! You're back!
- Chubby Xia.

257
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,960
Why didn't you tell me? I could've picked you up!

258
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,640
I missed you so much!

259
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,140
Hurry up and sit.

260
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,100
It's only a surprise if I showed up out of the blue.

261
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,260
Didn't you say after Miaomiao left, you've lost 2.5 kilograms?

262
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,030
Why can't I tell?

263
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,070
I bet you've never been on a diet.

264
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,380
The loss of 2.5 kilograms doesn't show.
 (5.5 lbs)

265
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,590
You and your excuses.

266
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,840
Hey, eat quickly.

267
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,420
I told Miaomiao to FaceTime before her class starts.

268
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,810
We need to hurry back to the dorms.

269
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:41,700
Ah... B-But I want to first meet Kaituo.

270
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,940
Is your sister or Kaituo more important?

271
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,900
Kaituo.

272
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,470
How come you don't ever learn?

273
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,310
Have you forgotten last time's lesson?

274
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,300
I still remember it.

275
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,250
Come on, don't worry.

276
00:24:54,250 --> 00:25:00,120
When I meet him this time, I will pretend to be very aloof.

277
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,020
Stop with the being aloof! Hurry and eat.

278
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,750
- Here, eat more.
- Okay.

279
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,660
A Xia! You should wipe it for Miaomiao.

280
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,760
How dirty is this?

281
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,840
What's the point in wiping it.

282
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,550
It's not like she'll be back soon.

283
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:26,060
Not using her desk to put my bits and pieces of things is already me being kind enough.

284
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,020
A Xia, who are you talking to?

285
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,350
- Come here!
- Miaomiao!

286
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,010
Xinxin?

287
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,390
Even if you want to promote Chinese culture,

288
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:43,150
you don't have to cosplay as our national treasure, a panda.

289
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,890
Hey, when did you come back? You didn't even tell us.

290
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,510
I've been back for a while now.

291
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,690
If I told you guys earlier, then I wouldn't have been able to surprise you guys.

292
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,980
Then, have you finished all your research work there?

293
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,370
I finished it all.

294
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,110
How about you? Are you used to things there?

295
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,190
It's okay, just a bit busy.

296
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,760
When there's something I don't know how to do, I'm thick-skinned enough to go ask my classmates.

297
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,310
-  Then, it's lucky your shyness is cured. 
- Right.

298
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,680
I've only been here for three months, but I feel like I've aged three years.

299
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,390
Are you and Liang Younian still not in touch?

300
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,720
Maybe what I said to him before I left was quite extreme.

301
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,280
Maybe what I said to him before I left was quite extreme.

302
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,140
Aiya! I can't take you people that dillydally about.

303
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,300
You don't know how to argue and are always unhappy.

304
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,070
Aiya! Let's not talk about me.

305
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,820
How about you and Lin Kaituo?

306
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,950
Miaomiao, it's time for class.

307
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,320
Okay.

308
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,890
I can't talk anymore. I have to go to class. Bye-bye.

309
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,090
As a friend that we see online, Xia Miaomiao has been like this for three months now.

310
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,540
Comes in a rush, leaves in a rush.

311
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,790
This won't do.

312
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,210
In a while, I'm going to the architecture department to find Liang Younian.

313
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,280
I want to look at that blockhead and see what medicine he's been taking.

314
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,480
Enough.

315
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,280
Who are you really going to the architecture department to see? Do you think I don't know?

316
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,940
I'm definitely not going to see Lin Kaituo.

317
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,120
Just eat.

318
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,210
Architecture Department

319
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,910
Kaituo, this is for you.

320
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,910
I don't want it.

321
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,630
Take it back.

322
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,050
Take it.

323
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,800
Take it!

324
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,430
He Xin, you're back.

325
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,660
When did you get back?

326
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,950
Why are you here?

327
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,350
What business is that of yours?

328
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,530
I didn't come to see you.

329
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,300
Where's Liang Younian?

330
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,260
He's not here.

331
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,530
Why didn't you tell me you were back?

332
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,360
You, precious people, are always so busy.

333
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,020
How could you have time to pay attention to me?

334
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,490
What do you mean?

335
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,880
You don't understand?

336
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,240
If you don't get it, just forget it.

337
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,180
Do you know where Liang Younian is or not?

338
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,550
I need to talk to him.

339
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:04,610
He's either in the dorm or at the Fang Corporation.

340
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,450
Why are you looking for him?

341
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,950
What business is that of yours?

342
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,130
Do you know why he and Xia Miaomiao broke up?

343
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,900
Ask the two of them about it. Why ask me?

344
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,040
I've asked them many times.

345
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,710
But they won't tell me, so I'm asking you.

346
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,230
If they don't say, it's because they don't want you to know.

347
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,250
You spend time on other people.

348
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,410
It would be better if you just worry about yourself.

349
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,730
What's the matter with me?

350
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,220
What do I need to deal with?

351
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,600
Is there a problem with your IQ? How do you not even understand that?!

352
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,040
Who are you yelling at?!

353
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,140
If you speak in circles, of course I can't understand.

354
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,020
Anyway, I've already been rejected by you.

355
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,490
There's nothing to say to you.

356
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,130
Then don't say anything!

357
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:23,670
I didn't want my personal issues to influence you.

358
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:32,160
But... you've been influencing me all along.

359
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:58,950
It's best that we... break up.

360
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,670
What new problem has Frank given you

361
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,670
that's made you sigh like that?

362
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,840
Nothing.

363
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,290
Teacher Li asked you to arrange the data.

364
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,100
How's that going?

365
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,940
It's almost done. How about you?

366
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,320
Your life is a lot harder than mine.

367
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,710
Drawing a pavilion.

368
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,430
Frank has rejected your work at least three times.

369
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,600
I'm about to throw down the gauntlet for the fourth time.

370
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,010
I wish you luck.

371
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,320
Hello, Xinxin.

372
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,880
When did you get back?

373
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,840
Today. I got back today.

374
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,050
Why does everyone ask me the same question when they see me?

375
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,660
It's really so irritating!

376
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,320
If I knew this was going to happen, I wouldn't have made it a surprise.

377
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,810
You just got back and you're already in a temper. Did you see Kaituo?

378
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,290
Other than him, who else could make my temper flare like this?

379
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,420
He says one thing and means another, that's nothing new.

380
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,640
Aren't you used to that yet?

381
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,000
Well, he shouldn't say that I have an IQ problem.

382
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,350
After all, I'm pretty intelligent.

383
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:27,040
Didn't you tell him his brain had a hole in it?

384
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:32,730
I... when did I say his brain had a hole in it?

385
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,610
I said it was you who had a hole in your brain.

386
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:44,210
Are you saying he was the one who sent the dried sweet potatoes, beauty products, and honey?

387
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,350
I'm not saying anything.

388
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,590
So it's like that...

389
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,270
I'm off.

390
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,830
Hey, wait a minute.

391
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,160
I have something important to ask you.

392
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,340
What matter?

393
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,210
The situation with Miaomiao.

394
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:05,300
All this time, I've been busy and let you get away with a perfunctory manner.

395
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,100
Now, you have to tell me exactly what the reason is.

396
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,590
The reason really isn't important for what Miaomiao's doing currently.

397
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:18,030
You can see that she's living a busy, full life right now.

398
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,910
Since I don't have any way to help her, there's no need to bother her.

399
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:24,510
Let her give her whole heart and mind to her own matters.

400
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,590
- But you two—
- Xinxin.

401
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,480
I want to give Miaomiao some time, so she can see how outstanding her own abilities are.

402
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,180
Not all the changes she's experienced was because of me.

403
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,140
But have you thought about the fact

404
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,960
that it's possible Miaomiao won't forgive you?

405
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,580
Every day, I think about that.

406
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,840
Okay, I'm going.

407
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,120
Xiaoyue, the topography map.

408
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,790
Good.

409
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,550
- Teacher Li.
- You're here.

410
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,090
- Is your fourth draft of the pavilion done?
- It's finished.

411
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,990
Then, I'll take a look.

412
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,840
Aren't you Teacher Li's assistant?

413
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,380
Why are you always doing work for Frank recently?

414
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,720
He's performed well. He's impressed Frank.

415
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,230
Then why does he always reject your work?

416
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:48,560
I don't know, either.

417
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:53,230
Younian, I've finished looking at the blueprint.

418
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,950
I don't think there's any problems with this.

419
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,530
Go on and give it to Frank.

420
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,230
He'll surely see a lot of problems.

421
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,950
Teacher, you're not helping.

422
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,750
- CEO Fang.
- CEO Fang.

423
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,340
Liang Younian, you came.

424
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,660
I was just coming to ask you...

425
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,070
Where are you going?

426
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,300
I'm taking these blueprints to Frank.

427
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,700
Give them to Xiao Liu; he'll take care of that.

428
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,910
Come and follow me.

429
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,330
Thank you.

430
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,700
President Fang, I think that's not too appropriate.

431
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,530
You have to understand where I'm coming from.

432
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,830
I'm just anxious out of the love for my daughter.

433
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,580
I had no other choice but to find you.

434
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,590
But I'm good friends with Da Chao.

435
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,850
This request is really difficult for me.

436
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,230
Moreover, I already know that you went to find Da Chao last time.

437
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,040
I can't treat my friend like that.

438
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,180
I'm really sincere this time.

439
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,860
You can see as well. Every day Xiaoyue works over hours at the office in such low spirits.

440
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:12,610
But this might not be because of my friend.

441
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:16,680
But every time I mention her boyfriend to her, she's always unhappy.

442
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,740
Boyfriend?

443
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,050
Could it be that they broke up?

444
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,750
I'm not too sure about this, either.

445
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,610
But I really can't help you meet with Wang Yichao.

446
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:34,270
He's busy with his graduation project, you better not agitate him.

447
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,820
I guarantee that I won't say anything bad about him this time.

448
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,590
Actually, my secretary invited him here many times already but he never comes.

449
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,620
Actually, my secretary invited him here many times already but he never comes.

450
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,950
Don't tell me you want me to go in person.

451
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,850
But I can't go, either.

452
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,670
Fine. None of you guys are willing to help me.

453
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:00,110
Secretary Liao, prepare the car. I going to Haicheng University.

454
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,260
Younian, here's another problem for you.

455
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,540
Prepare for your fifth draft.

456
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,380
What's the matter this time?

457
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,780
Here, take a look.

458
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,240
Frank said that he recently checked the material for land no.12.

459
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,620
He thinks the remaining building are quite unique.

460
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,670
He wants you to take a look and learn from this experience.

461
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:31,870
I took a look at Fang Corporation's archives, but they don't seem to have this design saved.

462
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,950
You might need to go to the site in person to take a look.

463
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,660
Okay, I understand. I'll go now.

464
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,270
Fighting!

465
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,890
Younian, wait a second.

466
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:52,410
Did my dad ask you about Wang Yichao?

467
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,400
How did you know?

468
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,140
He already sneakily went to look for Wang Yichao last time.

469
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:03,010
So you know all about it. Da Chao was worried you'd be mad so he didn't tell you.

470
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,140
Since it's like this, I'll leave it to you to protect Da Chao.

471
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,590
I heard he's heading to Haicheng University now to find Da Chao.

472
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,870
He already asked Secretary Liao to go prepare the car.

473
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,470
What is he up to now?

474
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,430
Uncle, have a drink.

475
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,950
You don't like this?

476
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:48,670
I can get you a caffeine beverage instead or a bottle of water?

477
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,530
It's okay. This is okay.

478
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,090
I always had this when I was young, too.

479
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,990
You have one, too.

480
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:10,230
Sit.

481
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:20,200
Uncle, I'm really sorry to make you come all the way here.

482
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,790
When your secretary contacted me before,

483
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,480
I was with my mentor preparing my graduation project.

484
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,070
I'm really sorry. I really couldn't get away.

485
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:31,060
It's okay, aren't I here now?

486
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,660
Uncle, why are you looking for me this time?

487
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,970
Come work at my company.

488
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,660
Lately, Xiaoyue has been pulling a lot of overtime hours.

489
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,500
Since you haven't been able to see her, I'm sure some problems have arose.

490
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,910
You might as well come work at my company.

491
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,010
Coincidentally, I'm lacking a secretary.

492
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,790
It's okay, Uncle, I already found a job.

493
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,160
I already agreed to the two of you being together.

494
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,390
Just reconcile with Xiaoyue.

495
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,110
Uncle, you've really misunderstood.

496
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,250
How have I misunderstood?

497
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,600
You've totally misunderstood.

498
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:10,830
We aren't fighting. We're great.

499
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:15,990
You're in low spirits all day long and always working overtime.

500
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:19,750
That's because I miss him.

501
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,050
I can't stand you.

502
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,300
Then work overtime.

503
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,570
Even if you work until midnight, I won't worry about you.

504
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:31,780
From today onwards, I won't work overtime anymore.

505
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,280
I'll spend time with my boyfriend every day.

506
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,690
Let's go. Let's head back to the company.

507
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,340
If it continues like this, I'll have a heart attack.

508
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,270
Your dad is already gone.

509
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:00,620
You can stop acting. Get up.

510
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:06,350
I... Is it okay if I don't get up?

511
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,340
Why?

512
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:17,480
Because... I really do miss you.

513
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,650
Why did you suddenly come back?

514
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:38,140
I have something I need to ask you about.

515
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,370
What is it?

516
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:50,280
Where's the design file of the project my mom was working on that year?

517
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,140
The box you gave me didn't have it.

518
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:10,420
Wait for me.

519
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,920
Number 12 Land Development Architecture Set

520
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,580
Dad.

521
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:03,270
Why did you hide this design?

522
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:18,460
I've always felt like this project caused your mom's death.

523
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:22,610
I originally wanted to burn it.

524
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:28,480
But I worried that your mom would be angry if I did that.

525
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:45,310
After Mom left, aside from the photo in my room from our birthday,

526
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,540
all the other photos disappeared.

527
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,950
I thought you got rid of all of them.

528
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:03,170
I only hid the things I wasn't brave enough to see away in a corner.

529
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,900
A Little Thing Called First Love

530
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:05,540

531
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:08,310

537
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,830
♫ Regarding what love feels like ♫

538
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,950
♫ I've only heard about it from friends ♫
