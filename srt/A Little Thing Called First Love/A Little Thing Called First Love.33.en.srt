A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,560
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,050
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,000
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,140
♫ I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,670
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,070
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,070
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,600
♫ I want to know what you're now up to ♫

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,590
♫ You're all that I can see ♫

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,550
♫ You're in my heart every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,100
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,660
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of
a love like this ♫

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,510
♫ You're all that I can see ♫

15
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,500
♫ You're in my heart every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,180
♫  I must control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,630
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,620
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,110
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,060
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,010
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,600
♫ Stretch out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,160
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,050
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,100
♫ Is the result of Heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,010
Episode 33

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,420
Xia Liushui, when did this happen?

28
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,790
Tell me properly!

29
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,110
I was going to tell you at an earlier time,

30
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,950
but I was worried you wouldn't let me.

31
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,480
Is there any use in me not letting you now?

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,860
Will you really not let me?

33
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,470
Have you gone crazy?!

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,730
Going abroad to study and not having to pay for it.

35
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,900
Why didn't you tell your mom about this great news before?

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,640
Why wouldn't I let you?

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,500
If you had told me earlier you were going to be an international exchange student,

38
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,410
then I would have helped you.

39
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,470
Then I'll get my passport sorted out tomorrow.

40
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,590
Go and get it sorted out. Do you need any money?

41
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,860
It's okay, I've got some.

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,700
That's good then. I won't say anymore.

43
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,820
I'll go give your dad the good news.

44
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,380
My good daughter!

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,310
This is great. I'm going then.

46
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,320
I've told you so many times before.

47
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,600
The dog's not allowed in the bedroom.

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,000
What's wrong with you?

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,270
You should learn from your sister.

50
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,710
I never get angry at your sister.

51
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,130
I'll deal with you when I get back.

52
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,450
Senior Liang Younian

53
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,940
It's hot, why are you closing the door?

54
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,300
Senior.

55
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,110
What are you doing right now?

56
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm talking to you on the phone right now.

57
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,190
Then can I tell you some bad news?

58
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,950
Teacher Li wants me to go to a meeting with him tomorrow.

59
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,950
So I probably can't go with you to sort out your passport.

60
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,470
I'll try my best to meet you afterwards.

61
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,990
Okay.

62
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,380
Then I'll wait for you.

63
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,390
If I finish early, then we can go and have some fun.

64
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,240
If I finish early, then we can go and have some fun.

65
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,640
Okay.

66
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,280
I want to go to a theme park.

67
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,230
- I need to hang up now.
 - Okay.

68
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,180
- What are you doing?
- You seem very suspicious to me.

69
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,460
How so?

70
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,130
Then I'll tell Mom that Mr. Liang Gang's eldest son took you home tonight.

71
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,490
Come back... come back!

72
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,840
I'll give you some pocket money.

73
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,830
- ¥100 ($15.00 USD).
- Are you trying to rob me?

74
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,410
Mom!

75
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,790
Okay... okay, I'll give you the money.

76
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,910
That's what I thought.

77
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,620
Your bed's still the most comfy.

78
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,630
- Sister.
- Yes?

79
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,890
So are you dating?

80
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,740
Are you really going to sleep with me tonight?

81
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,110
It's comfy. Your bed is really comfy.

82
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,300
Sleep tight.

83
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,600
As a designer, your communication has to be very exact.

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,860
You don't have to be nervous.

85
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,100
The key is to be very clear.

86
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,470
- Hello, Mr. Fang.
- Everyone please sit.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,020
Let's begin.

88
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,730
Good afternoon, Designers.

89
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,660
Welcome to the Fang Corporation.

90
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,610
The main reason for our meeting today is the design plan for

91
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,240
the Number 12 building for Haibian Senior Center Building.

92
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,600
Everyone look at the screen, please.

93
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,420
Five years ago, this property had already been developed.

94
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,650
Mom, why don't you go to the study room to draw?

95
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,340
Your dad's in there.

96
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,060
Then why don't you return to the office to draw?

97
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,660
No way. This is my first project not under the guidance of your dad.

98
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,140
It must be something that no one can criticize.

99
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,640
You can do that somewhere else, and give my desk back to me.

100
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,710
Stop making noise. You owe me this.

101
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,730
In the beginning, wasn't it because I gave birth to you that

102
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,740
I had to put things on hold during the best days of my youth?

103
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,630
I would have been way ahead of your dad in the architecture business.

104
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,760
How can he get to talk down to me?

105
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,370
Okay. Then, when I become an architect, I'll teach him a lesson for you.

106
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,090
Let's think about that after you get into Haicheng University's Architecture Department.

107
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,540
What score did you get on last week's Chinese Language test?

108
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,780
You win.

109
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,860
You can use my table.

110
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,430
The difficult part of this design concerns how to reduce corrosion to the structure from sea water and ocean winds.

111
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,310
Frank and Professor Li came up with two proposals.

112
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,600
Later, you can discuss those.

113
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,300
That concludes our project introduction.

114
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:41,230
Our students have targeted the problem of corrosion from sea water and winds.

115
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,630
They've provided some effective proposals.

116
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,530
I want to abandon the traditional ways to manage construction on sandy foundations

117
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,960
and use a steel-concrete mixture for the structural frame.

118
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:18,630
At the same time, that provides a solid foundation and reduces corrosion by sea water and winds.

119
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:30,290
Also from what I know, the land for the Number 12 building will be exposed to the sun from the north.

120
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,900
The high temperatures will also contribute to corrosion.

121
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,980
If we can use a higher grade concrete or add nitrate,

122
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,860
organic amine, and other rust inhibitors, it could slow corrosion.

123
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,340
Preventing rust would be a good strategy.

124
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,310
Not bad, kid. You can sit.

125
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,310
I never knew that you would be quite familiar with this project land.

126
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,980
You even thought about the materials.

127
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:11,680
Aren't you Liang Younian, the person that won the Architectural Design Competition?

128
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,980
Right now, I formally invite you to join our project.

129
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,890
Director Fang,

130
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:25,140
Liang Younian is going to go to the University of Edinburgh as an exchange student next year.

131
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,080
So, he couldn't be a part of the entire process of your project—

132
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,750
Excuse me.

133
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,400
Can I think about your offer?

134
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,920
Of course, you can.

135
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:36,200
♫ Those fuzzy and dilapidated memories, the story is zero ♫

136
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,300
Mom.

137
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,900
I want to eat some of your homemade dumplings.

138
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,230
You still want to eat dumplings?

139
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,200
Aren't you sick of them now?

140
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,060
Mom, I got into Haicheng University's Architecture Department.

141
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,600
I get a scholarship every term.

142
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,970
The competition that you attended, I also won it.

143
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,400
See? Haven't I made you proud?

144
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay, I know you're very capable.

145
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,970
I also found a girlfriend. Her name is Xia Miaomiao.

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,600
I think you'll like her.

147
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,700
Little rascal. You've already started dating.

148
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,700
Also...

149
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,800
I was also accepted as an international exchange student at Edinburgh University.

150
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,100
- Are you jealous?
- Yes.

151
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,100
♫ Missing your breath ♫

152
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,800
Mom.

153
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,000
♫ Losing all that you gave ♫

154
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,600
I did lots and lots of incredible things.

155
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,600
♫ The tears that fall in a moment just wanting to hold you ♫

156
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,600
If only you knew about them.

157
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,830
Of course, I knew about them.

158
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,000
I always knew my son is the best.

159
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
♫ I can only leave ♫

160
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,840
♫ I choose to follow your eyes ♫

161
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,000
♫ How can I not keep being reminded ♫

162
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
I went to the Fang Corporation office today,

163
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,600
and saw your project that you didn't finish.

164
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,200
♫ Stuck in this whirlpool ♫

165
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,400
♫ with no way to escape ♫

166
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,800
I know that if you were still alive...

167
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,200
♫ Those who can't forget is the first to leave ♫

168
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,200
You would've told me to let it go and move on.

169
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,200
♫ I have no right to keep you back and can only embrace your indifference ♫

170
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,800
But this time...

171
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:10,000
♫ Trying to solve all the puzzles that you left behind ♫

172
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,400
Can I not move forward?

173
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,260
It's okay, I'll support whatever you do,

174
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,100
but you have to do it better than me.

175
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,000
♫ Those unforgettable ♫

176
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
♫ The tears that fall in one moment ♫

177
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,600
♫ just want to hold onto you ♫

178
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,600
♫ Nothing said, can't be repeated again ♫

179
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,800
♫ Nothing said, can't be repeated again ♫

180
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,700
Xiao Liu, did you notice Liang Younian?

181
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,400
He really is a fine-looking, talented young man.

182
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,600
If only my son-in-law could be as good as him.

183
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,800
Liang Younian will indeed go far.

184
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,800
He's so much better than my daughter's simple minded boyfriend.

185
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,500
I really don't know what Xiaoyue was thinking.

186
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,900
- Come in.
- Okay, I'll get going.

187
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,300
Director Fang, the meeting minutes are done. Please have a look.

188
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,410
Why are you calling me Director Fang?

189
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,800
There's no one else in here. Sit.

190
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,300
Can you please inspect it?

191
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,000
Sit, sit.

192
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,400
Director Fang asked you to sit, so can you please do so.

193
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,690
Xiaoyue, you're always busy in the office.

194
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,200
Do you have any time to be in a relationship?

195
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,720
Is your boyfriend all right?

196
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,600
Did you guys fight?

197
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,200
Director Fang, can you not ask about your employee's personal lives?

198
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,600
Right now, I'm not your boss. I'm your dad.

199
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,310
Can I tell you something?

200
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,800
When it comes to dating, don't wrong yourself.

201
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,400
It's okay to fight. There's no small matters in a relationship.

202
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,600
If you want to split up, you can. Never hesitate.

203
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,000
Don't keep thinking that he wants to take advantage of our family!

204
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,200
He might not even be interested.

205
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,800
What do you mean by that?

206
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,800
What did he say to you? Did he bully you?

207
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,300
No, he didn't.

208
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,400
Director Fang, if you have nothing else, I'll leave first.

209
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,470
What's going on?

210
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,000
How dare he find fault with my daughter?

211
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,400
Xiao Liu, come to my office.

212
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,800
Hello Miaomiao.

213
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,200
Senior, I've already finished sorting out my passport.

214
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,550
Have you finished your meeting?

215
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,000
Am I disturbing you right now?

216
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,720
I'm finished. I'll come to pick you up.

217
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,400
Wait for me in the lobby.

218
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,920
I finished ages ago.

219
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,200
I'll wait for you at the lighthouse.

220
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,400
Okay, I'll meet you there.

221
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,740
Okay, there's no need for you to rush.

222
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,200
I'm revising IELTS anyway.

223
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,600
Okay.

224
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,200
Xia Miaomiao, are you up to something again?

225
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,800
Didn't I learn it from you?

226
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
What time did you finish?

227
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Why did you only call me a few minutes ago?

228
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,220
I didn't want to disturb you.

229
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,300
So I came to do review the questions.

230
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,400
I forgot about the time as I was doing them.

231
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Where are the tickets?

232
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,400
What tickets?

233
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,600
Didn't you promise me that you'll take me to a theme park?

234
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,010
I already bought the tickets yesterday.

235
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,700
But if we go now, wouldn't it be too late?

236
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,300
It won't be.

237
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,300
Also I've never been to one at night.

238
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,400
Okay, then we should get going.

239
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,450
I'm sorry. The ferris wheel is under maintenance.

240
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,100
It's not open to the customers right now.

241
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,600
Then how long do we have to wait?

242
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,100
The amusement park is closing soon, so we probably won't reopen.

243
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,500
Can you let us take the last ride?

244
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,400
I'm sorry, but it's all full for the last ride.

245
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,660
Senior, I'm hungry.

246
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,200
Shall we get some food?

247
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,500
Let's go and eat.

248
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,510
What tasty things did you get?

249
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,300
I'll have the burger.

250
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,200
Burgers are so good without lettuce.

251
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
What will you do when you're abroad?

252
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,600
Are you going to keep hating on the lettuce in the burgers?

253
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,000
I still have you, right?

254
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,800
Miaomiao, I have to tell you something.

255
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,800
What's wrong? Slow down.

256
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,400
Slow down.

257
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,400
I'm all right. Go ahead.

258
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,200
I'll tell you when you finish eating.

259
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,000
Okay.

260
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,400
Senior, I searched online.

261
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,200
The train from Edinburgh to Birmingham takes four hours.

262
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,500
How often do you think we should meet up?

263
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,330
I say we should meet every two weeks.

264
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,500
If we're really busy, then we should meet at least once a month.

265
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,100
A month is the longest I can endure.

266
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,400
What happens if we're so busy that we can't meet up?

267
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,800
That's okay. Even if we're busy, I'll still find a way to see you.

268
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,600
- I never knew that our Miaomiao has already thought things through.
- Right.

269
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,400
What happens if... for some reasons I can't leave the country?

270
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,450
What happens if... for some reasons I can't leave the country?

271
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,800
Then, I'll wait for when you're able to leave the country.

272
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,000
There should be a postponement period for exchange students.

273
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,200
If you can't, then I can register for a postgraduate in Birmingham University.

274
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,800
Anyway, we will be able to leave together.

275
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,700
What you just said wasn't for real, right?

276
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,580
No, it wasn't. I was just thinking.

277
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,000
But you said that you have something to tell me.

278
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,000
Yes, I do.

279
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,600
I was saying that when the theme park closes,

280
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,400
we'll go and ride the ferris wheel.

281
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,700
Won't we get caught?

282
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,100
You believed that?

283
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,100
Do you think that teasing me is fun?

284
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,300
It's pretty fun.

285
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:32,000
But... really... I have something that I would like to tell you.

286
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
What's wrong?

287
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,400
When you took me home yesterday,

288
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,300
I said "Thank you for buying me drinks".

289
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,300
But what I really wanted to say was,

290
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:53,200
"Thanks that you gave me the motivation to apply to Birmingham."

291
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,000
Without you, I wouldn't have even dreamt of going to Birmingham.

292
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,950
So I want to say, thank you.

293
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,700
Miaomiao.

294
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,300
Can you please not tell me anything now.

295
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,950
There's so much medicine.

296
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,900
What had you been doing recently? A side business?

297
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,700
It's nothing to do with you. Go and play your games.

298
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,000
Liang Younian

299
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,800
Teacher Li, is there anything wrong?

300
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Kaituo, can you come to the model classroom?

301
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,400
Okay.

302
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Bye.

303
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,900
- Teacher Li.
- Teacher Jia.

304
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,600
I just went to your office only to find that no one was present.

305
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,800
Teacher Jia, is there anything that you need?

306
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,920
I was coming to get Xia Miaomiao's first-year grades.

307
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,800
I need them for the "Change of Department" test.

308
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,210
Okay, okay. Can you wait a minute?

309
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,800
I just finished class and I need to tidy up.

310
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
- Please wait a minute.
- Okay.

311
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Are you free to eat lunch together today?

312
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,800
It's okay, I've already eaten.

313
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,380
Can you hurry up? I'm quite busy.

314
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,890
I've just come back to Haicheng from abroad.

315
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,400
Do you have time to eat tonight?

316
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,200
I know... I know, I'll come home and eat.

317
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,900
My mom is so annoying.

318
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,600
Are you done? If you're done, can we get going?

319
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,560
Teacher. Jia, I have something to say to you.

320
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,800
Lu Peng told me—

321
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,000
I... I have no interest in your family matters. Hurry up and go.

322
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,600
Do you know that I like you?

323
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,350
- That—
-There's no need to say anything. I know what you're going to say.

324
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,000
First, listen to what I have to say.

325
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,500
I've always quite liked you.

326
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,000
I've noticed that you've been avoiding me recently.

327
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,800
I may not be your ideal type,

328
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,400
but I've been trying very hard to change myself.

329
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,800
I would like you to give me a chance, okay?

330
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,900
- Teacher Li.
- Teacher Li.

331
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,960
Oh, look, there's a student looking for you.

332
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,200
Can you get someone to deliver Miaomiao's grades to me another day.

333
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Thanks!

334
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,010
What happened with TeacherJia? Why is she running so fast?

335
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,200
Nothing, it's not important.

336
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,100
Oh, yes. Can you please persuade Liang Younian.

337
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,100
I don't know what to do about him.

338
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,900
I'm this close to giving Senior Liang Gang a call.

339
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,700
What's wrong?

340
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,200
He is giving up his opportunity to go abroad.

341
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,400
Why?

342
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:06,500
I also don't know why. He isn't telling me.

343
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,000
Okay, then I'll find time to ask him about it.

344
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,200
Don't find time. Do it now.

345
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,500
Okay.

346
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,200
I understand. Let's talk later.

347
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,800
So why are you giving up this opportunity?

348
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,980
It's inconvenient right now.

349
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,100
I'll tell you when I get back.

350
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,910
Senior, what are you doing?

351
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,400
I've been looking all over for you.

352
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,000
Why are you buying so much?

353
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,420
I searched online.

354
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,000
Lots of people buy these things when they leave China.

355
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,400
You can buy these abroad, too.

356
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,100
But it's more expensive abroad.

357
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,460
But this is too much.

358
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,000
It'll be too heavy to take on the plane.

359
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I can carry it all myself. I can.

360
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,680
There's so much and I won't even be there.

361
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,800
How can you carry all of these?

362
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,980
Be good, let's put it all back.

363
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,600
We can buy it when we're abroad.

364
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,000
I said I can carry it all myself.

365
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,100
One bag, no more than that.

366
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,900
Five bags.

367
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,200
- Two bags.
- Four bags.

368
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,800
- Okay, then let's just take one bag.
-Okay, okay, let's take two bags.

369
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,600
Will you not even let me take one jar of Lao Gan Ma?
 (Popular Chinese hot sauce)

370
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,900
No.

371
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,900
Th-Then I'll bring the hotpot sauce, right?

372
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,000
- Only one packet.
- How about two packets?

373
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Xia Miaomiao.

374
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,600
Okay, have it your way. I won't bring any.

375
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,800
Let's have a look at what else there is.

376
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,200
Even if we look, you still would not let me buy it.

377
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,700
Thank you, thank you.

378
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
Hello, Uncle.

379
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,400
Then let's get straight to the point.

380
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
What do you want to do?

381
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,850
You know that I'm unsatisfied with you, right?

382
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,550
I know you have an ulterior motive in approaching Xiaoyue.

383
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,430
However, there's nothing I can do since she likes you.

384
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,930
So what else is it that you're not pleased about?

385
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,030
Hold on, Sir. You might be—

386
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,330
All right, you can leave now.

387
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,350
Anyway, bear this in mind.

388
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,630
I will be watching you.

389
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,570
You better be careful.

390
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,430
Sir, then I'll get going.

391
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,740
How come you're here?

392
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,510
Don't you know why I am here?

393
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,030
Where are all my roommates?

394
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,540
They are having dinner.

395
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,300
So can you tell me now, why aren't you going to study abroad?

396
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,470
They're all having dinner?

397
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,160
Have you had dinner yet?

398
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,200
Liang Younian, don't change the subject.

399
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,920
You must answer me now.

400
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,590
My phone is ringing.

401
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,230
Don't answer it. Answer my question first.

402
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,390
It's He Xin, should I answer it?

403
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,560
Answer... She's in such a remote place.

404
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,790
What if there's an accident? Right?

405
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:28,230
Liang Younian! Can you stop sending me random things?

406
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,950
I live in the mountains.

407
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:35,730
Why did you send me candied sweet potatoes and honey?

408
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,540
When did I—

409
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:43,170
I have to walk a couple of kilometers to pick up a parcel.

410
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,780
Can I not buy agricultural products from the farmers here?

411
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,510
Are you pulling a prank on me, or are you that stupid?

412
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,660
All right, Xinxin.

413
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:59,950
Then next time, I'll send you some things that make more sense?

414
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,740
Wang Yichao is calling me, so I'll hang up first.

415
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,670
Hey—

416
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,900
Ask Lin Kaituo to come along.

417
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,380
Meet me in your model classroom.

418
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,300
What is this? Are you selling beer?

419
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,660
Don't bring it up.

420
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,860
Xiaoyue's dad reprimanded me today.

421
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,100
Her dad really had the guts.

422
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,920
He dares to bully our Da Chao.

423
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,020
Don't get mad. What did he say?

424
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:08,310
Simply put, he thinks that I'm an ordinary citizen.

425
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,770
Their family is way out of my league.

426
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,470
It's really nothing.

427
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,530
I just haven't been looked down by someone in a long time.

428
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,590
I'm just not used to it.

429
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,760
It's fine when you get used to it.

430
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,880
He Xin just called me "stupid".

431
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,490
We really are birds of the same feather.

432
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,460
It seems that only our Younian is doing well.

433
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
Miaomiao is obedient and mature.

434
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,920
Her dad is often out at sea.

435
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,390
He 's going abroad with her soon.

436
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,940
They are the perfect couple.

437
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,580
He's not going abroad anymore.

438
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,950
What? Why?

439
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,530
My mom's unfinished project has been restarted.

440
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,780
I intend to take part in it.

441
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,630
Then what about Xia Miaomiao?

442
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,790
I haven't told her yet.

443
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:26,990
I'm afraid she won't study abroad if she finds out.

444
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,220
You can't do this.

445
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,590
You have to make it clear to her.

446
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,230
She will empathize with you.

447
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,240
I wanted to tell her.

448
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,510
But she said she would wait until we could go together.

449
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,300
I don't know when this project will be done.

450
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,050
I think that her plans shouldn't be messed up because of me.

451
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,350
She should do what she wants to do.

452
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,280
Lin Kaituo told me to come and pick you up.

453
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,020
Senior, why did you drink so much beer?

454
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,420
Yes!

455
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,750
- Slow down there.
- This place is so nice.

456
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,790
- Don't fall into the water.
- Yay!

457
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,980
Come and sit here.

458
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,580
What's wrong?

459
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,790
Are you feeling down?

460
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,760
I'm sorry.

461
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,830
You're sorry? Sorry for what?

462
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,400
I'm sorry I took your pickles.

463
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:26,180
Who is it? Who broke the lock for the swimming pool?

464
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,100
Who is it?

465
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,740
You young people can date anywhere.

466
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,800
The campus is huge.

467
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,750
You simply have to choose my swimming pool.

468
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,940
You even broke my lock.

469
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,500
Is this acceptable?

470
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,010
What's your major?

471
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,510
What is your name?

472
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,830
Architecture major, Liang Younian.

473
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,230
You have to volunteer work at the swimming pool next term.

474
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,290
If not, I'll file a complaint to your department!

475
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,880
- Teacher, I—
- Don't talk.

476
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,310
Or else, I'll punish you as well.

477
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,830
- Shouldn't you get going?
- Okay.

478
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:14,330
Well, we won't even be here next term, right?

479
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,320
Let's go.

480
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,120
A Little Thing Called First Love

481
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,400
♫  Can you see my heart? ♫

482
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,200
♫  Can you read my mind? ♫

483
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,300
♫  Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

484
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,780
♫  I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

485
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,200
♫  I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

486
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,500
♫  My heart... ♫

487
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:17,850
♫  My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

488
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:30,300
♫  I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

489
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,740
♫  Regarding what love feels like ♫

490
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,860
♫  I've only heard about it from friends ♫

491
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:45,850
♫  I never thought about when it would be my turn ♫

492
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:50,170
♫  You are so dazzling and outstanding ♫

493
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:53,260
♫  I'm just a faint breeze blowing ♫

494
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:58,390
♫  But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

495
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:02,210
♫  Can you see my heart? ♫

496
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,000
♫  Can you read my mind? ♫

497
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,400
♫  Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

498
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:17,100
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over  ♫

499
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,970
♫  My heart... ♫

500
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:32,050
