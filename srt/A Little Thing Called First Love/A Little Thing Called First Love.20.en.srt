00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,200
A LIttle Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,600
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,200
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,200
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,200
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,600
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,600
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,400
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,200
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,600
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,200
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,700
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,600
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,200
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,600
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,200
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,800
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,200
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,900
Episode 20

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,100
So pretty.

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
What's wrong?

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,600
My grandmother went missing again. She already ran out once last night.

30
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,800
It was your students who brought her back. Where did she go this time?

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,400
What do we do then? Should we call the police?

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,100
No need.

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,400
I'll go to the old house and take a look. She always goes over there.

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Wait for me.

35
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,200
Wait!

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Boss, this is?

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Sorry. Sorry.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,600
Grandmother, you're confused again.

39
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,800
Grandmother keeps saying

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,400
"Nian Nian, Nian Nian". Who's Nian Nian?

41
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Niannian is my dad's nickname. His real name is Zeng Younian, right?

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,200
I reckon my grandmother thought that these two little students

43
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,400
were my dad and my grandpa.

44
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,600
Grandma, come, come. Come home with me, okay? Let's go. Let's go home.

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,400
Come home.

46
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,900
Brother Yuan,

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,600
Who is he?

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,600
- Why does Grandma keep calling me Brother Yuan?
- Sorry, sorry.

49
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,000
Grandmother, he's not Brother Yuan.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,400
Take out your picture. Picture. Look at the picture.

51
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,600
- Picture?
- Yes.

52
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,000
It's right here.

53
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,040
It is Brother Yuan. Exactly.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,500
Grandma, you...

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,700
Yuan Brother.

56
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,200
I heard from my mom and dad that

57
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,800
my grandma used to be a renowned embroiderer.

58
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,200
Later, before my dad was born, my grandpa joined the army and left.

59
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,900
After he left, he never came back.

60
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,000
A lot of people persuaded her to remarry.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But my grandma thinks that my grandpa will come back.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,700
She raised me by herself.

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,400
The relationship between Grandma and Grandpa must be really good.

64
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,600
Yeah.

65
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,800
Before, when my Grandmother didn't become muddled, she'd come here and sit around when she had nothing to do.

66
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,600
There, in that backyard.

67
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
There was this ginkgo tree.

68
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,700
Later, the place was scheduled for demolition and relocation, so they chopped the tree down.

69
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,400
From that point on, my Grandmother became more and more confused.

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,600
She only remembers to come here every day.

71
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,800
If the house gets demolished, what will Grandma do?

72
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,400
Besides, this old house hasn't been repaired for years.

73
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,800
It isn't safe for your grandma to be here so often.

74
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,200
Yeah.

75
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,060
We also have no idea what to do.

76
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,800
My grandmother is getting more and more confused.

77
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,000
She doesn't remember anything or recognize anyone.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,400
Okay, I won't bother you anymore.

79
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Grandma, let's go. Let's go home, okay?

80
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,700
Brother Yuan is here.

81
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,800
Time to go home.

82
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Let's go.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,600
Daughter-in-law, Son, let's sit over where Brother Yuan is.

84
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,400
Here, come.

85
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,800
Brother Yuan, look at what a good match my daughter-in-law and son are.

86
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Brother Yuan, look at what a good match my daughter-in-law and son are.

87
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,600
I don't approve of this.

88
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,800
Yuan Brother, what did you say?

89
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,680
Nothing.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,800
What a good match.

91
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,200
Okay.

92
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,000
Boss, go back to work. Grandma's doing pretty well here. Go back to work.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,200
It's fine. Don't worry.

94
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,200
- I'd have to trouble you then.
- All right, all right, you can go back.

95
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,600
Students!

96
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,300
Don't stand here anymore. Everyone, do what you need to do.

97
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,000
What were you guys busy doing? Go quickly.

98
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Grandma.

99
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,200
- Grandma.
- Have some water.

100
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,800
I won't drink it.

101
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,800
Grandma, I got so moved due to your love story that I cried.

102
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,600
Teach me how to do that embroidery. I'll be sure to promote it.

103
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,500
I don't teach outsiders.

104
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,600
Drink water.

105
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,200
Grandma, take a look at this.

106
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,300
You're so disgusting.

107
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,300
No laughing.

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,800
Kaituo, help convince Grandma for me.

109
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,600
Not going.

110
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,000
Do you even have a heart? What's wrong with helping a teacher?

111
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,200
Where is Xia Miaomiao? Why did she leave the grandma after bringing her here?

112
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,900
You're not allowed to hit Brother Yuan!

113
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,800
Grandma, why don't I dance for you?

114
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,200
Stay far away from me, seriously.

115
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,400
Grandma, I'll dance for you.

116
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,800
Ms. Jia, you dance really well.

117
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,200
You can ask me for the favor.

118
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,700
Shut up.

119
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,900
The bed and breakfast owner got us tea.

120
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,340
Thank you.

121
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,420
What are you doing here?

122
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Earlier, Boss said that Grandma and Grandpa's

123
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,700
ginkgo tree used to be planted here.

124
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,100
Here?

125
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,300
I think that grandma is probably the only one who

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,300
remembers what that ginkgo tree looked like.

127
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,200
But Grandma will probably forget about it very soon.

128
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,480
Senior. I have an idea.

129
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Make a model of grandma's ancestral home?

130
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
How did you know?

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,600
Brother Yuan, are you thirsty?

132
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,800
No.

133
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,600
Are you hungry?

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,400
Hungry?

135
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,200
Then I'll clean up the kitchen and we can make food in a bit, okay?

136
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay! You go.

137
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,200
Grandma, I'll help you.

138
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
Lin Kaituo.

139
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,260
Where did you two go together?

140
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,020
I have an idea. Listen up.

141
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,400
Speak.

142
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,600
Let's make a model of the ancestral home together and restore a ginkgo tree for Grandma.

143
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,100
What do you think?

144
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,800
I agree. MiaoMiao, you're in charge of the landscape.

145
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,830
As for you, you'll do the blueprint.

146
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,000
Be my assistant and build the model.

147
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,400
Okay.

148
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,200
Let's start working then.

149
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,940
Clean this up.

150
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,200
If I had known, I wouldn't have said I was hungry. Now great.

151
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,700
Grandma won't leave and we still have to cook.

152
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,400
Brother Yuan, you talk too much. Go cook.

153
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, obedient son. Is this the attitude you use to talk to your dad?

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,800
- Students!
- Students!

155
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,700
Sorry, sorry. You guys still have to cook for yourselves.

156
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,800
You sit. I'll buy the stuff soon.

157
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,600
The cooking utensils in the old house are too old.

158
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,400
Use the new ones that I just gave you, okay?

159
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,000
It's fine.

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,400
Why are you acting nice? it's fine for you, but not for me.

161
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,200
- Brother Yuan, let me help you.
- No need.

162
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,600
- Brother Yuan. Brother Yuan.
- No need. No need. Thank you, Grandma. There's no need.

163
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,000
Grandma. Let's go back and wash the vegetables, okay? The ones you wash are the cleanest.

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,200
I want to help Brother Yuan.

165
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,900
Brother Yuan is waiting to eat the vegetables you've washed, okay?

166
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Try and see if it's salty.

167
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,800
What are you doing?

168
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,500
Seeing if it's salty.

169
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,400
Too salty.

170
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,600
Salty? Then what should I do?

171
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,300
I'll add some more water.

172
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,000
What are you making?

173
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
I'm making egg dumplings.

174
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,000
You can even make egg dumplings?

175
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
That's so impressive.

176
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,300
I've worked more jobs than the amount of salt you've eaten.

177
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,800
All right then, you do it. I'll learn.

178
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,400
Student.

179
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,000
Sorry. Can you help me with something?

180
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
My grandma is making a fuss to see Brother Yuan.

181
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,800
Brother Yuan, did you hear that?

182
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,400
Grandma needs you. Okay?

183
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,000
Go!

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,300
Fine. Then, Brother Yuan is leaving!

185
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,600
Senior, do you know how to make egg dumplings?

186
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
No.

187
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,000
Then what do we do?

188
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,600
Let whoever can do it, do it.

189
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,220
Do you consume vinegar?
("Do you eat vinegar?" and "Are you jealous?" are exactly the same in Chinese)

190
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,020
No.

191
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,970
Miaomiao.

192
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,600
Come out for a sec.

193
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,400
I'm making food, Teacher.

194
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,200
Hurry.

195
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,400
But.

196
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,600
Go. Teacher is calling for you.

197
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,100
Okay.

198
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,500
Look.

199
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Is it pretty?

200
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,600
This is?

201
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
The owner of the bed and breakfast found me this.

202
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,400
Look. If such a beautiful skill isn't handed down, won't it be such a pity?

203
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,700
But didn't Grandma say that she only teaches family members?

204
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,800
So I need your help.

205
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,200
Me?

206
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
How hard could it be?

207
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,600
If I use this embroidery technique

208
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,000
to embroider the ginkgo tree leaves on the model landscape,

209
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,400
it should look even more vivid, right?

210
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,800
Just where are you taking me?

211
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,400
I still have to pick vegetables with Brother Yuan.

212
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,200
Come and take a look and you'll know.

213
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Grandma is here.

214
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,000
Daughter-in-law, where's Nian Nian?

215
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,600
Grandmother, this is your daughter-in-law, right?

216
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,800
Yeah.

217
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,000
She was raised in a good family, right? She's the real thing.

218
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,300
Then, teach her your embroidery skills.

219
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,100
Daughter-in-law, do you want to learn?

220
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,410
Yes, I want to learn.

221
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,100
Can you teach me how to embroider ginkgo leaves?

222
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,800
Of course.

223
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,100
My daughter-in-law is so nice.

224
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,500
You, get out!

225
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,800
Okay.

226
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,300
What's so hard about this?

227
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,400
Everyone can come eat now.

228
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,200
- Come, Grandma. Slowly.
- Okay.

229
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,000
Thank you.

230
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Grandma, come sit over here.

231
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,200
- Can we sit here?
- Daughter-in-law, sit over here.

232
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,100
- Sure.
- Get Grandma some rice.

233
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,800
Thank you.

234
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
Go get Grandma some rice.

235
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,600
- Let me.
- Okay.

236
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,000
Senior, there's a seat here.

237
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,800
Not anymore.

238
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Brother Yuan, let's go sit over there.

239
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,000
Make space for Nian Nian and his wife. All right?

240
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,800
Get up! We will sit over there.

241
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Let's go Brother Yuan.

242
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,100
Let's sit over here, okay?

243
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,300
Move their bowls over there.

244
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,800
Thank you.

245
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Here, everyone. All dishes are served. Enjoy!

246
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,400
Senior, you worked hard.

247
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,800
By the way, Senior, I have decided to use embroidery for the model's lawn.

248
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,700
What do you think?

249
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,600
But this would be more complicated

250
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,400
than the techniques we use to make models usually. Do you think you have enough time to finish it?

251
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,740
But the colors of the embroidery will be more vibrantly vivid,

252
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,000
and I'm using Grandma's embroidery technique.

253
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,800
I think it'll be more meaningful.

254
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,900
- If you made up your mind, then do it that way.
- Okay.

255
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I learned it from Grandma for an hour today.

256
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,800
I'll ask her to teach me this afternoon to embroider the ginkgo leaves.

257
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,100
Once I get the hang of it, I'll start embroidering the model's lawn.

258
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,400
I need about...

259
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,600
Aren't you going to try this egg dumpling?

260
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,800
Senior.

261
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,000
Don't you think an embroidered lawn

262
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,200
fits the style of our architectural model?

263
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,900
Here, an egg dumpling.

264
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,600
Teacher.

265
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,200
Thank you.

266
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,200
Thank you, Senior.

267
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,800
It's so good. Did you make it?

268
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,300
You're amazing.

269
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,600
Oh, right, Teacher. What are the plans for this afternoon?

270
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,800
You're asking me? Ask Teacher Li.

271
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,000
Teacher Li hasn't been here all morning.

272
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,600
That guy... He gathered his students but I'm doing all the work for him.

273
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,200
How funny.

274
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,400
Friends, is it hot?

275
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,700
Yes! So hot!

276
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,600
Li Baiyang! Where is your brain? Do you use your brain when doing things?

277
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,800
Clean the area first before you turn on the fan.

278
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,200
Sorry, Teacher. I was wrong.

279
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,200
I'm going to go out for a bit. If anything comes up, call me.

280
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,800
I finished the blueprint. You'll build the model. Do you need any help?

281
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,390
You can just handle the materials. I'll build the model myself.

282
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:42,960
I am a professional, but why don't I embroider as well as you do?

283
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,600
I'm begging you. Transfer to our major.

284
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,200
Think it through.

285
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,400
Teacher, give me some more time.

286
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,060
There's no time left.

287
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,600
If you don't transfer before sophomore year, it'll be too late.

288
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,000
Be sure to keep it on your mind.

289
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,900
I will.

290
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,300
Help teach me this part over here.

291
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,600
Run the stitch from here.

292
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,000
Why did you change the outer wall?

293
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,800
It clearly isn't Chinese-style openwork on the blueprint.

294
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,920
It's taboo to alter the blueprint without permission.

295
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,800
Don't you know that?

296
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,660
Why do I have to build it according to your blueprint?

297
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,200
There's no character to it at all.

298
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,400
If an architect does whatever pleases him,

299
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,800
and if this is an actual building, this would have collapsed now.

300
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,960
People die when a building collapses.

301
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,000
Will you bear the responsibility?

302
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,360
Can't I just change it back?

303
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,400
Isn't this just a model assignment?

304
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,800
A model assignment is also a building.

305
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,300
If you stick to this attitude, I'll advise you to quit.

306
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,920
Build it on your own then!

307
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,500
Go and build those boring and safe buildings alone!

308
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,000
But don't forget one thing. Architecture itself is an art.

309
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,490
Was that really necessary?

310
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,010
It's not like I did it on purpose.

311
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,900
Grabbing every opportunity possible to teach me a lesson.

312
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,600
Child, wh-where is this?

313
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,200
Why am I here?

314
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,610
Grandma!

315
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,800
M-Mom, why are you here?

316
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,400
You're my daughter-in-law?

317
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
I am.

318
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,800
Where do you want to go? I'll bring you there.

319
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,100
I...

320
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,200
I think I was trying to look for someone.

321
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,400
- Who was I looking for?
- Is it... Brother Yuan?

322
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,000
Brother Yuan?

323
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,800
Brother Yuan. Didn't you marry Brother Yuan?

324
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,600
Brother Yuan... I married Brother Yuan.

325
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,400
I thought of it. I married Brother Yuan.

326
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,600
I'm looking for him.

327
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,200
I-Isn't Yuan Brother right here?

328
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,200
Brother Yuan?

329
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
I am Brother Yuan.

330
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,400
Don't worry.

331
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,360
Brother Yuan is right here. He won't go anywhere.

332
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,600
Let me take you back to rest. Okay?

333
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,200
Let's go.

334
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,400
Slowly.

335
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,200
Why did it take so long for you to take Grandma to the restroom?

336
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,810
I overlooked for a second and she already went into the courtyard.

337
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,800
Teacher,

338
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,200
Grandma almost forgot Brother Yuan.

339
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
Grandma's too pitiful.

340
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,700
She spends her days keeping an eye on her photos.

341
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
I have an idea.

342
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,600
What?

343
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
I'm going to fulfill one of her dreams.

344
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,220
I will do it with you.

345
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,400
I don't want to collaborate with you.

346
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,390
I just want to finish the model sooner, to give to Grandma.

347
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,100
I just want to finish the model sooner, to give to Grandma.

348
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,600
Did I say something?

349
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,000
If you want to do it, hurry up and start.

350
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,820
Are you using Mortise and Tenon Joints?

351
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,200
Mortise and Tenon Joints makes it easier to maintain those U-shaped ones.

352
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,800
All right. You make the Tenons and I'll do the Mortises.

353
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,800
Miaomiao, are you done embroidering the lawn?

354
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,400
It's done.

355
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,400
Okay. Done!

356
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,500
I also got it!

357
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,480
Lin Kaituo, come here.

358
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,200
Come here. I'm looking for you.

359
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,800
Hurry.

360
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,870
Bye-bye.

361
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Just what is it that you want me to see?

362
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,400
Grandma, please wait.

363
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,200
There's too much extra stuffs. I'm not going to wear this.

364
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,400
It's ceremonial. It's ceremonial, don't you understand?

365
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Hurry and go.

366
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,700
You are?

367
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,350
Brother Yuan?

368
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,280
This model is for you.

369
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,200
Brother Yuan wanted me to tell you that this house is about to be demolished.

370
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,800
Brother Yuan wanted me to tell you that this house is about to be demolished.

371
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,100
In the future, don't come here anymore.

372
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,100
If you miss Brother Yuan... just look at this model.

373
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,410
If you miss Brother Yuan... just look at this model.

374
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,300
The ginkgo tree... has grown again.

375
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,960
The leaves are so pretty.

376
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,390
Brother Yuan.

377
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,950
Under the ginkgo tree, we can... chat again.

378
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,200
Under the ginkgo tree, we can... chat again.

379
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,100
Thank you. Thank you all.

380
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Grandma.

381
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,200
You must take care of your health.

382
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,400
We will come visit.

383
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,200
- Grandma, we will definitely come back to visit you.
- Right.

384
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Okay.

385
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,160
Thank you.

386
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,400
Thank you, Children.

387
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:16,680
The gift you sent me, Grandma likes it a lot.

388
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,800
Thank you, Children.

389
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,790
Thank you, Children.

390
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,610
Where is Lin Kaituo and Liang Younian?

391
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,210
They are walking Grandma back to the bed and breakfast.

392
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:03,800
- Did you spend all afternoon embroidering the Ginkgo leaves?
- Yeah.

393
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,350
My hands hurt a bit from holding the needle.

394
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,750
Accomplishing a piece of work with someone you like,

395
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,380
must be a very happy feeling, isn't it?

396
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,610
- Teacher...
- You like Liang Younian.

397
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,630
Teacher Li.

398
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,060
Our model was completed.

399
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,600
Really? Where? Let me see.

400
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,780
Oh, we gave it to Grandma.

401
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,940
- Can I show you a digital version?
- Okay.

402
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,430
Senior has written a more detailed report on the model making. We'll hand it to you later.

403
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,170
Who worked on the landscape?

404
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,870
- I did.
- You?

405
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,260
How did you do the lawn?

406
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,720
It's embroidery.

407
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,100
This is very creative.

408
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,410
I didn't expect you to have more and more ideas on architectural designs.

409
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,820
- Fighting.
- Thank you, Teacher.

410
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,610
Miaomiao, I have something to talk to you about. Come.

411
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:05,800
Hey... I-I also have something to talk to you about.

412
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,510
What is there to talk between us?

413
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,980
Don't hinder me from talking about serious matters.

414
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,150
Hey, hey... th-the serious matter you're after, it's all on my phone.

415
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,530
Hey, hey... th-the serious matter you're after, it's all on my phone.

416
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,180
If you walk away, you'll surely regret it.

417
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:25,850
- Of course not. Let's go.
- Hey.

418
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,530
Oh, my.

419
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:36,900
Teacher, what do you want to talk to me about?

420
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:43,400
You're finding it so hard to decide whether you want to switch majors... it's because of Liang Younian, isn't it?

421
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,020
Is it really obvious?

422
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,330
Too obvious!

423
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,300
Senior is too outstanding.

424
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:05,950
Someone as ordinary as I am, after making so many efforts,

425
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,400
I only managed to get a bit closer to him now.

426
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,750
So, I'm afraid that if I change majors...

427
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,750
But have you ever thought that

428
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,030
if you always follow behind him like this forever,

429
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:27,110
you can only remain as a follower and a sidekick. You're not even needed.

430
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:30,310
Also, I'm not trying to scare you.

431
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:35,130
But one day, if he lets you down, you'll think then,

432
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:39,870
"Gosh, why did I give up my dreams because of him?"

433
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:43,860
During that time, who will you blame? Him or yourself?

434
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,460
It will be too late to even regret it.

435
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,870
If you don't come now, I'll delete it.

436
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,600
Give this some thought.

437
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,570
I'll go debate with Mr. Li first!

438
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,020
Li Sichen.

439
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,400
Li Sichen! Have you seen Mr. Li anywhere?

440
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,780
- He's inside drinking tea.
- Drinking tea?

441
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,350
Li Sichen!

442
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,100
Come out here. I've been looking for you for ages.

443
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,260
The sun has already set and you're still having tea?

444
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,940
Hey.

445
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,950
Why on Earth were you looking for me?

446
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,950
Aren't we heading back soon?

447
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,110
I called you over to come back and pack.

448
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,710
Ah! Wait, wait, wait!

449
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,790
The video of the embroidery that you want, I found it for you.

450
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,110
How is that possible? I

451
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:42,290
couldn't find it for ages. how could you find it?

452
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,970
Wow.

453
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,990
It's really it? Where did you find it?

454
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,130
When I was walking around, I accidentally saw someone embroidering it.

455
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,870
So I recorded it.

456
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,760
Hurry and send it to me. Thank you.

457
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,230
Hold on. Are you plotting something against me?

458
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,940
I..I...

459
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,670
Okay. Don't say. Hurry and send it to me.

462
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,910
Mr. Li, we've packed up.

463
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,480
Students, listen up.

464
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,140
Those from the Bed and Breakfast will carry your bags to your respective buses at 9 o'clock.

465
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,030
Liang Younian and Ling Kaituo, find some students now

466
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,420
to take away these cardboard boxes. Understood?

467
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,950
Understood!

468
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,780
Good, Let's get started.

469
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,150
Okay, let's get a few people to carry this out.

470
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,750
All right.

471
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,330
Ms. Jia

472
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:40,290
Teacher, I have decided to change majors.

473
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,330
Senior.

474
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:27,020
Miaomiao, have you finished packing everything?

475
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,830
- Everyone is getting ready to return to school.
- Right.

476
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,870
What's wrong?

477
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:53,720
Senior, I'm really happy that I've been able to study architecture with you.

478
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,790
Pardon?

479
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:03,180
Goodbye.
