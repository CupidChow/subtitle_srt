A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,550
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,050
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,030
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,150
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,630
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,070
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,020
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,680
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,570
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,620
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,220
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,640
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,550
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,500
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,110
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,580
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,590
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,170
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,060
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,070
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,620
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,100
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,930
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,160
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

Episode 18

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,270
Time Machine Photo Studio

28
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,550
Xin Xin? Why are you here?

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,290
Liang You Nian? What are you doing here?

30
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,070
Didn't I ask you that first?

31
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,010
I went to your house earlier and saw Kaituo come out. So, I followed him here.

32
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,660
What is he even doing in a photo studio?

33
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,280
We're taking a family picture today.

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,920
Kaituo is taking a family picture with you guys?

35
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,670
I didn't hear wrong, did I?

36
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,780
Yeah, you heard right.

37
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,990
Anyway, why don't you come inside?

38
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,230
Forget it.

39
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,190
I feel like since he's here to take a family picture with you guys, he definitely won't be in a good mood.

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,400
I'll just wait here.

41
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,790
Don't wait here. It's the Dragon Boat Festival today. You should go home.

42
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,720
It's fine. His attitude towards me has been really good lately.

43
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,770
I will strike the iron while it's hot.

44
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,740
Stop looking at me and hurry on inside. Don't make my Kaituo wait too long.

45
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,180
Didn't you win? Why are you here to take the picture?

46
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,890
I won. What's it to you if I want to take it or not?

47
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,620
Jerk.

48
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,400
Just a moment.

49
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,800
He Xin is waiting outside, you should go ask her to come inside.

50
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,660
Again?

51
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,270
If she wants to wait, then let her wait.

52
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,300
I don't know why she always follows me around. So annoying.

53
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,840
You have no right to talk this way about He Xin.

54
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,340
Have you really not figured out why she's always following you?

55
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,220
She's been like that since she was a kid.

56
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,070
If you don't like her,

57
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,890
then tell her clearly and as early as possible.

58
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,630
Which of one of you two is the groom?

59
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,180
Y-You misunderstood.

60
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,310
We are here to take a family picture.

61
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,670
Oh, my bad. I'm sorry.

62
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,350
Does it look nice?

63
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,860
- No
- Look at yourself.

64
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,800
Put it nicely.

65
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,210
- I'm really sorry.
- It's fine. We're okay.

66
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,700
I wasn't apologizing to you. I thought your child was a bride earlier.

67
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,540
Pardon?

68
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,370
My daughter can already even be a bride, and he's only taking me to take wedding photos now.

69
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,540
I have to take the two daughters too... Jeez.

70
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,020
- Unreasonable.
- All right, all right.

71
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,510
Why don't the two of you play somewhere else?

72
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,510
- I'll take a couple of pictures with just your mom.
- Okay.

73
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,730
We'll take a few solo pictures.

74
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,190
I'll take pictures of the bride and groom first.

75
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,030
"Bride and groom." How gross.

76
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,030
Shut up.

77
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,300
Please make us look nice, okay?

78
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,420
No problem.

79
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,170
Is this okay?

80
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,400
- Groom, relax a bit. Relax.
- Okay.

81
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,340
- Relax.
- Relax. Quite relaxed.

82
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,850
Is it okay now?

83
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,720
Lean in and pretend to smell the bride's hair.

84
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,460
I don't think that's a good idea. I didn't wash my hair this morning.

85
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,170
It's fine, I don't mind.

86
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,910
It's okay. It looks great.

87
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,310
Is this okay?

88
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,370
Does this make my face look small?

89
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,820
Make my face look smaller in the pictures.

90
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,000
Here, Sir, Ma'am.

91
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,050
- All right, that's good.
- Is that good?

92
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,910
Yes.

93
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,080
All right, look over here. Look over here.

94
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,180
All right, get ready. All right, I'm getting ready to take the picture.

95
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,910
Three, two, one.

96
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,090
Okay. Ma'am, please sit closer. Closer to him.

97
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,400
Yes, that's right. Sir, you can put your hand a bit lower. Okay.

98
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,420
Okay, look over here. I'm going to take the picture.

99
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,690
Three, two...

100
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,490
Hey, Little Brother. Little Brother. Can you look this way?

101
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,600
Here, look over here. Don't make such weird expressions.

102
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,480
Can't you do this properly?

103
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,800
I can't.

104
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,810
Come, come. Look this way. I'm going to take the picture.

105
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,480
Three, two, one.

106
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,670
Hey. That's it. This one's great.

107
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,880
- Eh? Kaituo!
- Kaituo!

108
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,050
Kaituo!

109
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,660
Kaituo! You're done taking the photo.

110
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,070
I'll take you home.

111
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,470
Take me home?

112
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,830
Okay.

113
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,750
Thank you for taking me home. I'm really happy.

114
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,120
I have something to tell you.

115
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,150
I...

116
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,320
Hold on, I have to prepare myself.

117
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,070
You're suddenly treating me so well.

118
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,790
it makes me feel like I added something in the chocolates I gave you.

119
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,320
If you don't like her, then tell her clearly and as early as possible.

120
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,340
He Xin, I actually didn't want to accept your chocolates.

121
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:13,220
We took our family picture today. I didn't want any relations to the Liang family before,

122
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,370
so I've always avoided you.

123
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,370
But from now on, it won't matter if I don't admit it.

124
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,620
We're one family in the eyes of others once they see the family picture.

125
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:31,000
So... you're just like a little sister to me.

126
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,470
You... what are you trying to say?

127
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,190
You're very smart, so you already know what I'm trying to say.

128
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,590
Your excuse is really lame.

129
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,220
Has Younian... started dating recently?

130
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:03,020
Pardon... I don't know.

131
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:08,660
Okay. I feel like this kid has been acting quite unusual this break.

132
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:14,900
One day, his phone kept ringing. I took a look and it was from a girl with the last name Fang.

133
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,830
Do you know her?

134
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,180
- Hello?
- Did He Xin go looking for you?

135
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,920
No.

136
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,920
If He Xin comes looking for you, then send me a message.

137
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,060
Is something wrong with Xin Xin?

138
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,610
If I ask you to send me a message, just send a message. What's with all the rambling?

139
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,110
Well...

140
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,780
I want to watch Balala the Fairies.

141
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,340
I haven't finished watching yet.

142
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,430
You are my older sister, so you should let me watch TV first.

143
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,970
- Hey.
- I'm currently watching.

144
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,630
Because I am your younger sister.

145
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,540
Please.

146
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,410
I don't have a naughty little sister like you.

147
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,870
I am your little sister, so let me watch the program.

148
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,180
Good for you!

149
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,950
He Xin?

150
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,280
I'm not a little sister!

151
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,510
I don't want to be a little sister.

152
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,370
I am the little sister.

153
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,690
Watch your show.

154
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,190
- What's wrong?
- I'm also a little sister.

155
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,500
He Xin, why are you crying on a holiday? Don't cry.

156
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,390
I have made lots of delicious food. Have dinner with us.

157
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,330
Tell me slowly. Don't cry.

158
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:14,910
- Kaituo... said... that I'm his little sister.
- It's okay.

159
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,440
- I'm his little sister.
- Don't cry.

160
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:24,940
What?

161
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,180
Tonight, my classmates are going to set fireworks. I also want to.

162
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,710
Tonight, my classmates are going to set fireworks. I also want to.

163
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,480
Buy me some fireworks.

164
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,400
It's too dangerous. Kids shouldn't play with them.

165
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,870
Then buy me those fairy wands that you hold in your hands. Those aren't dangerous.

166
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,630
I'll think about it.

167
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,430
Go on, keep on spoiling her.

168
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,330
Uncle and Aunt, sorry for disturbing.

169
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,570
- Not at all.
- Sit.

170
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,450
Taste my skills.

171
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,950
Eat, have a chicken wing.

172
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,180
Thank you, Aunt.

173
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,470
Xinxin, don't be sad.

174
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,350
You too, you're not off any better.

175
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,410
What's wrong with you two?

176
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,910
It seems like your moods aren't right.

177
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,550
Actually, people at your age,

178
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,270
it's normal to experience some setbacks when it comes to relationships.

179
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,760
- Your Aunt and I have both experienced it.
- Right.

180
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,370
We've experienced it all. This is normal.

181
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,460
Uncle, then have you ever been rejected?

182
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:53,380
I've been rejected many times.

183
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,080
Back then, I would play the guitar outside of the dorm building.

184
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,750
A bucket of cold water from her put out any hopes of mine.

185
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,190
I would deliver breakfast in the morning, and it would be thrown directly into the trash.

186
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,990
My love letters would be torn to pieces straight away.

187
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:13,090
But that only made me more determined.

188
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,360
Pouring water on me?

189
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,740
I stood outside of the dorm and sang out loud for a whole night.

190
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,650
You don't want my breakfast delivery?

191
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,070
I continued sending it to her the next morning.

192
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,520
Tore up my love letters? Fine.

193
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,710
I would read them out to her loud and clear.

194
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:31,540
Basically, I did a lot of embarrassing things.

195
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,360
When it comes to love, the more obstacles, the braver you become.

196
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,640
Then what happened in the end?

197
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,310
In the end... Let's just say,

198
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,790
"If there's a will, there's a way."

199
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,350
That's why when it comes to love,

200
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,330
It can't be forced, but you also can't just give up so easily.

201
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,890
Do all you can with a clear conscience.

202
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,100
Then, you won't have any regrets in the future, right?

203
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,650
- Eat. Eat.
- Okay.

204
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:07,260
I didn't expect Uncle and Aunt to have such an interesting past.

205
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,350
This isn't my dad and my mom's story.

206
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,430
Pardon?

207
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,100
Tell me more, "Uncle." Why haven't I heard of this story before?

208
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,000
Tell you what?

209
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,660
I was just telling the children a story.

210
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,830
Continue.

211
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,670
The end.

212
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,620
I'm the one who got rejected.

213
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,870
Why is your sigh louder than mine?

214
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,940
I'm not any better off than you.

215
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,590
True. But at least, you're still in the guessing stage.

216
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,390
I was rejected directly.

217
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,760
But after hearing your dad's story, I think he's right.

218
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,750
I haven't given it my all yet. How can I give up?

219
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,620
Oh, right. Lin Kaituo called me to ask about you. I almost forgot.

220
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,670
Lin Kaituo and I don't keep in touch often.

221
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,510
He only called me because of you.

222
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,430
Look how nervous you are, I didn't even say anything.

223
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,840
If only I were as brave as you.

224
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,790
I'm sure there's nothing between Senior Xiaoyue and Liang Younian.

225
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,340
Don't you give up now.

226
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,900
You have to promise me.

227
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,070
Promise me. You have to promise me.

228
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,450
Xia Liushui.
("Liushui" means six waters, since the character for "Miao" is made up of three characters for "water")

229
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,460
Xia Liushui!

230
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,890
Okay, coming.

231
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,080
Who asked for delivery so early in the morning?

232
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,300
It's not a delivery.

233
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,450
Go the photo studio to pick up the photos we took yesterday.

234
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,360
- Let me sleep a little longer
- Sleep?

235
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,370
Look what time it is!

236
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,810
It's already 10 a.m.

237
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,140
What time did you and He Xin go to bed last night?

238
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,410
I got up in the middle of the night to use the rest room, and I heard you two were still talking.

239
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:54,010
No, we slept quite early.

240
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,550
Where's Dad?

241
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,810
He left early this morning to buy a fairy wand with Santu (Xia Yaoyao).

242
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,320
Why are you still here?!

243
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,320
- So lazy.
- Okay.

244
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,030
Getting lazier by the day.

245
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,420
Haicheng Hotel

246
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:08,140
♫ Turning at the corner of the street, I halt my feet ♫

247
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,140
♫ With your appearance, the city is blurred ♫

248
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:21,090
♫ Your face appears to have unfamiliar feeling ♫

249
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,150
♫ Just like a block of wood, I can't move ♫

250
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,440
Actually, I've been lying to myself this whole time.

251
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,730
It looks like there's another one.

252
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,140
His camera had photos of Senior Sister.

253
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,960
I thought he might have taken a picture of the wrong thing.

254
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,230
♫ As if we first met yesterday ♫

255
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,380
He brought her a cardigan in case she got cold.

256
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,630
I thought he might just be too warm and thoughtful.

257
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,990
He brought her flowers.

258
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,470
I I thought since they are classmates, he gifted the flowers on behalf of the class.

259
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,210
♫ Do you also sometimes, sometimes think of returning? ♫

260
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:14,050
He carried her on his back, I told myself that it was normal.

261
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,230
♫ Returning to the yearned times where we were innocent ♫

262
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:24,220
♫ Returning to the unforgettable and beautiful times where we met unexpectedly ♫

263
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,060
♫ I pray to God to let you come with me now ♫

264
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:34,540
But now, I don't know what to even lie to myself about anymore.

265
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,890
He does like Senior Sister.

266
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,410
Is it okay for me to give up?

267
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,600
Hello? Wang Yichao. You're trying to get a girl, yet you're late?

268
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,670
I was hitting the punching bag last night and I overslept.

269
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,750
Why are you hitting the punching bag?

270
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,710
Even though I'm handsome, I think I still can be more masculine.

271
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:07,510
At that time, the muscles I've trained can give Xiaoyue a surprise.

272
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,640
Okay, then hurry over. She's already waiting in line.

273
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,720
I know, I'll be there soon.

274
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,790
You can leave first.

275
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,820
I know. I know.

276
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,090
Don't move.

277
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,240
Sorry, I overslept.

278
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,320
It's okay.

279
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,770
How is it? What did the doctor say?

280
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,500
Do you need to come for another check-up?

281
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,510
No need.

282
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,290
No need? Is this doctor trustworthy?

283
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,700
I think he's quite trustworthy.

284
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,220
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were here.

285
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,860
It's okay, you're worried about your girlfriend.

286
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,980
I can understand that.

287
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,780
We're not together, but I will work hard to be.

288
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,230
Did... I scare you?

289
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,780
Or do you think I'm especially handsome?

290
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,620
The bill and prescription.

291
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,930
I'll do it.

292
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,780
Wait.

293
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,770
Younian just called me.

294
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,670
He said that he has something to do, so he left first.

295
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,910
Oh, is that so?

296
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,520
Originally, I wanted to pick you up together with Younian.

297
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,710
But I overslept, I'm really sorry.

298
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,060
It's all right.

299
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,740
How about you hold onto me.

300
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,570
It's all right.

301
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,150
Slowly.

302
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:13,870
Hey, y-you, can you feel the muscles on my shoulder?

303
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,850
No.

304
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,840
No? They're there. How could that be?

305
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,340
Feel here.

306
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,040
Can you feel it? I'm a walking sculpture.

307
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,470
Here, this sculpture will hold onto you.

308
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,020
Since you're not replying my messages,

309
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,060
I'll go home first - Hexin.

310
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,280
What's wrong?

311
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,430
He Xin's mom called asking if we know what's wrong with He Xin.

312
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,590
Kaituo.

313
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,100
What?

314
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,650
Xiao Tuo, He Xin didn't go home last night.

315
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,640
She stayed at Miaomiao's house because she was in a bad mood.

316
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,540
Did you get into an argument with her?

317
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,540
No.

318
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,950
Hey, y-you really didn't?

319
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,020
I said I didn't!

320
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,310
Why are you asking me and not him?

321
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,420
Why is it my fault if He Xin's in a bad mood?

322
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,680
Kaituo, your mom was just asking, don't get agitated.

323
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,880
Isn't He Xin with you all the time?

324
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,550
It's normal for young people to get into arguments, but you didn't bully her, right?

325
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:22,090
Listen to Mom. Go apologize to her.

326
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,630
Yield to her a bit, okay?

327
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,470
Why do I have to apologize to her?

328
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,040
Why is it always my fault every time?!

329
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,460
Hey, Lin Kaituo! What are you doing?

330
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,350
You don't have to be so loud, I'm not deaf.

331
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,240
Please apologize to Aunt.

332
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,300
Who are you to make me apologize?

333
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,910
It's okay. Xiao Tuo didn't do it on purpose.

334
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:50,710
Aunt, if you keep on spoiling him, he'll just get more arrogant.

335
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,760
- Younian—
- Liang Younian!

336
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,750
Who are you to lecture my mom?

337
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,860
Xiao Tuo, Younian didn't mean it that way.

338
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,700
Don't make it hard for me.

339
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,290
- Xiao Tuo.
- Hey—

340
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,250
Aunt, don't worry. I'll speak with Kaituo.

341
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,350
It's okay, don't be mad.

342
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:30,520
Kaituo. Lin Kaituo. Let's talk.

343
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,610
Talk about what. What is there to talk about between us?

344
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,400
Since you hate me so much, just take your anger out on me.

345
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,830
Don't take it out on your mom and He Xin.

346
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:48,740
Even now you're still pretending to be a saint who sacrifices everything for others!

347
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,630
Don't you find it laughable?

348
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,770
Then have you ever thought that they had done nothing wrong in getting married again?

349
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,110
Why do our personal grievances have to come between them?

350
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,080
Based on the fact that I don't like it.

351
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,760
Based on the fact that I think my dad will come back!

352
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,670
Kaituo!

353
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,450
Stop pretending to be a good person.

354
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,450
Back when they got married, they didn't sacrifice you.

355
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:16,310
It was me. The me who was never taken into consideration!

356
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,230
I'm sorry. I didn't think about—

357
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,990
I don't need your high and mighty self to sympathize with me.

358
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,370
Why do you always want to misinterpret other people's good intentions?

359
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:34,180
Don't you know? I find you annoying!

360
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,090
Sis, Dad bought me a lot of sparklers.

361
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,600
Come down so we can play together.

362
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,450
Sis, don't sleep anymore. You've already slept most of the day.

363
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,330
If our parents found out, you'd be in trouble.

364
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,850
My stomach hurts.

365
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,860
Don't bother me.

366
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,560
Then I'll get Mom to bring you some medicine.

367
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,940
No need. I'll be better after lying down for a bit.

368
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,760
There's really no need?

369
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,070
Yeah.

370
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,230
She'll just make a big fuss out of nothing.

371
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:40,660
Isn't this Xiao Tuo?

372
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,110
Hello, Aunt Zhou.

373
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:48,130
Why are you back? How is your mom?

374
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,780
She's pretty good.

375
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,390
You guys have moved away for a few years now, right?

376
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:58,350
When you and He Xin were little, you guys always used the water hose in the area to have water fights.

377
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:01,730
There would be water everywhere. You guys were so naughty.

378
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,750
Only your dad could—

379
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,820
I remember now.

380
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,110
I still need to go throw out the garbage.

381
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,580
Do you guys know what you did wrong?

382
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:33,640
Tuotuo, will Uncle really hit us?

383
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,950
He won't, he always does this to scare us.

384
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,870
I'm not just scaring you guys!

385
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,510
If you don't acknowledge what you did wrong, not only will you get beatings,

386
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,750
you won't get to eat ice cream, either!

387
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,430
Uncle, I was wrong.

388
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:52,190
Xinxin, how could you be like this?!

389
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,030
Lin Kaituo!

390
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,350
What are you doing here?

391
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,070
It's nothing.

392
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,520
That's true, since it's not to find me anyway.

393
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,660
You... are you all right?

394
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,730
Why? Worried about me?

395
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,660
You're over thinking.

396
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,390
Lin Kaituo, I don't care if you think of me as a sister or whatever.

397
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:28,230
Anyway, I like you. I won't give up so easily.

398
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,570
Lin Kaituo!

399
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,110
What are you doing?!

400
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,660
We haven't had a water fight in a long time.

401
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,140
I'm going to make you reminisce about childhood.

402
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,950
♫ This familiar melody ♫

403
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:49,750
♫ Seems to hug and hide you in my arms ♫

404
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,700
♫ Take you to travel ♫

405
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,920
♫ Feels like time has stopped ♫

406
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,970
♫ I want to live in your heart, inseparable forever ♫

407
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:08,030
♫ I want to chat with you until dawn breaks ♫

408
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:13,140
♫ Counting the stars, a comfortable feeling arises from the chest ♫

409
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,500
♫ This meaningful gaze will make you understand ♫

410
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,910
♫ I want to live in your heart, inseparable forever ♫

411
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:25,010
Xia Santu, go ask your sister where the photos are.

412
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,440
No one's seen her the entire day.

413
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,840
Sis said her stomach hurts, she's been lying on her bed for the whole day.

414
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,440
Stomach hurts?

415
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,930
I'll go take a look.

416
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:43,780
Gosh, why is your room so dark? Why didn't you turn on the lights?

417
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,580
What's wrong, baby? What's wrong?

418
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,180
It's nothing.

419
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,220
How could it be nothing? Yaoyao said that your stomach hurts?

420
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:10,390
It's just that time of the month.

421
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:13,480
It's nothing. I'm fine.

422
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,670
I'll go pour some hot water for you.

423
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:19,000
Did you collect the photos?

424
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,600
Oh, I'll go get them right now.

425
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,650
Can you manage?

426
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,150
Yes.

427
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,010
Sis, after you get the photos, remember to come to the beach and

428
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,630
come play with me and Dad.

429
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,970
All right.

430
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,040
This one is good.

431
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,150
Good.

432
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,360
Excuse me, I would like to frame it with this frame.

433
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,180
It's going to look nice in the room.

434
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,880
Sorry, you would have to pay extra.

435
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,560
I printed so many pictures.

436
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,770
Can't you just give me one for free?

437
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:14,400
- Miss. You're...
- Da Chao.

438
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,920
Miaomiao?

439
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,680
Do you... have conjunctivitis?

440
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,560
Don't stand so close to me. Don't give it to me.

441
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,940
I don't.

442
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:29,940
Isn't this Senior Xiaoyue?

443
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,250
I took them secretly, don't tell her.

444
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,020
You and Senior Xiaoyue...

445
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,080
Oh, I'm pursuing her.

446
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,000
But Senior Xiaoyue is too hard to pursue.

447
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,500
I spent the whole day with her, accompanying her to the clinic and back home.

448
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,420
Then lastly, I treated her to a meal but she still rejected me.

449
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,390
The whole day?

450
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:59,080
But... I'm pretty sure when I was at Haicheng Hotel today, I saw—

451
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,450
You saw us, did you?

452
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,480
We were probably leaving the orthopedic clinic.

453
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,630
Orthopedic clinic?

454
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,920
Didn't you know?

455
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,420
The orthopedic clinic is on the first floor of Haicheng Hotel.

456
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,380
It's really famous, yet you didn't know?

457
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,180
Don't tell me you thought we went there to do that.

458
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:26,740
I didn't think an innocent looking girl like you... would have such dirty thoughts.

459
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,200
- Thank you, Senior Da Chao.
- For what?

460
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,470
Thank you for liking Senior Sister.

461
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,160
Hello, I'm here to pick up the photos.

462
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,590
Hello, can you give me the collection slip.

463
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,260
Here.

464
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,530
A nutcase.

465
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,310
Thank you!

466
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,690
More to the left.

467
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:48,680
Yes. Too much, go back a little.

468
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,220
Yes, that's good.

469
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,500
- Is this okay?
- Yes, it's great.

470
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:59,100
Those two young men have nothing better to do, but give an old man like me trouble and worry.

471
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,400
Call them and ask them to come back.

472
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,920
They just had a fight.

473
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,300
I'm sure they're not in a good mood.

474
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,330
Give them some space.

475
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:12,400
Hmm, space? It's because we gave them space

476
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,550
that the two boys have become so obnoxious and brazen.

477
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,470
I wonder if they managed to talk.

478
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:27,260
Would Xiao Tuo have hidden somewhere and felt sad by himself?

479
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,200
Younain is the same.

480
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,390
He would never willingly tell me what's on his mind.

481
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,220
Here you go.

482
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,830
I heard Architecture Department is going on a trip. Are you going?

483
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:54,080
I'm not. Besides, they're going to the same place as last year.

484
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,820
What's the point?

485
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,270
That's true, but please stay away from school.

486
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,950
Let me and Xiaoyue enjoy the weekend without your presence.

487
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:07,920
Wang Yichao, can you tell me why there's a punching bag in the lighthouse?

488
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,780
Wang Yichao, can you tell me why there's a punching bag in the lighthouse?

489
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,770
My dad told me to get rid of it. I had nowhere to put it.

490
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:15,750
Take it away.

491
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,660
I will, once I find somewhere to put it.

492
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,740
Have a go at it during the weekend. Consider it as the rental payment.

493
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,290
Not interested.

494
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,050
Liang Younian

495
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,990
All right.

496
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,300
Good job, baby.

497
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,120
Isn't this fun? I am so happy.

498
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:33,830
♫ I can't find a way ♫

499
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:37,440
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

500
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,420
♫ I want to give it up ♫

501
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:46,440
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

502
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,850
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

503
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,420
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

504
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,210
Santu!

505
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,530
Yaoyao!

506
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,230
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it♫

507
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,220
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

508
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,210
What about mum and dad? They're lighting fireworks.

509
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,940
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

510
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,910
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

511
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:10,910
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

512
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:14,350
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

513
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:18,910
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

514
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,920
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

515
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,030
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

516
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,430
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

517
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:34,930
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

518
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:50,310
A Little Thing Called First Love

519
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,960
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

520
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,870
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

521
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:15,160
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

522
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,710
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

523
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:24,630
♫ My heart... ♫

524
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:37,210
♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

525
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:49,490
♫ I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

526
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,290
♫ Regarding what love feels like ♫

527
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:59,450
♫ I've only heard about it from friends ♫

528
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:04,630
♫ I never thought about when it would be my turn ♫

529
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,790
♫ You are so dazzling and outstanding ♫

530
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,830
♫ I'm just a faint breeze blowing ♫

531
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:16,740
♫ But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

532
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,840
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

533
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,630
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

534

♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

535
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:35,620
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

536
