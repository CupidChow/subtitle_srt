A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,530
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,010
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,070
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,230
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,570
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,030
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,960
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,560
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,440
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,520
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,110
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,470
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,420
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,520
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,060
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,650
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,470
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,020
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,940
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,960
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,560
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,020
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,900
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,180
A Little Thing Called First Love
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,180
Episode 9

27
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,980
May I sit here?

28
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,550
- Are you in the Architecture Department?
- How did you know?

29
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,120
Every time I go to the Architecture Department, I see you drawing with Liang Younian.

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,880
Yes.

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,820
Wang Yichao.

32
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,060
Look this way.

33
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,780
Salute!

34
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,380
Don't you think I'm super handsome, inspiring your creativity?

35
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,030
- Yeeck!
- What?

36
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,910
Isn't that Liang Younian's camera? Why is it with you?

37
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,810
Let me turn to the side. My side profile is very handsome.

38
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,660
Yes, let me capture your lame ugly face.

39
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,140
I will break your camera.

40
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,960
It's Liang Younian's anyway, not mine.

41
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,950
Liang Younian, why can't I press this camera button?

42
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,330
The memory stick's full. I'll delete some pictures.

43
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,040
Yes. Delete all of Wang Yichao's pictures.

44
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,940
Don't delete my pictures. I'm so handsome.

45
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,120
It's fine. I'll delete the pictures I took.

46
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,410
I have backups on the computer anyway.

47
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,290
That's more like it.

48
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,780
Let me tell you, Liang Younian usually doesn't take pictures of people.

49
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,020
He only takes pictures of dead and lifeless buildings.

50
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,590
How can they be more important than me?

51
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,910
Liang Younian, why is it that you don't draw people or take pictures of people?

52
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,810
That's a little pretentious.

53
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,640
- None of your business.
- Fine.

54
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,050
Let's move on.

55
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,770
Want some?

56
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,440
Where do I put this?

57
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,680
Smile!

58
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,910
Kaituo, look this way.

59
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,480
Can you not take pictures of me?

60
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,580
You are practicing even during break.

61
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,020
Such a touching headline, how could I leave it out?

62
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,650
What isn't a touching headline to you?

63
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,840
Are you insulting me?

64
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,360
Actually, I've taken so many pictures of you. I am also a bit tired.

65
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,440
How about...

66
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,140
How about what?

67
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,140
How about we take a picture together?

68
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,940
Really. If you take a picture with me, I promise to not take another picture of you.

69
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,080
Isn't she trying a little too hard?

70
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,580
He isn't even responding to her.

71
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,070
- Camera.
- What are you doing?

72
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,500
Let's talk it out, don't throw the camera.

73
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,380
Give it to me.

74
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,430
We took a picture together.

75
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,360
Don't follow me anymore.

76
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,750
S-Senior.

77
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,360
Tired, right?

78
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,590
A little.

79
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,230
Sit.

80
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,430
This is for you.

81
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,510
Try it, it's cool and refreshing.

82
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,380
Thanks, Senior.

83
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,260
What is this?

84
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,900
This is for our great team leader.

85
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,430
Thanks.

86
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,400
Here.

87
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,900
Hmm?

88
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,530
How is it? Isn't it refreshing?

89
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,660
It is refreshing.

90
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,530
This is what I thought about after entering college as a way to become alert and focused,

91
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,380
but I have to thank you.

92
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,870
Thank me?

93
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,650
Last time at the basketball competition, you gave me a large bag of these.

94
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,720
What about it?

95
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,120
I put them in my luggage.

96
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,250
One time, I got very tired from drawing pictures.

97
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,960
I saw a fever cooling patch when I was looking for the cooling oil.

98
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,210
When I stuck it on, I found it was very effective.

99
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,000
Haicheng University

100
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,000
This school really knows how to torture people.
 [Banner of Haicheng University]

101
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,380
We have to switch dorms after military training.

102
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm so exhausted carrying my stuff around.

103
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,460
Don't complain.

104
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,000
You two were assigned to the same dorm.

105
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,200
You aren't even in the same major, yet you were assigned together.

106
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
Well, both of our majors had one female left.

107
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Don't be jealous.

108
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
You can come visit our dorm any time.

109
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm not jealous.

110
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,400
I'm just stating the facts, okay?

111
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,400
My dorm room also has an extra bed.

112
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,800
Even if they assign it, they should have assigned us all together.

113
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,400
Besides, we graduated from the same high school.

114
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Wouldn't you say so, Miaomiao?

115
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,400
Miaomiao? Did your wheel break?

116
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,530
I don't know what happened.

117
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,200
It broke just now.

118
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,400
I'll help you.

119
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,000
No problem. I can do it.

120
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,960
Then can you help me?

121
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,600
I can't pull mine anymore, either.

122
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,800
You tell everyone every day that you're going to lose weight.

123
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,600
Just treat this as exercise.

124
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,800
Ex-er-cise! One-two-three-four, two-two-three—

125
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,290
Kaituo!

126
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,600
Do you need help?

127
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,800
No need.

128
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,200
Are you sure you don't need help? Think about it.

129
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,700
Luggage!

130
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,800
She's so naive.

131
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,500
How could she be this devoted after one picture?

132
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,500
You're finally a university student.

133
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,050
Do you have any plans?

134
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,080
I've already decided.

135
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,600
I never thought of applying for the Architecture major before.

136
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,200
So in order to develop my interest in architecture,

137
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,600
I've decided to spend an hour every day outside of class looking at buildings.

138
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,200
What I'm asking is that since you're already in the same major as your Senior,

139
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,600
have you made any plans?

140
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,300
Do I have to make plans?

141
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,400
For example, joining the same clubs or electives as him.

142
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,500
To develop your feelings for each other.

143
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,900
I don't know what clubs Senior is in.

144
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,700
I've taught you all for nothing.

145
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,000
Don't be like that! Wait for me!

146
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,200
Hurry up, the sun is killing me.

147
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
I can't hurry up!

148
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,900
265!

149
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
We're finally here.

150
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,600
We're the first ones here, right?

151
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,400
It's just Tang Mengfei left.

152
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,900
Our dorm room still has an extra bed.

153
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,800
Didn't you say she's the prettiest girl in your major?

154
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,000
Is she like Xinxin?

155
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,200
Pretty and lively?

156
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,200
I'm not sure. I didn't see her during the military training.

157
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,900
Supposedly her health isn't' that good. She's always taking a leave.

158
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,200
Then I'll take He Xin's luggage over to her.

159
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,400
You go, I can't move anymore.

160
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,600
Hi, I'm Xia Miaomiao.

161
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,900
Hi, please move out of my way.

162
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,200
Senior, I've troubled you.

163
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,200
If it weren't for you guys, I don't know what I would've done.

164
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,600
No worries, no worries.

165
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,000
Helping our juniors is what we should be doing.

166
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,220
Oh, right. Which one is your bed?

167
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,000
We can help you set it up.

168
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's that one.

169
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Okay, no problem.

170
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,200
Please move out of my way.

171
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,300
Sorry.

172
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,500
Why is her temper so bad?

173
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,400
You must be Lin Xia from the name list.

174
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,000
You're so cute and chubby.

175
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,800
I'll call you Fat Xia. Is that okay?

176
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,250
No, that's very rude.

177
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,600
It's just a joke. Why are you so serious?

178
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,300
You should joke around more with your classmates.

179
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,800
Don't take things too seriously.

180
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
You look like a fox—
(Fox Spirit - implying she's a seductress.)

181
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,400
Let's go drop off He Xin's luggage.

182
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,000
Let's go.

183
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,140
Until when are you going to follow me?

184
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,800
I said I don't need your help.

185
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,400
J-Just up to here. Just up to here.

186
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,000
Kaituo.

187
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,400
Kaituo.

188
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,800
He left.

189
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,300
What?

190
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,400
He just left with a basketball.

191
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,000
If you leave now, you should be able to catch up to him.

192
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Okay, thanks.

193
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,600
Wow, this girl.

194
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,800
She's too overbearing.

195
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,900
Lin Kaituo.

196
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,100
Why do I run into you and your cousin everywhere I go?

197
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,220
Congratulations on getting into Haicheng University.

198
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,900
I know my entrance marks weren't as high as yours, but you don't need to mock me.

199
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,000
You saw through that?

200
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,500
Sorry, I made you paint on your own for so long.

201
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
It's okay.

202
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,600
- Did you finish the matter of changing dorms?
- Yes.

203
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,690
I've already applied for it.

204
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,100
I'm just waiting for them to find an empty bed for me.

205
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,300
This ladder seems unstable. I'll hold it for you.

206
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,200
Don't get as fat as me.

207
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Just write it later.

208
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,200
You're going to get as fat as me.

209
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,200
You scared me, Bro.

210
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,000
I thought your girlfriend came back again.

211
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,200
- Girlfriend?
- Right.

212
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,600
She even did your bed for you. She just left.

213
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,300
Remember to replenish liquids after exercising! -Xinxin.

214
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,000
I just heard your girlfriend say

215
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,200
that she's the cousin of the infamous Liang Younian.

216
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,000
You know Liang Younian, right? The Fine Arts Club President.

217
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,200
I heard it's really hard to get into the Fine Arts Club.

218
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,420
Bro, you really got something going.

219
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,200
Make sure to help us out after you get into the Fine Arts Club.

220
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,400
She's not my girlfriend.

221
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,400
- I'll reward this drink to you.
- Thanks.

222
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,400
Student, is there anyone sitting here?

223
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,100
Yes.

224
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,800
- Xia Miaomiao!
- Pardon?

225
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,110
Why are you just standing there?

226
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,140
Didn't you ask me to save you a spot?

227
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,600
When did I ask you to save me a spot?

228
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,100
Don't overthink it.

229
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,280
Students!

230
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,400
Congratulations on getting into Haicheng University's Architecture major.

231
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,690
I'm honored to be the instructor of your first specialized class.

232
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,400
I'll make a self-introduction first.

233
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,000
My name is Li Sicheng and I'll be your architectural drawing teacher.

234
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,400
From now on, I will also be the teacher for architectural structures,

235
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,600
architectural physics, and the lab courses you'll be taking.

236
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,400
Moreover, I'm the Architecture Major Faculty Leader.

237
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Let's put it this way.

238
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,000
In your five years here at the university, you will get really sick of seeing my face.

239
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,000
Okay, we have lots of time to get to know each other.

240
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,600
Today, we'll start by talking about this architectural drawing course.

241
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,400
Students who have studied Fine Arts, please raise your hands.

242
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,000
Very good, put your hands down.

243
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,800
Looks as if we have quite a lot of people with a Fine Arts basic foundation.

244
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,200
In architectural drawing, Fine Arts is a really good bonus.

245
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,000
So I recommend those students with the ability to participate in our school's Fine Arts Club.

246
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,400
Don't they say that the Fine Arts Club is very hard to get into?

247
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,400
But the two club leaders, Liang Younian and Fang Xiaoyue are our seniors from Year Two.

248
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,000
They should be able to let us get in more easily.

249
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,000
Senior is the Fine Arts Club President?

250
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,600
You won't get in.

251
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,800
Why not?

252
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Liang Younian is so snobbish. He won't let a person like you through the back door.

253
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Students, don't think of those unethical methods.

254
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,400
The two Fine Arts Club Presidents are quite strict.

255
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,800
Okay, we'll start class now. Turn your books to page two.

256
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,400
Younian.

257
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,000
This red color part doesn't seem to be uniform.

258
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,400
Then I'll do the red layering again.

259
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,900
- You repeat another layer of the white.
- All right.

260
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
It's Senior.

261
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,200
Why don't you use this sunscreen?

262
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,000
You've been under the sun all day, you're getting tanned.

263
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,000
Okay, then let me know when you want to use it.

264
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,700
She even uses the Loreal UV Perfect. No wonder she's so fair.

265
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,660
Xia Miaomiao?

266
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,600
Hi, Senior.

267
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,100
- Hi, Senior Sister.
- Hi.

268
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,790
Senior, I want to join the Fine Arts Club.

269
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,400
Xinxin said the Fine Arts Club has been painting murals lately.

270
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,300
So I came over to find out more about it.

271
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,100
Miaomiao, your clothes...

272
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,200
I must have accidentally brushed against the wall just now.

273
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,000
You can only remove it with turpentine.

274
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,600
Senior Sister, where can we find turpentine?

275
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,300
There's some in the model room, I'll take you guys over.

276
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,200
Hello?

277
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,000
There are no more empty beds in the Year 2 dormitory?

278
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,300
Can you please look again for me?

279
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,000
Okay. Then I'll wait for your news.

280
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,800
Thank you, Teacher.

281
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,800
Senior Sister, our dorm room has an extra bed. Why don't you come to ours?

282
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,400
Hurry. I'll take you to the Dorm Supervisor.

283
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,800
- Such a rush?
- Yes, or else it'll be taken by someone else.

284
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,200
Miaomiao! Senior, please take care of her!

285
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,000
Let's go.

286
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,800
Hi Senior Brother.

287
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,000
Here. You clean up first. I'm going to wash my hands.

288
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,400
Okay.

289
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,420
Do you need help?

290
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,800
Thank you.

291
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,100
I have to go back and change my clothes, too. You can just go once you're finished.

292
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,600
Okay.

293
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,400
Thank you, Senior.

294
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:25,700
School: Haicheng University, Department: Architectural Design
Year: Architecture Year Two
Name: Liang Younian, Design: Beach House

295
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Xia Miaomiao!

296
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,340
You're done for.

297
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,010
Hurry! Hurry!

298
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,400
I'm here, on the side!

299
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,600
Can you guys be quieter?

300
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,400
Go, go, go!

301
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,600
It's time to play ball!

302
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,000
He's made half his model already and went next door to ask for some glue.

303
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,200
What are you guys playing?

304
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,600
Wang Yichao, you're dead meat.

305
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,000
What happened?

306
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,100
Models are the lifeblood of us, Architecture majors.

307
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,000
I would even punch my girlfriend over a model.

308
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,200
Hello? Sister Luxing, Liran just said he's going to punch you!

309
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,000
Be quiet, please continue.

310
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,770
What's the big deal? You guys are over exaggerating.

311
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,600
Based on my relationship with Liang Younian,

312
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,800
he wouldn't do anything to me over a model.

313
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Brother Nian! Brother Nian, I was wrong.

314
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,100
Add on the shoes.

315
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,800
Brother Nian!

316
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,000
Liang Younian! Liang Younian, I'm going to kill you!

317
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Put on the socks.

318
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,100
No, no!

319
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,300
Then what should I do?

320
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,680
Are you looking for me?

321
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,800
If anything is broken over there, it had nothing to do with me.

322
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,000
Senior, I'm sorry.

323
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,700
I accidentally ruined your model.

324
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,230
I can give you my socks that I haven't washed for three days.

325
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,620
It's okay, I'll just build it again.

326
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,100
Th-That's it?

327
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,000
If not, what?

328
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,600
Last time when I ruined your model, you almost annihilated me!

329
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,800
You're so biased!

330
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,000
Stop talking nonsense.

331
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,800
You're so two-faced.

332
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,800
You head out first.

333
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,300
Senior, I'm so sorry.

334
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,100
You can stop acting now.

335
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,230
You really are two-faced.

336
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,980
Xia Miaomiao is such a scaredy-cat, could you not take advantage of the opportunity?

337
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,840
Why are you so nice to her, huh?

338
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Is there something going on between you two? Tell me honestly.

339
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,100
If you touch me again, I'm going to hit you.

340
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,400
Then should I stuff socks into Xia Miaomiao's mouth?

341
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,200
Moreover to me, Xia Miaomiao is just like Xinxin.

342
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,400
My younger sister.

343
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,700
Younger sister?

344
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,000
Do you have sister issues or you just have the desire to protect?

345
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,800
You've been especially gentle toward He Xin since young.

346
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,600
After Kaituo became your stepbrother, you always do his bidding, too.

347
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,000
Now, there's Xia Miaomiao.

348
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,400
How about I call you Big Brother, too? Then you'll treat me better.

349
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
Get over here and help me with the model.

350
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,700
Yes, Big Brother. Let me take that.

351
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,400
Where should I put it?

352
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,200
Over there.

353
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,000
You're back?

354
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,400
Senior Sister has become our new roommate.

355
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Why is your face like that?

356
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I accidentally ruined Senior's model.

357
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,300
Senior seems to really value that model.

358
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,200
He even took revenge on Senior Brother Wang Yichao when he ruined his model before.

359
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,400
And so? Did Senior Brother Liang Younian take revenge on you?

360
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,800
No.

361
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,600
Then did he yell at you?

362
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,200
No.

363
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,100
Then did he get angry?

364
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,750
Then why are you looking so glum?

365
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,160
I don't know, either.

366
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:03,440
I just feel strange.

367
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,000
Strange?

368
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
I have a daring guess.

369
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,000
What's your guess?

370
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,200
No way, no way. Unless he is seeking a soul connection.

371
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,700
What are you trying to say?

372
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,000
I think Senior Brother treats you too nicely.

373
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,800
Does he like you?

374
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,400
No way! Don't make stuff up.

375
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,500
Think about it.

376
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,200
He helped you review, gave you his notes,

377
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,200
and he didn't even get angry when you ruined his model.

378
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,100
Isn't he too nice?

379
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,200
Don't make me have these fantasies.

380
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,600
Miaomiao, Ah Xia, we'll be roommates from now on.

381
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,400
- Welcome, Senior Sister.
- Welcome, Senior Sister.

382
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,800
Thank you.

383
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,100
Hello, there is a form for you to fill out.

384
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,200
Okay, let's go.

385
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
This strategy of mine is awesome, right?

386
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,800
What strategy?

387
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,000
Know yourself and know the enemy in order to win a hundred battles with no defeat.

388
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,200
In the future when there are interactions between Senior Sister and Senior Brother,

389
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,800
we'll be able to get first-hand news!

390
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,200
What kind of news?

391
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,400
For example, I already found out that all the clubs are accepting new students tomorrow.

392
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,200
The Fine Arts Club is known for being laborious and tiring with very high standards,

393
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,000
so not many people will apply, about 20 a year.

394
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,800
This year, they're only going to accept five people.

395
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,400
Five people?

396
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,000
One in four? So I still have a chance.

397
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,600
Fighting!

398
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,600
Senior Sister, I'll give you a hand!

399
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,200
Okay.

400
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,400
I'm really happy to become roommates with you guys.

401
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,200
- Which department are you in?
- I'm in Fashion Design.

402
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,900
Me, too.

403
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,020
Make yourselves comfortable. Sit anywhere you want.

404
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,600
We've looked over everyone's applications.

405
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,600
But since there is a limit on how many new students we're accepting,

406
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,600
we have established two evaluation criteria.

407
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,300
These two criteria are...

408
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,200
One is a hands-on project

409
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,700
to see if everyone can get used to the usual activities of the Fine Arts Club.

410
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,400
And the other one is to see basic fine art foundational skills.

411
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,000
So we're having everyone hand in a sketch before the weekend.

412
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,400
These sketches will be used for the school's Manhole Beautification event.

413
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,230
Right.

414
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,200
Then, according to your performance on the two criteria,

415
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,400
we'll have all the Fine Arts Club members

416
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,200
vote on the new member candidates.

417
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,200
In awhile, Senior Sister Jingjing will take everyone to the mural area for everyone to use their experience

418
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,000
and learn the duties for finishing the mural.

419
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Everyone has to try to do their best.

420
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,220
This is our broadcasting station.

421
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,400
Student, you are...

422
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,800
Kaituo!

423
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,400
What are you doing here? I couldn't find you anywhere.

424
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,000
Hello. Teacher Wang from the Logistics Department asked me to take the key and check on the equipment.

425
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,600
Okay, I'll find you later.

426
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,200
Let's take a look over here first at the broadcasting list.

427
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,600
So why are you here?

428
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,200
If you don't answer me,

429
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
I'll keep on asking you.

430
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,420
He Xin is always so energetic. I didn't think she had this side to her.

431
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
I'm working part-time.

432
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,400
So you're in charge of all the equipment here in the broadcasting station?

433
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,300
You said you wouldn't ask anything more.

434
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
So petty!

435
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,250
Senior Sister, this is the key to the broadcasting station.

436
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,600
I'll be right here. Just find me if you need anything.

437
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,800
Okay, thanks.

438
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
Let's go look at the set-up.

439
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,600
Can you hurry up? You've been painting this color for an hour already.

440
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,600
It's too sunny, I'm going first. Jin Meng, are you leaving, too?

441
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,000
Let's go.

442
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,800
Don't go, don't go.

443
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,300
This ladder is unstable.

444
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,600
And aren't I under the sun, too?

445
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,800
You can take this as compensation, okay.

446
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,900
What is it?

447
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,640
Let's go.

448
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,800
It would've been better if they had just have given me some herbal cooling medicine.

449
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:38,400
It'd be great if someone could give me a Doraemon.

450
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,800
Senior?

451
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,800
This—

452
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:26,000
I saw that it was unfinished and was worried it wouldn't be done in time so I just finished it.

453
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,050
Thank you, Senior.

454
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,390
There's no need to thank me. I'm going first.

455
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,300
Architecture Majors, Liang Younian, Xia Miaomiao.

456
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,160
I think that

457
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,000
Senior Brother treats you too nicely.

458
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,300
Does he like you?

459
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,000
Don't overthink, don't overthink.

460
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
What nonsense are you thinking about...

461
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,200
I don't even get this tanned during the holidays.

462
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,600
It's a little stupid.

463
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,600
How is it? Is it fun to cosplay?

464
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,400
Of course, it's fun. I get to dress so prettily,

465
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,600
always in air conditioning, and there's so many people taking photos of you.

466
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,600
I feel like a superstar.

467
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
I have something to tell you.

468
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,300
What?

469
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,600
Liang Younian wrote your name next to his?

470
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,400
I told you he was up to something.

471
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,000
Don't be so excited.

472
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,700
It's just a signature because I also helped to paint it.

473
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,400
Let's not think too much about it.

474
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,000
Fine, fine, I won't think about it.

475
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,400
Did you get into the Fine Arts Club then?

476
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,400
I don't know yet. But I still need to submit a sketch.

477
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,400
What kind of sketch?

478
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,600
To go on manhole covers.

479
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,900
But I have no inspiration at all right now. I don't know what to draw.

480
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,600
Aren't manholes usually covered with cute cartoons?

481
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Why don't you just draw an animal?

482
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,900
I'll think about it.

483
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,030
I'm going to wear this to sleep in tonight.

484
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,400

A Little Thing Called First Love

486
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,800
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

487
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,500
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

488
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:13,000
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

489
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,600
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

490
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,500
♫ My heart... ♫

491
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:34,400
♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

492
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:47,200
♫ I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

493
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
♫ Regarding what love feels like ♫

494
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,200
♫ I only heard about it from friends ♫

495
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:03,400
♫ I never thought about when it would be my turn ♫

496
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,500
♫ You are so dazzling and outstanding ♫

497
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,600
♫ I'm just a faint breeze blowing ♫

498
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,400
♫ But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

499
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,600
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

500
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,300
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

501
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:27,800
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

502
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,400
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

503
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,600
♫ My heart... ♫

504
