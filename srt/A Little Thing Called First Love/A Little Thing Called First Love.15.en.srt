A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,600
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,200
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,100
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,200
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,600
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,700
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,200
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,600
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,200
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,700
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,600
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,200
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,600
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,200
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,000
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,400
A Little Thing Called First Love
♫ Is the result of Heaven's favor ♫

Episode 15

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,900
Cut!

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,000
Where is the beer?

29
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,990
Where is the beer that is supposed to be in his hand?

30
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,220
I'm asking you, aren't you in charge of this?

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,200
Senior Ning Qun, I'll go and buy it now.

32
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,800
Call him Director

33
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,500
On the film set,

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,900
call me Director.

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,200
Director.

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
- Go!
- Okay.

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,900
Why are all of you still standing around, go do your work!

38
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,200
Someone tell her that when she buys it,

39
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,000
buy a box, but the cheapest kind.

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,400
I will go.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You should go.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,800
I'll go look after the things, go.

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,700
Go on, go on.

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
Everyone, hurry up.

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,400
Miaomiao.

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,600
Hurry. Hurry, come in, come in.

47
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,000
Why are you here?

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,400
You've come at the right time when I just needed help!

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Help me give Lin Kaituo these chocolates.

50
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,100
I still have something to do.

51
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,000
Lin Kaituo!

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Your delivery.

53
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,600
Is it really for me?

54
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,200
Yeah.

55
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Hold it!

56
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't be shy.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Are you still playing basketball or not?

58
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,400
- Here.
- I'll never forget your great kindness.

59
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,800
Then I'm gonna go buy stuff.

60
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,000
Is buying your stuff more important or am I more important?

61
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Senior is more important.

62
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,600
Lin Kaituo.

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,200
What?

64
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,000
You received my chocolates.

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,100
Yes, you still pretend to act cool.

66
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,840
The chocolates were yours?

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,200
Of course.

68
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,200
I even wrote on it. Of course, it's handmade by me.

69
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,500
You can't buy this outside.

70
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,200
I'm back with the beer.

71
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,900
Why did you also buy it?

72
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,200
Younian bought it already. Did you guys not go together?

73
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Senior.

74
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
I didn't see her.

75
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,800
Just put it there. We are about to start.

76
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,900
Put it there.

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,050
Attention, actors!

78
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,600
The main actors will be crying and drinking beer,

79
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,800
but all of you are appearing in the main actor's dream.

80
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,400
Help yourself to eat and drink, and find a place to sit.

81
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay!

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We will— Wait a minute.

83
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,000
It's a little empty.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,800
You go stand there.

85
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,400
I don't know how to.

86
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,400
It's okay. Everyone is like that, you'll learn. Go, go, go.

87
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
- Here?
- Yes.

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Take your glasses off, they reflect the light.

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
- They reflect light.
- Okay.

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,200
Let's try it.

91
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,800
Start.

92
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,000
Hey, Xia Miaomiao, find something to do.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,100
- Eat something and don't just stand there like a block.
- Okay.

94
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,800
Cut!

95
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Xia Miaomiao, who told you to cut that cake!

96
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Do you know how expensive that cake is?! Don't you know how to read?

97
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,600
R-Read what?

98
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,200
On the cake! There's words on there!

99
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Very expensive, don't eat!

100
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,600
I-I thought... I thought it would say "Happy Birthday".

101
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,600
Do you have something against me?

102
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,100
You're going to be the death of me.

103
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,000
Director.

104
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,200
I can film from another angle and not shoot the cake, can we continue?

105
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Fine, go, go.

106
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,000
Three, two, one. Action.

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,200
I slept at 4 a.m., just look at my dark circles.

108
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,800
I look like a panda. How can I go out to meet others?

109
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,200
Wife.

110
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Listen to me. In my eyes, you are just as cute as a panda

111
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,400
A Xia, I've decided to schedule an appointment for Lasik in the afternoon.

112
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,200
What's that?

113
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,000
My girlfriend is the most beautiful girl in the world?

114
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Are you crazy?

115
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,700
Xia Miaomiao.

116
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,040
Director.

117
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,300
Come here.

118
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,000
Come.

119
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,000
Right now, just call me "Senior" and not Director.

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Sit.

121
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,700
I wanted to apologize to you.

122
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,400
When I am working,

123
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,400
I get too serious and easily angered.

124
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,000
So... sorry.

125
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,200
So... sorry.

126
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,400
It's fine.

127
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,000
I was the one who didn't do well earlier.

128
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,900
Things would be easier if her temperament is like yours.

129
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,400
Her?

130
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,300
Do you know Li Jingjing?

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,800
She's my senior in the Fine Art Club.

132
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,100
We were almost together before.

133
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,400
But every time when we were just about to decide to date, we would fight.

134
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,000
We fought every time just before we'd decided to date.

135
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
We would always separate with anger in the end.

136
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,800
Actually, I came back this time just to see her.

137
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,000
I didn't think she's still so stubborn. She doesn't want to meet me.

138
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,000
But I've thought it through, even if she doesn't come meet me, I can go meet her, right?

139
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Right?

140
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,000
If two people were to get together, there needs to be a side that takes the first step.

141
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
Right?

142
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
- Senior.
- Yes.

143
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,000
I think that you shouldn't go find her.

144
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,800
It's fine. This time, I will definitely not fight with her.

145
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
It's not that...

146
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,200
What I mean is...

147
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,250
Senior Sister Jingjing already has a boyfriend.

148
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,750
Oh, I see.

149
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,190
N-No wonder.

150
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,440
Do whatever you want to do.

151
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,870
Don't wait until you regret it.

152
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,150
Senior, where is everyone else?

153
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,300
They went to celebrate.

154
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,520
Are you not going?

155
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,880
I'll go after cleaning.

156
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,400
I'll help you.

157
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,620
No need.

158
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,660
We can clean it faster if we work together.

159
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,740
Hello, A Xia.

160
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,360
Hey, Miaomiao.

161
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,990
Can you go to the lasik surgery by yourself first?

162
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,000
Me and He Xin will go pick you up later.

163
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,280
What?

164
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,100
It's He Xin. She was too excited just now and dropped her phone. Now, the screen is cracked.

165
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,220
I'm going with her to have it fixed.

166
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,460
Let me talk to her.

167
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,960
Here.

168
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,040
Hello? What do you want to say?

169
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,360
You're really too much. It's just that Lin Kaituo just accepted your box of chocolates.

170
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,580
Do you have to be so happy that you dropped your phone?

171
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,650
Don't worry. It's fast to get the screen fixed.

172
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:56,040
So once you finish the surgery, we will be outside waiting for you.

173
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,690
Okay. Then I'll wait for you guys.

174
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,560
Don't worry, you helped me so much. I'll repay you well.

175
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,920
Don't let me be a personal delivery next time and I'll be grateful. Bye-bye.

176
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,690
Let's go.

177
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,840
Let's go!

178
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,940
Xia Miaomiao.

179
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,360
Help me open the garbage bag.

180
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,630
Okay.

181
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,380
Let's go.

182
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,680
Senior.

183
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,020
Yes?

184
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,970
Wait for me.

185
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:06,260
Senior.

186
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,100
For me?

187
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,550
Yeah.

188
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,510
So good, I just happen to be hungry now.

189
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,310
But I can't open it.

190
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,830
I'll help.

191
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,470
Be my friend.

192
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,830
Hey? Haven't we always been friends?

193
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,630
What are you eating?

194
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,800
It's just.

195
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,860
A punctuation mark.

196
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,250
A question mark.

197
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,700
A punctuation mark?

198
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,150
It tastes good.

199
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,530
Let's go.

200
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,790
Okay.

201
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,240
Hey. We didn't even wash our hands before eating chocolates.

202
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,030
Then what should we do?

203
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,380
No idea. It should be fine if we rinse our mouths.

204
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,260
Then we have to brush our teeth, too.

205
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,410
Nurse Station

206
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,740
Xia Miaomiao.

207
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,630
Here.

208
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,750
You came alone?

209
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,270
Yeah. My friends will come pick me up later.

210
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,500
Fine, but remember to ask her to get the eye patch and medicine from us after the surgery.

211
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,070
Okay.

212
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,960
A Xia, I have to go in and do the surgery now.

213
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,910
Just wait for me outside of the Haicheng Hospital Eye Operating Room when you arrive.

214
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,990
- Come with me.
- Okay.

215
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,630
Relax. We are already on the way.

216
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,660
Operating Room

217
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,550
Is there anyone here?

218
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,900
Is anyone here?

219
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,870
Is there anyone here?

220
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,590
Is there anyone here?

221
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,390
Xia Miaomiao.

222
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,300
Senior?

223
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,680
He Xin said that you needed someone to pick you up.

224
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,710
Senior.

225
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,110
Are you that touched? You are crying.

226
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,110
No, it's due to photophobia.
(Extreme sensitivity to light)

227
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,020
I've already helped you pick up the medicine and the eye patch.

228
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,950
Let's put the eye patch on first.

229
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,270
Okay.

230
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,950
♫ I can't find a way ♫

231
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,470
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

232
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,470
♫ I want to give it up ♫

233
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:28,450
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

234
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,980
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

235
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,480
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

236
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,520
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

237
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,000
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

238
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,980
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

239
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,980
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

240
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,390
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

241
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,010
Didn't you send me chocolates?

242
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,870
Now, it's my turn to gift in return.

243
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,730
What is it?

244
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,050
You will know once you get back.

245
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,630
Okay.

246
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,230
Let's go.

247
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,800
Okay.

248
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,610
Get up.

249
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,260
Medicine Bag

250
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,120
Celebrating Haicheng University's 80th Anniversary
♫ If this is love ♫

251
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,560
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

252
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,680
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

253
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,750
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

254
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,140
Celebrating Haicheng University's 80th Anniversary

255
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,390
Let's see where you can run off to this time.

256
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,190
Teacher, return it to me.

257
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,560
I'll give it back to you if you agree to be the male lead in my play.

258
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,580
Teacher, I've already said it several times that I'm not interested.

259
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,820
You're going to be the set designer of our play anyway.

260
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,230
Being the male lead along the way won't take too much of your time, right?

261
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,390
But it's going to spoil my mood.

262
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,980
Nothing I can do, I have a lot of time on my hands.

263
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:57,940
Teacher, what on Earth makes you think, I can be the male lead? I can change it.

264
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,950
Handsome.

265
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,460
- Then I'll—
- Can't change that, can you?

266
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,890
Hey, Liang Younian. Why are you sitting here?

267
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,200
Jia Yin? Why is it you again?

268
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,400
Teacher Li, I'm here to hand in the Model class homework.

269
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,000
And my model is now in the hands of TeacherJia.

270
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,800
I'll be leaving first then.

271
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,400
Give me the homework.

272
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,600
This is my "hostage". I'm going make him the male lead.

273
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,800
I don't care! That's your business! Give it to me!

274
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
- Give it to me!
- No!

275
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,000
- Give it!
- It's mine.

276
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
- Give it!
- No way!

277
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,800
Hurry and see if there are any problems.

278
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Why are you looking at me? I'm telling you to look at this.

279
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,600
You said it was your hostage?

280
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,400
Does the kidnapper still cares about the hostage?

281
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,600
I am a teacher. I have to worry about a student's project first.

282
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Second, I respect art.

283
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,400
I'm telling you, you have to take the responsibility if it's broken.

284
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,800
How many costumes have we made so far?

285
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,600
This is the third one. Luckily, you're here to help me or else I wouldn't know what to do.

286
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,600
If it weren't for the fact that I did too little credits last semester,

287
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,800
I have to depend on making costumes for the school anniversary's musical in order to make up for it,

288
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,400
I wouldn't have done it.

289
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,800
It's fine. We will work hard together.

290
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Right now, you have other things you need to work hard on.

291
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
Senior!

292
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Senior.

293
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,200
Where are you going?

294
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,400
I'm going to find Teacher Jia Yin to discuss the set design.

295
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,200
She's just up ahead. Let's go together.

296
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,100
Senior, you are the male lead?

297
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,800
Teacher, I already have dance activities. Can I still participate in the musical?

298
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,400
Of course, you can. We don't turn anyone away.

299
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,800
- Thank you, Teacher.
- No problem.

300
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,500
Next.

301
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,000
Thank you.

302
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,800
Teacher.

303
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,400
Male lead.

304
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,020
I clearly told you that I wasn't going to do it.

305
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,200
I'm not going to be the male lead.

306
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,200
Little Nian, Little Nian.

307
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,600
Come.

308
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Give me some dignity and help me out.

309
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,300
Let me borrow your face first to boost popularity.

310
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,900
After I find someone else, we'll replace you immediately. Okay?

311
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,100
Okay, so it's decided.

312
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,200
Take care of your health.

313
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,370
Make sure you don't have dark circles.

314
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,400
I'll notify you when we have the rehearsals.

315
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Chubby Xia, the clothes are done?

316
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,600
Let me see.

317
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
These clothes—

318
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,600
Teacher.

319
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,800
Don't stay around here, don't you need to go take photos of the theatre?

320
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,400
Hurry and go, tell me when you're done.

321
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,600
Teacher, about the male lead.

322
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,020
Don't say anymore.

323
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,000
Can't you tell that I'm busy and that there are a lot of people?

324
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,200
Give me some dignity. Hurry up and go.

325
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,770
Let me tell you, Chubby Xia,

326
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,000
I think the fabric is a bit lacking on these clothes.

327
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,500
Look.

328
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,800
This design has to be a bit more detailed.

329
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,000
- Xia Miaomiao?
- Pardon?

330
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,800
You did it?

331
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,600
Yes, did it.

332
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,800
No wonder you're as pretty as me now!

333
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
So pretty.

334
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Run. Don't stand there. Run.

335
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,400
Whatever, I'm not playing anymore.

336
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,600
She's here again.

337
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,900
I'm leaving.

338
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,000
Kaituo.

339
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,800
Why are you here?

340
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,400
I knew that you would be here.

341
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,300
Starting from tomorrow, I'll have to go with my teacher to do

342
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,200
a special interview on the children left behind in the countryside (their parents are in the city working).

343
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,100
I'm afraid that you would miss me too much, so I came over to let you see me.

344
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,400
Are you thirsty?

345
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,800
No.

346
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,000
Then are you hungry?

347
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,500
No.

348
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,800
Drink this.

349
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,800
You clearly accepted my chocolates before.

350
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,000
You're acting all cool again now.

351
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,900
Seriously.

352
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,800
Give this to me. Shut your mouth.

353
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,600
Don't follow me.

354
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,200
Seriously... cute.

355
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,000
Fashion Design

356
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,700
80th Anniversary School Play "First Love" Female Lead Sign Up Form

357
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,800
Why do you have this?

358
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,600
I grabbed one for you.

359
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,000
What did you grab this for?

360
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Your Senior is the male lead. Of course, you have to work hard and become the female lead.

361
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,400
Then... even if I want to, I have to be able to pull it off.

362
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,000
Even if you can't become the female lead, just acting a small role

363
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,900
will give you more opportunities to interact with him.

364
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,400
Xia Miaomiao, you are attending, too?

365
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,000
I suddenly feel a lot of pressure.

366
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Don't argue with her.

367
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,200
Think about it, what if your Senior Liang Younian and Tang Mengfei develop feelings for each other?

368
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,100
Can you stand it?

369
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,200
No.

370
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:57,300
University of Hai 80th Anniversary Theatrical Assembly

371
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,950
Teacher Jia.

372
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,000
Teacher Jia.

373
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,100
I'm not going to talk about the male lead part.

374
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
Can you help me look at the set?

375
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,700
You should've said so earlier.

376
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,000
How is it so far?

377
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Right now, we're still working hard to place a pillar.

378
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Let me take a look.

379
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Like this and this, but I don't know what color to use.

380
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What color is the background?

381
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,700
The background is this one, the rural one, rural style.

382
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,370
Because it's supposed to be the feeling of first love,

383
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,300
so it's better if it's pink or Tiffany blue.

384
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,400
And this one, the audience side, give me two gauze curtains.

385
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,000
- On both sides?
- Yes.

386
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Make it dreamier.

387
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,200
- Then I'll work on the two sides.
- Okay.

388
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,800
For the background, aside from using this image,

389
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,600
I'll also use another for this side.

390
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,200
Okay.

391
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,600
Then for these two sides, I'll also put up some sceneries.

392
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
Okay.

393
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
I understand now.

394
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,000
Then the stage will look similar to this.

395
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,600
Okay. You work first.

396
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,400
- I'm going to choose the female lead first.
- Okay.

397
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,200
Hello, my pretty flowers.

398
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Let me introduce you to the play.

399
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,000
For our play, emotion is very important.

400
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,400
There is a very important scene, a crying scene.

401
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,800
So right now, build up your emotions and we'll start crying in a bit.

402
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,000
Okay.

403
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,400
I'll give you the scripts.

404
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,600
What if I can't cry?

405
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,000
What are you worried about? If you can't cry, other people can't, either.

406
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,200
Look at Tang Mengfei.

407
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,600
Between you and her, who looks like a capable actress.

408
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,600
Me.

409
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,200
Exactly.

410
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,700
She won't be able to cry. Look at her.

411
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:14,000
If the person you like can be your driving force,

412
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,400
even if you can't be together,

413
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,900
it's still worth it.

414
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,400
Cut!

415
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,200
Tang Mengfei, extremely good. I announce you as the first runner-up.

416
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,000
Hurry and sit beside me, I'll discuss the character with you.

417
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,900
Next!

418
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,600
What do I do? I can't cry.

419
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,800
I have an idea.

420
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,800
Your turn.

421
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,700
- If the person you like can be your driving—
- Okay, that's enough. Next.

422
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,600
What did you apply?

423
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,000
I can't open my eyes. I'm tearing up.

424
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm tearing up.

425
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,200
I can't open my eyes.

426
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,600
Xia Miaomiao?

427
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,370
Wow.

428
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You haven't even gone up and you're already tearing up.

429
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,200
Are you a genius? How are you so expressive?

430
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,800
- No—
- I announce you as the second runner-up.

431
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,200
Who else

432
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,400
has acting skills like Xia Miaomiao? Come out for a little battle.

433
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,800
Genius!

434
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,100
Xia Miaomiao, You are too great. I'll go find some eye drops.

435
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,400
In the end, youth is but a faded painting that has not been repaired for years.

436
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,800
A light touch will disperse it into the wind.

437
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,400
Think of who gives us that moment, that feeling of love.

438
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Every time we meet, every time you turn around to look at me,

439
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,000
- A Xia, help me drop them.
 - I pretend not to know.

440
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
- I can't see.
 - Actually, I'm getting closer step by step.

441
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,200
- A Xia!
 - To confirm your feelings.

442
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,300
- A Xia.
 - So today, I want to ask..

443
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,100
What brings you here?

444
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,600
I'm waiting for you.

445
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,350
Why are you waiting for me?

446
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,820
Younian went to deal with the stage design stuff.

447
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,430
He told me to go with you to the architecture department first and organize the outstanding projects from previous years.

448
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,470
He will come soon.

449
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:46,490
Oh, right, aren't you the emcee of the school assembly? Don't you have rehearsals?

450
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:50,810
I don't have rehearsals. I'll just find somewhere to run through my lines.

451
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,550
Okay.

452
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,260
Let's go then.

453
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,900
What are you holding?

454
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,330
I've designed a batch of the school's cultural T-shirts.

455
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:10,910
For the anniversary, I'm planning on making a big profit.

456
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,990
It's actually kind of pretty.

457
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,890
Really?

458
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:23,760
Then I'll give it to you. Actually, I'll do a tailored one for you.

459
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,590
I don't need it.

460
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,910
Hey, Wang Yichao!

461
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,220
You came. Look at this.

462
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,580
This graphic design is very interesting.

463
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,800
- Eighty-five points, Zhou Bin?
- Yeah.

464
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,740
It's a project from some-twenty years ago.

465
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,400
Can you not talk? We have been waiting for you for so long. Hurry and take pictures.

466
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,780
Okay.

467
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,300
Okay, next.

468
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:29,830
Hey, can you guys work on different things?

469
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:34,620
These original files have to be submitted to the school library, we'll just keep the electronic files.

470
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,500
Younian, format these and upload them to the computer.

471
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,240
Okay.

472
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,340
Quickly, quickly. Move fast.

473
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,500
Okay.

474
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,150
Next, I'm going to announce the results of the audition.

475
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:24,070
Female lead, Tang Mengfei, understudy is Xia Miaomiao.

476
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:28,700
Second female lead, Lu Xiaoyan, understudy is Zhang Xinyi.

477
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,300
- Look at her gloating.
 - Supporting actress, Wang Xiaoyi.

478
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,800
Understudy is Xue Qinglu.

479
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,340
But she really can act crying scenes well.

480
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,890
And you're defending her?

481
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,010
Hey! Where are you going?

482
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,710
You've got the part, I'm going to sleep.

483
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:51,800
In a little bit, we'll analyze the characters and then the focus is the run through the scenes with the two leads.

484
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,380
Liang Younian.

485
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,580
Where's Liang Younian?

486
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,600
He went to organize information for our department head.

487
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,140
Don't leave. I'll be back soon.

488
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:27,250
I must steal Liang Younian back from Li Sicheng's hands, and I must find another guy to be the understudy!

489
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,140
I'll even find him from the architecture major to piss off that old man!

490
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,100
Hey! What are you guys doing? Next time, be careful not to hit somebody.

491
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,070
Sorry.

492
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,910
Student, help me get the ball.

493
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,890
Thank you.

494
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,980
Wait.

495
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,100
Student, what major are you?

496
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,290
Architecture Major.

497
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,800
This is about the feelings of first love and it'll be super romantic.

498
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,540
A guy standing like this will be super handsome, a lot of girls will like him. It's true.

499
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,450
I won't do it.

500
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,190
Don't be in such a rush to reject me.

501
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,150
Let me analyze this character for you.

502
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,630
- Look at this character.
- No need.

503
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,130
Student!

504
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,860
Li Sicheng. Li Sicheng!

505
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,890
Teacher Li isn't here.

506
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,780
Liang Younian, don't hide. I can see you.

507
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,530
Liang Younian.

508
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,090
Teacher, look for someone else.

509
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:49,790
I've already found the female lead, I'm just missing the male to come in for practice.

510
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:52,660
I promised you that once I found another candidate, I'd remove you from the position.

511
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,470
Can you please come with me to rehearse?

512
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,650
Teacher, who is the female lead?

513
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,530
Female.

514
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,820
Why are you here?

515
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:08,250
Don't you know that the architecture and fashion majors don't get along? Traitor!

516
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,260
I am helping Younian.

517
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:15,700
Since when did the two majors not get along well? How come I didn't know?

518
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,880
I just announced it, okay?

519
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,940
Okay.

520
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:23,880
Teacher, so who is the female lead?

521
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,270
Tang Mengfei and Xia Miaomiao.

522
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,110
Are you sure you're not going to participate in the rehearsal?

523
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:46,690
Fine. Then in the future, Wang Yichao will have to copy each assignment at least ten times in my classes.

524
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,800
Teacher, what does this have to do with me?

525
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,110
You are his best friend.

526
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:56,350
Liang Younian won't go to rehearsal just for me.

527
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,770
Teacher.

528
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,820
I'll go with you.

529
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:14,990
That's the spriit. Let's go to the rehearsal.

530
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,310
Look at how well he treats you.

531
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,020
I didn't think

532
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,900
that I'd have such an important place in your heart.

533
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,310
Continue with that.

534
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,740
Let's continue. Where were we?

535
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,350
Okay, quiet on set. We're going to rehearse the main part of the play.

536
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,460
Quiet!

537
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:50,070
Okay?

538
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,700
Start.

539
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,990
Don't stress. Relax.

540
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,250
Ready.

541
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,590
Action!

542
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,640
Every time we meet, every time you turn back to look at me...

543
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,660
Look at her.

544
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,980
Pay attention to your partner. At this time, there's no one else, You only have eyes for her.

545
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,710
One more time.

546
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,820
Every time we meet,

547
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,630
every time you turn back to look at me,

548
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,750
I pretend not to know.

549
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:58,530
Actually, I'm approaching you, step by step to confirm your feelings.

550
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,210
Today, I want to ask you.

551
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:11,060
Can we be together?

552
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:04,680
