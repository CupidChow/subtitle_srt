Episode 5

27
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,250
Thank you so much for today, Senior.

28
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,830
Good luck on the exam.

29
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,430
I'll get going.

30
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,050
Senior!

31
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,650
May I get your home phone number?

32
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,840
Wh-Wh-What I want to say is that...

33
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,160
If I-I have problems that I-I don't know... I-I can ask you, right?

34
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,370
I-If you don't want to then, that's...

35
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,890
I don't believe that you'll be able to memorize it.

36
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,730
Thank you.

37
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,490
I'm leaving.

38
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,580
Dad, can't you pick up the phone?

39
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,000
They're not looking for me so why should I answer?

40
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,890
Hello?

41
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,750
Hello, can you hear me?

42
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,100
I... I can hear you.

43
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,420
Senior... I am Xia Miaomiao.

44
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,290
Oh, Xia Miaomiao.

45
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,030
Senior, I got a passing grade on the re-test.

46
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,080
Furthermore, I even got a B.

47
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,060
Is that so? Congratulations.

48
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,020
Thanks, Senior.

49
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,740
There will always be good results if you work hard.

50
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,720
Why do I always see you like this every morning?

51
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,690
I've been doing practice problems.

52
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,710
Let me take a look at your math practice test, from question 38.

53
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,700
The reference answers are all vague. I can't copy them even if I wanted to.

54
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,870
You've really completed all of the problems?

55
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,920
How could there be such big differences between humans?

56
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,160
Look at how I look right now. I've only completed half the problems and I already look like this.

57
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,480
You've finished everything, yet you still look so handsome! Take a look at the rest of the class.

58
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,080
Look at what they've all become.

59
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,910
Did you secretly take some kind of a drug?

60
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,230
Give it to me. I want it, too. Hand it over.

61
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,750
Stop rambling. Hurry up and look at it.

62
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,400
I'll look at it after the physical exercise class.

63
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,510
Let me tell you. We must strike a proper balance between work and rest. You just don't get it.

64
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,920
Play basketball with me later.

65
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,420
Change gym class into math class.

66
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,260
I'm already really quiet.

67
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,310
You sleep every day. Even the seniors don't look as tired as you.

68
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,730
83841184

69
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,620
Who said you could see that?

70
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,040
Were you drawing Liang Younian?

71
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,010
No, I was just casually drawing.

72
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,200
I saw Liang Younian's home phone number on there.

73
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,220
That's...

74
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,890
That was the day of the re-test, then...

75
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,330
How did you know it was Senior's home phone number?

76
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,390
Don't the two of you have a really bad relationship? Yet you remember his phone number?

77
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,850
The last time I went to the art studio, I remembered it after seeing it once.

78
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,200
What? Is there a problem?

79
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,300
You've also been to the art studio?

80
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,100
How come I've never seen you?

81
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,580
Then have you met the teacher's wife? Isn't she just so gentle?

82
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,070
It would be great if my mom was like his mom.

83
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,450
No wonder.

84
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,410
If his mother is already this gentle, then, of course, Senior would be, too.

85
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,380
What do you know?

86
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,850
Did I say something wrong again?

87
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,840
Xia Miaomiao.

88
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,770
Senior.

89
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,390
Don't be nervous. I'm sorry if I scared you.

90
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,930
You didn't, I just didn't expect

91
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,980
that you, as a senior already, would still have time to come draw.

92
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,500
It's stressful being in school all the time, so I wanted to come here to relax.

93
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,530
Relax?

94
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,290
Why do I feel like drawing is even more tiring than lectures?

95
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,750
You're preparing for the art exam right now, so it must be tiring.

96
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,040
Although, I'm not afraid. I will definitely work hard.

97
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,950
I will do my best to get accepted to the University of Haicheng's Fashion Design Major.

98
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,200
Then work hard. I wish you all the best and I hope to see you at Haicheng University.

99
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,510
Senior, are you also planning on applying to Haicheng University?

100
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,170
I thought that because your grades are so good, you would want to go to Peking University.

101
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,060
Haicheng University has the best Architecture Major in the country.

102
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,610
My mom also graduated from there.

103
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,080
No wonder.

104
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,790
Your mother seems like she knows a lot about art.

105
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,890
She and Teacher Liang seem to have such a loving relationship.

106
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:09,270
- What are you drawing?
- Pardon? Nothing.

107
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,210
Let me see.

108
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,410
I didn't draw it well.

109
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,000
That's why I wanted you to let me see.

110
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,520
I'll teach you.

111
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,410
You draw pretty well. It's just that... He Xin's proportions look kind of off.

112
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,320
He Xin?

113
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,180
Aren't you drawing He Xin watching Kaituo playing basketball?

114
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:56,280
Yes! He Xin's proportions look off?

115
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,490
Come here and look.

116
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,550
7 for standing, 5 for sitting, 3.5 when sitting cross-legged. 3 for the torso, 4 for the legs, and 1 for the feet.
(T/N: Numbers are the length in oval shaped heads).

117
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Usually, when a person is standing, they are around seven heads tall and their legs are four heads.

118
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,860
You can count how many you've drawn.

119
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,160
Why is He Xin also wearing glasses?

120
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,350
Because...

121
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:46,390
Because she said she wants to know if she looks good in glasses so I drew her wearing them to see.

122
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,710
- Then remember to fix it well.
- Okay.

123
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,210
Hello, Mr. Ye.

124
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,090
Wake him up. Then come with me, both of you.

125
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,650
What is it?

126
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,100
Coach, what's going on?

127
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,990
Coach?

128
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,560
For our team to be able to make it to the finals for the intercollegiate league tournament this time

129
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,890
was, to be honest, not an easy feat.

130
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,260
We know that. But, Younian and I haven't played for the basketball team in a very long time.

131
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,950
So, this honor doesn't really have anything to do with us.

132
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,810
I want the two of you to come back and play in the competition.

133
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,710
What?

134
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,780
Someone from the team tore a ligament

135
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,130
and right now, there's no one on the team who has the ability to fill his position.

136
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:14,300
Lin Kaituo, that little punk, is still mad about the uniform incident last time, so he doesn't want to come back to help.

137
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,700
If this continues, we will definitely lose the competition.

138
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,200
I had no choice but to come and ask you two to come back.

139
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:30,050
Coach, we're currently preparing for the college entrance exam. We don't have the freedom to act freely right now.

140
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:37,080
The main thing is, our opponent for the finals is Hai City Second High School (HCEZ) again.

Aren't we brothers?

149
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,260
Let me tell you. You guys played really well in the first half. Let's continue that in the second half, okay?

150
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,510
Lin Kaituo, why does your phone keep on ringing during the game? Hurry and go pick it up.

151
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,870
Okay.

152
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,120
Listen well to the game strategy, okay? Play well in the second half.

Go HCEZ! Go HCEZ!

158
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,790
- HCEZ
- Fighting!

159
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,360
Hai City Second High!

160
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,640
- HCEZ.
- Ggo!

161
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,770
Wait.

162
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,310
[HDFZ - 79, HCEZ - 58 to 60]

163
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,140
They fouled us!

164
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,920
Defense! Defense!

165
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,200
HCEZ, fighting!

166
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,160
Go, HCEZ!

167
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,260
Foul!

168
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,960
They fouled us. That was a foul!

169
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,530
They fouled!

170
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,220
They fouled!

171
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,150
That was a foul!

172
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,580
- Kaituo.
- This has nothing to do with you, go away.

173
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:29,650
Didn't we already talk this through?... Why did you still agree to it?

174
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,460
You really do know how to put on an act.

175
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,640
Kaituo.

176
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:01,550
Let me ask you. Don't you want to beat HCEZ in the ground by winning the championship and release some of that anger?

177
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,330
I'm in.

178
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,920
Me too.

179
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,580
With the two of you, we've got the championship in the bag.

180
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,350
If that little punk, Lin Kaituo, came back, that would be even better.

181
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,690
Younian, what exactly happened between the two of you?

182
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,760
Coach, the two of us still need to study, so we'll be going now. Talk to you later.

183
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,390
It's really different after not playing basketball for a while.

184
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,030
My hands feel unfamiliar. Otherwise, there's no way you could've blocked me earlier.

185
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,940
Is that so?

186
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,230
I let you try for the three-pointers so many times, but you didn't even make one shot.

187
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:52,420
I just haven't gotten the rhythm back yet. You know how I am with my three-point—

188
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,010
So sorry about that.

189
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,880
Kaituo!

190
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,550
Why are you delivering take-out?

191
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,190
You just turned 18 and you already can't wait to work?

192
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,550
Liang Younian, did you see him?

193
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,260
Let's go.

194
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,100
So interesting.

195
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,530
Younian, you're back. Are you hungry?

196
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,790
Where did you go that you came back so late? Don't you know we're waiting for you, to start dinner?

197
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,560
The college entrance exam is coming up, he was probably studying and forgot the time. Right?

198
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,600
Although I know that studying for the college entrance exam is quite stressful,

199
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,520
remember to take care of your health and not work your body too hard.

200
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,740
I understand.

201
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,980
Go wash your hands first. We can start dinner once I finish cooking the bok choy.

202
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,350
It's time for dinner.

203
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,520
You two are always the compassionate mother and filial child.

204
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,720
Isn't it uncomfortable having me as an extra addition?

205
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,150
I think eating cold food is uncomfortable.

206
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,720
Xiao Tuo, it's dinner time.

207
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,330
I am not hungry!

208
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,340
I made your favorite braised pork.

209
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,150
I told you I'm not hungry!

210
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,900
I will put it in the fridge for you. Remember to heat it up before eating it.

211
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,550
Eating cold food is not good for your stomach.

212
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,990
I like eating cold food, so what.

213
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,090
You said you would stay until after I took the Fine Arts exam.

214
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,330
You also promised me you'd take me to the amusement park.

215
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:22,950
Yes, but I got the phone call unexpectedly, it's not something I could control.

216
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,760
I'll come back quickly this time, it isn't far away.

217
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,140
- I don't care.
- I also don't care.

218
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:34,720
I packed some jackets and coats in here, it's cold out on the sea.

219
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,010
Alright, your father is in a hurry.

220
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:52,050
Listen to them, it's the same every time. Don't you get sick of it?

221
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:56,240
Listen well to your mom. I will bring yummy things to you when I get back.

222
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,230
Chocolate, okay?

223
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,060
Alright, I am going.

224
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,510
Are you leaving?

225
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,340
Yes, leaving now. Listen to your mom, okay?

226
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,480
Bye-bye.

227
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,000
I'll hold it.

228
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Slow down.

229
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,700
I really can't run anymore.

230
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,200
Let's go.

231
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
No, no, no.

232
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,400
- I can't run anymore.
- Hurry up! We'll miss Senior's competition!

233
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,000
That's not possible! The competition takes a long time.

234
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,500
I don't want to miss even one second.

235
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,200
Then you go first. I'll catch up in a little bit.

236
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,700
- Okay.
- All right.

237
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,000
What's going on with me these past two days?

238
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,400
Why am I lacking so much strength?

239
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,600

241
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:21,000
No wonder. It's really so accurate.

242
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,600
Kaituo.

243
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,900
Why are you at school? Isn't it Saturday today?

244
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,800
What do you think?

245
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,000
You have to deliver take-outs even on Saturdays?

246
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That must be hard.

247
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
It's not like I can deliver while I'm at school.

248
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,200
Are you going to follow me?

249
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
I am not following you!

250
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,200
I am also going that way. I am on my way to the basketball court.

251
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Why are you going to the basketball court?

252
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,000
I am going to watch the intercollegiate league competition. Our school is going up against HCEZ.

253
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,500
It's the finals. You didn't know?

254
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,200
You still don't believe me?

255
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,600
Then I'll walk in front of you, okay? I really wasn't following you.

256
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,850
- Miaomiao, do you want to squeeze me to death?
- What?

257
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,200
- I-I am sorry, sorry.
- It's okay.

258
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,600
It's not—

259
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,600
It's not like you're in the competition, why are you so nervous?

260
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,000
But Senior is competing.

261
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So what if he is?

262
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,200
Would you be nervous if Lin Kaituo was in the competition?

263
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,900
I would.

If Lin Kaituo was also competing, that would be great. I really want to watch him play basketball.

What Senior? Call out his name!

271
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,000
There are so many Seniors here. How would they know which one you're cheering for?

272
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,400
You're wasting your energy like that.

275

See what? I don't see anything.

Slowly, slowly.

Senior Yichao is hurt. What are they going to do now?

308
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,230
You go in to cover Wang Yichao's position.

309
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,400
Remember to coordinate well with Liang Younian, okay?

310
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,000
I-I-I can't.

311
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,700
Coach, I can do it.

312
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,000
All right, just rest. I'll definitely bring home the championship.

313
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,920
No, that won't do. They play too dirty.

314
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,200
How are you going to do it alone?

315
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Coach, I really can do it.

316

Let it go.

00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,880
Stay here obediently.

318
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,800
If I'd known you were going to be like this, I wouldn't have let you come.

319
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,300
Coach, I'll do it.

00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,900
Senior is the best.

[60 to 33]

329
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,540
Kaituo and his fans, lifelong companions!

330

Kaituo and his fans!

331
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Senior got hurt.

332
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,800
Where?

333
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,400
His left arm.

334
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,200
Fighting! Go, HDFZ! Go, HDFZ!

335
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,630
Liang Younian, you were absolutely amazing earlier!

336
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:10,520
- Senior, you got the championship back for us!
- Senior really is too handsome and cool.

337
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,550
Fighting.

338
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,400
- Thank you. We're leaving first then.
- Okay.

339
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,750
Bye-bye.

340
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,170
Senior.

341
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,450
You are here.

342
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:34,530
Looking for me?

343
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,150
Didn't you get hurt?

344
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,870
No.

345
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,000
It's just a small injury. It's unavoidable in basketball.

346
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You're already injured to this extent and you're saying that it's only a small injury?

347
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,330
I just knew it.

348
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:52,590
Even if the competition is over, you still won't tell people that you got injured.

349
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,110
Others' injuries are injuries, so isn't your injury also an injury?

350
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,150
Before you think about other people in the future,

351
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,180
can't you worry about yourself first?

352
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,270
Okay.

353
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,370
Okay what?

354
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,050
Okay, I will take care of myself.

355
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,520
S-Sorry.

356
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,950
That's not what I-I meant.

357
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,020
It's just... It's just that I wanted to say,

358
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,090
you got hurt, so you should apply some medicine and then,

359
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,430
if you're going to ice the injury, you should use ice cubes.

360
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:32,380
Popsicles are for eating, not for—

361
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,580
Then will you eat it?

362
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,110
I'll eat it then.

363
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,390
You're not going to sit down?

364
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,790
Where did you go to get all of this medicine?

365
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,050
I just ran home and got it.

366
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:02,320
I brought all the medicines that I thought you might need.

367
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,690
Can you please explain...

368
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:16,950
under what kind of circumstances would I have to use...

369
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,050
Wuji Baifeng Wan.
(A type of pill in China used to regulate menstruation)

370
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,110
All right, I'll take that one back.

371
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,810
Stop icing it. I'll help you apply some medicine.

372
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,150
How could he be so careless?

373
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:01,820
Younian... What happened to your face?

374
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,590
I got injured playing basketball.

375
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,370
How come you both got injured playing basketball?

376
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,400
I played together with him.

377
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:14,210
What?

378
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,590
You two... played basketball together?

379
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:20,980
He played so poorly. If I hadn't shown up, we would have lost.

380
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,150
Then who's the one who scored less than I did?

381
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,280
Don't move.

382
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,000
I was on the court for a shorter time than you!

383
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,870
Lay still and don't move.

384
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:35,090
- Here. Let me do it.
- What?

385
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,770
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

386
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:41,230
You have to rub the bruise for it to heal faster.

387
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:47,380
It's great that the two of you played basketball together. Really great.

388
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,800
Mom, do it lightly.

389
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,580
Oh, it hurts? Then I'll do it gentler.

390
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,200
Younian, come here. I'll also apply some medicine for you.

391
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,260
No need. I already did it.

392
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,420
Is that better now?

393
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:22,100
The mix of medicinal oil and sweat smells like something's gone rancid.

394
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,130
Xiao Tuo.

395
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,980
What?

396
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:33,360
Let's eat together. We haven't eaten together in a long time.

397
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,040
I made some bone soup.

398
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,180
Didn't you get hurt? It'll help you recover.

399
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,320
If you're still not hungry, then I'll put it in the fridge first.

400
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,360
It's fine.

401
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,830
Younian, here.

402
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,690
Thank you, Aunt.

403
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,470
Since Xiao Tuo won't eat, let's not wait for him.

404
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,080
Eat.

405
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,110
He gets hungry on the later side.

406
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,210
Mom, give me a bowl of rice.

407
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,500
- Okay.
- Here.

408
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,250
- Here.
- Thank you.

409
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,500
Thank you.

410
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,340
Go ahead.

411
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,500
Younian, the college entrance exam is coming up.

412
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,950
How do you feel?

413
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,900
I'm confident, Aunt. Don't worry.

414
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,600
That's good. I have faith in you.

415
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,140
What are you going to major in? Have you made up your mind?

416
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,500
Haicheng University, Architecture major.

417
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,950
You can't.

418
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,580
I'm going to apply for the architecture major.

419
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,800
Younian. Here, eat some more.

420
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,510
The college entrance exam is approaching. It's a lot of pressure for him as well.

421
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,100
Stop lecturing him.

422
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,320
Besides, look. He's hasn't been eating much lately.

423
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,500
He eats only a little because he's too picky.

424
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,530
Since he was little, he's never liked to eat the fatty part of the meat.

425
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,710
But that happens to be what you keep making these days.

426
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,500
Sorry. Sorry.

427
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,570
Mom, why are you apologizing to him?

428
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,160
Do you feel like my mom hasn't treated your son well?

429
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,850
Right?

430
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,350
That's not what I meant. What I meant was that,

431
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:14,130
this Younian, he's too picky, so I...

432
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,920
Xiao Tuo, you're overthinking it.

433
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,450
Younian, what do you want to eat? Mom will go make it for you.

434
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,960
Aunt. Aunt will make it for you.

435
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,330
You really think you're his biological mom?

436
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,950
You don't even look to see whether he even acknowledges you.

437
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,440
Younian, sorry about that.

438
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,120
It's because Xiao Tuo likes eating braised pork belly, so I didn't think too much about it.

439
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,220
It's fine, Aunt.

440
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,620
Besides, I haven't been picky for a long time.
