A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,620
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,100
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,180
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,060
♫ I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,590
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,140
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,080
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,630
♫ I want to know what you're now up to ♫

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,590
♫ You're all that I can see ♫

11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,650
♫ You're in my heart every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,070
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,580
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of
a love like this ♫

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,590
♫ You're all that I can see ♫

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,580
♫ You're in my heart every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,100
♫  I must control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,660
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,590
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,170
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,090
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,150
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,670
♫ Stretch out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,120
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,960
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,270
A Little Thing Called First Love
♫ Is the result of Heaven's favor ♫

26

Episode 4

27
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,540
So can you go directly from this step to this step?

28
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,360
It might be kind of hard to understand how to go from that step to this step, so let me explain that step first.

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,190
Oh, okay.

30
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,300
I will also make some sample problems based on what I have here on the board.

31
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,960
Next time, we'll see how well you do on the examples.

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,260
Okay. Thank you, Senior.

33
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,690
Also you need to memorize well the equations that I've explained to you.

34
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,740
Because when you're calculating how to solve a problem, even if you can't get the answer,

35
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,860
writing down the formula will still get you some points.

36
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,340
Okay.

37
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,200
What's wrong?

38
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,310
Y-Your f-face.

39
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,310
No, no, it's not that.

40
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,180
Okay. We'll end here for today. Pack up your things.

41
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,790
Okay.

42
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,350
Thank you.

43
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,220
I'll get going now.

44
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,340
Okay.

45
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,500
I'll leave after I pack up my stuff. Bye, Senior. Thank you, Senior.

46
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,350
I forgot to ask for his number.

47
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,870
S-Senior?

48
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,830
Are you trash?

49
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,050
Pardon me?

50
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,400
Why are you charging towards the dumpster?

51
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,070
Oh. H-How is it that you're here?

52
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,920
I have no idea who put a dumpster in the middle of the road.

53
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,850
It'll be bad if anyone crashes into it.

54
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,350
I don't have his number. Ask for it yourself.

55
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,480
Hanging up.

56
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,550
Senior.

57
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:49,420
Your phone...

58
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,110
What?

59
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:59,480
Y-Y-Your... Does your home phone work?

60
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,930
I have a relative that sells telephones.

61
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,350
What?

62
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,140
How did you know that our house phone recently broke?

63
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,520
But I've already fixed it.

64
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,150
Oh, I see.

65
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,930
I'm off.

66
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,350
Bye, Senior.

67
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,510
It's so late. What were you up to?

68
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,110
A student was tutoring me.

69
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,560
Tutoring?

70
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,910
Then how did your clothes end up like this?

71
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,080
Can't you just kindly appreciate the results of my hard work?

72
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,710
If you really are going for tutoring like this every day...

73
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,700
In the entire grade, only two people failed the exam

74
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,580
and you're one of them!

75
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,670
Explain yourself. Come, tell me.

76
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,500
I...

77
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,470
You what?

78
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,080
Aren't you usually pretty good with words?

79
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,730
When the teacher called me, at first, I felt quite understanding and forgiving.

80
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:00,710
After all, we have just moved here and you just transferred. Your poor exam results were forgivable.

81
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,830
But Xia Miaomiao, you can't lie to me!

82
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,340
You can't go out and play and tell me that you were studying.

83
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,260
I really was studying.

84
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,060
You're really insisting that you were studying? Fine, give me that person's number.

85
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,450
Give it to me. I'll call him myself.

86
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,150
I am going to ask him just what exactly he's tutoring you in!

87
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,120
What? Don't you have it?

88
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,320
You... and that Xia Santu.

89
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,790
Can't you two make me not worry so much?

90
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,970
It's so late, and you're going out to play!

91
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,270
You don't even know to call home if you're late!

92
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,210
Not calling you is to give you a surprise.

93
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,500
Not calling you is to give you a surprise.

94
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,300
Dad!

95
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,030
- Dad.
- Yes?

96
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,970
How come you suddenly came back?

97
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,430
There was a tropical cyclone, so we turned the boat back.

98
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,140
Thank you, cyclone.

99
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,020
Why didn't you call if you were coming back?

100
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,580
Where is Yaoyao?

101
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,710
Isn't she the same as you, both of you don't like to stay home.

102
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,230
What great genes.

103
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,230
- Miaomiao.
- Yes?

104
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,500
- How are your scores after transferring schools?
- Don't bring this up.

105
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,800
She failed math on her finals. A re-test?

106
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,460
I mean, what's the point of even applying to a university? After she graduates high school, she can just work for me in this store.

107
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,170
- Wouldn't it be great if you became a waitress with me?
- Okay, enough.

108
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:37,080
Oh, right. I haven't eaten yet tonight. Why don't you make me two dishes?

109
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,300
All of you only know how to open your mouths and eat.

110
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,160
If you don't want me to talk, just say it directly.

111
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,730
Stop with the "Oh, I haven't eaten yet."

112
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,220
Would we even be able to carry on with our lives this way?

113
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,110
Yes, you can.

114
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,140
I saw on the internet that a lot of customers gave you a high rating.

115
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,910
Isn't that all because of you?

116
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,060
Stop trying to flatter me.

117
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,820
Wait.

118
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,440
Hey!

119
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,550
Hurry and hide it, hide it.

120
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,390
You can't let your mom see or else she'll come after me.

121
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,800
Your teeth aren't great, yet I still bring you chocolate.

122
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,100
Mom wants me to wear braces.

123
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,820
Your mom is doing it for your good.

124
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,740
Don't you know your mother well?

125
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,240
She sounds harsh but she has a good heart.

126
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,210
Every day, she saves up and spends frugally,

127
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,500
just so she can save money to get you braces.

128
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,830
Just then, your mother talked about you not getting into a university,

129
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,670
but actually, her heart is always worried about you.

130
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,070
Actually, I know all of these.

131
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,250
Miaomiao, don't give yourself that much pressure.

132
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:07,150
First, think about what you really want to do and then work hard.

133
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,440
Hey?

134
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,310
Dad!

135
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,790
How come you came home?

136
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,560
Where did you go so late? Huh?

137
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,420
Look at you, those who don't know what's going on might think that I abused you.

138
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,140
You treat me like a stepmother every day.

139
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,470
Have you eaten?

140
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,660
Let's eat together. Come, come.

141
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,410
- I want to eat, too.
- Okay.

142
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,740
- Stop adding yourself to the trouble.
- Who's going to have the first bite?

143
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,610
Me!

144
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,170
- You can't eat it. You can't eat it.
- I'm going to eat it!
- No!

145
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,470
Then I'll eat it!

146
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,350
Red.

147
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,990
The next time I see Senior, I will definitely get his number.

148
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,330
Miaomiao, don't put too much pressure on yourself.

149
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:17,900
Think about what you want to do and then work hard.

150
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,190
Senior is such a brilliant person,

151
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,550
he definitely knows what he wants to do with his life.

154
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,790
Welcome to Mrs. Xia's Private Kitchen

155
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,850
- Here comes the food.
- Slowly.

156
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,550
Here, take it.

157
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,460
Wow, you know to wake up early since you didn't do well on the exam.

158
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,920
Dad, Mom, I have to discuss something with you.

159
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,230
What is it? Go ahead.

160
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,230
I thought it through. I plan on studying fashion in college.

161
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,430
I thought it was something serious from looking at your expression.

162
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:52,070
University? We don't even know if you can pass the unified exam yet.

163
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,140
Isn't that just a seamstress? They tried to make it sound so nice by saying "Fashion".

164
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,940
If she wants to study fashion, then I can just find a clothing factory for her and have her stay there, can't I?

165
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:08,120
Miaomiao, do you know that Fashion is in the Fine Arts Department?

166
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,510
Yes.

167
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,310
From now on, you will need to take art classes.

168
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,610
Why would she take art classes? Don't you know what her drawing skills are like?

169
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,150
And look at what her grades are like right now!

170
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,170
- I will work hard on both those things.
- Work hard?

171
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,940
Do you think just working hard is enough? Do art classes not require money?

172
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,030
O-Our teacher has an Art class and it's free.

173
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,190
Okay.

174
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,590
Miaomiao, have you really made your decision?

175
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,440
I have decided.

176
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,430
Then try it. Daddy will support you.

177
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,190
I just knew that my dad is the best.

178
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:05,060
What do you mean "try it" and "it's decided"?

179
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,450
I am going to ask you two. Who is the head of this household?!

180
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,580
Tell me, who is it in this family that works hard from morning to night?

181
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:33,050
Who is it that provides you and your sister with meals?

182
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,550
And yet you say your dad is the best.

183
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,620
It's okay.

184
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,550
You have no conscience. I guess your dad is the best.

185
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,340
That's not true. Of course, you're the best, Mom.

186
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:52,110
You are the best mom in the world. You make delicious food. You're pretty.

187
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,970
You have a kind heart, too.

188
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,490
Okay, okay. I've spoken my mind. Sit back down.

189
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,510
Eat.

190
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,200
I can't even hold my chopsticks right because of you.

191
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:26,320
Yesterday, you transferred schools and I forgot to give you a red egg. I'll make up for it today.

192
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,260
No need, it'll stain my hands red, and it doesn't even taste good.

193
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,130
If I tell you to eat it, you should eat it. Why do you complain so much?

194
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,710
Only by eating red eggs will you have good luck.

195
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,180
It's too dry.

196
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,310
Then drink some water.

197
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,930
- Mom.
- Yes?

198
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,110
Can you boil me a red egg today?

199
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,510
I will need good luck when I apply for the schools in a bit.

200
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,620
She can have that.

201
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,390
She doesn't believe in that anymore.

202
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,940
I don't know what's wrong with her these past few days.

203
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,140
She wants me to boil red eggs every day for her.

204
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,830
Okay, I'll boil one for you.

205
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,020
I have to do every little thing every single day.

206
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,150
Thank you, Head of the Family.

207
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,760
Don't cause trouble.

208
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,900
Do you really think you'll get to see Liang Younian just because you ate a red egg?

209
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,220
You'll never know.

210
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,950
Even if you see him, you're afraid to ask for his number.

211
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,140
Who knows, maybe I'll be brave enough.

212
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,180
Even if you are brave enough, you won't be able to see him.

213
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,590
Because... after starting Year 12, he rarely goes to the art studio.

214
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,420
No matter how many red eggs you eat, it's pointless.

215
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,380
Just watch. It's magic.

216
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,900
Uncle!

217
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,350
You scared me.

218
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,540
You little troublemaker, why did you come here so early?

219
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,200
This is my classmate Xia Miaomiao, she wants to attend your class.

220
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,750
Hello, Teacher.

221
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,140
Ah, I remember you.

222
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,350
I think I saw you drawing in the class the other day, right?

223
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,460
You've really made up your mind to study art?

224
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,780
I thought you didn't like to draw.

225
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,420
Xinxin, why are you here?

226
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,260
Aunt, Uncle is saying that my classmate is bad at drawing

227
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,630
and doesn't want to accept her as a student.

228
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,600
What's going on?

229
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,150
Don't listen to her nonsense.

230
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,590
It's not that I don't want to teach her.

231
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,910
I'm just worried that she might have some secret hardships.

232
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,910
I don't. I really do want to learn how to draw.

233
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:17,430
I'm just not very good at it... but I will work really hard.

234
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,630
The reason we learn is precisely because there are things that we don't know, but want to improve on.

235
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,860
- Right?
- Right.

236
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:30,270
Okay, you can come here to learn after school today.

237
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,790
- Okay?
- Really?

238
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,510
But there's just one thing. I am only responsible for the teaching.

239
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,150
The results will depend on how much work you put into it.

240
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,380
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Thank you, Teacher.

241
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,350
Aunt, where's my cousin?

242
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,450
He's at school.

243
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,310
(Told you so!)

244
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,900
Why are you two still not at school?

245
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,790
You are going to be late!

246
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,120
- Aunt, we're going now. Bye-bye!
- Bye.

247
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,870
Let's go!

248
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,650
Your aunt is really so pretty and so gentle, too!

249
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,240
Of course, she is. Don't you know whose mother she is?

250
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,090
This is the first time I've heard you compliment him.

251
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,910
Stop eating. That is already the fourth one.

252
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:28,190
I might just see Senior if I eat one more.

253
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,820
Do you know the side-effects of eating too many eggs?

254
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,070
Wh-What side effects?

255
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,430
You'll keep farting.

256
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,890
- Class time!
- Class time, let's go!

257
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,820
Let's go, let's go!

258
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,670
Let's go!

259
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,930
Liang Younian

260
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,510
He Xin, this is Senior's workbook!
 [Grade Two Class Five]

261
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,540
I already have a bunch of Liang Younian's workbooks at home.

262
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,670
My mom doesn't let me use new ones and just keeps telling me to use the old ones.

263
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,050
This problem is important!

264
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:31,400
Xinxin, you really are the most blessed person on this planet.

265
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,990
- Kaituo, you're awake now?
- Yeah.

266
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,000
These are the notes I took during the last class. I took really detailed notes.

267
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,400
You'll understand as soon as you look. Take a look.

268
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,350
No need.

269
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,630
You didn't even pass the test, why are you pretending to be an "A" student?

270
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,220
So did you learn from a certain someone, who's good at pretending to be an "A" student?

271
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,850
Kaituo, can you please not talk to Miaomiao that way?

272
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,340
How does it concern you?

273
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,500
Xinxin, thank you.

274
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,030
I really think it's wrong for him to act that way.

275
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:35,120
I thought you only had Lin Kaituo in your heart.

276
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm just a really justice-loving, selfless woman of the new generation.

277
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,170
One, two, three, four,

278
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,350
five, six, seven, eight...

279
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:06,190
Two, two, three, four...

280
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,340
Lin Kaituo didn't show up again. I guess he's not planning to come to classes.

281
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,100
Say, when do you think he'll cool his temper?

282
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,030
I think you two should just get into a fight and be done with all of this.

283
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,440
Forget it.

284
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,790
Four, two, three, four...

285
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,380
five, six, seven, eight...

286
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,750
Hey... what's up?

287
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,020
Hey, who did you catch not doing the eye-protection exercises?

288
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,320
Who was it? Who?

289
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,050
five, six, seven, eight...

290
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,740
I think the people in this class are pretty earnest.

291
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,780
Let's go.

292
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,030
six, seven, eight, one...

293
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,160
Two, three...

294
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,360
Lin Kaituo.

295
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,920
Six, seven. eight...

296
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,660
Of course, it's the Student Union President.

297
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,540
People with power are so generous.

298
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,350
Lin Kaituo, is there even a point to you acting this way?

299
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,550
It's been so long already, can you stop being so childish?

300
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,640
When we started Year 11, you did, too.

301
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,830
We've started Year 12 now, yet you're still in Year 11.

302
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:13,120
I'm telling you, if you keep on like this, you won't even get into a university.

303
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,340
That is my own business.

304
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,880
How is it related to you?

305
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,290
Aren't we your friends?

306
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,850
Friends?

307
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,130
I don't have any friends as fake as he is.

308
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,990
Come out!

309
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,190
You want to fight?

310
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,550
- Go!
- The teacher is here.

311
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,990
You two...

312
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:47,620
What are you doing? A group fight?

313
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,110
Lin Kaituo, what happened?

314
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,060
That's right. I just can't look at fake people!

315
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:58,060
Teacher, my stomach hasn't been feeling well these past few days.

316
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,710
They were in a rush to send me to the nurse's office.

317
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,530
- Really?
- Yes.

318
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,790
I can be responsible for my own actions. If there's any punishment, just give it to me.

319
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:13,330
What do you mean, "I can be responsible for my own actions"? You're talking just like a thug.

320
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:18,290
During class, you don't listen, and now you're fighting.

321
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,390
Student, come to my office.

322
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,340
Why does a teenager like you have such a bad temper?

323
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:33,990
Teacher, th-the Senior student threw up.

324
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,100
- How do you feel?
- I don't feel very good.

325
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,580
Take him to the clinic.

326
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,910
Oh, no. How come you threw up again?

327
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:50,400
Teacher, don't worry! He'll be fine.

328
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,850
They even want to trick the teacher? I'll discipline them shortly.

329
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,500
- Student on Duty, clean up this mess.
- Okay.

330
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,280
Everyone else, continue with the exercises.

331
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,100
Okay.

332
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:26,510
This is all thanks to Xia Miaomiao's cooperation. Otherwise, Kaituo would have been given another demerit.

333
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,710
Can you stop being so protective of him?

334
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,270
I was also in the wrong in this situation.

335
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,430
- Really?
- Okay, come on.

336
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,100
Remember to call Kaituo when you get home, okay?

337
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,100
You know, he won't really stay angry at you.

338
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,310
I'm not calling him. If you're concerned about him, do it on your own.

339
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,870
Next class is Basketball. I'm going to play now.

340
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,110
You're playing basketball and not taking me along?

341
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,190
You're too good at it! I'm worried that you'll steal my limelight.

342
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,390
Fine.

343
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:00,080
- Hey. Let's go together.
- No.

344
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,440
Are you also angry at me?

345
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,740
This scenario needs to be played out to the end.

346
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,260
Didn't I just throw up? Is it appropriate for me to play basketball?

347
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:14,860
Bring me two cans of eight-treasure porridge in a bit.

348
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,990
Why?

349
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:20,420
It's just that... it smelled really good just now.

350
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,600
Disgusting.

351
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,660
Hey! And potato chips and a cola!

352
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,540
I don't have money. I'm not buying anything.

353
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,550
Senior?

354
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,220
Why are you here?

355
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:05,110
Teacher Lu wanted me to come check on you.

356
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,930
It turns out that scenarios really should be acted out to the end.

357
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,750
What?

358
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,070
Nothing.

359
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,350
You seem really timid.

360
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:27,030
Earlier, I never would have guessed that you could be so daring.

361
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:35,100
That's... It's all right, being brave. The thing is... one gains pleasure from helping others.

362
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:40,150
It's very important. It's one of the traditional virtues of Chinese culture.

363
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:58,230
Senior, if I were to give you a phone call...

364
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,690
What?

365
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,120
Nothing.

366
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,830
This is for you.

367
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,390
What?

368
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,220
Thanks for what you did back then.

369
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,940
Let's go.

370
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,790
This is my painting. When did it get hung up?

371
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:52,860
First place in the National Teenage Art Competition?

372
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,850
Yeah.

373
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,870
The one next to it is by my deskmate, Wang Yichao.

374
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,850
He received a finalist qualification prize.

375
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,100
You're not explaining well. It's not the qualification prize, it's the "Outstanding" prize.

376
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,870
How did basketball go during P.E.?
 (Physical Education)

377
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,720
Without you there, it definitely went smoothly for me.

378
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,880
Congrats.

379
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:25,430
Hey, Junior classmate, between Liang Younian and me, who painted the best?

380
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,750
Liang Younian.

381
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,640
How is it that people like you don't have any sense of good taste?

382
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,400
How did he paint well? Even if he did paint it better, it would still be just buildings

383
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,780
or pavilions or something. No imagination at all.

384
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,420
I don't agree. Senior can paint whatever he likes to paint.

385
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,460
He can paint anything, anyway. It's just the issue of whether he wants to or not.

386
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,870
Fine.

387
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,880
It's another one of your little fans.

388
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,290
I-It's not like that.

389
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,830
It's not like what?

390
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,070
I have Liang Younian's phone number. Do you want it?

391
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,160
I can give you a good deal on it.

392
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,650
I-I'm not buying that.

393
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,960
She's embarrassed.

394
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,380
You talk so much.

395
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,590
You should be the speaker for the next English class.

396
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,930
I was wrong. I was wrong, Bro.

397
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:26,040
Forgive me. Bro, I can make up for it.

398
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,140
- Buy me a meal tomorrow.
- Fine.

399
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,050
Everybody can paint what you like.

400
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:37,940
Here, we have a sculpture, a bouquet, and fruit.

401
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,470
Don't restrict yourself. Just paint whatever you like.

402
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,110
All right, begin.

403
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,390
Reporting for study!

404
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,550
It's you two naughty kids again?

405
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,560
Quickly come and sit.

406
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,380
Why are you here? Aren't you supposed to be studying for the math makeup test?

407
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:25,660
Umm, I... already finished half of the problems you gave me.

408
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,260
And before we meet at the lighthouse, I'll do them all one time— No, two times!

409
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:37,120
I-I want to study art in college, so that's why I-I'm h-here... I'm here.

410
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,790
I was just wondering. Don't be nervous.

411
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,030
Here, eat some fruit.

412
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,230
Thank you, Ma'am.

413
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,470
Kids, eat some fruit.

414
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:16,260
That's right, come and eat some fruit.

415
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,710
It's already washed, you can eat it right away.

416
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,540
I'll pass it out.

417
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,030
Younian, here.

418
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,510
Thank you.

419
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,860
We're family. No need to be so polite.

420
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,110
- Miaomiao.
- Ma'am?

421
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,980
Why aren't you eating?

422
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,500
Thank you, Ma'am.

423
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,020
- This is for you.
- I get one, too?

424
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,280
Thanks, Honey.

425
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,950
- Miaomiao.
- Yes?

426
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,630
Here.

427
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,830
Thank you, Ma'am.

428
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:30,450
I just saw you weren't signed up yet.

429
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,110
Here's the registration form, please fill it out.

430
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,350
Yes.

431
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,300
Liang Younian's phone number

432
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,440
Ma'am, I'm finished.

433
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,100
Good.

434
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,620
- Do a good job painting, okay?
- All right.

435
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:37,590
Isn't this too much of a coincidence? We're wearing the same outfit!

436
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,980
Same outfit?

437
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,400
It looks exactly the same as the shirt my doll wears!

438
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,380
You still play with dolls?

439
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,840
What's wrong?

440
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,930
You're a grown man and you still play with dolls?

441
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,470
He plays with dolls!

442
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,320
He's a grown man who not only plays with dolls.

443
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,560
He even mentioned that he had one named "Li Li" today.

444
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,210
You're a grown man who not only plays with dolls, but also gives them names?

445
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:08,660
I don't play with dolls, you guys don't know anything.

446
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,950
I'm not playing with them, I'm designing clothes for them!

447
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,940
You're one to talk. You're laughing even with those teeth.

448
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,780
There's a fruit peel stuck right there and you're still laughing?

449
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,770
Classmate, can you speak more politely please?

450
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,750
Go inside.

451
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:36,580
It's fine. Don't take it to heart.

452
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,820
Stop sighing. Even if you sigh, your teeth won't look any better.

453
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,800
Is this the attitude you use to speak to your older sister?

454
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,740
This is the attitude I use to speak to an older sister who is interrupting a younger sister who's reading a book.

455
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,870
Are you done or not?

456
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,020
Go to your own bed and read.

457
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,950
I won't.

458
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,060
This child, what are you doing?

459
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,430
You bring me out this early and I haven't even changed my clothes.

460
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,500
I'm looking for a doctor to save my life!

461
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,840
Help me-e-e!

462
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,460
Why are you screaming so early in the morning!

463
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,570
Where's the doctor?

464
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,990
The doctor hasn't started work yet.

465
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,380
How about you wait for a while first?

466
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,230
I'll wait.

467
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,890
It must hurt quite a bit.

468
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:53,500
Yeah, it hurts.

469
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,690
You must have bled a lot.

470
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,830
What pain? She had an anesthetic.

471
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,260
It also hurts to get the anesthetic.

472
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,070
Enough. I knew you would go running to your dad.

473
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,230
Xia Yaoyao, come to eat.

474
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,820
I got it.

475
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,200
Hey, this kid today...

476
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,390
Go wash your hands.

477
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,190
Last time when I took her, she ran away at the doorway.

478
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,710
Very early today, she insisted on dragging me to go get her teeth done.

479
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,530
You don't even know how horrible it was, the way the blood was splashing...

480
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,990
I told her, if you really can't take it, you don't have to have braces. But, she said no.

481
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,220
She insisted on wearing the braces over and over again without complaining.

482
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,190
I couldn't bear to watch.

483
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:40,300
If someone wants to be prettier,

484
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,990
they have to pay the price. I think it looks good.

485
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,400
How is it good? It's ugly as anything.

486
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,110
What?

487
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:52,250
What are you saying? Look at how your teeth are pointing in all kinds of directions.

488
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,350
There's a chance they will grow crooked, too.

489
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:57,670
Look at my teeth. They look a lot better than hers.

490
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,660
That works out, I can save money.

491
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,630
Anyway, I'm just saving up money for one person.

492
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,150
I don't care. Whatever my sister gets, I want it, too.

493
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,510
If she wears braces, I want to wear braces, too.

494
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,240
Not... enough... money.

495
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:18,050
Wow, sweetheart. The potato salad I made is really good.

496
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,830
Eat up, eat up. Eat up.

497
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,030
Stop looking in the mirror. Even if you do, you won't become prettier.

498
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,670
Stop that. Okay, that's enough.

499
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,950
Time to eat. In a bit, you need to study math with He Xin.

500
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,710
Did you finish all the problems I gave you last time?

501
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,230
Yes.

502
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,470
How many times did you do them?

503
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,600
Then I'll ask you questions based on those.

504
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,200
Okay.

505
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,460
I'll give you a couple of problems but in a different format.

506
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,150
- Do you want to try?
- Yes.

507
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,030
Why aren't you speaking?

508
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,870
I... I... just got braces.

509
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,870
What?

510
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,300
I've heard that braces are pretty painful.

511
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,180
They're not. Not painful at all.

512
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,470
Then I'll give you some problems, okay?

513
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,460
Okay.

514
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,700
Looking at how you did today, it seems you'll be able to pass the makeup test.

515
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:03,400
Really? Is it possible that I'll encounter the exact type of problem that I can't solve?

516
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,920
Then I'll fail again and I'll have to take the exam again.

517
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,040
Even if you don't have confidence in yourself, you should have confidence in me.

518
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,010
The students that I've taught can do any variety of math problems.

519
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:21,420
Senior, how many points do you think I can get?

520
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:25,890
Could I maybe get full marks and end up with an "A"?

521
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,820
The last time, how many marks did you get on the paper that flew onto my face?

522
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,640
Thirty-one.

523
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:39,100
Then I promise, next time you test, you'll get double that amount.

524
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,220
31×2=61? (Fail)

525
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,790
31x2=62 (Pass)

526
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,070
That's fine.

527
00:43:56,450 --> 00:44:00,370
