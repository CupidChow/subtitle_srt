00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,600
A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,600
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,200
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,200
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,200
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,600
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,100
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,600
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,200
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,600
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,200
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,700
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,600
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,000
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,200
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,000
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,300
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,000
Episode 27

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
Dinner is ready.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Not bad.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,400
It's almost winter break. When will the boys come home?

30
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,800
I've talked to Sichen.

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
He said that both of our boys are busy preparing for the final round.

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,600
He said that both of our boys are busy preparing for the final round.

33
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,800
I reckon they will be busy for quite some time.

34
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,300
I'll make some nice food and take it to them then.

35
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,000
Sure.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,400
- Little Tuo.
- Kaituo is home.

37
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,500
Why have you suddenly come home?

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,400
I'm here to get something. I'll leave right away.

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,600
Wash your hands. Have dinner before you go. There's no rush.

40
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,200
Exactly. There's your favourite braised pork today.

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,900
It's fine. I'll go back to the campus to eat.

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Let's eat first.

43
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,400
- Dig in.
- All right.

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,100
I'll ask him what he would like. I'll cook it for him.

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,900
Sure. Go on.

46
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,600
Little Tuo, would you like to eat something?

47
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,200
Is something bothering you lately?

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,400
No.

49
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,600
You've set that money aside for years without using it.

50
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
- Why did you suddenly—
- Since this money is mine,

51
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,200
I get to decide how to spend it, right?

52
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,000
Little Tuo.

53
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,700
Little Tuo, hold on.

54
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,570
What's wrong?

55
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,400
What is this?

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,800
Why did you go through my bag?

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
You're taking so much money and even getting a loan.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Are you in trouble?

59
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,200
Why do you always accuse me of borrowing money?

60
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,500
Why do you need so much money?

61
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,800
For no reason.

62
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,400
You're still quibbling.

63
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Do you know borrowing money and gambling are the same? They can be addictive.

64
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Your dad—

65
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,500
You have the cheek to talk about my dad?

66
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,070
If you didn't insist on getting divorced,

67
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,400
I wouldn't have been in a situation where I've not even seen my dad for years!

68
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,000
I did it for your sake.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,200
Is it good for me to be fatherless?

70
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,400
In your eyes, whatever I do is always wrong.

71
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Everything your dad does is right.

72
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,800
But he isn't as good as you imagined.

73
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,940
I know very well if he's good or not.

74
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,800
Don't speak ill of my dad.

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,900
You were too young then. You didn't understand anything.

76
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,200
But at least, there's one thing I know.

77
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,700
After you got divorced, I wasn't happy at all!

78
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,400
So stop saying you're doing it for my sake.

79
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,800
It's too much for me to bear.

80
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,000
Little Tuo!

81
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,200
Five characters.
 (Mahjong tile name)

82
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
I'll take it.

83
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,290
Weiguo, when will you be home?

84
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,200
Little Tuo is asking for you.

85
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,200
I'm just playing two rounds. Why are you interrupting?

86
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,000
Hurry up. Go and put our son to bed.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,100
Stop playing.

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,400
Two days ago, someone came to the company to ask for money from you.

89
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,200
Why did you pat me? You pat my luck away!

90
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,600
I'll handle it. Head home quickly.

91
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,800
Whose tile is it?

92
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,600
Weiguo.

93
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,200
Go home now!

94
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,300
Come home soon. I've kept the rice warm.

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,400
How much is five plus two plus one?

96
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,000
Eight.

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,200
Don't count that. Kaituo, look.

98
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Every time I shake the dice,

99
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,200
why do I always get a bigger number than you?

100
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,800
Dad you're awesome. I want to grow up to be like you.

101
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,600
Yes, yes. Show me how you shake it.

102
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,200
Here, try it.

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,200
- Kaituo
- I win this round.

104
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,600
Aunt, you're home.

105
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,900
- Mom, you're home.
- Yeah.

106
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Little Tuo, go home with Xinxin.

107
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,600
I have to talk to your dad. Okay?

108
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,800
I want to play with dad for a while.

109
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,600
Yes, let him play longer.

110
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,930
Be good. Go and watch cartoons at home.

111
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll make you braised pork later.

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
There's braised pork?

113
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,400
I'll go with you.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,200
- Lin Weiguo.
- Yes?

115
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,800
Let's get divorced.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What? Get a divorce?

117
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,500
Mom

118
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,400
Aunt Yang

119
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,200
Hello, Aunt Yang?

120
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,390
Younian, Kaituo came home and had a huge fight with me.

121
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,800
He has turned off his cell phone now.

122
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,100
Can you help me look for him?

123
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,000
Sure, I'll look for Kaituo right away.

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,500
And...

125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,600
Is he in some sort of trouble lately?

126
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,000
He took away all the rent he paid me before.

127
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,300
I even found a flyer in his bag for taking loans.

128
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,800
Aunt, don't worry.

129
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,200
Yichao told us to invest in his businesses, that's why he went home to get money.

130
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,600
That's good to know.

131
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,400
What's wrong? Did Kaituo argue with Aunt?

132
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,810
He went home to get money.

133
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,400
He seemed to have argued with Aunt over this matter.

134
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,420
We've searched everywhere on the campus.

135
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,000
We're going to look around his house now.

136
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Let's split up.

137
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's go.

138
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Why did you come here?

139
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I didn't want to come here, but Aunt was so worried,

140
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,200
looking for you all over the world.

141
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,400
Just how old are you?

142
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,600
How could you shut off your phone? You should call her back.

143
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,900
It's none of your business.

144
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,440
Aunt!

145
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,800
I found Kaituo.

146
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,400
He's fine.

147
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,200
No need to worry. Later, I'll send him back to school.

148
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,800
That's great Xinxin! Sorry to bother you.

149
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,000
How is Kaituo's mood?

150
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That day, I was too impatient. I shouldn't have shouted at him.

151
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,110
Now he doesn't pick up my calls.

152
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,300
Help me by having a talk with him.

153
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,400
You heard it all, right?

154
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,890
It's like this and your mom still doesn't blame it on you.

155
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,200
She's like this every time. She puts all the blame on herself.

156
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,800
As like in the whole world, she's the mightiest.

157
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,190
What type of attitude is this?

158
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,200
Your mom yields to you in everything

159
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,600
Is she not nice enough to you?

160
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,000
Yes.

161
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,200
She does everything for my own good.

162
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,820
Divorce,

163
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
remarriage,

164
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
it's all for my own good.

165
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't know about remarriage,

166
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,800
but divorcing was for your own good.

167
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,070
What do you mean?

168
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,700
Some things, Aunt doesn't let me tell you.

169
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,600
But, you're not a child anymore.

170
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,100
I don't want you to always think that everyone owes you something.

171
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,200
Do you still remember when your dad taught us how to play dice?

172
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,900
Tuotuo, my princess ring fell off. I need to go back and find it.

173
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,300
Then I'll go home to watch cartoons and wait for you.

174
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,300
Lin Weiguo, let's get a divorce.

175
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,700
Divorce?

176
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Are you crazy? I'm not getting a divorce!

177
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,000
If you don't agree, I'll sue you.

178
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,800
What is wrong with you today?

179
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,300
From day to night, all you do is

180
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,100
gamble everywhere, not caring about your family.

181
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,400
I can put up with all of these.

182
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,300
But I can't put up with you misguiding Little Tuo.

183
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,000
Either we peacefully divorce,

184
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,400
or I'll get the court to sue.

185
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,430
You're crazy!

186
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,000
Let me tell you, if you want a divorce, in your dreams!

187
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,800
Just you wait!

188
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,600
Aunt, are you and Uncle going to divorce?

189
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,200
Yes.

190
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,600
The parents of our classmates are also divorcing.

191
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,900
They have a lot of pocket money.

192
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,200
- Xinxin.
- Yeah.

193
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,040
Can you promise Aunt

194
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,200
that what happened today, you won't tell Little Tuo?

195
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,000
But I think Uncle's wrong. Why can't I tell Little Tuo?

196
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Becaus Little Tuo really loves his father.

197
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,200
If he finds out that his father's wrong, he'll be very hurt.

198
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,400
You also don't want Little Tuo to be sad, right?

199
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,400
I don't want Little Tuo to be sad.

200
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,000
Then Xinxin, can you protect Little Tuo with Aunt?

201
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,500
Yes.

202
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,500
Now, do you understand? Aunt was really protecting you.

203
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,800
You... Are you okay?

204
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,200
Don't follow me here!

205
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,000
Do you think... I'm really dumb?

206
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
No.

207
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,600
I've always thought their divorce was because of my mom.

208
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,000
That it was her who betrayed the family.

209
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,660
But I still had hope,

210
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,300
thinking my dad would come back.

211
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,800
We would still be a family.

212
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,400
But when she remarried,

213
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,200
that last glimmer of hope... was completely destroyed.

214
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,900
that last glimmer of hope... was completely destroyed.

215
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,700
So I though it was her fault even more.

216
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,600
But...

217
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,600
I only found out today,

218
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,300
that everything she'd done was all to protect me

219
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,700
that everything she'd done was all to protect me

220
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,600
and the picture of the perfect dad in my heart.

221
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,950
Okay, I'll send you back to school.

222
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
Lin Kaituo!

223
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,140
You don't need to take me now.

224
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,200
I can take you now.

225
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,800
Students, attention!

226
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,000
Two days... In two days, it'll be the competition finals.

227
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,600
So today, I'm going to add one more reward to you all.

228
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,000
Every year, the winning student of the architectural design competition

229
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,200
will have arrangements for a one year overseas university exchange.

230
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,800
I heard that this year...

231
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,200
I only heard.

232
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,300
They will be going to the department of Architectural Design at the University of Edinburgh in the U.K.

233
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,600
Are you excited?

234
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,200
So, today is the last session before the competition final.

235
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
I'll stop beating around the bush,

236
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,400
put in all your efforts, the prizes we deserve, win them all!

237
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,800
put in all your efforts, the prizes we deserve, win them all!

238
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,400
Okay!

239
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,000
Good, please continue.

240
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,200
Are you also going to the U.K. for the exchange?

241
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,600
Why?

242
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,200
Can you not go? I don't have the money to go overseas with you.

243
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,800
Who asked you to come?

244
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,100
When I leave for the U.K, you better not go to the airport to send me off.

245
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,200
I'm afraid you might cry.

246
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,800
I'm telling you. When you have enough money to go overseas,

247
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,100
I'm already back from my exchange in the U.K.

248
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,000
Don't be too cocky. You might not know,

249
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,400
my grandpa was one of the first architects to go overseas.

250
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,830
Then you also might not know,

251
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,400
my mom was the winner of this competition.

252
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,400
No wonder you were trying so hard for this competition.

253
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,800
But it's a pity that your efforts can't catch up with my talents.

254
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,100
I'm already missing the days when our relationship was off.

255
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,800
I'll be waiting for you in that restaurant near your school last time.

256
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,000
I have something to do. I'll head out.

257
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,600
I forget to tell you.

258
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,800
After the competition, the art club needs to add new members.

259
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,200
There are too many newcomers who quit this year.

260
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,000
Okay, I know.

261
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,800
I'll join... I'll join.

262
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Your resume won't pass through me.

263
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,370
What a heartless woman.

264
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,100
Bro Nian, my happiness depends on you.

265
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,850
Miaomiao

266
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,200
Why are you looking at me this way?

267
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,700
I don't have any interest in fighting for her with you.

268
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,600
Hello? Miaomiao?

269
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,200
Senior Da Chao, I'm in the library now.

270
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,000
The reference books about designing accessories that you talked about last time have all been borrowed.

271
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Do you have any other similar references?

272
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,000
You can find a book called "The Costume Design Art".

273
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,800
It's published by China Textile and Apparel Press.

274
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,800
It's nothing. Bye.

275
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,800
- Is Miaomiao in the library?
- Yes.

276
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,600
Let's go.

277
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,000
Senior.

278
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,000
Why are you here? Aren't you busy with the designing competition?

279
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,200
I'm here to recharge.

280
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,000
Recharge?

281
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,400
Are you like me,

282
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,400
that we like to go through some reference books before the big test

283
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,300
and then I'd feel like I'm full of power.

284
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,410
I'm full of power right now.

285
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,400
Don't move.

286
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,800
Does your apparel designing department all need to know how to design for accessories?

287
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,300
We just learn the simple things.

288
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,200
But designing accessories for yourself is pretty interesting.

289
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,200
But designing accessories for yourself is pretty interesting.

290
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,200
It should be interesting.

291
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,870
I have all the money. You can use it to pay the loan.

292
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,100
I'll go back to school.

293
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,600
Wait!

294
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,200
Can you hear what I have to say before you go?

295
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,670
Little Tuo, I can't take your money.

296
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
You take it back.

297
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,400
I got your electric bicycle back, too.

298
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,400
From now on, they won't go bother you anymore.

299
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,200
If you don't take this money, how are you going to pay the loan?

300
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,800
Also how did you get the electric bicycle back?

301
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Don't worry about that.

302
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,400
I'm here to tell you

303
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,800
that I plan on going someplace far to work with my friends.

304
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,500
I can pay for the rest of the money soon.

305
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Are you leaving again?

306
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Work? What kind of work?

307
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,400
Gambling?

308
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,800
The reason that you divorced with my mom...

309
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:27,100
I know it already.

310
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,380
It's all my fault.

311
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
I've let you down.

312
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,500
I destroyed this family with my own hands.

313
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,810
But...

314
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
I've really changed now.

315
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,510
Starting this year, I haven't gambled at all.

316
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,000
It's true.

317
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,900
Coming back this time,

318
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,000
I originally wanted to go back to you guys.

319
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,800
But I didn't think that your mom is already—

320
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,200
Then why do you still owe so much money?

321
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,800
That's the debt from the past. I have paid back a lot already.

322
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,400
The rest, I will pay them soon.

323
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,450
This time, I'm going out of town to really do serious business.

324
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,400
This time, I'm going out of town to really do serious business.

325
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,800
So don't worry.

326
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,600
I'm here... to say goodbye to you.

327
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,800
I'm here... to say goodbye to you.

328
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,260
When I'm settled,

329
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,700
I'll come back to see you.

330
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,700
Dad.

331
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,000
Keep in touch.

332
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,600
♫ I have lost what you have given me ♫

333
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:43,200
♫ Those unforgottable moments ♫
♫ My tears at this moment ♫

334
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,800
♫ I just hold your hands and not let go ♫
♫ Whatever it is ♫

335
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:56,400
♫ We can't go back anymore ♫

336
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,400
♫ I can only leave ♫

337
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,600
I just went to get the package and I just happened to see your name.

338
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,800
What is it?

339
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,800
I don't know. Maybe your mom mailed you something again.

340
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,770
Little Tuo, Mom shouldn't have searched your bag

341
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,200
and shouldn't have wronged you for no reason.

342
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,600
I was too worried. Don't hold it against me.

343
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,310
Hangzhou? Little Xue.

344
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,630
How about we spend the spring festival this year in Hangzhou?

345
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,660
The last time I was there was twenty years ago.

346
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,900
Forget about it. Did you forget about Harbin last year?

347
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,010
Little Tuo wouldn't go no matter what we said.

348
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,050
In the end, we went alone.

349
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,850
We didn't even have a proper new year.

350
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:32,530
Yeah, Younian didn't go, either.

351
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:37,630
Tell me about it. Little Tuo, this kid, sometimes is really...

352
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,940
Really what?

353
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,080
Nothing. That's not what I meant.

354
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,110
I'm just saying that it's understandable that kids have problems with us.

355
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:54,680
But Little Tuo and Younian have been friends since childhood.

356
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,230
But now, it's such a pity that the situation has become like this.

357
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,430
This time, I was too worried again.

358
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,390
Little Tuo must be really mad.

359
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:10,170
I don't know if he got the bag or not.

360
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:16,150
Look. How beautiful West Lake is.

361
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,110
- Kaituo!
- Mom, the apple is all soft. Did you put it out for too long?

362
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,550
Little Tuo, how come you're back?

363
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,170
Have you eaten?

364
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,880
Not yet.

365
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,810
Then what do you want to eat? I'll cook it for you.

366
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,650
Anything. I'll eat whatever you have at home.

367
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,700
I'll cook some dumplings for you then. I made them this morning.

368
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,700
I was thinking that you guys were coming home soon since it's almost winter break,

369
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,900
so I made some and put them in the freezer.

370
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,180
Go cook them.

371
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,140
Little Tuo, you're back so late.

372
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,190
Are you staying tonight?

373
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,330
No.

374
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:27,060
I heard that the competition has entered the final stage.

375
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,420
How's the preparation?

376
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,540
Not bad.

377
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,710
That's good.

378
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,090
Here.

379
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:03,790
Thank you. You have some, too.

380
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,940
Okay.

381
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,950
Mom, I'll help you with the dumplings.

382
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,560
Okay.

383
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,160
It's done.

384
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,920
Little Tuo.

385
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,200
Last time with you taking the rent,

386
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,640
I was being too nervous. You know that mom is—

387
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,950
Mom, I know.

388
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,480
It's good that you know.

389
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:01,450
Mom, take a rest. I can cook it.

390
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:08,340
Okay. Then I will peel an apple for you.

391
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,390
We have fresh ones.

392
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,470
Mom.

393
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,930
What is it?

394
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,990
Sorry.

395
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,630
There is no need to say sorry to Mom.

396
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,320
You have touched your face for like 100 times from day to night.

397
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,110
Do you have a rash?

398
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,900
No.

399
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,140
Is the air conditioner making your face too dry?

400
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,690
No.

401
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,770
Here. Put some on.

402
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,730
Wang Yichao!

403
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,230
Can you be polite or not?

404
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,080
Senior Wang Yichao, it's one thing that you occupy the classroom for our major.

405
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,840
It's another thing that you are sighing all the time.

406
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,750
Are you trying to bring bad luck to our big project?

407
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,020
I'm feeling miserable inside and I can't help sighing.

408
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,120
Yeah right! You are thinking about earning our money every day.

409
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,010
We are the miserable ones.

410
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,750
I'm being serious. You know that I like Senior Xiao Yue, right?

411
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,260
But she is about to go abroad.

412
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:05,030
- To where?
- We haven't heard her mention it.

413
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,710
Didn't they participate in that architecture competition?

414
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,220
If they get the first prize, they'll have a position to go aboard to study.

415
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,410
I haven't even got to be with her yet and she is going so far away.

416
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,110
The round-trip tickets are more than ¥9000.
 ($1.300 USD)

417
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,500
I can't afford to go there.

418
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,990
How do you know that Xiao Yue can get that position for sure?

419
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,550
Xiao Yue is so great, and she will surely get the first prize.

420
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:30,020
I think that Senior can get the first prize.

421
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:40,590
Then Liang Younian would be the one to go abroad.

422
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,550
Don't be scared. We can have a long-distance relationship.

423
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,370
Ah Xia, Miaomiao!

424
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,510
How come you are here?

425
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:02,220
The person I asked from the computer department found out the IP address for the Kaituo fan who posted that the anti post.

426
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,840
This is it.

427
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,950
Now Lin Kaituo can't slander me anymore.

428
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,840
We don't understand these string of numbers.

429
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,670
It's the IP address from your dorm.

430
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,270
Tang Mengfei?

431
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,610
Oh, my god. Your dorm is so terrifying.

432
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,330
Xiao Yue is having a really hard time.

433
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,540
She should go as fast as she can.

434
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,740
What do you want?

435
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,950
Let's talk about that anti post.

436
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,300
About what? I know nothing.

437
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:35,100
Really? I have already found the IP address of the one who posted it.

438
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,930
- What do you want?
- We don't want anything.

439
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,780
We just think that since you did something bad, you should be punished.

440
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,210
I will tell the teacher about it.

441
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,590
Oh, my god! She said she's going to tell the teacher!

442
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,350
- I'm so scared!
- I'm so afraid!

443
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,380
What should we do?

444
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,350
The— There are too many calories in it.

445
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,320
Can I not finish it?

446
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,860
No!

447
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,300
