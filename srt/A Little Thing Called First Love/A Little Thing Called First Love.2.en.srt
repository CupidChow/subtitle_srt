A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,590
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,140
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,140
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,120
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,670
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,060
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:40,680
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,640
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,630
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,070
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,620
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,630
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,590
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,110
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,620
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,590
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,070
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,150
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,050
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,600
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,060
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,820
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:00,270
[A Little Thing Called First Love]
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

Episode 2

27
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,520
Wang Yichao.

28
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,180
Why were you just standing about?

29
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,200
You can have it back.

30
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,670
Oh, did another junior confess to you?

31
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,070
No.

32
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,700
No? Then why are you smiling?

33
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,540
Let me tell you. In the future, don't be so soft toward just anyone.

34
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,510
You already have the looks, yet you still flash smiles at them.

35
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,590
Hey! Don't always avoid my questions.

36
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,000
Someone, please send me a Doraemon,
 (Japanese manga series)

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,100
so I can hop in a time machine, go back in time, and throw this doll away.

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,150
Here, for you.

39
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,900
For you.

40
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,550
Next time, be a bit more careful.

41
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,140
Thank you, Big Brother.

42
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,980
- You have to hold it tight, okay?
- Okay.

43
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,750
You like balloons?

44
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,310
Here, for you.

45
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:13,950
Hello?

46
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,540
Hey, what's up?

47
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,310
Did you return the umbrella to Senior?

48
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,000
I forgot.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,880
You forgot? I thought you chased after him right when class ended to return it to him.

50
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,910
He rode his bike too fast.

51
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:35,910
Oh, that's normal. People, like the popular kids at school, usually have gear shifter mountain bikes.

52
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,130
It makes sense that your little run-down bike wasn't able to catch up to him.

53
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,470
But that's fine. There's definitely going to be a day when his bike ends up breaking down.

54
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,130
It's not like that.

55
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,160
After school, I was wearing my backpack and while I was bending down and unlocking my bike,

56
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,250
I suddenly heard a familiar sound. Then I turned around in shock.

57
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,950
He was also unlocking his bike and I suddenly remembered that I still had his umbrella in my backpack.

58
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,790
So I quickly reached inside my bag and felt something shaped like an umbrella.

59
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,580
When I took it out, it ended up being a doll. Then he said he likes Transformers and left. After that, I walked home

60
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,200
thinking to myself how great if a robotic cat could take me in its time machine. Suddenly a boy jumped out from behind a tree and I froze.

61
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,460
He was so handsome while holding a balloon out to me with that same robotic cat on it.

62
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,190
At first, I thought it was for me, but didn't realize that it was actually for a little kid right behind me.

63
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,940
Turns out it was the boy who lent me the umbrella.

64
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,490
- Understand?
- Got it.

65
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,330
So basically you were stunned by his handsomeness and forgot to give the umbrella back to him.

66
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,820
Yeah... Wait, no. No...

67
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,060
All right, it's fine. Although I think you did the right thing by not returning the umbrella to him today.

68
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,050
Why is that?

69
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,910
Returning his umbrella is such a great excuse to meet him again! Don't throw away this opportunity.

70
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,190
You must think carefully about what you want to say when you return the umbrella.

71
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,940
I suggest that you write down your main points and outline them.

72
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,320
The most important thing is to get his QQ ID.
(QQ - Chinese message service and web portal)

73
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,030
Who knows, you could become friends.

74
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,910
Are you Lin Kaituo's new fan?

75
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,550
Do you want to join his fan club?

76
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,870
Shui Lingling: Who said they don't!? I would love to be his friend.

77
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,180
This is all utter nonsense.

78
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,020
Hey, how am I talking nonsense? Aren't I doing this for your own good?

79
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,510
I'm not talking about you.

80
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,380
I'm telling you, you better remember what I said.

81
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,670
I have to do homework. I can't talk anymore. Bye-bye.

82
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,330
Jeez.

83
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,520
Those good things that I said about Lin Kaituo earlier were all nonsense.

84
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,440
Liang Younian is actually the undisputed, most attractive boy at HDFZ.

85
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,960

Lin Kaituo Fanclub President: Do you know how hardworking Lin Kaituo is? Who are you to discredit all of that with just one sentence?

87
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,870
Fanclub President: I'd only suggested that you join our fan club. If you want to be a casual fan only

88
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,680
I won't force you to join. Why did you have to post that?

89
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,950
You anti-fan! You probably don't know who his backer is.

90
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,050
I will definitely figure out who you are.

91
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,770
My username isn't even my real name. How would you know?

92
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,870
Who exactly are you? Don't you dare let me catch you.

93
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,630
Personal Information: Shui Lingling, female. Followers: 11. Following: 12.

94
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:12,630
Thank goodness. I probably won't be discovered.

95
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:34,440
Will I be lucky enough to see him again today?

96
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,810
- Liushui. 
- Yes?

97
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,110
Your breakfast.

98
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,830
- Don't forget to eat it.
- Okay.

99
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,990
Oh... Yesterday, you changed schools and I forgot to boil Chinese red eggs for you. I'll make it up to you today, okay?
(Symbol of a new start, rebirth)

100
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,900
It's fine. My hands will be stained red after eating them, and besides, they don't even taste good.

101
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,930
If I tell you to eat it, just eat it and stop complaining.

102
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,420
You'll only have good luck if you eat these red eggs.

103
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,900
It's too dry.

104
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,820
Drink some water as you walk on the road, okay?

105
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,250
It's just a tradition, okay?

106
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,090
Let me tell you. You can't believe any of these superstitions. The main point is that you have to work hard, too.

107
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,030
Okay.

108
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,100
Mom, I'm leaving!

109
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,730
- Be careful on the road.
- Okay.

110
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,030
- Finish eating. Don't be in such a rush.
- Okay.

111
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,830
Didn't I already tell you? Don't wear earbuds while you ride your bicycle.

112
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,540
You have to care about this as well?

113
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,930
Of course. If you act like that,

114
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,100
you will affect our Kaituo's popularity.

115
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,630
Fine, this is what I'd expected from Kaituo's number one fan.

116
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,150
Let's go.

117
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,010
- I've prepared something for you...
- What?

118
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,780
- Soy milk!
- Why is it the savory kind?

119
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,000
Only you are a picky eater. Hurry, we're almost late.

120
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,920
There was someone else.

121
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,690
Are there more? I also want some.

122
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,170
Nope.

123
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,050
- What are you writing?
 - My homework.

124
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,770
What? You're still not done?

125
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,770
The next class is math.

126
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,270
But the schedule says it's art class.

127
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:49,260
Our art teacher is very easily persuaded. All of the main subject teachers like taking over his class, especially the math teacher.

128
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,070
Didn't you know we're getting a new math teacher?

129
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,270
- What? Who?
- Don't know.

130
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,180
- Then what about Mr. Zhou?
- He's teaching Grade 12, Class 1 now.

131
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,560
Their original math teacher went on maternity leave.

132
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,430
Liang Younian's class?

133
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,750
You sure know a lot.

134
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,280
I also know that Mr. Zhou has been a bit sick recently.

135
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,530
You sure like gossiping.

136
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,750
Students, please take out the exam papers from yesterday.

137
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,390
Liang Younian, please go over yesterday's exam papers with the class.

138
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,090
Teacher, I haven't done it yet.

139
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,810
You haven't done it? Even if you haven't, you can still go up and talk about it. Go.

140
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,010
Which questions did you guys get wrong the most?

141
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,900
Hey, have you seen the new math teacher?

142
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,380
No.

143
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,740
The new math teacher has to be handsome.

144
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,200
He has to be cute. Be handsome and cute.

145
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,550
Be handsome and cute.

146
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,130
What?

147
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,590
What's wrong, Miss He?

148
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,570
You don't... like art?

149
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,770
Art?

150
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,080
What? You all don't like it?

151
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,920
We like it!

152
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,660
I am glad you like it. Class, your new math teacher hasn't arrived yet

153
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,410
and your art teacher is sick.

154
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,860
So this retired teacher is here as the substitute.

155
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,380
All right, let's start!

156
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,450
Everyone,

157
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,410
take out your math textbook.

158
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,840
Make sure to pay attention to this part.

159
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,430
Good.

160
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,050
Slightly tuck this part inward a little bit.

161
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,770
Focus.

162
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,320
This student here is very focused.

163
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,110
Looks like you must have taken—

164
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,210
You haven't taken lessons before, have you?

165
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:09,150
That's all right too. It's precisely because you haven't learned it before that you're learning it now, right?

166
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,340
Why is Lin Kaituo absent again today?

167
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,070
What's wrong?

168
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,810
It's just that...

169
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:27,570
You are the first teacher, after I transferred here, who's cared about whether or not Lin Kaituo came to school or not.

170
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,240
Oh, really?

171
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,380
Okay. Keep drawing.

172
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,430
Hey, hey! Focus and draw. Quiet.

173
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,390
Hello. May I ask who you are?

174
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,490
Hello, Mr. Liang. I'm Class 5's new mathematics teacher, Lu Peng.

175
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,370
My wish just came true so suddenly.

176
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,170
He really is both handsome and cute.

177
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,330
I really want to learn math now.

178
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,730
Me, too!

179
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,750
Mr. Lu, I'm currently having a class right now.

180
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,110
Look, the students are having a rare art class,

181
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,820
so why don't you let them finish and then we'll talk after.

182
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,770
Mr. Zhou said that he discussed this with you.

183
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,850
He told me that I'm supposed to go over a few math papers this period.

184
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,500
But you and I didn't speak beforehand.

185
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:32,330
It's my first day here and I need to establish myself, so please help me out.

186
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,570
Fine, fine, fine, it's hard for you, too.

187
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,090
I will have you take the second half of the class time then.

188
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,930
Okay.

189
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,920
Class, let's stop for now.

190
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,440
Right, your new math teacher will take over now

191
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,070
to teach you for the second half of class time.

192
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,110
All right, all right. Settle down, settle down.

193
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,580
Teacher knows that all of you love art...

194
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,340
Oh, here. I've started an elective drawing class.

195
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:12,490
I encourage all students who love to draw to come to me and sign up for the class.

196
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,600
Okay? It will be totally free.

197
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,480
I hope all of you won't give up

198
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,470
your passion for drawing and artistic dreams because of the exam.

199
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,100
All right, the mathematics class will begin.

200
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,910
Thank you.

201
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,070
Hello, everyone. My name is Lu Peng.

202
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,150
I am your new mathematics and homeroom teacher,

203
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,980
please take care of me from here on out.

204
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:52,300
I know that a few students find this a little dull and uninteresting. We're going to start going over some math papers now.

205
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,580
Please take out your papers.

206
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,590
Reporting.

207
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,050
Please sit.

208
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,460
Let's look at the first question. Actually—

209
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,060
Sorry. I forgot to bring that.

210
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,910
- Here.
- Thanks.

211
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,380
I welcome you all to sign up, okay?

212
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,180
Let's look at the first question.

213
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,400
Stand right there.

214
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,240
How ugly can your drawing be for you to look so upset?

215
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,080
It really is pretty ugly.

216
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,290
Shui Lingling

217
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,120
Wang Yichao

218
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,380
What?

219
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,230
You better not ask me to go hang out with Liang Younian again, if you still want to stay friends.

220
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,930
Yeah, I got it. I just called to tell you

221
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:11,600
that another crazy fan of yours appeared under that malicious post. They seem like a funny character.

222
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,880
Go take a look, all right?

223
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,430
The Seven Sins of the Devil Incarnate, Lin Kaituo of HDFZ...

224
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:47,160
What? It's already ugly. Do I need to be insulted for it on top of that?

225
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,900
In the future, do my homework for me.

226
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,930
Why?

227
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,680
Because you are my obsessive fan.

228
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,320
What?

229
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,280
Don't think that I don't know that you're the one who's posting things about me on the school forum.

230
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,650
If you don't do as I say, I'll tell everyone.

231
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,000
Stop right there.

232
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,270
What?

233
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,510
This child... What are you thinking about inside that head of yours?

234
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,700
Why are you so fixated on the ground? Is there money on the ground? If so, share it with me.

235
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,010
Why are you here?

236
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,040
I am here to take you to get braces.

237
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,470
I don't want to. Why are you always forcing me to get braces?

238
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:18,150
What do you mean that I'm always forcing you to go?

239
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,680
If your teeth weren't bad, I wouldn't take you.

240
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,130
Braces are expensive and I've been saving for this for so long. I've been working relentlessly—

241
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,170
If I don't get braces, wouldn't I be helping you save money then?

242
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,100
Ah Xia said that braces are really painful!

243
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,820
And once I get braces, it'll be extremely inconvenient. Even eating will be difficult.

244
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,660
You only have eating on your mind.

245
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,850
If your teeth could regenerate themselves, I wouldn't be worrying about them.

246
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,830
Mom, just let them grow freely.

247
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,290
Xia Liushui, this is your school after all.
(Liushui - six waters / Miao Maio - each miao has 3 characters for water)

248
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,780
Initially, I was going to spare you and your dignity,

249
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:05,920
but it seems like you are taking my kindness for granted. So don't blame me for taking extreme measures.

250
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,350
Come on.

251
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,670
Mom. I really don't want to go...

252
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,550
Isn't she that junior who gave you something last time?

253
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:24,550
I'm always amazed by your memory when it comes to gossip.

254
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,030
Of course.

255
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:30,460
Let me tell you some more gossip. She's also Kaituo's seatmate right now.

256
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,720
Kaituo's seatmate?

257
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,590
So you better be careful and stop trying to charm her.

258
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,460
After all, Kaituo did say to you, "Stay away from those close to me!"

259
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,180
You'll get beaten up if he knew you were imitating him like that.

260
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,710
Beat me up? He's the one who keeps avoiding us. Impossible.

261
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,870
That's true. After all, he's not as gossipy as you are.

262
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,720
All right, since I'm a busybody, I'll leave now.

263
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,800
You're delaying.

264
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,600
- Do you think Mom will harm you?
- Stop dragging me.

265
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,400
Stop dragging you? Then walk by yourself. Seriously.

266
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,600
Wait.

267
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,600
Miss, do you have a discount today?

268
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
No, the discount day is next week.

269
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Wait, Miss.

270
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,000
But you already have the banner out now.

271
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,600
It's also fated that I happened to see it on the street.

272
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Say, it's not that big of a difference having it a week earlier or later.

273
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,800
Can't you just give us the discount today?

274
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,500
You can just come back next week.

275
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,000
Miss, why are you being stubborn? I can just pay you next week.

276
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,200
Did your child come?

277
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,600
Xia Miaomiao, did you think it would be all over if you hide?!

278
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,200
Let me tell you! You must get braces!

279
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,000
Did you hear me?

280
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Ah Xiao, did you hang up?

281
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,800
No. Let me tell you, you really need to stand your ground this time around.

282
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,000
You saw how bad it was when I got braces.

283
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,200
I could only eat liquid food for two weeks.

284
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,000
I know.

285
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,400
You cried every time you had to eat. It was too miserable.

286
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,400
That's right, which was why I gave up having them. It's too unbearable to look back at the past.

287
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,800
Let's keep talking about that He Xin.

288
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,600
She and you can still compete fairly, right?

289
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,200
Is she pretty?

290
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,600
She's beautiful.

291
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,600
Then her grades probably aren't that good.

292
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,500
She's first in our grade.

293
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Why don't we just forget about it, then?

294
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,800
Are you my friend?

295
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,000
Let me think, let me think.

296
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
What should I do?

297
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,200
I think we should keep ourselves firmly planted on the ground and study well.

298
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,600
We'll deal with it after we get accepted into the University of Haicheng first. Since it's so hard to get in,

299
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,400
we really have to start working hard now.

300
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,600
Yes, yes, yes.

301
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,910
Then, let's study well and become scholar tyrants.
(Slang for top students)

302
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,000
But it's not that easy becoming a scholar tyrant.

303
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,700
It's simple! I'll teach you.

304
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,800
First, you need momentum.

305
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:54,150
The total is ¥287 and fifty cents.
 ($40.00 USD)

306
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,000
Next, you need conviction.

307
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,600
Finally, determination and willpower.

308
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,600
Next—

309
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,300
Xia Miaomiao and Lin Kaituo, please come up and solve this problem.

310
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,300
Parabolic Equation

311
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,200
What is the focal coordinate for Y?

312
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,800
The focal coordinate is...

313
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,500
Not bad.

314
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Teacher, I've done this problem before,

315
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,000
but...

316
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,200
It's fine.

317
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,000
If there's something you don't understand, come find me any time after class.

318
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,600
You can return to your seat as well.

319
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,200
Lin Kaituo solved the problem correctly, so you can use it as a reference.

320
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,800
That will be it for class today.

321
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,000
Oh, right. The results for the monthly exam are out.

322
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,200
The grades and rankings have already been posted on the bulletin board outside.

323
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,000
What's with all the reactions? Now you guys know how to sigh?

324
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,200
If you all studied well from the beginning, there would be no need to sigh right now.

325
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,600
Class Representative, come with me to the office to pick up some exam papers.

326
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,580
Study hard.

327
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
- They're out so soon.
- That's right.

328
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,000
- I'd rather not know my result.
- Let's go take a look.

329
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,600
I'm going, too.

330
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,900
I remember I did that problem.

331
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,600
It's that exact problem!

332
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,800
I clearly did that one. How could I forget it—

333
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,600
Enough!

334
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,000
With your IQ, it's no use even if you do it a bunch of times.

335
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
So noisy.

336
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,700
- Sorry, could you let me see?
- Pretty good.

337
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,200
192nd place. I'm on the brink.

338
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,800
Class 5: Xia Miaomiao - Score: 337 - Ranking:147

339
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,400
High School Two Monthly Test Results: Senior Class Rankings

340
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,900
Class 1: Liang Younian - Score: 680 - Ranking: 1

341
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,200
Excuse me.

342
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,400
That guy's incredible!

343
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,000
Sorry. Coming through.

344
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,200
Sweetheart, you got 100 again!

345
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,600
So impressive! I just knew that you were better than your sister.

346
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,000
Go on and watch some cartoons.

347
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,400
Mom will make you some yummy food, okay?

348
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:32,390
Score of thirty-one.

349
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,170
Xia Miaomiao.

350
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:41,030
Here.

351
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,130
The results of one exam doesn't mean much. Just study harder next time.

352
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,420
Thank you, Senior.

353
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:02,630
Umbrella...

354
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:07,500
Senior, I forgot to bring your umbrella.

355
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,310
What umbrella?

356
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,100
The one that you lent me last time at the bookstore when it rained.

357
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:22,030
It's also raining now... and you're wet, I...

358
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,840
Oh... So last time you wanted to return the umbrella?

359
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,710
Right. Last time, I accidentally took my sister's backpack.

360
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:37,370
That doll isn't mine. Why would I have a doll?

361
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,550
That doll also isn't mine.

362
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:47,460
It's my little sister's. She insists that I make clothes for her doll. Look...

363
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:53,610
Right? Because I borrowed money from her to buy practice workbooks.

364
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,490
- You bought that much?
- Yes.

365
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,950
But even doing them is useless.

366
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:07,630
My desk partner said that no matter how many problems I complete, I'm still hopeless because of my intelligence.

367
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,560
I think he's right.

368
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,980
Your desk partner?

369
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,240
Is it Lin Kaituo?

370
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,630
You know him?

371
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,950
Don't care too much about what Lin Kaituo says. If he bullies you, I'll apologize on his behalf.

372
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,940
He's the type to not think before he speaks, every time...

373
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:40,670
Senior, do you know Lin Kaituo really well?

374
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,830
Take out your notebook for a second.

375
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,630
I quickly skimmed through your exam paper just now.

376
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:59,110
I found that your weakness is with parallel planes and parabolic curves.

377
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:06,730
I will help you figure out the parallel planes proof first.

378
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,100
What?

379
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,510
Sit.

380
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,070
What's the parallel plane theorem?

381
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:23,880
Uh... Straight lines and planes...

382
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,160
No. Straight lines on a plane...

383
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,360
If a plane with two intersecting lines is parallel to another plane, then they are parallel to each other.

384
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,800
Okay.

385
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:56,470
Where are you looking? Look here.

386
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:06,770
Look at this figure. Plane M-N-E-F is parallel to these points. They are all end points.

387
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:14,150
Then, how do you prove that M-A-N and E-D-B-F are parallel?

388
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,970
I don't know.

389
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:24,810
Firstly... Look carefully. First, take this...

390
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,570
Hey, give it back.

391
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,100
You have been laughing like a fool the whole night. Are you mental?

392
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,210
You're the one who's mental. Give it back to me.

393
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,130
Here, eat a red egg.

394
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,830
Mom said you did badly on the exam. I'm different.

395
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,810
I scored a hundred.

396
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,670
Give... me... the... notebook.

397
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:17,260
- Come and get it!
- Xia Yaoyao!
- Get it, get it!

398
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,980
- Come and catch me!
- Xia Yaoyao, give me the notebook!

399
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,940
Xia Yaoyao, give me my notebook.

400
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,940
- You can't catch me!
- Quit making trouble.
- Do you need a spanking?

401
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,220
Heavens, jumping around all day long. You two don't seem like young ladies at all.

402
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,910
I just washed it. Hurry and eat it, okay?

403
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,390
Xia Liushui!

404
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,430
Here.

405
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,520
What are you looking at? Let Mom take a look as well.

406
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:47,090
- Hey, Mom!
- Let me take a look!

407
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,080
Mrs. Xia's Private Kitchen

408
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,070
I'm leaving, Mom.

409
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,330
- Morning.
- Good morning, Aunt.

410
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,680
Good morning, Uncle.
