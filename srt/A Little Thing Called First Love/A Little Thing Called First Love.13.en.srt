A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,490
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,190
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,040
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,140
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,630
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,120
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,990
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:40,610
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,660
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,700
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,140
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,620
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,630
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,670
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,110
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,630
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,570
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,060
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,120
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,090
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,600
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,110
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,880
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,110
A Little Thing Called First Love
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

Episode 13

27
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,600
I was so scared earlier.

28
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,580
You didn't expose me, right?

29
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,660
No. I said that I picked it up and forgot to return it to him.

30
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,760
That's good then. Did he believe it?

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,900
He believed it.

32
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,300
It's too bad that I have to reprint the pictures again.

33
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,310
I'm hanging up.

34
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,380
We should be done by the afternoon, right?

35
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,800
You are so tired. How about you rest a little?

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,400
The architecture major midterm is such an abyss of suffering.

37
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,910
You finally suffered through it and you're even helping me with this now.

38
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,250
It's fine.

39
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,950
Making clothes is like resting and de-stressing for me.

40
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,100
Some people just can't stay in their own dorms and keep going to other people's dorms.

41
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,940
Some people just don't like staying in their own dorms so why can't they go to other people's dorms?

42
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,980
Guess what I bought.

43
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,780
Food. Clothes.

44
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,220
Look here, I now have the same motorbike as Kaituo.

45
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,650
Where did you get so much money?

46
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,520
I borrowed it from Liang Younian.

47
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,110
Senior Younian has that much money?

48
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,210
Yes, the Architecture majors scholarships amount is very high, and he gets it every semester.

49
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,130
Shouldn't every major's scholarships be the same? Why do they get more?

50
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,150
Our department has a special scholarship from the Fang Family's Enterprise Group.

51
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,400
Yes, and this special scholarship is awarded very quickly.

52
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,790
It's not like our school's scholarships

53
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,930
where you have to wait for the approval and distribution of funds.

54
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,120
How do you know more than me?

55
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,480
I am Haicheng University's front line reporter, He Xin reporting in.

56
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,580
All of you are here. Are you all done with your exams?

57
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,370
I am done Senior Sister. What about you?

58
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,150
I came back to pick up some books to study. I have one more exam tomorrow.

59
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,640
Senior Sister, have you ever won the Fang Family's scholarship?

60
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,260
I have. But most of the top-class scholarships are taken by Liang Younian.

61
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,250
See? Liang Younian's allowances are more than he could spend.

62
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,050
I only borrowed some and I'll return it once I get a scholarship, too.

63
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,250
You say it as if you'll get it for sure.

64
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,510
Xinxin can definitely get it.

65
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,290
Oh, right. Lin Kaituo says that he wants to get the scholarship, too.

66
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,080
- Really?
- Yes.

67
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,630
You can get it for sure but I can't say the same for Lin Kaituo.

68
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,930
You talk first. I'm going to go study.

69
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,620
- Bye, Senior Sister.
- Good luck, Senior Sister.

70
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,960
Bye-bye.

71
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,930
Hey, when do you guys plan on going home?

72
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,640
I will go back home whenever Kaituo decides to go back. When the time comes, we'll be wearing couple clothes,

73
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,260
driving our couple motorbike,

74
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,200
and going back home together.

75
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,400
Do you know how to drive?

76
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,230
No, but I can learn.

77
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,810
You can say it's romantic if he's driving you back, but you two are driving together separately.

78
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,470
At most, you can call it road mates.

79
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,390
It's not like he would be willing to drive me back home.

80
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,250
I also want to go home with Senior.

81
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,940
Why are both of you so pathetic.

82
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,850
Useless!

83
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,610
Ah Xia, should we really be doing this?

84
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,870
What's wrong with it? I looked into it earlier.

85
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,030
Your Senior has to pass this route to go take the bus.

86
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,910
We'll wait right here. We'll definitely run into him.

87
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,370
Hey! Senior.

88
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,880
Senior.

89
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,170
Are you guys going home, too?

90
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,790
Uh. Yeah.

91
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,940
Senior, I'm not going the same way as you, but Miaomiao is.

92
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,260
From here on, I will formally leave Miaomiao to you.

93
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,770
Remember, she likes to sit at the back row on the bus

94
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,220
but she will get carsick if she looks outside the window for too long. Take good care of her.

95
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,860
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

96
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,340
Let's go.

97
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,910
Let's go.

98
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,070
Thank you.

99
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,730
You must sit together with Liang Younian on the bus, it's ideal if you can sit at the back part of the bus.

100
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,860
Student. Sorry.

101
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,450
I'm with her.

102
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,340
Kaituo! Drive slower.

103
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,700
I can't keep up with you.

104
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,470
Hey! Kaituo! This is running out of battery!

105
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,970
I can't catch up to you!

106
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,580
Don't charge the motorbike to full battery because he will have to drive you back if you run out of battery.

107
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,060
What crappy idea did Ah Xia come up with? This really ran out of battery.

108
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,970
Senior, do you want to listen to music?

109
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,070
Senior.

110
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,860
Yes, I got it.

111
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,820
The motorbike is on the roadside. When you're off work, come and get it.

112
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,690
Okay, I will take the subway back home.

113
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,130
Oh, right. Don't tell my mom.

114
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,870
Or else she'll scold me again.

115
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,260
Okay. Bye-bye.

116
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,900
What are you going to do with your motorbike?

117
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,810
My dad will come get it once he gets off work.

118
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,780
Are you going or not?

119
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,440
Let's go!

120
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,200
What are you doing?

121
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Can you sit still?

122
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,200
Grab my bag not me.

123
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,200
Friendly reminder, if you fake sleep do it more naturally.

124
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,300
How do I be more natural?

125
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,300
No. Not natural.

126
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,000
Why don't I really fall asleep?

127
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,800
How do I sleep for real?

128
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,200
Can't sleep.

129
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,200
You can do it.

130
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,550
Count sheep.

131
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,000
One sheep.

132
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,410
Two sheep.

133
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,000
Three sheep.

134
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,000
One hundred thirty-two sheep.

135
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
One hundred thirty-three sheep.

136
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,400
One hundred thirty-four sheep.

137
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

138
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,400
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

139
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,800
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

140
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,400
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

141
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,800
♫ My heart... ♫

142
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,100
♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

143
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,800
The 19 year old Xiao Xie has been feeling low.

144
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,400
It turns out that he has gotten into online campus loans.

145
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,200
Xiao Xie is a second year student at Haicheng University.

146
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
He started dating a girl and through that girl's recommendation,

147
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Xiao Xie was introduced to the loan sharks and wouldn't stop.

148
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,500
In half a year, he'd owed fourteen thousand yuan (~ $20000 USD) through borrowing loans.

149
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,200
Younian, you're back.

150
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Kaituo also came back. He just finished his dumplings and went back to his room.

151
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
What do you want to eat? I'll make it.

152
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,000
No worries. I'll just wait for dinner.

153
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,300
Okay.

154
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,400
Dad!

155
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Honey, let's go to Harbin for New Years.

156
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,600
Honey, let's go to Harbin for New Years.

157
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,400
Didn't you say that you've never seen snow before and yet your name is Yang Xue (first name means snow).

158
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,500
You always think about traveling whenever you have a break.

159
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,200
Harbin's winter is very beautiful.

160
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,000
Look.

161
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,200
Younian is back.

162
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,600
Dad.

163
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,000
You came back. Perfect.

164
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,400
Take a look, too. How about we go to Harbin for the New Year?

165
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,100
What do you think?

166
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
I'm okay with whatever. You guys decide.

167
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Why don't you sponsor us a bit.

168
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,500
You only know to say nonsense.

169
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,800
How can you say something like have Younian sponsor?

170
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,400
He sponsored He Xin to buy a motorbike.

171
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,400
So what if he chipped in for a family vacation?

172
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,600
Younian, don't listen to your father's nonsense. Go unpack your bags.

173
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,290
Help me put away the wine.

Why did you soak so much jujube?

175
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,500
Don't worry so much. It will come in handy.

176
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,700
Mom. I'm back.

177
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,800
Miaomiao, you're back.

178
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Dad?

179
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,800
When did you come back?

180
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,500
He got home ten seconds before you.

181
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,600
I came back to celebrate the New Years with you all.

182
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Are you hungry? Mom is making dumplings.

183
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,200
I'm so hungry.

184
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,800
Mom, I want to eat the pork and cabbage filling ones.

185
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,300
You will eat what I make.

186
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,700
So picky.

187
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,090
Let Dad have a look.

188
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,600
How is university life? Is it tiring?

189
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,600
It's okay.

190
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,800
I'm tired.

191
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
You're tired. Why are you tired?

192
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,000
Tired from doing homework.

193
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,400
Tired from doing homework?

194
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,040
Would you be able to go to the university without doing your homework?

195
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,000
You won't be tired once you get into a university.

196
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,500
Okay?

197
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Why did you just come?

198
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,400
Now, my dad has forced me to look after the store.

199
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,000
Do you still want to go play?

200
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,200
I can't. Let's wait until my dad comes back.

201
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh, right.

202
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,200
Do you know why Kaituo isn't working part-time this winter break?

203
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,000
He's just sleeping at home everyday.

204
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,200
In order to review for this semester's midterm,

205
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,600
he stayed up late for 2-3 weeks. It must've taken a toll on him.

206
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
He's now recuperating.

207
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,200
Grandpa, you can't set up stalls here.

208
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,500
What? I can't set it up here?

209
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,000
Am I in your way,

210
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,500
or disrupting your business?

211
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,600
Seriously.

212
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,900
I'll go inside first.

213
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,400
Grandpa, did you make this through processed coconut?

214
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,000
Of course.

215
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,400
Have you seen any coconut that grows like this on a tree?

216
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,800
This craftsmanship is so so.

217
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,000
So so?

218
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,400
Youngster, that's because you don't know how to appreciate it.

219
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,030
Why don't you let me add some work to it?

220
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,000
I'll definitely be able to sell more than you.

221
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,400
You want to add to it?

222
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,230
Sell it better than me?

223
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,190
Okay!

224
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,790
I'll let you try it.

225
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,000
Let's see if you can do a better job at selling them than I can.

226
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,600
Okay, you go and try it.

227
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,100
Okay, I'll go get a pen.

229
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,800
Lin Kaituo really got first place?

230
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,000
I don't like that attitude.

231
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,200
Why can't our Kaituo get first place?

232
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,400
It's not that, I am just envious.

233
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,600
I always just merely pass.

234
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,200
Did you check what place Senior got?

235
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,480
Why would you need to check Liang Younian's?

236
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,200
Of course, he would be first again.

237
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Talking to you guys is so boring.

238
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,700
All you two talk about is Liang Younian and Lin Kaituo.

239
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,000
It's almost the New Year and I miss Kaituo so much.

240
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,520
He's better off making deliveries.

241
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,200
At least that way, I can follow him from behind.

242
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,800
Now, he's at home every day and Aunt is worried that something's wrong with him.

243
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,000
If you have so much free time to worry about Lin Kaituo, why don't you worry about yourself first instead?

244
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,600

I know.

Yeah.

The last time I saw him was when he rode his bike past my house.

He was with his wife to buy winter coats.

They said they're spending the New Year in Harbin, is that right?

Yeah.

- Go put on the couplets.
- Sure

Where's the glue?

Shoot. I forgot to buy it.

277

Miaomaio, go buy a bottle of glue from the bookstore.

You can't even leave one behind.

Okay.

Don't embarrass yourself.

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,630
Why did Senior Dachao insist on selling me the most expensive one?

00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,140
I'll give this one to you.

00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,370
Me?

300
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,130
This must have taken a long time.

301
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:38,830
You're giving this to me? You even drew our lighthouse.

302
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,650
N-No, I mean, you drew a lighthouse.

303
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,830
The lighthouse is not ours. It belongs to everyone.

304
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,090
No.

305
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,610
It's just...

306
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:56,640
Thank you, Senior. I'll definitely cherish it well.

307
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,080
Little Miss, look over here.

308
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,990
You don't have to cherish it too much.

309
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,620
I have all that you could want over here.

00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,770
Look. Lighthouse.

You should go home first.

312

313
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,140
Yes. Right.

314
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,100
I'm leaving first, Senior.

315
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,740
Mom, you don't need to tidy it.

316
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,680
I still need to sleep.

317
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,540
Kaituo.

318
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,390
You got a message just now and I accidentally saw it.

319
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,040
Why do you all of a sudden have so much money?

320
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,380
You didn't borrow money from anyone, right?

321
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,620
If you need money, you can tell me.

322
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,220
Moreover, the rent you paid before is still here. No one touched it.

323
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,750
You can use it if needed.

324
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,300
There is no need to be stubborn with us.

325
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,230
It's from a scholarship.

326
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,890
How could a scholarship be so much?

327
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,360
I didn't hear Younian receive so much—

328
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,510
If it was Liang Younian who received this amount of money today, would you doubt him?

329
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,220
Xiao Tuo!

330
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,370
After the New Year, it'll be a while before you head out, right?

331
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:09,660
The closed season for fishing is extended this year. I'll set sail later.

332
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,220
Look at her.

333
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,420
Who are those kids that are singing?

334
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,220
How would I know? They're child stars.

335
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,850
TFBoys!
 (Very popular boy band in China)

336
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,590
All the girls in our class like them.

337
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:29,070
Son, wait until your mom grows up. My son~

338
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,150
Son?

339
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,400
Who's son is this?

340
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,200
My son.

341
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,880
She's crazy. It's time for her medicine, just ignore her.

342
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,520
Xia Yaoyao, you're crazy.

343
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,170
Little crazy person.

344
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,550
Throwing a tantrum so he doesn't need to go to Harbin. Now, I can't go, either.

345
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,820
I know.

346
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,150
But my mom...

347
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:26,750
No buts, give your phone to your mom, I'll talk to her.

348
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,980
Okay.

349
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,180
Mom.

350
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,490
Xinxin wants to talk to you.

351
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,210
Okay.

352
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,380
Hey, Xinxin.

353
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,340
Bring this into the kitchen.

354
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,110
Thank you, thank you. Happy New Year to you, too.

355
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,930
You two, turn the volume down.

356
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,210
Okay.

357
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,340
Go ahead, I'm listening.

358
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,460
Okay, okay.

359
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,370
Oh, really?

360
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,680
Then you guys sleep early. Don't play too late.

361
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,950
Okay.

362
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,730
I will give the phone to her.

363
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,370
Hurry and go. Don't let her be scared alone.

364
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,200
It's the New Year soon. Where are you letting her go off to?

365
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,820
Her classmate, He Xin.

366
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,030
Says that her mom and dad went on vacation and left her alone at home.

367
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,140
She's scared so she wanted Miaomiao to accompany her.

368
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,280
Be cautious when you head out.

369
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,530
Okay. I'm leaving.

370
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,520
Wait!

371
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,760
Bring Xinxin some dumplings.

372
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,930
Right.

373
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,110
I want to go, too.

374
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,750
I'm not bringing you along.

375
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,820
Then I'll cling onto you!

376
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,590
This child.

377
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,460
Hurry and get off.

378
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:09,090
Who's knocking at this hour? Kaituo, did you order delivery?

379
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,920
Are you surprised?

380
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,070
Brother Chao came to celebrate the New Year with you guys!

381
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,580
Go back.

382
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,350
I came all this way. You want me to go back?

383
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,120
Liang Younian. Liang Younian will welcome me.

384
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,710
Go back.

385
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:36,440
They want us to go back.

386
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,320
Happy New Year!

387
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,420
Happy New Year!

388
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,920
Hey! Don't leave.

389
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,470
It's really heavy.

390
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,060
Come on in.

391
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,680
Three of a kind and a single.

392
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,510
Your turn.

393
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,350
Three Queens and a pair of fives.

394
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,860
One five.

395
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,860
Pass.

396
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,540
What should I play?

397
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,800
Put this one, it's the strongest card.

398
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,870
Look what I found.

399
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,010
What is it?

400
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,180
Jujube liquor.

401
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,010
Be honest with me. After you guys entered the university,

402
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,450
did you ever drink wine?

403
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,890
Nope.

404
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:47,930
You?

405
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,190
You must have had some.

406
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,640
You.

407
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,040
You haven't had any?

408
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,500
Oh, my.

409
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,000
Y-You're more well behaved than you look.

410
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,640
Kaituo was very well behaved to begin with.

411
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,630
I'll go get the cups.

412
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,010
Got angry?

413
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,150
That's enough!

414
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,970
Okay, I'll pour it for you.

415
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,730
Continue.

416
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,550
It's your turn.

417
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,660
Here.

418
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,470
Bottoms up. Who's scared of you?

419
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,700
You two just drink according to your limits. Be careful.

420
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,600
Should we do a toast? Happy New Year!

421
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,330
Happy New Year!

422
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,280
Don't burn yourself. Did it burn you? If anything happens...

423
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:59,200
5, 4, 3, 2,1! Happy New Year!

424
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,470
Lin Kaituo.

425
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,100
Lin Kaituo.

426
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,290
Xia Miaomiao.

427
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,600
Xia Miaomiao.

428
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,630
- I feel like I'm going to throw up.
- Right now?

429
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,760
Hold it!

430
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,770
I can't hold it!

431
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,940
You're so fierce.

432
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:05,020
I can't tell if she's actually drunk or faking it.

433
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,270
Sleep then.

434
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,670
Senior.

435
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,630
I want to ask you something.

436
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,100
Go ahead.

437
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:38,140
Where are my glasses?

438
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:45,190
I don't know. I'll help you look for it afterward.

439
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,510
Okay.

440
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,590
Xia Miaomiao, are you awake?

441
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,140
HDFZ, 6, Liang Younian

442
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,540
Senior's room?

443
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,540
Why were my glasses with Senior Dachao?

444
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,350
You must be hungry.

445
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,830
Are we not going to tell them to come eat together?

446
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,820
The others... they can't be woken up.

447
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,630
You eat first.

448
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,990
Be careful. It's hot.

449
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,380
Thank you, Senior.

450
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:48,660
Senior, your dumplings are really good.

451
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,630
These are your dumplings.

452
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:58,070
You brought them over last night.

453
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,710
Oh, I see.

454
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,940
This also tastes really good.

455
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,390
Thank you.

456
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,790
So you guys celebrated the New Year together and didn't even invite me?

457
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,240
That's going too far!

458
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,940
We decided at the last minute.

459
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,310
It would've been the New Year by the time you got there.

460
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,410
But you're really overboard.

461
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,500
You left empty-handed.

462
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,960
How come you brought so much coming back?

463
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,090
Hold this for if you think it's too much.

464
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,450
Did you manage to find a topic for the campus broadcast?

465
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:27,510
No. It's been an entire winter break.

466
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,180
I can't think of anything.

467
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,710
Don't worry. We'll help you think.

468
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:37,880
I saw this over winter break.

469
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,860
Why don't you just do a topic on confessing.

470
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,540
You two can take the opportunity to confess, too.

471
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,780
Then I won't have to analyze your problems every day, I'm so tired of it.

472
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,780
There's this new love confession wall plugin on the site.

473
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,830
Type in the name of the person you like and it will generate a link.

474
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,540
Isn't it cool?

475
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,830
Yeah.

476
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,120
Where are you going?

477
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,310
Broadcasting station!

478
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,460
What's up? You asked me to come over in such a rush.

479
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,930
Senior Sister, come and take a look at the topic I came up with.

480
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,540
I want to do a Confession Special Event with the school newspaper.

481
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,610
It won't be limited to love, family, or friendship.

482
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:29,570
I want to encourage everyone to live while they're young and to loudly express their love.

483
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:33,740
Not bad, but what means will you use to make this event happen?

484
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:40,060
I want to go through the school newspaper and the school social media platform to collect confessions.

485
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:44,300

For a week, we can also coordinate with other offline events.

487
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,640

It's good.

489
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:59,370
Then why don't you see if you can coordinate with other majors to do an offline event together.

00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,360
No problem.
