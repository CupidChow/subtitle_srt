2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,540
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,070
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,120
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,100
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,540
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,140
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,920
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,580
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,550
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,630
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,110
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,590
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,620
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15

♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:08,140
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,590
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,680
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,140
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,080
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,070
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,580
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,170
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,640
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25

28
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,140
♫ Can you read my mind ♫

29
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:57,510
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

30
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:03,110

32

♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

33
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:28,110
S-Senior, you are really good at boxing.

34
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,470
Thank you.

35
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,500
Th-That last punch... it doesn't matter.

36
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,620
I know.

37
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,230
Would you like to play with this?

38
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,000
It's so pretty.

61
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,150
Student Xia Liushui, have you finished packing for your field trip?

62
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,430
I already packed things up at the university.

63
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,630
Show me.

64
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,800
Bring a pair of old shoes with you, so that you can dump them when they get worn out.

65
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,260
I have already packed them.

66
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,710
Let me see. It is this pair, right?

67
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,460
Yeah.

68
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,950
I don't want to nag, but I mean, look at that. How are you even a girl?

69
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,140
How can you call yourself a girl?

70
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,100
Look at this mess. What is this?!

71
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,000
Fold them again! You always make me worry.

72
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,980
You're nothing like me.

73
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,430
I have packed it up quite well, but you have messed it all up.

74
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,560
I'll lend you my new camera.

75
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,080
Take more photos of Kaituo when you're at the ancient town.

76
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,030
They are taking bus number two. These ones are on bus number three.

77
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,780
Get this sorted, okay?

78
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,000
Students, come and get on the bus on time!

79
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,540
Get on your respective buses according to the list. Hurry up!

80
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,280
Get on the bus. Hurry up. There's no time to lose.

81
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,140
- Xia Miaomiao.
- Yes?

82
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,030
Hurry, you're on bus number one.

83
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,890
Okay.

84
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,540
Hey, hold on.

85
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,880
Let's take a photo. Three, two, one.

86
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,670
Three, two, one.

87
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,620
Is this seat...

88
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,600
Three, two, one.

89
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,760
Let me through.

90
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,380
How is this? is it okay. Let's take another one.

91
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,820
Yeah.

92
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,300
There's one missing from the list.

93
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,550
We're one student short. I need to do a roll call.

94
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,500
Everyone, quiet down! I'm calling a roll call.

95
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,970
Liang Younian, present!

96
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,150
Can you clear a seat over there?

97
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,590
S-Sure.

98
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,150
I'll do it. Sure.

99
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,700
Thank you.

100
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,710
All right, Sir. Everyone's present. Close the door and go.

101
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,550
Hey, hold on!

102
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,870
Hold on!

103
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,050
Sir, open the door.

104
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,310
Thank you.

105
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,350
Excuse me, help me with the bag, please? Thanks.

106
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,140
No, Teacher Jia. You're...

107
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,540
I'm going to the ancient town as well. Take me with you.

108
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,950
Why are you going to the ancient town?

109
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,940
I'm going to do research on embroidery in the ancient town.

110
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,810
You can apply for funding for your research.

111
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,670
I would have applied for it if I could.

112
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,830
No, look. This... we don't have any seats left on the bus.

113
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,580
Sir, should I... Keep quiet. look, it's full.

114
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,250
Sir, do you have a folding stool?

115
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,130
- Thank you.
- It's fine, you're welcome.

116
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,050
Look, this is called life experience.

117
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,870
All right, Sir. We're all present.

118
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,740
Let's go!

119
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,380
Y-You can lean back a bit.

120
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,720
Pardon?

121
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,330
Sure.

122
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,620
S-Senior, thank you.

123
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,870
It's okay, right?

124
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,650
It's okay.

125
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,530
By the way, Senior,

126
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,650
didn't you visit last year?

127
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,500
Why did you sign up again this year?

128
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,110
I would like to see if there are materials that I can apply to my design.

129
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,130
Outstanding buildings should be revisited repeatedly.

130
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:32,070
It's such as shame that I'm not as sensitive to architecture as you are. If only I...

131
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,110
Can you be quiet?

132
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,840
All right, we've arrived. Everyone, get off the bus!

133
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,710
Get off the bus.

134
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,950
Everyone, leave your bags.

135
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,340
Let's gather first and I'll announce the itinerary.

136
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,190
Hurry up.

137
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,870
Teacher Jia.

138
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,840
Hey, hey.

139
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,600
Pardon?

140
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,350
Why do you still have time to attend this event?

141
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,140
What? I...

142
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,600
Shouldn't you be busy preparing for transferring majors?

143
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,530
I'm still considering whether to transfer majors.

144
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,840
Look, you love fashion design so much, and you can do it so well.

145
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,780
What are you still considering?

146
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,310
It's...

147
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,740
Gather up! Everyone, there's no time to lose.

148
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,310
We're meeting up. Teacher, I'll head over there first.

149
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,690
Hey...

150
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,020
Seriously...

151
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,590
Everyone, pay attention.

152
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,720
Look. This type of building has the regional features of residential houses.

153
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,470
Look. This type of building has the regional features of residential houses.

154
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,230
It fully integrates the essence of Chinese traditional folk culture.

155
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,490
Its architectural style is unique and has a well-knit structure. Its carvings are exquisite.

156
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,790
Let's take a look at the entire ancient town.

157
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,170
Be it the layout or planar elements...

158
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,460
Shouldn't you be busy preparing for transferring majors?

159
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:55,390
I'm still considering whether to transfer majors.

160
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,170
Spatial arrangement, and the general application of sculptural artfully reflects the distinctive regional features.

161
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,600
Spatial arrangement, and the general application of sculptural art reflects the distinctive regional features.

162
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,970
Why is it out of focus?

163
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,530
Next, I'll go through the itinerary for these two days.

164
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,790
As for the rest of the day, you'll have time for yourself,

165
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,090
to make measurements and make sketches of these ancient buildings.

166
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,650
We need to take as many photos as possible, of the details in these ancient buildings.

167
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,780
Tomorrow, according to these measurements and sketches,

168
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,620
we'll make models of ancient buildings.

169
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,900
Do you all understand?

170
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,380
Teacher, what about food and accommodation?

171
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,780
- You're already hungry?
- Yes.

172
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,180
What a foodie.

173
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,380
At around 4 p.m., we will start a barbeque in the woods at the back.

174
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,320
Woohoo!

175
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,330
And let me talk about accommodation.

176
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,440
Follow this path, and at the end, you'll see a homestay.

177
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,240
As for the rooms, we have already booked them. Two can share a room and you can pair up freely.

178
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,060
But there's an issue. There aren't enough rooms in the homestay right now.

179
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,910
Therefore, including me, and at least four students will have to stay in a different place.

180
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:15,010
Some of you will have to sacrifice a little. Who wants to volunteer for it? Raise your hand.

181
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,780
I signed up last minute, so I'll volunteer.

182
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,110
All right. Anyone else?

183
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,660
I'm a teacher after all, count me in.

184
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,950
All right.

185
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,160
Miaomiao, how about you stay with me?

186
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,860
All right.

187
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,120
We need one more person. Who's it going to be?

188
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,570
Me.

189
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,540
Good, that's enough then.

190
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,480
How about this? You have some free time now. Remember, we're having a barbeque in the woods at 4 p.m.

191
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,920
After dinner, we'll move our bags to our rooms. Understand?

192
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,000
Okay!

193
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,600
Go on.

194
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,160
See you later.

195
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,670
All right.

196
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,660
What is it?

197
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:15,610
Xinxin, how do you adjust focus on your camera? Why can't I get it right?

198
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,490
How about adjusting it to autofocus?

199
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,840
Pardon? How do I do that?

200
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:26,270
Actually, I just bought it. Why don't I look it up when I back in the dorm?

201
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,150
Forget it. I can take photos with my phone.

202
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,030
No way!

203
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,400
I'm hanging up.

204
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,590
My photography skills are not bad after all.

205
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,430
Just a bit of adjusting and it works.

206
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,900
S...Senior.

207
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,540
Did you already go there?

208
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,980
Yeah, I climbed over the wall.

209
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,510
However... It was all for nothing.

210
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,320
There's nothing in it. It's too shabby.

211
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,450
Let's go.

212
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,400
Go where?

213
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,070
I already caught a whiff of the barbeque.

214
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,850
Barbeque should go with beer. Do you not get it?

215
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,470
It's as if.

216
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,640
Only barbarians have beers with barbeque.

217
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,660
Civilized men should have coke.

218
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,600
How many years have you been walking upright?

219
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,000
You dare you to call yourself a civilized man.

220
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,960
A few years before you did. Two years.

221
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,510
You're so old.

222
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,920
What did you say?

223
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,470
Hey!

224
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,990
Teacher Jia, you—

225
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,590
Seriously.

226
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,010
You're grilling the squid quite well.

227
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,490
Can you teach me?

228
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,740
Place it on the fire.

229
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,760
And then?

230
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,520
Grill it.

231
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,140
Miaomiaoa and Senior...

232
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,770
Senior, the pictures you took are so good.

233
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,280
Not bad, right?

234
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,900
Did you know that Miaomiao is switching majors?

235
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,610
She's transferring to Fashion Design Department.

236
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,770
How do you know that?

237
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,820
The professor from the Fashion Design Department was asking her earlier.

238
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,160
When we got off the bus earlier, I overheard Teacher Jia say that...

239
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,500
Say what...?

240
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,500
[Lush Courtyard]

241
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,780
Why can I never focus the camera at a critical moment?

242
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,980
Do you have issues with the focus?

243
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,940
I'll help you take a look.

244
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,620
Sure.

245
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,890
Oh, no.

246
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,590
Get up.

247
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,530
Here.

248
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,170
The focus is okay now.

249
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,650
Pardon?

250
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,400
What should I explain?

251
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,400
Could he be jealous?

252
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,200
I must be overthinking , right?

253
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,000
This is for you.

254
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,500
Well...

255
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,600
I heard that you're transferring majors?

256
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,000
What for?

257
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,800
At worst...

258
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,200
At worst, I'll just be nicer to you.

259
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,000
Senior, what are you doing?

260
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,900
When I travel to a new place, I'm used to recording it on the travel app.

261
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,200
Want to eat some?

262
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,200
Thank you.

263
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
- The thing is...
- The thing is...

264
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,400
You first.

265
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,260
Actually, you should switch majors.

266
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,400
- But...
- But what?

267
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,200
But... There's someone in our department I can't bear to leave.

268
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Wh-What I meant to say is... I have many friends in our department,

269
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,800
and the teachers are also very nice to me.

270
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,100
My grades have also improved a lot so...

271
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,240
I studied architecture...

272
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,000
because since I was a child, I always think that

273
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,800
building houses is particularly interesting.

274
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,600
It's not because my mom is an architect.

275
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,200
In high school, you said you wanted to study fashion design.

276
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Your eyes sparkled when you said that.

277
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,300
But now that you're in the Architecture Department,

278
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,000
I can't see the same passion in you.

279
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,200
Xia Miaomiao!

280
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,350
- Go have some food.
- Okay.

281
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,800
I... can get up on my own.

282
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,400
What are you doing? Put me down.

283
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,800
I'll dump you into the water if you keep on nagging.

284
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,000
No, I'm not even hurt. Put me down.

285
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,260
There are nails on the bridge.

286
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,000
What if you step on them?

287
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Don't get me wrong.

288
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,600
I just think that... I bullied you too often in the past.

289
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,000
To the point that you even wanted to switch majors.

290
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,400
So, I should be nicer to you.

291
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,100
I'm not switching majors because of you.

292
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,400
Just put me down first.

293
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,000
I'll put you down after we finish crossing the bridge.

294
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,500
Keep fussing and I'll carry you on my shoulders.

295
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,000
What kind of house are we staying in?

296
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,400
It's the homestay owner's ancestral home.

297
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,800
Is it very ancient?

298
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
It's not.

299
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,600
We'll have a chance to experience staying in a Chinese traditional building.

300
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,100
How is it? We're here.

301
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,100
This is surely some life experience.

302
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,600
Let's go. What are we still waiting for?

303
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,400
You're the one standing still, not us.

304
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
Keep up.

305
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,800
Don't be finicky. This is such a simple countryside..

306
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,000
Who is being finicky?

307
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,900
Miaomiao, these are the Doraemon flowers that you like, Liang Younian.

308
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,200
Those flowers... were supposed to be given to me?

309
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,900
Those were for me.

310
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,400
Do you like staying in shabby houses that much?

311
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,400
You're sick.

312
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,600
Don't be scared.

313
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,100
Senior.

314
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,600
Did you just open the door just now?

315
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,860
No.

316
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:38,210
It's all right. I'll go take a look.

317
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,000
Can I go with you?

318

319

00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,100
You're staying up at night to sing out here?

326
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,200
Kaituo...

327
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,600
There seemed to be someone outside just now.

328
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
"A quiet conscience sleeps in thunder."

329
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,620

330
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,500

331

Brother Yuan...

332
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,710
Brother Yuan...

333
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,410
- Miaomiao.
- Yes?

334
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,200
Stay here and don't go anywhere.

335
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,340
Kaituo and I will go take a look first.

336
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,200
I'm... scared of being by myself here.

337
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,700
Can I... go together with you guys?

338
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,260
Who is playing ghost out there?

339
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,390
Come out now!

340
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,250
Brother Yuan!

341
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,430
Brother Yuan...

342
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,230

345
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,600
Very good, you're all doing very well.

346
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,860
"A day's plan lies in the morning." We should be efficient.

347
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,690
Li Baiyang, efficiency.

348
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:53,260
You, hurry up. Eat faster. Eat your buns faster.

349
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:58,070
As for this field trip, we have to make models.

350
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:03,900
Now, based on the measurements and sketches we made yesterday, we're going to be making models of the ancestral houses.

351
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,200
I've grouped you randomly. Feel free to cooperate.

352
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,550
When you're making models, be sure to coordinate the landscape with the building.

353
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,130
- Understand?
- Yes, understood.

354
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,500
Hurry up, get moving.

355
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,950
- Be efficient. Hurry up.
- Yes.

356
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,540
- Let's go.
- Hurry up. Go over there.

357
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,110
- I can't eat anymore.
- Eat it up quickly.

358
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,110
Hurry up.

359
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:37,190
How do we start?

360
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,700
You're good with color coordination and handiwork. You'll be in charge of the landscapes.

361
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,760
- Kaituo and I will take care of the building itself.
- Sure.

362
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,020
How come you get to delegate?

363
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:53,220
I was unlucky enough to be on your team, but it doesn't make you the leader.

364
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,700
Nor should I have to listen to you.

365
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:03,340
Okay then, you can delegate. I'll listen to you, Team Leader.

366
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,230
Split up and handle the materials first.

367
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,820
All right.

368
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,480
What?

369
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:48,270
It's not this embroidery, too.

370
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,590
Would it be a lost embroidery?

371
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,850
Lend me two sandpapers. Thank you.

372
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,450
Who told you to saw it?

373
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,900
It's crooked. Give me the saw. I'll do it.

374
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,680
I'll give it a go again. I can do this.

375
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,840
There's only this much wood. There isn't enough for you to waste.

376
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,420
Miaomiao.

377
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,100
Try not to saw it vertically.

378
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,310
Look at how I do it. Hold your saw a bit slanted. Try it.

379
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,410
It really works.

380
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,290
You're smiling? You won't smile when you hurt your hand.

381
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,180
What's wrong?

382
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,510
Nothing.

383
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,230
What are you doing with that?

384
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,850
I'm going to polish this.

385
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,550
Give it to me.

386
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,310
When you're done, I have to work on it again. I don't have that much time.

387
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:04,070
I haven't done it yet. How do you know that I won't do it well?

388
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:08,160
It goes without thinking. Look for materials for the landscape.

389
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,070
- But—
- No "buts".

390
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,400
I'm the team leader. You have to listen to me.

391
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,830
Go on.

392
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,060
Do you like Xia Miaomiao?

393
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,860
How could I like Xia Miaomiao?

394
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,090
Am I blind? She's just a trouble maker!

395
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,650
Don't you find her dumb and foolish?

396
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,470
She can't do anything well.

397
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,420
I don't think so.

398
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,310
Since the first day I met Xia Miaomiao,

399
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:12,420
she was neither dumb nor foolish.

400
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,630
She is adorable and kind.

401
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,510
What?

402
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,350
It's a match.

403
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,820
- You gave me a fright.
- I'm sorry.

404
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,200
- Do you want to stay here?
- No! No!

405
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,350
No, I'd just like to ask who embroidered this portiere?

406
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,990
This? My grandma did.

407
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,310
Why?

408
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,950
I'm a teacher at Haicheng University's Fashion Design Department.

409
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,540
I would like to learn how to do this ancient embroidery. Can you take me to see her?

410
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,940
Well...

411
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,650
My grandma doesn't remember a thing now.

412
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,410
She might not be of any help. How about this?

413
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,340
I'll ask her.

414
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,820
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

415
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,700
What's wrong?

416
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,390
My grandma is missing again.

417
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,670
She went out once last night.

418
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,610
Your students bought her home.

419
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,310
- Where has she gone now?
- What should we do? Should we call the police?

420
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,230
No need, no need.

421
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,430
I'll check at our old house. She is often there.

422
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,570
Wait for me!

423
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,700
Wait for me!

424
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,100
Where... where is this?

425
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,080
Pardon?

426
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,620
What am I doing here?

427
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,750
Grandma, what are you doing here?
