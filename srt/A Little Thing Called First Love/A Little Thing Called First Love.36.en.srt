A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,550
♫  I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,130
♫  To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,050
♫  I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,160
♫  But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,640
♫  Pretending that I don't care  ♫

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,070
♫  Pretending to be busy every day  ♫

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,930
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it  ♫

9
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,630
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now  ♫

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,590
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see  ♫

11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,530
♫  My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,220
♫  I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,620
♫  Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,540
♫  At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,590
♫  My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,110
♫  I want to control myself and forget you  ♫

17
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,400
♫  But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,570
♫  If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,100
♫  Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,080
♫  Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,070
♫  Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,660
♫  Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,110
♫  And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,870
♫  According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:00,120
♫ Is the result of Heaven's favor  ♫

26

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,150
Wang Yichao!

33
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,600
Huh?

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,320
Since you are a guest here, could you act like one?

35
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,220
What's going on?

36
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,810
Our Brother Nian seems to be kind of irritable today, isn't he?

37
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,070
Are you jealous that I'm currently in a sweet, sweet love?

38
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,550
What do you want?

39
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,930
Wang Yichao. Let me warn you.

40
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,160
If you keep on messing around, I will kick you out.

41
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,490
You already graduated and yet you still won't leave school.

42
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,720
Did I sleep in your bed?

43
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,730
I've been sleeping in Li Ran's bed.

44
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,210
So why do you want to kick me out?

45
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,730
I guess it's true that only those who have girlfriends understand each other.

46
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,930
Who would've thought that the first one to get a girlfriend

47
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,810
would now be the single guy?

48
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,660
Do you want me to invite Kaituo, who also has a girlfriend,

49
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,020
Do you want me to invite Kaituo, who also has a girlfriend,

50
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,730
to think of some ideas for a single guy like you?

51
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,900
I'll shut up.

52
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,390
Keep reading. Keep reading.

53
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,400
Why are you still handing him drinks?

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,700
Let me tell you, don't drink too much. Take it easy.

55
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,690
If you keep drinking, no one will carry you home.

56
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,650
What? Are you trying to kill me or something?

57
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,550
I'm telling my Xiaoyue that you are bullying me.

58
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,260
You are so disgusting!

59
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,360
You love showing off that much?

60
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,780
Have you thought about Younian's fragile heart?

61
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,740
Do you think he wants to be single? He doesn't!

62
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:19,620
Hey hey hey! Are you guys going to help me or are you going to keep laughing at me?

63
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,470
- Both.
- Both.

64
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,620
Stop drinking! Why are you still drinking?

65
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,110
Do you think this can solve your problem?

66
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,340
Isn't it all about coaxing Miaomiao to come back?

67
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,800
Her usual personality is like that of a bunny.

68
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,180
It's easy to make her happy.

69
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,120
You must just have had the wrong strategy.

70
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,860
You make it sound so easy.

71
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,980
Would she be more difficult than He Xin?

72
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,470
He Xin is an irritable little squirrel.

73
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,540
We have been too careless.

74
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,460
Who knew that even the thing with your mom

75
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,170
was not enough for Xia Miaomiao to forgive you.

76
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,720
Isn't she too cold-hearted?

77
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,940
Sorry. Xia Miaomiao is kind and thoughtful. Okay?

78
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,590
I knew that you two weren't reliable.

79
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,960
How about we speak from our own experiences for him to make references to?

80
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,050
I think that could work.

81
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,690
My experience is actually pretty simple.

82
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,490
Just shamelessly clinging on her and care for her in every way,

83
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,290
and then I met her father.

84
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,850
After meeting her dad, I have no idea how we got together.

85
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,260
Maybe it was because I'm quite handsome.

86
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,140
My experience was that I kept pissing her off until she exploded, and then I confessed my love to her.

87
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,770
And then I kept pissing her off again. And then I eventually succeeded.

88
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,140
Why aren't I spending my time drawing?

89
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,190
But I think there is one thing that worked for He Xin.

90
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,820
Speak. I'm out of ways, so why not?

91
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,460
Just pretend to be hurt.

92
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,460
And Miaomiao won't have a choice but to feel anxious about you.

93
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,580
You guys keep messing around. I need to go draw.

94
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,920
Hey! Are you just going to leave like this?

95
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,530
Are you looking down on our experience in relationships?

96
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,860
Even I look down on myself.

97
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,510
Yourself? Are you dumb or something?

98
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,550
Come back!

99
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,890
Why is it so hard to find an internship?

100
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,390
Don't worry too much. It takes time.

101
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,880
Of course, you're not worried.

102
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,810
There are already three big companies waiting for you to intern for them.

103
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,020
But why aren't you going to any of them?

104
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,230
I want to find a small start-up company to work at.

105
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,320
This way, I'll have the work experience needed to enter competitions.

106
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,210
Also you learn more in small companies.

107
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,790
Then when the time is right, I'll know how to build my own brand.

108
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,260
You're so impressive.

109
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,030
He's so handsome, yet you were able to break up with him?

110
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,490
Xia Miaomiao, you're amazing.

111
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,260
I got breakfast for you guys.

112
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,430
Wow, it's my favorite soup dumplings!

113
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,850
Thank you. We have to go to class.

114
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,110
Senior, you're amazing.

115
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:58,810
Senior, do you need me for something today?

116
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,370
No.

117
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,590
N-No? You've been following me all day.

118
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,910
I think that works.

119
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,550
My experience is actually quite simple.

120
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,390
Just shamelessly clinging on her and care for her in every way,

121
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,130
and then I went to meet her father.

122
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,620
After meeting her dad, I don't know how but we ended up together.

123
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,100
Maybe it was because I'm handsome.

124
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,630
When is your dad coming back?

125
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,580
That... Ah, forget it, forget it.

126
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,110
I really am just spouting nonsense.

127
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,330
Hey.

128
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,360
You are back.

129
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,550
This is the draft of my blueprint revision. I'm done drawing.

130
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,900
So this is the draft you came up with after arguing with me.

131
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,380
You really are wasting my time.

132
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,620
Please point out the exact problems, so I can fix them.

133
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,570
Don't you know where your problem is? It's ugly.

134
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,330
It's only practical, but no artistry!

135
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,100
You are better than this.

136
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,660
Okay. Understood. I will fix it.

137
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,840
I hope you won't disappoint me again.

138
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,080
I'm paying my respect to you again.

139
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,680
How did you get through this year?

140
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,180
Actually, I don't really feel like it was that hard.

141
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,780
You're crazy.

142
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,700
Excuse me, which one of you is Fang Xiaoyue?

143
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,530
That's me.

144
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,400
- Hello. Your package.
- Thank you.

145
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,700
Right, your boyfriend asked me to tell you that he misses you.

146
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:30,500
Oh, my god! That is too sweet.

147
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Hey, come on. We're at work.

148
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,030
The beauty in our architecture department

149
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,160
got taken by the other department.

150
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,030
What are you two doing all day?

151
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,320
It's okay. Younian used to date the prettiest girl in Fashion Department.

152
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,330
One beauty to another. It's been worthy.

153
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,760
Xia Miaomiao used to be in Architecture.

154
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,570
You are taking care of yourself within the department.

155
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,430
What are you guys talking about?

156
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,630
I don't understand and it makes me a little sad.

157
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,440
Let's continue, Frank.

158
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,740
Let's do this.

159
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,380
Are you that happy getting chocolates?

160
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,300
Actually, when a girl gets a surprise gift,

161
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,670
she is very happy.

162
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,780
Senior Miaomiao.

163
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,270
Senior Lin Xia, can I talk alone with Senior Miaomiao?

164
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,740
Okay.

165
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,360
Do you need me for anything?

166
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,580
Senior Miaomiao.

167
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,970
This is for you.

168
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,560
I can't accept that.

169
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,660
Senior Miaomiao, I like you.

170
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,410
I'm sorry. I don't like you.

171
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,980
I know that.

172
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,620
But Senior Miaomiao,

173
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,790
could you give me a chance to get to know you?

174
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,720
Actually, I noticed you the moment I entered school.

175
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,940
I've been working hard towards your direction.

176
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,020
You made me become a better person.

177
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,300
To me, you are really very important.

178
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,370
To me, you are really very important.

179
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,950
So...

180
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,990
could you please reconsider?

181
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,620
Senior.

182
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,340
I need to tell you something.

183
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,750
I like you.

184
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,440
Thank you for liking me.

185
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,660
I'm also very happy that I'm so important to you.

186
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,350
But I really can't say yes to you. I'm sorry.

187
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,110
Can I at least keep you company?

188
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,400
I don't think so.

189
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,040
Okay.

190
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,260
Thank you, Senior Miaomiao.

191
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,300
Senior Miaomiao, goodbye.

192
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,040
Goodbye.

193
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,240
Sometimes, Miaomiao is so cold that she's scary, right?

194
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,330
You can do it! I'll be here.

195
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,140
What are you doing here?

196
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,130
What if I said that I just happened to pass by?

197
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,620
You wouldn't believe me, would you?

198
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,600
I really wasn't following you today.

199
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,970
I'm just here to give you a little gift.

200
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:32,000
Xiaoyue said all girls are happy when you give them gifts.

201
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,290
Thank you.

202
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,230
So you accepted it.

203
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,180
Wang Yutian was trying to give you so many chocolates earlier, and you didn't take them.

204
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:58,620
Does it mean that you are not mad at me anymore?

205
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,140
I actually wasn't mad at you.

206
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,690
I was just really scared.

207
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,460
Scared of what?

208
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,460
I was scared that if something similar happened in the future,

209
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,200
when you needed to make a decision,

210
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,330
you'll still exclude me.

211
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,790
Miaomiao, I promise you that next time—

212
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,640
Senior.

213
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,760
I really do like you a lot.

214
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,030
Every single decision I make has everything to do with you.

215
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,030
Yet it seems that I...

216
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,160
was never able to affect you.

217
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,770
To the point where I thought

218
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,850
that you never really liked me the way I like you.

219
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,150
that you never really liked me the way I like you.

220
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,600
I didn't know that I was—

221
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,060
So give me some more time, okay?

222
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,580
I don't want to listen to you!

223
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,390
Mom, what's going on?

224
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,800
Sister, it's me. I'm calling you with Mom's phone.

225
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,680
Hurry and come back. Dad is back.

226
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,960
Dad is back? Wait for me. I will be back soon.

227
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,880
Mom and Dad are arguing.

228
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,480
Why are they arguing?

229
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,530
We are moving again.

230
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,240
We're moving again?

231
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,680
Wait for me, I will be home soon.

232
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,520
Senior, I have something urgent, so I need to go home.

233
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,200
It's late. I'll accompany you.

234
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,420
I also need to go back and get some resources that my mom left behind.

235
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,090
Okay.

236
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,820
Sister, help. I think Mom and Dad are really going to get a divorce.

237
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,530
Mom, Dad, what's going on?

238
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:02,030
You! Be quiet and let me talk.

239
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,740
Your father switched his route again.

240
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,990
In order to accommodate him, we have to move again.

241
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,470
Don't get so riled up.

242
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,760
We don't have to move.

243
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,630
Didn't I say that it was just going to waste some time on my way back?

244
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,630
What do you mean by "don't get riled up"?

245
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:22,530
Xia, you're floating in the ocean at least three months a year.

246
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,720
You only have a couple of days off!

247
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,830
What do you mean by it'd just be "wasting some time on your way back"?

248
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,690
How many days are you planning on wasting on the road?!

249
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,210
You tell me.

250
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,900
Tell me what should I be doing right now?

251
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,030
- What do I want you to do?
- Right.

252
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:40,870
Don't you know? How old do you think you are?!

253
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,900
Have you never thought about transferring back and working on land at all?

254
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,080
How could you compare the salary you make when working on land with the salary I make now?

255
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,310
Good, the kids are here. Here is what I think.

256
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,630
When you are independent and start to make money,

257
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,910
I don't have to work in the ocean this much.

258
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,160
Then I can come back and manage the store with you—

259
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,690
All right, all right... Just shut up!

260
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,310
Making money is important.

261
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,270
Have you ever spent time with them when they were growing up?

262
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,850
Have you ever taken care of anything in this home?!

263
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,310
Can the three of us even depend on you when we get sick?

264
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,690
Don't even say anything.

265
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:18,910
I save money any way I can and I wake up early every morning to manage our restaurant.

266
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,840
It is for supplementing our home.

267
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,570
I do this so you don't have to work at sea!

268
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,200
But I realized it today.

269
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,700
You never thought about reuniting with your family.

270
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,710
In your heart, there is only the ocean and no place for your family!

271
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,710
Mom, don't be mad.

272
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,300
Don't worry.

273
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,100
She has that temper and you know it.

274
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,010
She says that, but she will understand you eventually.

275
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,720
Actually, your mother is right.

276
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:24,770
All these years... she really has been working very hard.

277
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:36,520
No matter what choice you make, we will all support you.

278
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,990
Who drew this so... No wonder Bob threw this away.

279
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,290
Good luck on the exam :)

280
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,120
Why did I hide this so well?

281
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:38,130
What's wrong? You looked so mature out there.

282
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,200
Why are you so upset now?

283
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,540
Haicheng is the place that we've stayed in the longest.

284
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:50,150
I have so many good friends here. I really don't want to move anymore.

285
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:59,860
Good friends will be good friends forever, like Ah Xia and me.

286
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,620
Also when you move somewhere new, you can also make new friends.

287
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,930
You can also contact them online, right?

288
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,560
Dad doesn't want me to use the internet.

289
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,100
I'll sneakily let you.

290
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,310
Hello?

291
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,060
Miaomiao, do you want to pick seashells on the beach?

292
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,290
I'm at the lighthouse already.

293
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,090
Why are we picking seashells?

294
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,720
Then could you come to the lighthouse?

295
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,220
I don't really want to go there right now.

296
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,820
I really do have something I want to tell you.

297
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,000
Didn't we already talk today?

298
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:22,460
Just pretend to be hurt, so Miaomiao will have to be anxious for you.

299
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,490
What? Are you hurt?

300
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,230
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.

301
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,520
Don't move. I will be there soon. Dad.

302
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,820
- Dad.
- I've thought it through.

303
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,150
I have something urgent so I need to leave right now.

304
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,800
Let's talk when I get back.

305
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,380
Where are you hurt?

306
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,240
Miaomiao.

307
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:28,220
You wouldn't come out, so I had to lie to you.

308
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,580
I'm leaving.

309
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,800
I really do have something I want to tell you.

310
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,590
Could you stop lying to me?

311
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:44,990
You asked me why the necklace I gave you was 9:30.

312
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,800
So... 9:30 was purposefully designed by you?

313
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,100
So... 9:30 was purposefully designed by you?

314
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:08,340
Do you still remember the day when we picked Xinxin up from the orphanage?

315
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:25,000
♫ When you showed up the whole city is blurred  ♫

316
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,910
♫ Your face felt strange ♫

317
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,480
Really think about it.

318
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,160
Do you only really see Xia Miaomiao as your little sister?

319
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:48,420
♫ I miss your smiles ♫

320
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,810
Right now, Beijing time is 9:30 p.m.

321
00:30:53,810 --> 00:31:01,710
The average speed might be slower due to traffic after work...

322
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,140
I thought that was the day that I fell for you.

323
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,920
Wasn't it?

324
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,800
Didn't you say that you felt like I was hiding everything from you?

325
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,330
I am going to tell you everything today.

326
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,320
Senior!

327
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,070
I-I thought you finished the entrance exam.

328
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,730
Why are you still drawing?

329
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,370
I'm still in a hurry trying to finish one last drawing.

330
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,050
What's the hurry?

331
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:49,300
The reason why I kept on going back to the studio after the exam...

332
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:55,450
was because I knew I would see you there.

333
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,050
It's been a while.

334
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,390
When I was a freshman in college,

335
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:03,000
I actually had no time for the ceremony

336
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,450
because... I was so busy.

337
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,200
It's been a while, everyone.

338
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,100
But when I thought about how it had been a long time since I'd seen you,

339
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,400
I couldn't help but go back.

340
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,940
Why are my glasses feeling weird right now?

341
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,950
There was one year, your family came to my family's for New Years.

342
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,020
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

343
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,520
Shouldn't we call them to join us?

344
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:38,720
I can't... wake them up. Let's just eat first.

345
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,320
Okay.

346
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,100
When I woke you up the next day,

347
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,910
I actually didn't plan on waking up the others at all.

348
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,050
I didn't know why.

349
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:56,550
But that day, I just wanted to have breakfast with you alone.

350
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,690
This is for you.

351
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,210
For me?

352
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,620
The coconut bowl that I gave you.

353
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,300
The painting in it was completely different from the other ones.

354
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,450
There were two people in the painting.

355
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,680
One is you, and the other is me.

356
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:29,030
I have liked you for a long time.

357
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,960
You said you felt like you were never able to affect me,

358
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,820
but that's actually not true.

359
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,200
When the entrance exam ended,

360
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,190
and I was about to give up pursuing Architecture at Haicheng University,

361
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,310
you suddenly showed up in the lighthouse.

362
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:53,360
You helped me regain my faith for my choice.

363
00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:01,390
Senior, I want to show you a place.

364
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:05,080
When I was out of ideas for the design competition,

365
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,710
it was you who gave me inspiration.

366
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,320
Are you okay? It will stop raining soon.

367
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,520
Let's just not listen to it.

368
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,480
When I had a panic attack at the construction site,

369
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:27,410
it was you who helped me out of the shadow.

370
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,120
I like you.

371
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,690
I like you very, very much.

So when are you guys moving?

384
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,710
We haven't decided yet.

385
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,590
My father is still waiting for my mother's approval.

386
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,180
Then will I never see you again?

387
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,500
If you really move, that is.

388
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,840
We can see each other at school.

389
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,400
Also I can go to you, or you can come to me.

390
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,190
Which city are you moving to?

391
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,490
I'm not sure yet.

392
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,540
I need to get a job in that city then.

393
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,750
Mr. Liang will yell at me if you do that.

394
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,220
Who cares.

395
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:34,000
Slower! Baby.

396
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,700
Didn't you guys break up?

397
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,880
Thank you Other Languages Moderators
for your hard work

398
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,050
Come over here.

399
00:36:52,690 --> 00:37:01,180
Thank you to the entire The Crazy Little Team 💞

400
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,080
What's your name? How old are you?

401
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,710
What do you study?

402
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,530
Where do you live?

403
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,750
How many people are in your family?

404
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,800
What do your parents do?

405
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,340
His name is Liang Younian.

406
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,080
He is one year older than sister.

407
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,780
He's in architecture and he has super good grades.

408
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,600
His house is a couple of blocks away from us.

409
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,880
There are four people in his family.

410
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,580
His father is an art teacher and his mother stays at home.

411
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,000
Oh, by the way. He also has a little brother.

412
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,460
Wh-Why are you guys looking at me like that?

413
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:40,980
I just... investigated him when he walked Miaomiao back for the first time.

414
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,270
Earlier, Yaoyao said you guys broke up. What happened?

415
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,550
We're already back together.

416
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:50,540
We know. You were holding hands.

417
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,020
We're asking why you guys broke up.

418
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,860
Aunt, it was actually all my fault, because I—

419
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,750
It was my fault. It was none of his business.

420
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,390
- Miaomiao—
- I will tell them.

421
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,600
Be quiet! You tell us.

422
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,750
All right. Let's stop pushing them.

423
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,690
It's normal for young people to bicker with each other.

424
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:15,100
We broke up every three days when we were young.

425
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,740
You were just trying to divorce me, too.

426
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:23,250
If I didn't say that I wasn't moving, your mother was going to sign the papers tomorrow.

427
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,530
We're talking about the kids. Why are you mentioning this?

428
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,690
Mom, a-are we not moving?

- Let's see the floor plan of the apartment complex for the elderly.
- Okay.

447
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,170
Look at Frank's face. I think he is in danger.

448
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,710
Look at Frank's face. I think he is in danger.

449
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,990
But look at Mr. Lian's face.

450
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,570
He seems pretty satisfied.

451
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:50,490
Hey, you're already an outstanding designer. I promise.

452
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,380
Come here!

453
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:21,870
Yay!

454
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:25,900
This way.

455
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,690
Put it on.

456
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,910
The front row, get down.

457
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,190
Ready?

458
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,720

Senior, where are you taking me?

469
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,720

00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:01,900
Now.
♫ Our encounter ♫

478
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:07,390
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

479
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:11,400
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

480
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,340
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

481
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,890
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

482
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,320
Where is this?

483
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,280
♫ At every moment, you're all I see ♫

484
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,300
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

485
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,890
♫ I want to control myself and forget you ♫

486
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,610
The lighthouse.

487
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,020
This... this is...

488
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,480
My first project

489
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,880
is complete.

490
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,290
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

491
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:03,380
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

492
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,900
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

493
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,370
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

494
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:15,400
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

495
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,320
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

496
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,900
♫ I want to control myself and forget you ♫

497
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:27,420
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

498
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,300
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

499
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,400
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

500
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,910
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

501
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:43,300
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

502
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:47,960
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

503
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,510
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

504
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,230
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

505
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:12,600
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

506
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:18,190
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

507
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:21,660
♫ My heart... ♫

508
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:38,230
♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

509
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:46,420
♫ I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

510
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,700
♫ Regarding what love feels like ♫

511
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,820
♫ I've only heard about it from friends ♫

512
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:01,670
♫ I never thought about when it would be my turn ♫

513
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:06,270
♫ You are so dazzling and outstanding ♫

514
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,300
♫ I'm just a faint breeze blowing ♫

515
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:15,180
♫ But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

516
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,320
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

517
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,040
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

518
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:27,410
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

519
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:33,000
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

520
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,150
♫ My heart... ♫
