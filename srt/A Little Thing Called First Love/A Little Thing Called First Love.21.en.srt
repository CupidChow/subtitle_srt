A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,600
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,200
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,200
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,200
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,600
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,700
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,200
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,600
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,200
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,100
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,600
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,000
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,700
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,200
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,000
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,400
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

Xia—

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
Student's Change of Major Application Form

29
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,500
Architecture Department

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
- Teacher.
- Yes?

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,800
I would like to request to change my major.

32
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,560
Are you sure you want to change majors?

33
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,990
Actually, you should switch majors.

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,200
- But...
- But what?

35
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,010
But... There's someone in our department I can't bear to leave.

36
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,400
I studied architecture because since I was a child, I've always thought that

37
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,200
building houses is particularly interesting.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,900
It's not because my mom is an architect.

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,600
In high school, you said you wanted to study fashion design.

40
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,700
Your eyes sparkled when you said that.

41
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,830
But now that you're in the Architecture Department,

42
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,670
I can't see the same passion in you.

43
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
If you've decided to change majors,

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,200
do you know the rules to switch majors in our school?

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,200
You will need to self learn all the first-year courses of fashion design.

46
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,000
You will need to take the mock exam with the other students and turn in the semester assignment.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You have to at least have a passing grade after completing the requirements to be permitted to change majors.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,500
I understand.

49
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,400
Other than that, you wouldn't be able to take the architecture exams since the two exams are held at the same time.

50
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,300
If you don't change majors successfully, that means you will need to re-take the year.

51
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,300
I fully understand the consequences.

52
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,300
Okay, I wish you success.

53
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,450
Thank you, Teacher.

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,200
When's Liang Younian going to be back?

55
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,000
He's in the Model Room. It's his second home.

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,200
No, I need to ask Younian to help me out with the final assignment.

57
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,330
Oh, you're back!

58
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,400
Brother Nian, help me with this.

59
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,200
Don't you know how sharp Hawk Eye is?

60
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,600
He would definitely know I was the one who drew it.

61
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,400
What if he can't tell?

62
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,600
Younian, ignore them. I put the Architecture Design Competition Registration Form on your desk.

63
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,400
- Remember to fill it out.
- Okay.

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,300
University Architecture Design Competition Registration Form

65
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,000
Mengfei, can't you turn your phone volume down?

66
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Did you guys all block the class group chat?

67
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,800
- Xia Miaomiao is going to change majors!
- What?

68
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,200
Why is she trying to change majors?

69
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,400
Maybe it's because Kaituo bullies her every day,

70
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,500
so he has scared off our architecture major's little rabbit.

71
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
Isn't this that person?

72
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,700
What's going on?

73
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,600
What is it?

74
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Are you really changing majors?

75
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah.

76
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're dumb! Why are you trying to change majors?

77
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Do you have nothing better to do? Why are you calling me dumb?

78
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,300
Anyway, what does me changing majors have anything to do with you?

79
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,800
I think you won't be able to change majors, so don't waste your time trying.

80
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,500
Wait and see. I will definitely change majors successfully.

81
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,700
Xia Miaomiao, I am not permitting you to change majors!

82
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,600
What are you looking at? Go back to go to sleep!

83
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,200
Little fishy, eat well. Big Sister will eat, too.

84
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,800
Ah Xia, other than the exams,

85
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,800
what is the fashion major's final assignment?

86
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,100
You need to create a men's coat.

87
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,600
I have never tried making menswear. Is it difficult?

88
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,000
It looks simple.

89
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,800
You really are a layman. Compared to womenswear, menswear is really hard to make.

90
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,400
Haven't you heard that

91
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,800
menswear focuses on craftsmanship, not on aesthetics. Womenswear focuses on aesthetics, not on craftsmanship.

92
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,800
Really?

93
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Really.

94
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,400
I should just die.

95
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Why don't you draw the design first? In our department, we submit the final assignment before the exam.

96
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,500
Do it quick.

97
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,100
Why are they all in use?

98
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,400
What should we do if there are no more male mannequins?

99
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,800
The male mannequins were few to begin with.

100
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,000
They're in high demand every time.

101
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,400
Why don't I buy one?

102
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,800
It would be too expensive and unrealistic to buy one.

103
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
This isn't right.

104
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,500
Who is it that reserved this but not use it?

105
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
If you're not from the Fashion Design Department, then don't keep coming to our studio.

106
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,800
You're bothering us.

107
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,200
What's there to bother about your mosquito net?

108
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,600
Ordinary people like you would not understand the gothic style.

109
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,000
Tang Mengfei, aren't you being—

110
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,600
Watch out.

111
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,800
It's fine.

112
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,230
Let's find another way.

113
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,580
There's so many people here, and I'm not even in your department yet.

114
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,820
It really is a disturbance to you guys, by making clothes here.

115
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,870
How about this afternoon? We all have another class this afternoon so this room will be empty.

116
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,780
The model is the problem now.

117
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,040
I know!

118
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,390
What?

119
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,940
Come with me.

120
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,870
So you want me to be your model?

121
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,360
Senior Da Chao, sorry to trouble you.

122
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,380
Why should I be your model? Do I look so idle?

123
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,200
We'll pay you.

124
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,680
How much?

125
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,700
According to the standard of work-study program, ¥8 (~$1.2 USD) an hour.

126
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,010
- ¥10 ( ~$1.5 USD).
- Okay.

127
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,630
Boss, it's my pleasure to serve you.

128
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,240
When do you need my service?

129
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,830
Today and tomorrow afternoon, is that okay?

130
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,660
This afternoon?

131
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,650
Any problem? Or we can find another model.

132
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,400
I am free. Well...

133
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,590
As long as you're happy, Boss.

134
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,940
Come with your boss then.

135
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,360
What are you doing? Have you ever made 3D cutting before?

136
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,150
You have to use grey cloth.

137
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,680
I'm sorry.

138
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,650
Be careful! Don't prick me!

139
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,540
I'll be careful.

140
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,570
Lift your hand.

141
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,590
Why did you want me to come here?

142
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,700
Senior, why are you here?

143
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,920
That's great. You're finally here. For a while, be Xia Miaomiao's model instead of me, okay?

144
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,190
I have an appointment with someone.

145
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,950
What model?

146
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,900
You just stand here. I'm going first.

147
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,160
What do you need me to do?

148
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,210
I wanted to make a 3D cutting with this.

149
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,710
Well... What can I do for you?

150
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:30,290
Just stand here. Put your arms out.

151
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,290
So, I'm coming now.

152
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,740
What do you mean you are coming now?

153
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,840
Xia Miaomiao, I seriously doubt that you are—

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:38,280
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

162
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,190
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

163
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,280
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

164
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,800
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

165
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,260
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

166
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,190
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

167
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,200
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

168
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,710
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

169
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:10,320
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

170
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,880
Is it okay now?

171
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,100
Just a minute.

172
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,190
♫ If this is love ♫

173
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,730
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

174
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,800
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

175
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,740
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

176
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,320
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

177
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,800
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

178
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,670
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

179
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:58,200
Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

180
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,230
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

181
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,190
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

182
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,760
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

183
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,290
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

184
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,170
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

185
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,200
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

186
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,490
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

187
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,430
- Wage?
- What wage?

188
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,160
The wage to be Miaomiao's model.

189
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,060
¥10 per hour. ¥5 each.

190
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,570
You should have collected at least ¥50 ($7.00 USD) from her today. Give me my ¥25 ($3.50 USD).

191
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,850
No wages.

192
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,580
Didn't she give it to you?

193
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,390
Pay me some as agency fees then.

194
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,210
If you don't leave now, I'll lock the door.

195
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,430
This is the fourth floor. Let's see how you jump down from here.

196
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,390
Hey, hey, hey!

197
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,620
I knew it, you must've embezzled my money!

198
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,290
All right, I'll go myself tomorrow.

199
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,840
I'll tell you what, Liang Younian.

200
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,020
I won't introduce any job to you again!

201
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,060
Wait.

202
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,290
What's up?

203
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,250
She's already done with measurements today.

204
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,060
If you go tomorrow, she would have to measure it all over again.

205
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,680
Our figures are about the same.

206
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,620
She'll only need to make some minor alternations.

207
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,630
Let me go tomorrow. Don't trouble her.

208
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,020
Besides, our figure is not that similar.

209
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,210
You're still going tomorrow, huh?

210
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,720
Yes.

211
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,630
Do you...

212
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,030
You want to keep my salary all to yourself, right!

213
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,000
Wang Haiyang, help me!

214
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,180
He wants to keep my salary!

215
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,820
Go away! Don't disturb me!

216
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,910
Hello, Xiaoyue.

217
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,850
Younian.

218
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,490
The school informed us that the 17th University Joint Games will be held during the next semester.

219
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,260
They wanted us to draw cultural walls.

220
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,230
I know.

221
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,860
Brother Nian, I want to join the activity of Fine Arts Club, too.

222
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,790
Sure, bring all the notes and key points from freshman year.

223
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,960
Why?

224
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,780
I like helping people.

225
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,920
Hurry up and leave.

226
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,400
Okay.

227
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,410
Give it a try, Senior.

228
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,170
I'll alter it, if it doesn't fit.

229
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,580
How can you be so handsome?

230
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,600
I feel like crying.

231
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,460
Is there anything else that you will need to alter?

232
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,050
Perfect!

233
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,980
Only a few parts need to be altered.

234
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,700
Well, I talked to Senior Da Chao about the wages.

235
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,050
Who should I give the money to? You or him?

236
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,990
He was joking.

237
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,400
What? But it didn't look like he was joking.

238
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,440
The final assignment is all done. You should get ready for the exam.

239
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,080
Good luck! I'm going now.

240
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,870
Okay.

241
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,130
By Liang Younian and Xia Miaomiao

242
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,570
I am here.

243
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,660
You're not in the Fine Arts Club. Why are you here?

244
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,220
Xia Miaomiao is going to transfer and is preparing for the exam.

245
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,490
Your president was afraid you'd be understaffed,

246
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,670
so he cried and begged me to come and help.

247
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,190
Really?

248
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,070
It's true.

249
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,660
Younian, according to your instructions, all my notes and textbooks from my first year in the fashion design major

250
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,940
have been delivered to Xia Miaomiao who's in the library.

251
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,760
But our mutual benefits,

252
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,250
don't forget, all right?

253
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,260
Am I not cooperating with you now?

254
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,500
See this? Work a little more.

255
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,630
Where did you get so many movie tickets?

256
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,900
I got a staff discount, so I bought a lot.

257
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,180
Even if my date doesn't come through, I can still earn some money off of it.

258
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,760
Aren't we brothers? Why don't you support me a little?

259
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,900
Let me tell you, Hu Fangxu and Wang Haiyang bought one each.

260
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,990
Li Ran bought two. Xia Miaomiao bought four. Even Lin Kaituo...

261
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,130
I can't watch 3D.

262
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,220
Oh, I forgot you faint when watching 3D.

263
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,170
Go and give me and Xiaoyue some space. You hear me?

264
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,690
Understood.

265
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,290
Go, go.

266
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,700
Xiaoyue, let me help you.

267
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,790
- No need.
- This one, right?

268
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,400
Where have you been the past two days?

269
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,000
Making clothes.

270
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,200
What clothes?

271
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
Are you really changing majors?

272
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,900
Yes.

273
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,300
Can you really finish reading all of those books?

274
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,800
If you finish reading all of them,

275
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,200
will you be able to understand it?

276
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Have you studied for Architectural Mechanics?

277
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,800
I heard Teacher Cheng loves to have math questions on the exams.

278
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Aren't you most afraid of the math questions?

279
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,310
Xia Miaomiao are you deaf?!

280
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,600
Can't you be quiet and stop bothering me.

281
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,800
Let me study, okay?

282
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,900
It's time to eat right now. Let's go together.

283
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,000
I'll treat you to a big meal, okay?

284
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,700
I am not coming.

285
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,400
It's fine to study but you also need to eat.

286
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
How can you study if you don't eat well?

287
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,200
How can you study if you don't eat well?

288
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Xinxin will bring me bread later.

289
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,200
Don't say that I don't take care of you.

290
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,800
Since you're studying so hard, I will take you to the movies to de-stress.

291
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,800
You can pick the time.

292
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,600
I can treat you to the movies four times.

293
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,000
Xia Miaomiao.

294
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,000
Lin Kaituo, how have I offended you with my changing major?

295
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,200
Is it because there'll be no one else to save seats for you?

296
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,400
Or is it because there'll be no one else to take notes for you?

297
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,500
Or is it because there'll be no one else do the homework that you think is a waste of your time?

298
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,200
Do what you want!

299
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,700
He's crazy.

300
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,200
Kaituo, why are you here?

301
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,400
I am going to eat.

302
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,390
Me too, let's go together.

303
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,200
Treat me to a meal today.

304
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,300
It's already the end of the semester, but Senior Da Chao is still trying to make me buy movie tickets.

305
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,400
Thankfully, I'm attentive.

306
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,200
But I really don't have money left.

307
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,800
Aren't you going to bring bread to that stone-like Xia Miaomiao?

308
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,400
How did you know?

309
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,700
I guessed.

310
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,600
You guessed right. Stingy.

311
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,200
It's fine if you don't want to treat me, I'm going.

312
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,400
He Xin.

313
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,600
Help me convince that idiot not to change majors.

314
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,000
If you want to convince her, do it yourself.

315
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Your bread is here.

316
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,800
Thank you, you're the prettiest and kindest girl in the world.

317
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,300
I am dying of hunger.

318
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,800
You can't eat in the library,

319
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,000
Eat it outside. I'll look after the things for you.

320
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,800
Wow, Dachao tricked you into buying this many tickets?

321
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,800
There's two that belong to Lin Kaituo. Help me give it back to him later.

322
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,600
I'm going then.

323
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,200
Come back quick. I have to go to an interview later this afternoon.

324
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,000
I'll be quick.

325
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,000
Wang Yichao, what are you doing?

326
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,800
Weren't you drawing air parachute?

327
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,400
Does your local sports event have an air parachute event?

328
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,800
Then what were you drawing here?

329
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,900
The hands are like this. Isn't it a parachute?

330
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,400
I am drawing someone who's weight lifting.

331
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,600
How did you see it as parachuting?

332
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Who would parachute like that?

333
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,400
As you go down on the parachute, you legs will bend like that if you're scared.

334
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,030
Erase it.

335
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,800
No need to be angry, I'll erase it now.

336
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Why don't I help you draw the weights?

337
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
No need.

338
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,600
Go away and stop bothering me.

339
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,100
Alphabet, geometric and object silhouettes.

340
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,700
Letter shapes include A, T...

341
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Letter models... letter shapes include...

342
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,600
A, T and H forms.

343
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,600
Liang Younian doesn't really take pictures of people. He takes pictures of boring buildings instead.

344
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,400
How can they be more important than my photos.

345
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,900
There seems to be another one.

346
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,400
What are you taking pictures of?

347
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,800
Just random things.

348
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Fang Xiaoyue said my painting was terrible.

349
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,800
Can you help me ask her out for dinner with us?

350
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Please, Brother Nian.

351
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,000
Fang Xiaoyue, let's go eat something first.

352
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,400
Okay.

353
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,270
I'll go save seats first then.

354
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,600
There's a really popular 3D movie that's showing. Have you seen it yet?

355
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
I get really dizzy watching 3D movies.

356
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,800
Wang Yichao, slow down.

357
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,560
Xia Miaomiao.

358
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,400
Senior.

359
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,200
Why did you borrow so many books? Were Dachao's notes not helpful?

360
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,300
Senior Dachao also gave me a book list.

361
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,030
How did you know Senior Dachao lent me his notes?

362
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Oh, he told me.

363
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,200
Even though Senior Dachao looks unreliable,

364
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,600
he really moved me this time.

365
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,800
He got me these many books early in the morning,

366
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,600
and when I thought he wanted to sell them to me at a high price,

367
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,000
he didn't even mention money to me.

368
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I guess I misunderstood him before.

369
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,500
He's actually a good person.

370
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,300
It's nothing. Then, you study well.

371
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,100
Senior, you came to the library, but are you leaving without reading any books?

372
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,800
Oh, something urgent just came up.

373
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,700
I'm going then.

374
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,400
Here are some very effective refreshing patches.

375
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Thank you, Senior.

376
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,600
That Liang Younian, he was the one who suggested eating and then ran off to do something else. Let's eat first.

377
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,150
No appetite?

378
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,410
I'll sponsor you with my appetite.

379
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,000
You can have it all.

380
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,200
Thank you.

381
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,200
Xiaoyque.

382
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,400
Want to go watch a movie together?

383
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,200
Where did you get so many movie tickets?

384
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,600
My friend gave them to me for free.

385
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,800
I couldn't give it out because there's so many.

386
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,200
Do you want to help me out and use two? I will sell the rest.

387
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,800
How's that?

388
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,600
You, don't touch my things later.

389
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,600
I won't touch it even if you tell me to.

390
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,800
Lin Xiao.

391
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,400
Lin Kaituo.

392
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,000
Is he the Lin Kaituo that He Xin is always talking about?

393
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,400
I need you for something.

394
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,200
Say it.

395
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,600
What do you mean?

396
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,000
You want to bribe me with movie tickets to help you convince Xia Miaomiao not to change majors?

397
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,440
I will not accept it.

398
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,200
Right now, she's doing just fine in architecture major. There's no need for her to change majors at all.

399
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,000
It's not like she wants to change majors because she's not doing well in architecture.

400
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,400
What's the reason then?

401
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,600
Because she likes fashion design.

402
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,300
Did you think she wanted to change it because she couldn't tolerate your bullying?

403
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,190
When did I ever bully her?

404
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,500
Moreover, it would be childish of her if that was her reason to change majors.

405
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,090
Who can win against you for being childish.

406
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:08,400
Sometimes, you're bullying Miaomiao. At other times, you're bullying He Xin.

407
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,800
You're worst than a street bully.

408
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,400
I've disliked you for a long time.

409
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,600
So don't think too highly of yourself.

410
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,300
Miaomiao's reason to change majors has never be because of you.

411
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,600
Even if that's the reason, it would be for Liang Younian.

412
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,440
What shabby thing are you making?

413
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,600
K.O. (Knock Out)

414
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,600
So weak and yet he dares to swagger around all day?

415
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,000
He's really spoilt!

416
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,200
Where are my sleeves?

417
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,700
I had just finished pinning it.

418
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,400
He Xin, you're alone? Where's Miaomiao and Ah Xia?

419
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,800
They're both studying in the library.

420
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,600
My roomate is working on vocal techniques. It's too loud so I came over here.

421
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,800
You're going to the movies later?

422
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,100
The tickets aren't mine.

423
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,000
Senior, do you have time later?

424
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,300
Yes, I'm free. What's up?

425
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,600
Let's go watch movies.

426
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,100
My gosh.

427
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:44,000
This movie is so good that I want to watch it again.

428
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,800
It's just that 3D makes me a little dizzy.

429
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,800
If it makes you dizzy, then you better not watch it, let alone watching it a second time.

430
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,500
My dizziness is considered light.

431
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,600
Liang Younian is much worse than me.

432
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Liang Younian really gets dizzy from watching 3D?

433
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,800
Isn't it embarrassing?

434
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,200
I remember there was that time when we were young where Liang Younian

435
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,200
threw up after watching a 3D movie. We made fun of him for an entire year.

436
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,100
After that, he never watched another 3D movie again.

437
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,200
I thought he only made up that excuse to reject me.

438
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,700
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

- Let's watch it again.
- Go go.

00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,000
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

477
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,600
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

478
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

479
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,600
The last exam is finally over. How do you think you did?

480
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,200
I think I did especially well.

481
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,200
I feel a sense of liberation.

482
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,100
Then I think we should celebrate, or else it might become ominous.

483
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,400
You might end up failing.

484
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,000
Screw you!

485
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
How should we celebrate?

486
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,800
Let's get Xinxin and watch a movie together.

487
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,000
Xinxin already watched that movie with Senior Sister.

488
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And I don't really want to watch animations, either.

489
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,200
Then, what do I do with these tickets? It'll be such a waste to throw them away.

490
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,400
Xia Miaomiao!

491
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,600
You and Hexin are really infuriating me.

492
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,200
What's wrong?

493
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,400
I don't want to be your love coach anymore.

494
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,000
But has it ever occurred to you to invite Senior Liang Younian to watch the movie with you?

495
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,400
- Oh, right.
- Oh, right.

496
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
You guys are really frustrating.

497
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,000
One is watching with her Senior Sister and the other is going to throw away the tickets.

498
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,200
What are you guys thinking?

499
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,200
I'm thinking about treating you to a big meal.

500
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm not going. I'm on a diet.

501
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,800
Really?

502
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,200
I'll consider it.

503
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,700
I knew it!

504
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
What do you want to eat?

505
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,400
- I want to drink bubble tea.
- No problem.

506
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
- Chicken with potatoes.
- No problem!

507
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,200
- Korean cuisine.
- Korean cuisine!

508
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,800
- Pizza!
- Okay!

509
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,600
A Little Thing Called First Love

510
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:12,290
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

511
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,000
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

512
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,600
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

516
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:55,900
♫ I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

517
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,600
♫ Regarding what love feels like ♫

518
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,600
♫ I've only heard about it from friends ♫

519
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:12,000
♫ I never thought about when it would be my turn ♫

520
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
♫ You are so dazzling and outstanding ♫

521
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,200
♫ I'm just a faint breeze blowing ♫

522
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:24,000
♫ But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

523
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

524
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,800
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

525
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:36,400
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫
