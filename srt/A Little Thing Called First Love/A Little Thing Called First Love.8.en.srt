A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,620
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,170
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,070
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,150
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,660
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,060
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,010
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,600
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,620
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,640
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,190
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,660
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,620
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,500
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,710
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,590
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,150
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,070
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:44,040
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,650
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,120

Episode 8

27
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,100
Haicheng University   (University of Hai)

28
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,130
There's only one copy of this book left.

29
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,020
I want to borrow it. Can you let me have it?

30
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,200
Thank you for letting me have this book.

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,490
Why don't I treat you to a meal?

32
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,280
No need.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,960
I already ate a lot of crackers in class.

34
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,380
Then... when I return the book to you after I finish reading it, I can treat you then.

35
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,550
No, it's okay. I've already read this book many times.

36
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,500
Furthermore, I'm planning on buying this book.

37
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,670
All right then. Thanks.

38
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,410
You're welcome.

39
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,020
I refuse to believe there's only one copy.

40
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,500
Liang Younian, are you here to borrow books?

41
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,080
Yes.

42
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,190
I found mine, I'll leave first.

43
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,680
Okay.

44
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,860
Bye-bye.

45
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,450
Mom, there's another order.

46
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,690
Have you finished making the previous batch of orders?

47
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,500
I won't be able to deliver it in time if you don't hurry up.

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,380
The take-out platform will charge us if we're late with the orders.

49
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,380
Stop rushing me. Okay, okay, I'm coming.

50
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,490
Have you checked all the addresses?

51
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,710
Do you know how to do the delivery?

52
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,070
I have a vague idea of how.

53
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,370
I can ask one at a time once I am there.

54
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,660
Why do we have to do it ourselves when all the other stores use the delivery service provided by the platform?

55
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,720
Do you think it's free to have other people do the deliveries?

56
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,270
You know nothing about meticulous planning and careful accounting.

57
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,150
If you can't find the address once you're there, just ask around. Okay?

58
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,530
It's free if I do it and I do it every time. Look at how tan I am now!

59
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,100
If you don't want to, I'll go.

60
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,110
Or Santu (Xia Yaoyao) could do it, too.

61
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,860
I am leaving.

62
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,890
Be quick, okay?

63
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,930
I got it.

64
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,000
Seventeen...

65
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,880
Where's Building 18?

66
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,910
Hey, Mister. Mister!

67
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,490
Uncle may I ask—

68
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,760
Who are you calling uncle?

69
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,960
Why are you here?

70
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,470
S-Sorry... I didn't see clearly.

71
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,870
You also do deliveries?

72
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,820
What? Am I not allowed to?

73
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,700
No, no, that's not it. We're in the same trade. I also make deliveries.

74
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,630
We're in the same field.

75
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,130
Which platform are you doing deliveries for?

76
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,650
My mom's own store. We produce and deliver ourselves.

77
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,100
Then continue. I, an uncle, need to move on to the next delivery.

78
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,250
Wait wait.

79
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,060
Do you know where Building 18 is at?

80
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,270
I've looked for it for ages and I still can't find it.

81
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,060
Building 18 is on the other side. You can follow me.

82
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,230
Wait for me! Wait!

83
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,470
Wait for me!

84
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,350
Winona Guoguo Food Delivery

85
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,320
Weren't you going way too fast?

86
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,060
You're just too slow.

87
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,990
See? Building 18.

88
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,150
Building 18

89
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,930
Thanks.

90
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,360
You need to say, "Thank you, Uncle".

91
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,960
I got it.

92
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,950
I will deliver that right away.

93
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,720
Why are you still here?

94
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,330
Lower your voice.

95
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,260
What happened?

96
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,620
Nothing, go away.

97
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,430
Who are you talking to? Stop dawdling.

98
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,790
Okay, I got it, I got it.

99
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,860
Auntie.

100
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,700
Hey, Miaomiao. What are you doing here?

101
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,010
I'm helping my mom make deliveries.

102
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,650
It's such a hot day and you're making deliveries. It must be hard work, isn't it?

103
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,250
It's okay, it's not hard.

104
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,560
Seeing you working like this makes my heart hurt a little bit.

105
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,500
What are you doing here?
(Formal Voice)

106
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,050
Oh, do you know where Building 17 is?

107
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,370
I've been looking for it all day.

108
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,040
Your Teacher Liang has a student that signed up to take his art class but has never shown up.

109
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,670
I wanted to come to see if he's sick or if something has happened.

110
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,610
Oh, I know. Building 17 is right over there. It took me a while to find it, also.

111
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,770
Why don't I take you there?

112
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,740
Okay.

113
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,610
- Do you need help?
- I'm fine. I got it. Okay, let's go. That way.

114
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,860
How are you doing in your classes lately?

115
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,320
I'm doing okay. The semester is about to start.

116
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,160
Okay, feel free to come to our house if there's anything you need help with.

117
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,530
Let's go.

118
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,940
Why did you come back?

119
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,070
I won't be able to make it to my last order on time. Can you take me there on your electric scooter?

120
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,820
Do it yourself. I don't have time.

121
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,650
Can you lend me your scooter then?

122
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,890
You know how to drive it?

123
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes, my dad taught me in the past.

124
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,590
Furthermore, there's not a single person out on the street right now.

125
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,550
I can just practice driving around a couple of times.

126
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,510
There's no one?

127
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,390
No one.

128
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,820
Come on quick.

129
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,720
I can't wait to show off my driving skills.

130
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,680
Can you go slower than this?

131
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,970
Don't talk to me,

132
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,520
I am driving. It's too dangerous.

133
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,790
No worries. At this speed of yours,

134
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,320
what you need to worry about isn't danger but your feet.

135
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,210
Sit tight. My orders are always delivered on time.

136
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,680
Lin Kaituo!

137
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,840
I don't want to die yet, I still haven't gone to college!

138
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,740
I don't mind paying the late fee, go slower!

139
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,570
All right, don't get too excited.

140
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,160
Lin Kaituo!

141
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,620
Fine, fine, fine.

142
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,730
Sit tight, and let's go!

143
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,900
Okay... Okay, I like this speed. Keep it like this.

144
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,970
That's pretty good.

145
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Here, your delivery fee.

146
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,640
This is it for my delivery fee?

147
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,180
Then I'll give you both.

148
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,380
Then I'll get going.

149
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,390
I still need to get my bicycle.

150
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:59,300
- Thanks... for today.
- What?

151
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,320
Just, thanks for today.

152
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,790
Hurry and disappear.

153
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,860
Thank you for helping me avoid embarrassment today, so my mom didn't have to see me making deliveries.

154
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,560
- Quickly come in.
- I'll take that.

155
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,710
You can't fit anything else in.

156
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,310
Why are we preparing Kaituo's luggage already?

157
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,950
I start packing early. Just in case something is forgotten, there's still time to look for it.

158
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:04,390
The school is very close. If he leaves anything behind, he can always come back and get it.

159
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,630
It's not like you don't know what kind of child Xiao Tuo is.

160
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,630
Once he leaves, we won't know when he'll even be willing to come back.

161
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:16,370
He's a boy. He'll get better as he matures.

162
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,760
Oh, this is the rent he will pay for two years.

163
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,000
Where do you want to keep it?

164
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,310
- You can put it in that drawer.
- Okay.

165
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,580
Okay. Judging from his personality, he won't come to pick it up even if we put it there.

166
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,230
He has never asked for money.

167
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,070
It's good even if he doesn't get it, he can use it if there's an emergency.

168
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,920
I saw Xia Miaomiao making deliveries today.

169
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,670
I wondered... if Xiao Tuo was also working this hard every day?

170
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,050
I wondered... if Xiao Tuo was also working this hard every day?

171
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,120
Don't worry too much, he's a man.

172
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,690
It's good for him to go through some hardship.

173
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,920
Younian also said he wouldn't come back home for the summer.

174
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,810
He said he wanted to go explore the mountains and collect local cultural materials or something.

175
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,240
Of course, I supported him.

176
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,600
Even if you say it, it's still hard not to worry.

177
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:26,440
Wife, if you want to overthink why don't we think about what we're going to have for dinner tonight. Okay?

178
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,980
You only know to eat. Help me tidy things up.

179
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,460
Once you're done with that, I'll make dinner for you.

180
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,570
All right! As you wish!

181
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,170
- Put the coat there.
- Okay.

182
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,720
Money for rent

183
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:16,440
I feel like if it's okay, you can come to the Business Center to fill out the form.

184
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,790
Student, are you sure you want to apply for the Architecture Major?
[Fashion Majors]

185
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,330
In that case, you can follow us.
[Fashion Major]

186
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,780
What should I pick?
[Fashion Majors]

187
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,160
Fashion Majors

188
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,960
It's huge here.

189
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,500
This is my first time coming to Haicheng University.

190
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,710
Look how tall that building is.

191
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,480
There are pamphlets for new students over there. Let's take a look.

192
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:02,350
It's nice being a college student. Look how fashionable they are dressed.

193
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,990
Hello, thank you.

194
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,260
My Journalism Major is over there. Let's go look.

195
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,640
- Architecture Majors

196
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,980
This...

197
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:30,620
Student, I want to know what is the employment rate for the architecture students?

198
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,210
Our architecture students usually get recruited even before they graduate.

199
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,710
Our employment rate is 99.9%.

200
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,360
That's good, that's good. I'll have a look at these.

201
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,940
Of course, please.

202
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,280
Civil Engineering Major

203
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,210
Ah Xia, I've arrived at Haicheng University. Where are you?

204
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,520
Miaomiao, I'm touring the Fashion Department's building.

205
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,280
Do you want to meet me there?

206
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,300
Okay, I'll go look for you in a little bit.
[Journalism Major]

207
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,370
Stop chatting, your Architecture Major is over there.

208
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,460
Let's go take a look.

209
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,500
Okay.

210
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,340
Kaituo!

211
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,630
Your Architecture Major. Let's go.

212
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,520
Ar-Architecture Major.

213
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,400
I've got a cold.

214
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,600
Senior isn't here...

215
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,820
- Hello.
- Hi. Welcome to the Architecture Major booth.

216
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,900
I want to ask if you know Liang Younian?

217
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,030
Liang Younian?

218
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,020
Yes, we know him. Are you looking for him?

219
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,780
I am his cousin and I also got admitted into Haicheng University.

220
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,960
We wanted to ask him to give us a tour around campus.

221
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,600
He's currently busy with his group assignment, but he should be in the model room.

222
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,730
If you walk that way and turn right, you'll see the Architecture Building and the model room is on the top floor.

223
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,350
Thank you, Senior.

224
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,380
- Thank you.
- No problem.

225
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,200
Then... you're going to the Architecture Building, aren't you?

226
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,330
Yes, can you come with me?

227
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,450
Come with me.

228
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,830
Miaomiao.

229
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,060
That's fine, I can go by myself.

230
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,260
Go do your thing.

231
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,550
Give me a hug. Miaomiao is the best.

232
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,680
I'll be going now. Bye-bye.

233
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:07,960
Welcome to our classroom

234
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,940
I knew you would be here.

235
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,600
Why did you come here?

236
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,660
The group project.

237
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,340
Team leader, are you going to leave your members behind and just complete the project by yourself?

238
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,160
But didn't you already finish your portion?

239
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,420
This isn't my first time as a member of your team.

240
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,400
I know you calculate everything many times.

241
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
I might not be as good as you in drawing,

242
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,440
but as far as math, I did participate in International Mathematical Olympiad, after all.

243
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,920
All right then. You can calculate everyone else's numbers again.

244
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,790
- Then, you can verify them for me.
- Okay.

245
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,080
Department of Architecture

246
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,830
What is this?

247
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,760
This is for our almighty team leader.

248
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,410
Thank you.

249
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,530
I saw you use it last time and it seemed pretty effective, so I also bought a box for myself.

250
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,720
This method is really quite amazing.

251
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,070
It's worth promoting it to the entire Architecture Department.

252
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,720
Miaomiao?

253
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,920
- Ah Xia?
- Yeah.

254
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,980
Ah Xia!

255
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,890
What's wrong? You missed me that much?

256
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,080
You didn't even pick up my call.

257
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,420
It's not that.

258
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,330
Don't cry, don't cry.

259
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,550
What's wrong? Tell me, Sis is here.

260
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,690
- It's just...
- What?

261
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,820
- That...
- Yes, what?

262
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,620
Ah Xia.

263
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,680
Miaomiao?

264
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,520
What's wrong?

265
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,720
You... are Ah Xia?

266
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,090
You are... He Xin?

267
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,500
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

268
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,500
- I've heard about you.
- I've heard a lot about you.

269
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,210
Miaomiao, what is wrong?

270
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,660
Didn't you go looking for Lin Kaituo?

271
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,460
He left too quickly, I couldn't catch up.

272
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,910
Besides, do you need to be moved to tears after seeing an old friend?

273
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,230
Of course, there is a need!

274
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,400
What should I do?

275
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,930
I asked around a few days ago.

276
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,600
Liang Younian doesn't have a girlfriend.

277
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,910
Really?

278
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,050
Yes, really.

279
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,150
Liang Younian is nice and polite to everyone.

280
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,670
Don't read too much into it, okay?

281
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,770
Even if you don't read too much into it,

282
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,530
those two seem to be surrounded by pink bubbles when they stand together.

283
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:29,190
Miaomiao going over there looks like someone asking for directions.

284
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,100
I just seem like a passerby.

285
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,700
I have to ask, is she your friend?

286
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:49,170
Ah Xia, can you not speak to Miaomiao that way?

287
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,420
What do you know? I am doing this for her own good.

288
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,590
Miaomiao must change.

289
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:59,730
I hope she becomes beautiful and someone who can catch everyone's attention.

290
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,080
That's right.

291
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,920
Isn't it?

292
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,830
Xia Miaomiaoooooo!

293
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,140
Why are you two always together?

294
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,150
Ah Xia, you're living at my house every day, yet I can't even catch a glimpse of your shadow.

295
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,420
After so many days of researching and investigating,

296
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,660
it's time we present our findings to you.

297
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,240
This summer, we are going to make you...

298
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,940
Shed your mortal body and exchange your bones!
(Idiom: to change inside and out))

299
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,700
- What?
- Let's go!

300
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,650
Ah Xia, I'm hot.

301
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,900
If it's hot, then we're on the right track.

302
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,230
That's how we can get rid of all the toxins in your body.

303
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,760
Can you feed me something? I'm about to faint.
(from heat exhaustion)

304
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,520
Stay.

305
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,060
Are you sure?

306
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,280
I am sure.

307
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,680
This is so long!

308
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,520
Chubbiness ruins everything! That's why you need to be slim!

309
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,190
What? You think because I'm fat I don't know anything?

310
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,750
I just have a healthy appetite.

311
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,580
What are you standing there for? Get on!

312
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,360
Faster.

313
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,150
Ah Xia, you should diet!

314
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,690
You should hurry up and pedal.

315
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,350
You can do it!

316
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,100
Give me your hand.

317
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,290
What is all of this?

318
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,860
What is the ideal hairstyle for a goddess?

319
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,940
Black, long, straight.

320
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,520
What is the ideal skin color of a goddess?

321
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,510
White, pure, clear.

322
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,220
You can do hair, I will do her face.

323
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,930
Begin.

324
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,230
W-Wait. A-Are you two sure?

325
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,510
Stop talking!

326
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,290
Sister, I'm back! Your admissions letter!

327
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,910
Where is my sister?

328
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,260
Did I get accepted by the Fashion Department at Haicheng University?

329
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,290
Demon!

330
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,570
I got in!

331
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,370
- Ah Xia, we can head out.
- Let's go.

332
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,970
Where is your luggage?

333
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,960
Just this. My mom is sending the rest.

334
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,050
Why is your mom so great.

335
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:10,130
She will agree to everything you want to do.

336
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,110
Are you still mad that your mom changed your major?

337
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,210
I didn't have a single happy thing happen this summer.

338
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,630
My face had an allergic reaction.

339
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,400
Even my hair got messed up by you two.

340
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,580
Most importantly, I can't study for the major I wanted.

341
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,700
I think architecture is pretty great.

342
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,750
You are in the same department as Liang Younian.

343
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,430
Right, you'll benefit from being the pavilion closest to the water, enjoying the moonlight first. (Closest to an influential person)

344
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,490
Thank you.

345
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,540
Bus money.

346
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,790
But I've had this allergic reaction on my face for half a month and it's still not any better.

347
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,090
I don't want to see Senior looking like this.

348
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,610
Don't worry. The 2nd year students are teaching assistants this year.

349
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,030
They'll be in military training with us.

350
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,080
Liang Younian is one of the assistants.
(Military training is sometimes a compulsory collegiate course)

351
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,190
By that time, Liang Younian will also be super tan and dark.

352
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,530
So one person won't frown on the other person.

353
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,820
No wonder you're in the Journalism Department.

354
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,930
You really do know everything.

355
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,070
Miaomiao, this is a soothing cream that my mom gave me.

356
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,530
It's pretty good. Give it a try.

357
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,170
Yes, okay. Let's go.

358
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:14,480
Wait! Wait, wait.

359
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,820
I just washed and cut them. Eat up.

360
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,830
Thanks, Aunt!

361
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,410
Who is "Aunt"?

362
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,400
- Thanks, Sister!
- Good.

363
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,140
Are you trying to cause a heat rash?

364
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,360
What are you doing? Are you still mad at me?

365
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,360
No.

366
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,370
I did it for your own good.

367
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,710
That is Haicheng University's best department.

368
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,660
I've already asked around.

369
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:46,010
Those students pretty much get recruited by various real estate companies before they even graduate.

370
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:50,190
This means that as soon as you start your studies, you'll already be employed. You know?

371
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,870
I know. I'm heading out.

372
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:57,320
- Be happy, okay? Good girl. Be safe.
- Okay.

373
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,010
- Let's go.
- Thanks, Aunt—

374
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,680
Bye, Sister.

375
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,310
Go on. When you come home for break, Sister will make you lots of yummy food.

376
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,230
- Bye!
- Okay. Bye-bye.

377
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,540
- Bye.
- Go on. Bye-bye.

378
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,920
What are you doing?

379
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,470
Can't you bear to part with your older sister?

380
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,630
She'll be back during break.

381
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,970
I wouldn't miss her.

382
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,550
I can have my own room since she's gone.

383
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,060
This way, you are similar to me the most.

384
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,000
You're like a duck.

385
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,180
Stubborn.

386
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,280
Look at your little attitude.

387
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,050
Power to the Military - Honor to the soldier's spirit

388
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,090
Get off the bus.

389
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,580
Gather over here.

390
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,540
Five people in a row.

391
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,640
Let's gather up.

392
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,230
Hurry, hurry. Five in a row.

393
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,810
Faster.

394
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,410
Come everyone, gather up.

395
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,040
Look around and see if everyone is here.

396
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,490
Come forward, come forward.

397
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,000
Get over here.

398
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,910
First of all, welcome Haicheng Unversity students to our training ground.

399
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,350
My last name is Xu. I am the Head Instructor for your military training.

400
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,150
I'm usually a very easy going person,

401
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:16,180
but during training, I am extremely strict.

402
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,200
I hope in our remaining time together, we can all cooperate and excel.

403
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,080
Your university has arranged temporary accommodations for all of you at the training grounds.

404
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,080
Next, you guys have thirty minutes to

405
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,150
find your dorm, put down your luggage, and change into your military uniforms.

406
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,450
In thirty minutes, we will all regather here at the training ground.

407
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,670
You will form groups based on your majors.

408
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,560
One leader per group.

409
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,330
The school has already given us a list of names. I'll read them out.

410
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,630
Those who are called, please stand out for students to recognize you.

411
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,540
Fashion major, Liang Jianquan.

412
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,170
Here!

413
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:50,350
- Journalism major, Liu Dacheng.
- Here!

414
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,650
- Architecture major, Liang Younian.
- Here!

415
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,350
You will be in charge of the groups when we gather later.

416
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,090
Yes!

417
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,160
Turn left!

418
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,410
At ease.

419
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,700
Stand still!

420
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,130
Turn left!

421
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:13,160
Button it up properly.

422
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,720
Inspect appearance.

423
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,730
Turn to the right!

424
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,930
Xia Miaomiao?

425
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,320
Long time, no see.

426
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,760
Senior, long time, no see.

427
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,930
Did you catch a cold?

428
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,490
Uh... I...

429
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,650
Class Leaders, fall out!

430
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:50,010
Get ready.

431
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:53,360
Reporting to Instructor, the entire Architecture Major Squad has arrived.

432
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,720
Has their appearance been inspected?

433
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,980
Currently in the middle of inspection.

434
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,450
That girl over there with the broken glasses,

435
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,570
take off your mask.

436
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,690
No wonder she kept on wearing a mask,

437
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,420
why's her face like that?

438
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:22,840
Is it that funny? Have you seen yourself in the mirror?

439
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,420
Which person in the unit is speaking without permission? Fall out!

440
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,980
You, run ten laps.

441
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,560
- Instructor! I don't think I did anything wrong.
- Twenty laps!

442
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,040
- Instructor!
- Thirty!

443
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,690
Reporting to Instructor!

444
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,740
Please do not punish Lin Kaituo.

445
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,660
The person who is speaking, fall out.

446
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,390
Turn left.

447
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,120
Turn right.

448
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,660
A soldier's duty is to obey to commands.

449
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,020
The two of you continuously disregarded my commands!

450
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,820
You, thirty laps, starting immediately.

451
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,330
Don't drag Xia Miaomiao into this.

452
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,270
Yes!

453
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,630
You, fifty pushups.

454
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,530
Reporting to Instructor! I'm willing to do the punishment on Xia Miaomiao's behalf.

455
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,680
Then tell me why you should be the one to take the punishment?

456
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,960
Senior, you don't have to do this for me.

457
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,650
If the little brother acts improperly, it's the older brother's fault for not teaching him right. The main offender is Lin Kaituo.

458
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:36,310
Reporting to Instructor! Recently, it came to my attention Xia Miaomiao has contracted a cold,

459
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,320
I was worried she wouldn't be able to handle it.

460
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,120
Get ready.

461
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,520
Mind your distance.

462
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,580
You must be clean-shaven.

463
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,440
- Liang Younian!
- Present!

464
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,390
A hundred pushups!

465
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,990
Yes!

466
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,350
- Instructor...
- Go back!

467
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,690
Don't make me repeat myself.

468
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,360
- Wang Haiyang!
- Present!

469
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,940
Lead the group on a five kilometer run!

470
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:18,570
Yes! Entire formation fall in, face the rear!

471
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:19,940
Move out.

472
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,580
Left, right, left. Left, right, left.

473
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,250
Left, right, left. Left, right, left.

474
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,780
One, two, three, four!

475
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,750
One, two, three, four!

476
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,350
One two three four!

477
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,540
One, two, three, four!

478
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,090
Not bad.

479
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,430
After doing a hundred pushups, you're willing to do double for additional punishment.

480
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,570
I like playing with rebels like you.

481
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,090
Keep going.

482
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,420
Keep going.

483
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,620
You can't stop.

484
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,520
A sandbox can show you the geography of the battlefield.

485
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,010
It can tell you the makeup of the soldiers,

486
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,370
their formations, and their weapons.

487
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:47,600
For military use, we often use them for investigating battlefield geography,

488
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,500
the enemy data, strategizing, and the practice of any strategies.

489
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,850
You are all Architecture Majors,

490
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:59,310
so your final product must be better than the other groups.

491
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,330
Xia Miaomiao, where are your glasses?

492
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,210
They're shattered.

493
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,680
My prescription is too high so the clinic said I have to wait for new lenses.

494
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,540
So I'm wearing contact lenses now.

495
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,700
Are you sure the store doesn't just want you to spend more money on contact lenses?

496
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,180
My contact lenses are very cheap.

497
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,940
Are you stupid? Aren't you afraid of sand getting into your eyes?

498
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,230
- I'll do the digging.
- It's okay.

499
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,040
- I'll do it.
- I can do it.

500
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,360
Lin Kaituo! Xia Miaomiao!

501
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,960
Present!

502
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,380
Is piling the sandbox too easy for you guys?

503
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,320
You keep on fooling around, not being serious at all!

504
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,580
This is military training!

505
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,700
It's all your fault.

506
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,740
Lin Kaituo!

507
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,240
Present!

508
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,510
What expression did you make toward Xia Miaomiao?

509
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:14,120
Reporting to Instructor, sweat dripped into my eye!

510
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,240
Why do you have so many excuses?

511
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,800
Do you think you're really good at this?

512
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,030
Reporting to Instructor, I'm not bad!

513
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,620
Why are you shaking if you're not bad?

514
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,450
No laughing!

515
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,030
Miaomiao! Look over here.

516
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,210
Don't take photos of me.

517
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,200
Don't move, you look really good right now.

518
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,420
Don't take photos of my face.

519
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,350
What are you doing?

520
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,170
Taking pictures.

521
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:11,570
I want to submit some military training photos to the school newspaper.

522
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,430
Where did you get the camera from?

523
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:17,120
I borrowed it from Liang Younian. All architect majors have cameras.

524
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,710
You didn't know?

525
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,990
Pardon?

526
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:26,350
I didn't know. Then I still need to ask my mom for money.

527
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:31,670
She already scolded me on the phone for changing my glasses.

528
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:44,660
I also want to take a look at what photos are in Senior's camera.

529
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,920
Why did you take so many of Lin Kaituo?

530
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,150
He's good looking.

531
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:06,490
Hey, what's so meaningful about taking solo shots of him? You should take photos with him together.

532
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,740
That way, you can show off your status.

533
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,570
My status doesn't need to be proven through photos together.

534
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,270
Hi!

535
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,330
Senior.

536
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,850
Hey, Xia Miaomiao. Aren't I a senior, too?

537
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,130
Shush.

538
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,430
Is your cold better?

539
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,430
Senior, I actually don't have a cold.

540
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:45,560
It's just that my face has allergies.

541
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,020
I didn't explain it clearly to you earlier.

542
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,920
It's okay.

543
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:04,860
Your allergies are much better now.

544
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,190
You're not wearing your glasses, either?

545
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,650
Yeah.

546
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,080
May I sit here?

547
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:36,600
