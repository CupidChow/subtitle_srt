00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,400
A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,600
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,100
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,200
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,200
♫ I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,600
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,600
♫ I want to know what you're now up to ♫

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
♫ You're all that I can see ♫

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
♫ You're in my heart every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,200
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,600
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of
a love like this ♫

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
♫ You're all that I can see ♫

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600
♫ You're in my heart every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,200
♫  I must control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,900
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,600
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,000
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
♫ Stretch out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,200
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,000
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,300
♫ Is the result of Heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,900
Episode 35

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,200
Ten Months Later

28
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,800
Have you reached a consensus with Frank yet?

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,000
Not yet.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,900
I argued with him all night yesterday just for him to allow me to come up with another design.

31
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,000
Then let's come up with a few more.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,200
There's no disadvantage from coming up with extra options.

33
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,600
You're already deep in participating in this project.

34
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,200
Take advantage of this, okay?

35
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
I understand.

36
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,000
Wu Fangxu, are you done painting the section view yet?

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's done.

38
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,580
- Are you heading to the airport now?
- Yes.

39
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,400
Good luck!

40
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,500
Let's take a look at this

41
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,910
Ground Transportation Center

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
I've arrived at the airport.

43
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
I've also arrived.

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,400
Wait a second for me.

45
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,800
How long do I have to wait for?

46
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll be there soon.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,500
Okay.

48
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,800
Where exactly are you?

49
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,800
How did you know I was coming back today?

50
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,200
- I...
- Hey, how come your phone suddenly went silent?

51
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,800
Is this how you pick people up from the airport?

52
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,200
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm Liang Younian.

54
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,300
It's okay.

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,800
- Hello? Miaomiao?
- Yes, Mom.

56
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,600
Then do I have to come out to pick you up or not?

57
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,000
It's okay, Mom. I'll just take a cab back.

58
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,500
Let me send you.

59
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,300
It's okay. I can take a cab.

60
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,400
Let's go together. Younian's friend is my friend, too.

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's go.

62
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,400
Wait for it to stop fully.

63
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,600
- Yaoyao!
- Sis!

64
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,800
- Mom!
- You're back!

65
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
- Did you miss me?
- I missed...

66
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,000
...my Barbie doll.

67
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You think about your doll but not me?

68
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
It's in my luggage.

69
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,600
I'll get it for you.

70
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,500
- My baby.
- Mom.

71
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,400
- I've missed you so much.
- I missed you, too.

72
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,200
Look at you, you're all grown up now.

73
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,000
Did he drive you here?

74
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,400
We ran into each other.

75
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,800
Thank you both so much. I remembered the wrong time to pick up Miaomiao.

76
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,400
Next time, I'll treat you guys to a meal.

77
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,800
It's okay, Auntie.

78
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,200
Okay, when?

79
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,900
When you guys have time.

80
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,180
I have time right now.

81
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,700
Let's go.

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Here, suggest something to our guest.

83
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,200
He insists on having a free meal when I'm so busy.

84
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,400
Do what you need to do.

85
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,800
This is yours.

86
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
This menu is so interesting.

87
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,000
Little friend, did you draw this?

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,400
How could it be? It's so ugly, it could only be drawn by my sister.

89
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,800
Here, take this for me, get to work.

90
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
I just got back and you're putting me to work?

91
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,000
What? Do you have to take a rest for forty-nine whole days?

92
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,100
Hurry up.

93
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,600
Sis! Is your luggage full of rocks? It's so heavy!

94
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
I'll help you.

95
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,800
Thank you, Brother.

96
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,700
You can leave it here.

97
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,600
Brother, help me open it.

98
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,000
If you open your sister's luggage, she'll get mad.

99
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,200
Aren't you her boyfriend?

100
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,500
How could she get mad?

101
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
How did you know?

102
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,100
My sister told me.

103
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,800
- I...
- Stop stalling, help me open it.

104
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,200
But if you open her luggage like this, she'll definitely get mad.

105
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,400
Then, if you help me open it,

106
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,600
I'll let you see a magical drawer.

107
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,400
Magical? How magical?

108
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,000
You'll know once you see it.

109
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,970
Drawing Sketch Book

110
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,200
My sister has a lot of drawings of you.

111
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,500
But they don't look like you at all.

112
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,510
Look at it.

113
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,900
After you're done, immediately come over and help me open the luggage.

114
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
The drawing's not bad.

115
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,000
It's just that He Xin's proportion is a little off.

116
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,600
H-He Xin?

117
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,200
Aren't you drawing He Xin watching Kaituo play basketball?

118
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,600
Yes! He Xin. Her proportion is off?

119
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,000
Who allowed you to look at my things?!

120
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Your sister, she—

121
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,200
Don't blame a good person! When did I tell you to look?

122
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,600
We already broke up! Please leave.

123
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,800
Hurry and go. You shouldn't look through other people's things.

124
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,200
Your sister has such a big temper?

125
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,500
You broke up with my sister?

126
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,250
But I still—

127
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,770
What are you doing?

128
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,000
Who told you to bully my sister.

129
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,800
Who is it?

130
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
It's me.

131
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,630
I have something that I want to tell you.

132
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,700
I...

133
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
I don't have time.

134
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,200
Haicheng University

135
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,600
Let go of me.

136
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,400
Why do I have to let go?

137
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,600
I was here first.

138
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,000
Is there any evidence that can prove that you were here first?

139
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,930
Senior, you saw that I came first, didn't you?

140
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,200
There are still so many empty seats. You don't have to fight like that.

141
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,910
It's not me who is fighting.

142
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,000
It's him being all crazy. I was clearly here first.

143
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,400
Recently, why do you guys fight whenever you meet?

144
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,600
It's like you guys have a blood feud.

145
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,250
Senior! Haven't you realized?

146
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,600
Recently, he kept on picking on me.

147
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,710
Who is picking on you?

148
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,400
- Don't think too highly of yourself.
-You—

149
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Okay.

150
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,000
You guys can fight next time.

151
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,900
Didn't you say that you wanted to discuss the candidates for the head of the school broadcasting station?

152
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,100
Let's hurry. I still need to go register at the graduate school.

153
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,600
Lin Kaitou, I brought you some things from my hometown.

154
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,800
I don't want it.

155
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,400
- Senior, I'll go add some water.
- Okay.

156
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,100
Jin Mou, wait a minute.

157
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,900
Why do you drop things and then run away every time?

158
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,800
I brought that for everyone.

159
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,200
I have said that I don't want it.

160
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,800
Even if you brought it for everyone, I don't want it.

161
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,700
Then you can throw it away.

162
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,400
Jin Mou, I have someone in my heart already.

163
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,200
So stop giving things to me from now on.

164
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm afraid that if she sees it, she will be unhappy.

165
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,900
After all... she is very bad-tempered.

166
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,200
After all... she is very bad-tempered.

167
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay. I know.

168
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,300
He Xin!

169
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,000
Were you eavesdropping on us just now?

170
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,400
As a reporter, where are your job ethics ?

171
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,700
That... That's because you said that I'm bad-tempered.

172
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,500
I never thought that you would say bad things about me in front of other people!

173
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,720
I said that the person I like is bad-tempered.

174
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,800
Does it have anything to do with you?

175
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Don't think too highly of yourself.

176
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:41,430
Think it through. Are you really not talking about me?

177
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,700
He Xin!

178
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,710
He Xin!

179
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,500
Didn't you hear me talking to you?

180
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,800
I take back what I have just said.

181
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,100
The person that I like is you.

182
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,420
Why do you look at me this way?

183
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,980
It's not the first time that I have confessed my love to you.

184
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,580
So?

185
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,570
S-So... so what?

186
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,900
Aren't you going to give me an answer?

187
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,100
Then... let me think about it.

188
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,080
Don't think. Tell me the answer right now.

189
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,200
I'm afraid that we will have another fight tomorrow, and you won't talk to me again.

190
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,700
But...

191
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,000
So do you want to be with me or not?

192
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,670
Yes.

193
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,300
Mrs. Xia's Private Kitchen

194
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,100
Xia Miaomiao! Come downstairs and help me clean the dishes!

195
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,500
Oh, Mom. I'll be downstairs right away.

196
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,000
Your food is so delicious!

197
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,600
Delicious? Come back next time, I'll give you a discount.

198
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,200
Younian, what does "da zhe" mean?

199
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,000
- Discount.
- Oh, I see.

200
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,600
Okay! Thanks! I'll get going then.

201
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,800
I'll come back next time.

202
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,400
Are you leaving now?

203
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,180
Miaomiao, your classmate is leaving!

204
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,000
Why don't you come downstairs and sent them out!

205
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,400
I'm busy.

206
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,800
I'll walk you guys out then.

207
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,600
Thank you for sending my daughter home today.

208
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,400
You are welcome.

209
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,400
Take care!

210
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,400
Okay, okay.

211
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Weren't you busy?

212
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,500
I'm done washing.

213
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,900
Then clean these up and go upstairs.

214
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,000
Santu has come a few times asking how to open the luggage.

215
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,520
Wow!

216
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,600
Thanks, Sister!

217
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,200
Don't thank me for now.

218
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,100
I have your favorite here.

219
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,400
Thank you, Sister!

220
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,800
Do you like it?

221
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,600
Wow!

222
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,300
Yes!

223
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,100
Little fool.

224
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Sister, are all these mine?

225
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,300
This one is not. This one is for Sister A Xia.

226
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,800
Sister!

227
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,200
You have so many! Aren't they enough?

228
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,000
Are you coming downstairs to help me or not?

229
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,800
The night market is about to start.

230
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,400
We are coming!

231
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,090
Liu Shui, you can throw away the garbage.

232
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,200
I'll clean the table.

233
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,600
Didn't you leave a while ago?

234
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,800
I was waiting for you here.

235
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,450
I-I'm very busy.

236
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,500
I'm going to throw away the garbage.

237
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,000
Then I'll go with you.

238
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
There is no need.

239
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,230
Then you... can you give me five minutes?

240
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,700
I have something to tell you.

241
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,600
I... I don't have time now.

242
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,990
I'll wait for you at the lighthouse.

243
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,600
Come when you have time.

244
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,600
I...

245
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,100
Don't feel any pressure.

246
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,610
It's okay even if you don't come.

247
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,700
Do you have something to tell me why you asked me to come here?

248
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,300
I promised you that the second you come out of the airplane, I'll tell you why I didn't go abroad.

249
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,600
What do you think is the point in saying all these right now?

250
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,500
- Miaomiao—
- Just say it. I'm listening.

251
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,000
Do you know why I always like to be in the lighthouse?

252
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,800
Because the wasted factory that you can see from the lighthouse,

253
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,000
is where my mom had her accident.

254
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,600
Since the accident happened to my mom,

255
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,000
Fang Shi had put this project aside.

256
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,800
My mom was the designer of this project at that time.

257
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,330
It was her first project without the help of my dad.

258
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,000
My mom always joked that

259
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,200
if she was not busy getting married and having kids,

260
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,400
and not having time to do what she liked,

261
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,900
with what she could do, my dad wasn't qualified even to dig for her.

262
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,100
My mom liked to brag, didn't she?

263
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:23,000
So your mom was just like you. Very interesting.

264
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,300
Last year, when we were about to go abroad,

265
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,800
Fang Shi restarted this project.

266
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,200
And I had a chance to join them.

267
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,800
That's why I didn't go abroad.

268
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,700
I wanted to stay here to finish this project for my mom.

269
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,700
Actually, you could have just told me.

270
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,400
I hesitated for a long time on whether to tell you or not.

271
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,500
But I was afraid that you might give up going abroad for me.

272
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,500
It shouldn't be like that.

273
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,820
You should do what you want.

274
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,600
Not be like my mom.

275
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,000
Because of me and my dad, she held up her own dream.

276
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,800
In the end, there was only regret left.

277
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:35,400
Senior, I believe that this wasn't what your mom thought.

278
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,700
She chose the life that she thought was happy.

279
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,800
And you, shouldn't speculate her decision like this.

280
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,600
It's like at that time,

281
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,200
you should have told me to let me make my own decision,

282
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
instead of habitually thinking for me

283
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,400
to make the decision for me based on what you thought would be good for me.

284
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,900
I'm sorry.

285
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,800
Can you forgive me?

286
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Give me some time.

287
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
I know.

288
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,400
I'm in school having class.

289
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,800
Just work and don't worry about me.

290
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,960
Don't keep running out to call me.

291
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,400
Aren't you afraid of being criticized?

292
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,500
All right, I know.

293
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,000
I will wait for you to get off work and go to movies together.

294
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,480
Stop saying it. I'll be really mad if you keep saying it.

295
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,000
What are you hiding?

296
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,600
Nothing.

297
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Nothing?

298
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Then let me take a look.

299
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,000
Snacks. I was afraid that you would criticize me.

300
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,800
Really?

301
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,600
See?

302
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,200
What's there to hide?

303
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,600
I'm afraid.

304
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,440
It's good that you know it.

305
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,540
You're the one that asked me to supervise you to lose weight.

306
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,400
Worst case scenario, you can be a happy chubby girl.

307
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,800
That wouldn't work! Losing weight is important, okay?

308
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,400
Even if I don't succeed, at least it means I have a heart that wants to succeed.

309
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,260
I'm going to suffocate to death!

310
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,800
How long are you two going to talk?

311
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,600
Miaomiao!

312
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,100
When did you come back?

313
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,600
Weren't we just voice chatting last night?

314
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,000
We didn't tell you intentionally.

315
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,200
You were scaring us like that last time you came back.

316
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,600
We are sisters! Do you have to revenge on me like this?

317
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,400
Miaomiao!

318
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,400
We miss you so much!

319
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,030
You have been eating burgers and fries for a year.

320
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,000
Why are you still so skinny?

321
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,700
Don't mention it.

322
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,300
There was one midnight that I suddenly craved for dumplings with pickled vegetable fillings.

323
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,400
I was craving for them so much that I cried.

324
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,600
That is nothing. I'll buy you ten plates in a minute.

325
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,800
- We'll all go to the cafeteria together, okay?
- Okay.

326
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,600
I wouldn't go then.

327
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,000
I have promised Senior Da Chao to have dinner and watch a movie together.

328
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,200
You have been together for a year, and you guys are still so sickeningly sweet with each other.

329
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,800
Can you care about our single ants?

330
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,600
You are not even worrying for us.

331
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,000
I am!

332
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,300
Okay, it's all up to you!

333
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,800
"Okay, it's all up to you!"

334
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,200
Chubby Xia!

335
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,400
Be a lady.

336
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,400
Tang Mengfei! Long time no see.

337
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,650
It has not been that long.

338
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,900
Do you want some cookies?

339
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,200
Do you know how many calories a butter cookie has?

340
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,600
I'm already a popular model.

341
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,800
Who would use her as a model?

342
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,400
Okay.

343
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,200
- You eat then.
- I'll eat.

344
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,900
But I didn't say that I wouldn't eat it.

345
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,000
Then eat more.

346
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,600
Get fat!

347
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,200
These are all yours.

348
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,400
I'm not trying to make you fat!

349
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,300
Make her fat!

350
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,600
What the hell is this?!

351
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,880
It's no use even if you throw it away.

352
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,800
I don't agree with what you do.

353
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,600
I'm your leader. You need to listen to me!

354
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,800
Because you know that I'm right.

355
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,000
Retract the overhead floor and use more glass

356
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,200
is the way to make the light go deeper into the building.

357
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,500
Don't talk to me now. Let me think.

358
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,700
Frank!

359
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Younian, can you not fight with him?

360
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,800
You have been fighting about lighting for three hours.

361
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,000
Our design project is an apartment building for senior people.

362
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,100
What? Shouldn't we start from the daily needs of senior people?

363
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,800
Large area lighting will benefit the mental and body health of senior people.

364
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,200
I insist on my design.

365
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
Younian.

366
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
The design that you have...

367
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Based on the situation right now,

368
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,200
needs too much work in modifications.

369
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,700
I would suggest changing as well.

370
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,600
See, your teacher also says this.

371
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,600
How about this?

372
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,000
You carry on based on the original plan.

373
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,400
I will change based on the new design.

374
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,600
Younian.

375
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,400
You will exhaust yourself to death.

376
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,500
I agree.

377
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,410
All these are what I have to share.

378
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,400
Thank you, everybody.

379
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,400
Thank you, Student Xia for sharing with us.

380
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,600
Miaomiao had really good scores when she was in Britain.

381
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,200
She was praised by all the professors in Birmingham University.

382
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,400
You can take a look at her work.

383
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,800
If you have more questions or other things that you want to communicate about,

384
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,600
you can ask your senior, Miaomiao.

385
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,400
Self-study time.

386
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,000
I want to ask you about...

387
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,400
Ask one by one. I can't even hear it.

388
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,760
Senior, your sharing was very inspiring to me.

389
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,300
I want to apply for the exchange student in Britain as well.

390
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,200
You...

391
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,480
Wang Yutian?

392
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,800
Teacher Wang, I'm on my way to deliver the materials to you.

393
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,400
Thank you.

394
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,300
Teacher Jia!

395
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,400
Teacher Jia.

396
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,800
I need to deliver the materials.

397
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,200
Teacher Jia, wait for me.

398
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,600
Wrong way. It should be this way. I forgot.

399
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,800
Teacher Jia, wait for me.

400
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,300
- There is no time.
-Teacher Jia! Jia Yi!

401
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,600
Can we have a talk?

402
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,000
But I really need to deliver the materials. I really have no time.

403
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,800
It will just take a little while.

404
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,000
We can sit there and have a talk.

405
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,200
I have been pretty busy recently.

406
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,500
But I'm trying to make myself better.

407
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,400
Teacher Jia, your major is designing.

408
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,600
Have a look. How is my new shirt?

409
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,400
It fits well, right?

410
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,300
That's the thing.

411
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,600
I have been always trying to talk and communicate with you.

412
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,400
But I think that you have been evading me.

413
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,000
Today,

414
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,500
let's solve this problem in an adult way.

415
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,400
Teacher Jia, if you think that we are not suitable,

416
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,000
just tell me clearly. I won't keep persisting.

417
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,600
I'm not evading you intentionally.

418
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,200
It's just that before, we really didn't fit well.

419
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,300
I really didn't think of us that way.

420
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,600
Th-Then think about it now.

421
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,600
Actually, I did think of it.

422
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,400
But I don't know how to tell you about it.

423
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,900
Give it to me straight.

424
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,800
Looking at how you treated Lu Peng, you are not the kind that would hesitate.

425
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Straight? It would make people sad.

426
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,400
What? What did you say?

427
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,000
What are you doing?

428
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,300
Did you pick this yourself?

429
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,290
I-I don't know anything about clothes.

430
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,800
The staff picked it for me.

431
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,600
What?

432
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,000
This is what's different between us.

433
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,600
If I like this shirt, I'll buy it right away.

434
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,400
If I don't, I won't even look at it.

435
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,100
Because you know if it's something that you would like or not by one look at it.

436
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Teacher Jia, I think that there are some clothes, only by wearing them

437
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,300
Teacher Jia, I think that there are some clothes, only by wearing them

438
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,700
can you tell if they are suitable or not. Right?

439
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,600
Teacher Li.

440
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,800
I'm just a teacher assistant.

441
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,960
I'm on my way to promotion, and I don't know if I will succeed.

442
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,900
But I'm a teacher from the designing department.

443
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,500
I have a certain level of requests for the taste of clothes.

444
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,000
Of course. That's necessary.

445
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,600
Also Teacher Jia is so outstanding and cute.

446
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,000
In my eyes, you are the most perfect in this school.

447
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,900
- I think—
- Teacher Li.

448
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,400
Just... don't you understand that I'm rejecting you?

449
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,000
Just... don't you understand that I'm rejecting you?

450
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,300
Rejecting?

451
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,320
It's okay if you reject me.

452
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,990
You don't dislike me, do you?

453
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,600
Not really.

454
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,130
It's good that you don't dislike me.

455
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,300
It's good that you don't dislike me.

456
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,000
- But—
- I still have a chance if you don't dislike me.

457
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,800
That way! Be careful!

458
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,600
Shooting my Kaituo's long legs with super-wide angle is perfect.

459
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,400
Shooting my Kaituo's long legs with super-wide angle is perfect.

460
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,600
Three cameras are surely different.

461
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,800
- Take a break
- Okay.

462
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,000
Wait for a bit. I'm almost done.

463
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,100
Okay.

464
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,500
Are you tired? I bought you water.

465
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Never mind. Why so hot-tempered?

466
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,800
I'm not. You're hot-tempered.

467
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,990
Peng Fei, who's that girl?

468
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,200
What's her connection to Lin Kaituo?

469
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,000
At first, I thought she was Lin Kaituo's girlfriend.

470
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,600
I later found out that she is Liang Younian's younger sister.

471
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,000
As you know, Younian is Lin Kaituo's brother.

472
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
As a conclusion, she is probably Kaituo's younger or older sister.

473
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,300
Younger or older sister?

474
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,070
Hey, Peng Fei.

475
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,400
Get someone to replace me.

476
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,500
I need to go to the toilet.

477
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,100
I'll get back to the game. Wait for me.

478
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Student!

479
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,800
- Were you calling me?
.- Yes.

480
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,800
Hi, Student. I'm Lin Kaituo's friend.

481
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,400
I am fourth year, Business Management student, Ye Nan.

482
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,000
Hi, is there something you need?

483
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,300
Can I add you on WeChat?

484
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,600
You can't.

485
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,400
Lin Kaituo, why not?

486
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,200
Because she is my girlfriend.

487
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,800
Sorry for disturbing you.

488
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,000
What are you looking at?

489
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,100
I'm done. Let's go.

490
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,700
Calling me the hot-tempered one?

491
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,600
Kaituo, can you slow down?

492
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,400
Get Ye Nan to wait for you.

493
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,400
You seemed so happy talking to him.

494
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,800
I can't walk anymore.

495
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,720
Okay.

496
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,000
You're getting more and more spoiled.

497
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,150
Kaituo.

498
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,400
What?

499
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,500
We're holding hands.

500
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,000
Why? Are we not supposed to?

501
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,900
We can.

502
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
But...

503
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,400
But what?

504
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,200
But I don't feel anything special.

505
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,800
Is it because we know each other too well?

506
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,700
I didn't mean anything else.

507
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,000
I saw on TV when two people hold hands, it was as if their hearts stopped beating.

508
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,600
I saw on TV when two people hold hands, it was as if their hearts stopped beating.

509
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,600
How come we hold hands,

510
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:14,020
there weren't any special feelings?

511
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,400
Do you feel anything now?

512
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,200
Lin Kai—

513
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,400
Do you feel anything now?

514
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,300
A Little Thing Called First Love

515
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,000
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

516
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,600
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

00:44:53,600 --> 00:45:02,000
♫ I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

522
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,200
♫ Regarding what love feels like ♫

523
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,200
♫ I've only heard about it from friends ♫

524
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:18,500
♫ I never thought about when it would be my turn ♫

525
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,600
♫ You are so dazzling and outstanding ♫

526
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,800
♫ I'm just a faint breeze blowing ♫

527
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,600
♫ But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

528
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,700
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

529
