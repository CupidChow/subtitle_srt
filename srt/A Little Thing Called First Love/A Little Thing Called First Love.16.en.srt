A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,550
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,030
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,020
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,120
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,690
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,100
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,090
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,660
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,630
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,620
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,100
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,610
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,620
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,580
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,080
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,660
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,550
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,170
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,090
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,110
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,580
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,150
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,710
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,220
A Little Thing Called First Love
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,910
Episode 16

27
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,990
Okay, quiet on the set. We're going to run through the main point of the play.

28
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,110
Quiet.

29
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,920
Is it okay? Is it okay?

30
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,670
Focus on the story and look at each other.

31
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,380
Start.

32
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,740
Don't be nervous. Relax.

33
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,110
Ready!

34
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,940
Action!

35
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,300
Every time we meet... Every time you turn around and look at me—

36
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,340
Look at each other.

37
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,980
Pay attention to your partner. There's no one else at this time.

38
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,950
In your eyes, there's only her.

39
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,580
One more time.

40
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,450
Every time we meet...

41
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,300
Every time you turn around and look at me...

42
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,540
I always pretend to not know anything.

43
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,770
Actually, I'm also slowly step by step getting closer to you

44
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,450
to determine your feelings.

45
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,420
Today, I want to ask you...

46
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,630
If we can be together.

47
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,020
♫ I can't find a way ♫

48
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,610
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

49
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,590
♫ I want to give it up ♫

50
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,570
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

51
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,010
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

52
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,490
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

53
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,520
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

54
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,060
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

55
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,100
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

56
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,910
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

57
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,540
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

58
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,020
Cut!

59
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,040
Fantastic!

60
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,550
That was fantastic, my male lead!

61
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,120
I knew I was right, my eyes wouldn't deceive me. You're a natural male lead!

62
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,990
Take a break, you'll rehearse with Tang Mengfei in a bit.

63
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,020
Oh, my gosh.

64
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,390
This is great. Thank you.

65
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,170
Student, first pay, then drink it.

66
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,750
Sorry.

67
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,440
Earlier, I just dunked it and scored.

68
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,310
It was too cool.

69
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,110
It had to be.

70
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,900
Hey?

71
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,260
Anniversary of the school founding.

72
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,230
He's really unabashed.

73
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,370
Turn around. Hair.

74
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,140
Shoulder is 39.

75
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,780
- Miaomiao, the measurement for the shoulders is 39 cm.
- What?

76
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,470
- Shoulder is 39 cm.
- Okay.

77
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,300
What are you thinking about?

78
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,310
The waist is 65 cm.

79
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,320
What? 65 cm?

80
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,440
I'm clearly 63 cm.

81
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,550
You got fat.

82
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,430
You're calling me fat? You don't even look in the mirror.

83
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,630
Do you still want me to measure?

84
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,150
A Xia is already trying hard to diet.

85
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,460
Really? How hard?

86
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,340
She... She doesn't drink the soup when she eats instant noodles now.

87
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,570
Shut up.

88
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,700
Arm length is 57 cm. What a "gibbon" (wordplay).

89
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,500
Okay.

90
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,830
Younian, your camera is with me.

91
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,150
I have to use it these days, anyway.

92
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,050
I'll return the camera to you after I make a copy of the photos, okay?

93
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,640
- You're still not going to bed?
- Yeah.

94
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,210
I'll sleep once I finish.

95
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,310
Then rest early.

96
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:49,230
Urban morphology refers to the holistic formation, organization, and environment of a city,

97
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,830
as well as the organization structure of activity space.

98
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:59,710
Generally speaking, there are tangible formations and intangible assets.

99
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,700
Okay. Class will end here.

100
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,290
- Xia Miaomiao!
- Pardon?

101
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,860
L-Last time... the chocolate...

102
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,540
What?

103
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,990
- Pardon?
- Forget it. It's nothing.

104
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,840
- Then I'll be leaving.
- Where are you going?

105
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,950
- Rehearsal.
- Rehearsal for what?

106
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,990
She's the female lead of the drama club play.

107
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,820
What? You didn't know, either?

108
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,940
I don't think this dress highlights my thin waist.

109
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,260
I'll change the waist line later.

110
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,610
Will you be able to do it?

111
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,770
Do you know where the waist line is?

112
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,140
After all, you don't have a waist.

113
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,850
What are you doing?

114
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,940
Are you trying to strangle me to death?

115
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,430
A Xia is very tired. Can you talk nicely?

116
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,240
If you're too tired, then don't do this for credit.

117
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,840
If you don't do better, I'm going to tell the teacher to switch you out for someone else.

118
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,380
If she doesn't change you out, then I'm not going to act in it anymore.

119
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,990
Go tell the teachers. I don't want the school credit!

120
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,550
Whatever. I quit.

121
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,780
What are you doing?

122
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,500
The school credit is supposed to be yours.

123
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,030
She's always looking for my trouble, how am I supposed to get school credit?

124
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,550
Don't worry. I'll think of a way for you to get school credit.

125
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,410
Teacher, I don't want to do this anymore.

126
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,980
Why?

127
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,850
Xia Miaomiao wants to take my role.

128
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,350
She said that she doesn't want to be the understudy and wants to be the female lead.

129
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,710
Is there something wrong with that?

130
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,470
An understudy who doesn't want to be the main lead is not a good understudy.

131
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,960
If she is here, then I quit.

132
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,480
If I'm here, then she isn't.

133
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,780
Let me think it through.

134
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,070
Then, when will you give me a response?

135
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,070
Otherwise, I won't do it anymore.

136
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,140
All right.

137
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,730
Both of you try this part.

138
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,410
Whoever wins get the part.

139
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,040
One more time.

140
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,400
Tang Mengfei, what kind of a fall was that? Look at how she did it.

141
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,600
Liang Younian isn't here. Who am I acting for?

142
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,000
For me!

143
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,400
One more time! I'm giving you a chance.

144
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,000
Let me announce. The female lead is changed to Xia Miaomiao. No understudy.

145
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,600
Good!

146
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,600
It's not right. Like a prince and Cinderella.

147
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,200
Teacher, Cinderella has her own prince, too.

148
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,800
That's after all the makeup.

149
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,000
I know!

150
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,400
Xia Miaomiao, follow me!

151
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,200
- Lin Xia!
- What?

152
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,810
Help Miaomiao change into the play costume.

153
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,990
Then give her an exquisite makeup look.

154
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,200
Why?

155
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Because she is now the female lead.

156
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,200
What did I miss? How are you the female lead?

157
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,600
I also don't know...

158
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,400
It's decided then! I will go back to work and leave this to you.

159
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,200
- Make her pretty.
- Okay.

160
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,200
I've decided to use Lansur & Chen Man custom-made set

161
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,100
to demonstrate my uncanny makeup skills.

162
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,700
Close your eyes.

163
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,600
♫ Can you see my heart ♫

164
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,400
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

165
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:04,000
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

166
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,400
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

167
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,200
♫ My heart... ♫

168
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:25,300
♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

169
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,000
♫ I'm afraid to look up ♫

170
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's wrong!

171
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,300
The male lead is him!

172
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,800
Half an hour ago

173
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Liang Younian. Liang Younian.

174
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,800
Why are you doing this? Hurry.

175
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,400
Hurry and memorize the script.

176
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,000
Teacher, I already memorized it.

177
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,400
I changed one part.

178
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,800
Teacher, why do you keep on hovering around me.

179
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,000
Can I not hover around you? I don't want to, either.

180
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,400
What happens if you leave? I don't have another male lead.

181
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Who said that?

182
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,600
Teacher, didn't you ask me if I wanted to act?

183
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,800
I'm here now.

184
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,500
Okay.

185
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,900
You are the understudy.

186
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,400
Understudy? Who is his understudy?

187
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,300
Teacher, didn't you say I would automatically be the lead if I came over?

188
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,200
Didn't you reject me?

189
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,600
And he came first.

190
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,400
But you just got rejected by Liang Younian.

191
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,000
Didn't you hear him say that he didn't want to act.

192
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Hey, Younian. How should I fix this?

193
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,400
The color of this image...

194
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,800
The color...

195
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,000
I-Is too inappropriate for the feeling of first love, get him to change it.

196
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,700
My male lead got changed.

197
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,830
For same amount of credits, I have to do all the costumes for this play.

198
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm really envious of He Xin. I wonder where she's off to playing now.

199
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,200
Hello?

200
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,900
Did we run into bad luck?

201
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Why are you complaining about bad luck when

202
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,200
I haven't slept for two days and I'm not complaining.

203
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,990
A Xia, the teacher asked you to do all the costumes because

204
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,200
that means that you are good, and she likes your abilities.

205
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,200
But before Miaomiao was also helping me.

206
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,000
Then let Miaomiao continue doing it. She likes fashion design, anyway.

207
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,000
As for Miaomiao,

208
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,600
the main male lead has been changed to my Kaituo. What's there to dislike?!

209
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,200
Which part of him isn't worthy enough for you?

210
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,800
Act well! I'll rush back and watch it!

211
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,420
He Xin is too ferocious.

212
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Let's go and survive this week.

213
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
How is it, Da Chao?

214
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,600
- The camera has to be focused.
- Okay.

215
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Younian, hurry, okay? Do it well, make sure to be detailed.

216
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,600
Miaomiao. Miaomiao!

217
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,200
Come help me and see which cloth is better.

218
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,800
This one, this one, or this one?

219
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,200
This is to make the whole dress.

220
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,100
Or you can—

221
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,590
Let me tell you.

222
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,960
Liang Younian doesn't usually take pictures of people.

223
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,300
He only takes pictures of those lifeless buildings.

224
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,600
How are they more important than my photo?

225
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,600
Senior, we are back.

226
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,600
You came back. How are the costumes?

227
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,600
We finally finished everything one day before the play.

228
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,400
So tired.

229
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,200
I'm gonna finish this up and then go to sleep.

230
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,100
You've been so tired, will you be able to do well tomorrow?

231
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,000
It'll be fine. Everything is fine, except I can't cry.

232
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,600
How about we use the menthol oil again?

233
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,200
Forget it.

234
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,500
- Hey, Miaomiao.
- Yes?

235
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Come over here for a second.

236
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,300
What's up?

237
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,450
- You know that Liang Younian never takes pictures of people, right?
- Yes.

238
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,200
He took one of you.

239
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,400
C-Could...

240
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,400
This must be wrong.

241
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,400
It seems like there is another one.

242
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,570
Senior took a very pretty picture of you.

243
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,280
Miaomiao, let's sew this button on.

244
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,600
No. I'm too tired.

245
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,020
My favorite costumes for this play are all made by you?

246
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,430
Yeah...

247
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,170
It's such a pity that you're an architecture major.

248
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,180
How about you forsake darkness for light and switch over to our major?

249
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,740
There.

250
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,130
All right, everyone. Prepare yourselves and get ready to go on stage.

251
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,180
Okay.

252
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,030
Fighting!

253
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,110
How come there's no energy? Say it louder!

254
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,060
- All right?
- All right!

255
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,670
Fighting!

256
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,370
Miaomiao, are you all right?

257
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,350
Don't think about it too much right now. Get through acting in the play first.

258
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,190
Do you want menthol oil? Will you be able to cry?

259
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,590
No need.

260
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,270
So pretty.

261
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,790
Okay, thank you. Take care.

262
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,430
Student, come look at the flowers.

263
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,580
Students, come here and look at the fresh flowers.

264
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,150
Student, look.

265
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,760
Student, do you want to buy some fresh flowers?

266
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,940
Student, why don't you take a look at these fresh flowers?

267
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,300
- They're a special price today.
- Not bad.

268
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,000
Thank you. Take care. Bye-bye.

269
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,630
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

270
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,320
Student, do you want to buy fresh flowers?

271
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,380
Student, come and look at the fresh flowers.

272
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,500
Student, come and take a look.

273
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,170
Boss Wang, are you done?

274
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,570
The play is about to begin and you still don't feel like you've made enough money?

275
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,890
There are still two bouquets. The production costs are high.

276
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,390
Why don't you buy it?

277
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,670
I won't.

278
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,780
You have the heart to leave me here to sell by myself?

279
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,750
Yes.

280
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,130
Younian, you've changed.

281
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,140
You even took the male lead role last time because of me.

282
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,500
Now, you won't even buy one flower from me.

283
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,400
You're too hurtful.

284
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,350
Okay.

285
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,670
How much is this one?

286
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,990
Indeed, you're my brother. This will be 80 yuan.
 ($12.00)

287
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,890
Here, I'll give you a card for free.

288
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,120
Who are you writing it to?

289
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,990
Xia Miaomiao

290
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,940
Xia Miaomiao?!

291
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,870
Hey, is there something going on?

292
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,470
There're Doraemons in the flowers, who would I give it to if not her?

293
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,770
Why?

294
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,960
Haven't you seen the drawings of the doraemons on the manholes around the school?

295
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,870
They're all drawn by her. How could I not know she likes Doraemon?

296
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,550
You can buy the other bouquet that doesn't have Doraemon and give it to someone else.

297
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,900
No, that's fine. I've already written the card so let's leave it.

298
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,580
♫ Woke up on the right side of the bed ♫

299
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,350
♫ What's up with this Prince song inside my head? ♫

300
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:19,220
♫ Hands up if you're down to get down tonight ♫

00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,060
♫ Cuz it's always a good time ♫

♫ It's always a good time  ♫

311
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,010
♫ It's always a good time ♫

312
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,480
Sorry about that. Excuse me, excuse me.

313
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,570
♫  It's always a good time ♫

314
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,040
Why did you just come?

315
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,070
Thank goodness I made it in time.

316
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,380
♫ Woah oh  ♫

317
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,100
♫ It's always a good time ♫

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,110
♫ We don't even have to try, it's always a good time ♫

319
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,130
Thank you for the school dance team for such an amazing performance.

320
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:47,400
Let's give an enthusiastic round of applause to welcome our next performance.

321
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,660
A play to celebrate the school anniversary, "First Love."

322
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,050
So excited!

323
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,710
Every time we meet...

324
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,550
Every time you look back and look at me...

325
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,140
I pretend that I have no idea.

326
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,940
Actually, I'm also getting closer to you step by step

327
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,670
to confirm your feelings

328
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,920
And so...

329
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:51,200
Today, I want to ask you...

330
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:08,750
Can we... be together?

331
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,540
We can't...

332
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,150
Why is that?

333
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:10,980
If the person you like can be your driving force,

334
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:18,220
then even if you can't be together, it's worth it.

335
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,900
Maybe that's what liking someone is really about.

336
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,590
I like you enough.

337
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,780
That's why...

338
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,980
I can forget you.

339
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:29,560
Teacher Lin, I was inside the theater later so I couldn't pick up your call.

340
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,560
Come to the office to find me.

341
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,750
All right, I know.

342
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,130
Did you help me give that shirt to Fang Xiaoyue?

343
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,810
I gave it.

344
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:44,190
She's too pitiful. The air conditioning inside is so cold and she's wearing so little.

345
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,440
Being tender towards females, it's so unlike you.

346
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,900
You don't know me. I'm the modern day Jia Baoyu, okay?
(Jia Baoyu: main male character in the classic Chinese novel, "Dream of the Red Chamber," equivalent to a "Romeo")

347
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,950
I don't want to know you.

348
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,410
What?!

349
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:09,540
Senior, you came?

350
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,270
Hello. I want to ask where Xia Miaomiao's seat is?

351
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,920
That one.

352
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,880
Thank you.

353
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:49,380
Oh, dear! It was an accident.

354
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,950
Teacher, you were looking for me.

355
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,360
Younian. Here, have a seat.

356
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:19,540
These few days as I was organizing the outstanding projects, I discovered this.

357
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,670
I want to give it to you to keep as a memory.

358
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,350
Chinese Style Courtyard

359
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,820
Grade: 90 points; Name: Chen Yi

360
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:45,470
Your mom drew this when she was in her fifth year.

361
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,790
At that time, I was only a freshman.

362
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:54,670
I heard your mother had a fight with your father at the time.

363
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,540
So, it was the first time that she didn't turn in a final project on time.

364
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:04,180
But when she made up for it later and turned it in, she still received the outstanding award.

365
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:07,980
Grade: 90 points; Name: Chen Yi

366
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,900
Chinese-style Court Yard; Grade: 90 points; Name: Chen Yi

367
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,950
Grade: 90 points; Name: Chen Yi

368
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,590
"Silly Liang Gang"

369
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,000
Hello. Dad, I wanted to tell you something funny.

370
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,330
Let me tell you something first.

371
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:36,810
Come home for the Dragon Boat Festival. We'll all go for a family portrait.

372
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,540
Find a way to bring Kaituo back.

373
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,260
Hello?

374
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,030
Did you hear it? Why aren't you saying anything?

375
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,320
The signal isn't good.

376
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,830
Did you hear what I just said?

377
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:00,120
Yes. Kaituo, right?

378
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,100
I'll go find him.

379
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,010
That's about right.

380
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,600
My own son is indeed the most reliable one.

381
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,450
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

382
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:14,040
Hey? Wait. Didn't you say that you had something funny to tell me?

383
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,350
What is it?

384
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,620
I forgot.

385
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,510
Hello? Hello?

386
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,550
This kid.

387
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,620
Why don't we go backstage and find Miaomiao?

388
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:48,150
Today, I want to ask you...

389
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:02,030
Can we be together?

390
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,620
You go, I'm going to find Kaituo.

391
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,300
Jeez, you have heterosexuality, but no humanity.

392
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,340
May I ask, what is humanity?

393
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,880
You're indeed not human.

394
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,540
You smell like a beast.

395
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,950
Aren't you afraid your smell is going to make Lin Kaituo faint?

396
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,290
That's perfect. Once he faints, I can bring him back with me.

397
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,910
Are you shameless?

398
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,500
I'm just joking.

399
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,180
I think it does smell a little too much.

400
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,870
But these are the cleanest clothes in my bag.

401
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,500
Then I'll take you home to change your clothes.

402
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,580
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

403
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,870
Senior Younian brought it in.

404
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,950
Yeah, I saw him hold it.

405
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:48,720
Eh? Miaomiao, don't remove your makeup.

406
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,390
Your drama club wants to take a group photo and asked me to go, too.

407
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,990
This is for you..

408
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,740
I don't want it.

409
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,010
I'm giving the flowers on behalf of our class.

410
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,430
Senior Sister, your flowers look so pretty.

411
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,550
Senior Sister, none of us have flowers.

412
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,510
Did your boyfriend gift them to you?

413
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,990
No. Don't say random stuff.

414
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,380
Who are you giving these flowers to?

415
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,230
- Junior Sister gave this to me.
- Nice.

416
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,710
This is for you.

417
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,420
I don't want it.

418
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,590
This was given from our class, take it.

419
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:12,780
Come on, let's take a photo for memories and capture today's success.

420
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,900
Miaomiao, go up.

421
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,950
Just in time, the ones who are short, stand in the front and the ones that are tall, stand at the back.

422
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,510
Girls stand more forward.

423
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,350
Hurry up, hurry up.

424
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,710
Photographer, make us look nice, okay?

425
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,460
Okay. Face forward.

426
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,740
One, two, three.

427
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,680
Okay.

428
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,350
Okay.

429
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:40,170
- I want to take a picture with you.
- Come.

430
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,630
Everyone together.

431
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,300
Anyone else?

432
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,360
Ma'am, I want to take one with you
  Let's take one together. You and us.

433
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,750
One, two, three.

434
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:05,830
♫ Turning at the corner of the street, I halt my feet ♫

435
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,780
♫ With your appearance, the city is blurred ♫

436
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:18,820
♫ Your face appears to have an unfamiliar feeling ♫
