♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,150
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,150
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,120
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,590
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,060
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:40,590
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

Episode 1

27
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,000
Hey! Why are you riding so fast?

28
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,650
Hey! Did you hear?

29
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,460
Grade Eleven is getting a transfer student.

30
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,540
- Really?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,590
Don't know if it's a girl or a boy. What's your guess?

32
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,830
I'm guessing...

33
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,690
You're already in the Twelfth grade, can't you be a bit more mature?

34
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,280
What did you get on the mock test last time?

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,910
It would be awesome if it was a really cute girl.

36
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,720
Our school has too few pretty girls.

37
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,420
Don't you think so? Hey, Liang Younian!

38
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,340
Wait for me!

39
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,550
Mr. Zhang and Mrs. Li, I'll visit you both when I have time.

40
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,760
Okay.

41
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,450
Xia Miaomiao! What are you doing? Hurry!

42
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,180
Oh, my. Slowly, slowly.

43
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,300
This girl. Hang on, Mom's going to help you.

44
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,710
Your father really is something. He didn't even wait for us to finish moving first before going out to the sea again.

45
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,600
What is he in such a hurry for?

46
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,110
Dad said that the sea is the sailor's clock.

47
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,750
Sure, sure, sure. Your father is the most worthy of admiration in your heart.

48
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,170
Xia Yao Yao! Hurry up!

49
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,990
I almost forgot about you.

50
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,790
Coming!

51
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,760
I've finished moving everything.

52
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,100
Boss, we're neighbors from now on, so let's take care of each other.

53
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,310
It's just a little messy. It'll be better in just a bit.

54
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,310
Are we really going to open a store here?

55
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,070
This alley is so long, I almost got muddle-headed running back and forth.

56
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,120
Will anyone be able to find the store?

57
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,450
As long as the wine is good, there's no reason to fear a long alley.

58
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:57,780
Besides, the balcony on the second floor has a view of the lighthouse.

59
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,670
Haven't we been able to see a lighthouse every time we've moved?

60
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,900
But our business still gets increasingly worse.

61
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:12,880
Remember, in places where there's a lighthouse, we will never get lost.

62
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,420
You've probably watched too many dramas.

63
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,480
Signs of early menopause.

64
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,700
What are you saying you rascal!

65
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,950
You two, change those dresses quickly!

66
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,390
- Boss!
- Yes?

67
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,070
Congrats on moving to a new house. This is for you.

68
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,180
Thank you, thank you!

69
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,140
Come eat when you have time, I'll give you a discount!

70
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,880
Mom.

71
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,790
The zipper on my backpack broke again!

72
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,050
Just get a safety pin and pin it together.

73
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,080
You really don't know how to take care of your own matters.

74
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,270
Can't you buy me a new backpack?

75
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,730
How much money would that be?

76
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,820
Mrs. Xia's Private Kitchen

77
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,460
Xiao Yaoyao! It's fine if you're not helping, but you're making a mess. Pick it up.

78
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,230
No.

79
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,660
Did you hear what I said? Mom will get mad again.

80
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,510
Hey! Let see you try and dodge my grapefruit dart!

81
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,990
- You missed!
- Just you wait, you're dead meat!

82
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh, no. Oh, no.

83
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,340
What if it hit someone?

84
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,590
It's fine.

85
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,020
Big Brother.

86
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,060
Sorry. Are you okay?

87
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,160
Menu

88
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,180
Mom.

89
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,070
I feel dizzy. I don't think I can hand out flyers anymore.

90
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,870
You hit me even though I'm dizzy?

91
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,810
All right. Stop faking it.

92
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,690
I'll go hand them out.

93
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,080
You are the best sister in the world!

94
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,770
Oh, my.

95
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,020
- Sis, it's so hot outside, you have to remember to—
- I know.

96
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,850
My little sister is still the one that cares about me the most.

97
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,790
I will drink lots of water and won't get a heat stroke, okay?

98
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,300
You have to remember to buy me a popsicle.

99
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,580
Hurry and go.

100
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,700
Hello.

101
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,540
Hello.

102
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,540
Hey! Don't randomly hand out flyers.

103
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,670
I... came to buy water.

104
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,860
Boss, how much is this?

105
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,390
Three yuan. ($0.50 USD)

106
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,650
This is a very important competition, do you have confidence?

107
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,910
Yes!

108
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,980
One, two! Let's Go!

109
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,130
- Has anyone seen Lin Kaituo?
- No.

110
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,420
As the captain, how can he be late?

111
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,140
Your lot is the worst class I've ever had.

112
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,240
When Liang Younian was captain, the team was never this lazy nor scatterbrained.

113
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,710
Younian.

114
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,070
Coach, it's twelfth grade now, I need to go home and study.

115
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,980
Coach... I already quit.

116
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,150
Coach, I didn't bring my uniform.

117
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,190
I have one.

118
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,870
Let's go, HDFZ! Let's go, HDFZ!
(HDFZ - Affiliated High School of Haicheng University)

119
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,270
Keep it up, HDFZ!

120

121

Go, go, go! Keep it up, HDFZ!

124
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,580
Keep it up, HDFZ! Go, go, go!

125
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000

NDFZ, fighting! Go, go, go!

128
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,000
Are you kidding me?!

129
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,000
- Liang Younian! Liang Younian!
- Yeah!

130
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,800
Isn't Lin Kaituo the one who's supposed to be playing well?

131
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Why is it Liang Younian?

132
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,100
Lin Kaituo, fighting!

133
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,800
Lin Kaituo!

134
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,800
- Lin Kaituo! Lin Kaituo! Lin—
- Hey!

135
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,700
Are you also a Kai fan?

136
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,400
Time to eat?
 ("Fan of Kaituo" sounds like Kai fan - time to eat)

137
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,900
Look, "Kaituo, Fans of Kaituo, Forever Companions!"

138
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,200
What do you think? Do you want to join our fan club?

139
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,600
Our fan club is really big and powerful!

140
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,900
Big and powerful? Are there a lot of people?

141
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,600
Uh, if I count you that makes two.

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
- Fighting! Let's go, Kai!
- Liang Younian, let's go!

143
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,000
Hello?

144
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,400
Why are you still not back? Where is my popsicle? Did you forget?

145
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I bought it. I bought it.

146
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hurry and come back then.

147
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,000
I know.

148
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,200
Kaituo fighting! Kaituo fighting! Kaituo fighting! Kaituo fighting!

149
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Lin Kaituo.

150
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,200
HDFZ, fighting! HDFZ, fighting!

151
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,600
Stop!

152
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,000
Stop!

153
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,700
Take off that uniform.

154
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,800
You're still the same.

155
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,000
Lin Kaituo, do you think you are in the right after you were so late?

156
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,100
Even if I was late, he still had no right to wear my uniform.

157
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,400
I was the one who gave him permission to wear it. Hurry and continue the match.

158
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,000
Why even continue with the match?

159
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,000
How could you let him wear my uniform?

160
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Because I'm the coach and because you're the Captain of the basketball team!

161
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,200
Affecting the competition because of tardiness

162
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,000
is a mistake that never occurred when Liang Younian was captain.

163
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,700
Do you understand?

164
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,300
Then I quit being the captain.

165
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,300
Lin Kaituo!

166
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,400
I'm coming. I'm coming.

167
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,200
Ah Xia!

168
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,600
Miaomiao!

169
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,400
I miss you so much. Now that you're gone, there's no one to accompany me to the bathroom anymore.

170
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,300
I miss you so much, too.

171
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Let me tell you something.

172
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,600
I'm so worried that I won't make any friends in the new school.

173
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,200
Don't worry. No matter what, you'll still have me.

174
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,900
Have you visited the new school and taken a look around?

175
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
There's someone called Lin Kaituo.

176
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,600
I think he's on the basketball team.

177
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,910
Lin Kaituo?

178
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,000
[HDFZ Campus Forum]

179
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,800
The Seven Sins of the Devil Incarnate, Lin Kaituo of HDFZ

180
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,400
Today, I walked by the basketball court and a girl tried to hand a bottle of water to Lin Kaituo, captain of the basketball team.

181
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,600
But he completely ignored her and just left.

182
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,400
I can't stand it! I must reveal his true colors!

183
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,000
Lin's Fan: Do you know how hardworking he is?

184
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Did Lin Kaituo provoke you? Why do you want to hurt him like this?

185
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,800
What do you think? Did you finish reading all of it?

186
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,800
Yeah.

187
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,800
That Lin Kaituo of yours doesn't seem to be a good student.

188
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,600
But, I don't think he's that kind of person.

189
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,800
Miaomiao, it's so late. Why are you still awake?

190
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,600
Ah Xia, my mom told me go to bed. I'm hanging up now.

191
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,000
Bye-bye.

192
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,200
Miao, I will call you again.

193
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,200
Come on, hurry.

194
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,400
Welcome. Feel free to look around.

195
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,800
Hi, Uncle.

196
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,570
Did you fall?

197
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,760
My leg hurts.

198
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,750
Does it hurt here?

199
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,250
Can you stand?

200
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,900
Big Brother will do a magic trick for you. Wait here.

201
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,800
One, two, three.

202
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,400
Be a bit more careful next time, okay? Also, don't be so noisy. Off you go.

203
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,100
What?

204
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,800
I forgot about that, thanks.

205
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,600
- Checkout please, Uncle.
- Okay.

206
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,200
You're already first in the school, yet you're still so hardworking.

207
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,200
It would be nice if only our Dachao could be half as hardworking as you.

208
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,000
That's ¥20. ($3.00 USD)

209
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,700
All right. Say hi to your parents for me.

210
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,900
- Oh, Uncle.
- Yes?

211
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,580
This...

212
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,200
will be on Dachao's tab.

213
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,000
- Dachao?
- Yes.

214
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,670
Why would he need to repeat a grade if he is the first in the school?

Is there something still stuck on my face? Why do you keep staring at me?

223
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,000
I-I'm staring at you because...

224
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,200
I want to borrow your umbrella, but you also need it.

225
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,300
Y-You'll get soaked. I-I'm not that kind of person.

226
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200

I can lend you the umbrella. Besides, it's hard to hold an umbrella while riding a bicycle.

230
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,600
I have a raincoat.

Username: Shui Lingling
(Bright, lustrous)

243
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:08,110
Do you guys even know him? Why are you all attacking him? He's clearly a good person.

244
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,230
He's extremely kind and polite.

245
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,030
He's great at basketball, and his grades are really good, too.

246
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,020
I hope you guys can stop slandering him.

247
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,180
[You said he's a good person, where's your proof?]

248
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:31,180
I saw him lend his umbrella to someone who didn't bring theirs.

249
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,390
You might as well have said that he assisted Grannies to cross the street.

250
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,910
If there's a Grandma who needs help crossing the road, I am sure he would help.

251
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:50,230
Then has ever he picked up any money and handed it over to the police?

252
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:56,220
That I don't know, but he's definitely a good person.

253
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,900
If he's that kind, then why doesn't he have any friends?

254
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,750
Who said he doesn't? I would love to be his friend.

255
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,380
You have one private message from Lin Kaituo.

256
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,040
Xia Miaomiao.

257
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,790
Have you gone crazy again?

258
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,540
Mom, Xia Miaomiao has gone insane again!

259
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,580
Lin Kaituo: What does this have to do with you? Who wants to be friends with you?

260
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,840
- Ah Xia.
 - What?

261
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,910
What happened?

262
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,820
I'm so sad.

263
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,060
What happened? Did you not have a full dinner?

264
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:51,290
Do you think that I still won't be able to make any friends
at the new school?

265
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,020
Why would you suddenly think that? Did someone bully you?

266
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,620
Remember that Lin Kaituo I told you about yesterday?

267
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,830
- He got mad at me.
- He got mad at you?

268
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,310
What did he say? I'll go beat him up!

269
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,900
I wrote good comments for him in the forum,

270
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,740
and he DM's me and wrote "Who are you to care?"
(DM - direct message)

271
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,480
Then why did you have to do that for him?

272
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,680
Why are you like this? You clearly know that you're my only friend, yet you're not very comforting.

273
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,540
It's precisely because I'm your only friend that I need to be responsible for telling you the bitter truth.

274
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,570
Let me tell you, you really need to change your people-pleasing personality.

275
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:38,460
I know you've always moved around so you don't have many friends, but you can't just go around trying to befriend everyone.

276
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,550
You won't be able to make any friends like that. It's better if you just treasure me as your only friend.

277
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,850
Xia Miaomiao, how many times do I have to come upstairs to call you?

278
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,230
Even though we are in different places, my heart is still always with you.

279
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,240
- It's time for dinner.
- You can come to me with any problems you have.

280
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,500
I have to go eat.

281
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,580
I am always by your side.

282
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,500
Okay, I've also tired myself out from talking. Bye-bye.

283
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,150
Bye-bye.

284
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:04,490
I'm not going to eat tonight. I don't have an appetite.

285
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,930
Mom, Xia Miaomiao says she doesn't have an appetite!

286
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,390
No appetite, huh? Sit down!

287
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,200
Leading someone by the arm, pretending to have no appetite...

288
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,150
Eat.

289
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,240
Sweetheart.

290
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:43,200
Did someone give you a hard time when you were passing out flyers today?

291
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,000
No.

292
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,420
Really?

293
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,880
Then why do you look so down?

294
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:12,500
I just... really want a new backpack.

295
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,420
Wait here.

296
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:23,820
Actually...

297
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,650
I bought one for you long ago!

298
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,150
Thank you, Mom.

299
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,220
I want one, too.

300
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,540
I don't have any more money!

301
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,570
Mine.

302
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,730
- Sis.
- Yes?

303
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,760
Do you think your backpack is prettier or do you think mine is prettier?

304
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,290
- Aren't they the same?
- They're not the same.

305
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,210
I think mine looks prettier than yours.

306
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:59,650
Fine, yours looks better. Then why don't you just sleep with it in your embrace tonight?

307
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:02,180
That's fine with me.

308
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,500
Sleep early. You have to get up early tomorrow.

309
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,990
You can have the umbrella.

310
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,700
It's none of your business. Who wants to be friends with you?

311
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,590
Sis, where's my backpack?

312
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,550
It's here. Here.

313
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,020
No one is going to steal it from you.

314
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,390
Hurry up and sleep.

315
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,370
Why are you still in bed?

316
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,310
It's already eight o'clock! Hurry and get up!

317
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,320
Get up now. It's already eight o'clock!

318
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,730
Mommy's little baby, it's time to wake up~

319
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:32,720
Come on, I made something tasty for you.

320
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,290
Oh, my sweet child.

321
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,880
Oh, my sweet child.

322
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,900
There will be a new student joining us today.

323
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,400
Come over here.

324
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,750
Please introduce yourself.

325
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,990
Hi, everyone. My name is Xia Miaomiao.

326
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,620
That's all?

327
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,620
That's all.

328
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:33,460
There are a few empty seats, pick one and go sit down.

329
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,020
What's wrong?

330
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,860
Standing on the side of reason and not affiliation. You're indeed a little bold for choosing that seat.

331
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,320
What?

332
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,550
You'll understand in a little bit.

333
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,710
Stop right there.

334
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,150
What?

335
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,000
You are late. Who let you come inside?

336
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,470
Then I'll go back.

337
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,290
Stand right there!

338
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:20,200
Sit down.

339
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,770
Hello, I am Xia Miaomiao.

340
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,490
I just transferred.

341
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:42,480
Everyone, class is starting. Open your textbooks to page six.

342
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,350
A is greater than thirty...

343
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,890
Sis, where is my backpack?

344
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,920
It's here, here, here. Take it, take it, take it.

345
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,540
No one is stealing your backpack.

346
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,650
Excuse me...

347
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:20,300
Student, may I borrow your math textbook? I forgot to bring mine.

348
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,930
Student. Where is the bathroom?

349
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:39,530
- That way.
- Thank you.

350
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,090
It's none of your business. Who wants to be friends with you?

351
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,660
Xia Miaomiao, follow me to the office to fill out your student information.

352
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,950
Oh, okay.

353
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:18,550
Okay, the next multiple choice question that we'll be looking at is mostly about the difference between "arrive at" and "arrive in".

354
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:23,740
"At" shows that you've arrived at a small place such as the airport or a station.

355
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,650
"In" shows that you've arrived at a big place such as a country or city.

356
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:33,400
When you use "at", take the location that follows it and use it as a reference point.

357
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:40,640
On the other hand, when you use "in," take the location that follows it as a large space.Therefore, "arrive at"...

358
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,210
When my dad told you to take care of me, is this how you treat me?

359
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,520
"Airport" represents a small range of words.

360
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,550
And another thing you need to pay attention to is that there is no set standard for the size of a city.

361
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,750
Teacher, I have a question.

362
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,550
Wang Yichao, what's your question?

363
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:59,220
Liang Younian is playing checkers by himself during class.

364
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:05,280
Teacher, there's no way I could be playing checkers by myself. Wang Yichao was playing with me.

365
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,650
Teacher, with his intelligence, it's completely possible.

366
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,100
Teacher, you believe me, right?

367
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:17,270
Class has already begun. It was the teacher who asked me to go so I won't get yelled at, right?

368
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,390
Thank you.

369
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,660
Hey, Student.

370
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,100
What?

371
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,700
Can you place it for me? I can't see.

372
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,800
B-Bring your head down.

373
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,020
Even lower? If I lower it any more, they'll fall.

374
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,730
Th-Then what should I do?

375
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,890
How's this?

376
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,620
Thank you.

377
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,060
No problem.

378
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,500
Reporting.

379
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,330
Which class are you in?

380
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,440
Teacher, I just transferred here.

381
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,040
My name is Xia Miaomiao.

382
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,990
You just transferred here, yet you're also late?

383
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,830
What's wrong with your class?

384
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:57,140
Looks like I need to have a conversation with your homeroom teacher.

385
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:01,670
There is Lin Kaituo, who is late and skips class every day.

386
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,790
New student, you're late, too?!

387
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,580
You are Lin Kaituo?

388
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:11,230
Yes, do you have a problem with that?

389
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,430
Hey! Who said you two could have a conversation?

390
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:19,190
Teacher, can you let us sit back down?

391
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:25,180
Lin Kaituo... What's wrong with you?

392
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,720
Before taking a break from school, you've always been one of the top 5 in your grade.

393
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,270
Why does it seem like you've turned into a completely different person after that break? You're not passing any of your subjects.

394
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:40,580
You're late. You skip class. You even get into fights. Don't you feel ashamed?

395
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,740
I don't.

396
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,740
Call your parents to come to school!

397
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:54,310
Teacher, you might not know this. I don't have parents.

398
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,870
You two, sit back down.

399
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,540
Okay. Let's continue the class.

400
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,590
Excuse me, Student. May I pass through?

401
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,790
Oh. Okay.

402
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,170
Thank you.

403
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,700
H-Hey, wait a second.

404
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,740
Hold on for one second.

405
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,310
I'll be quick.

406
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,470
I'm returning this to you.

407
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,660
I'm returning this to you.

408
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,150
Liang Younian, what's the hold-up? Are you coming or not?

409
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,670
I prefer Transformers.

410
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,500
- I-I wasn't...
- Coming.

411
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,750
I wasn't...

412
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,460
I wasn't going to give...

413
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,970
So embarrassing! How could I even mistakenly grab
a doll for an umbrella?

414
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,820
But at least I found out that his name is Liang Younian.

415
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,510
It was worth it, it was worth it.

416
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,790
But so what?

417
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,500
He probably thinks I'm a crazy person now.

418
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,160
Please give me a Doraemon

419
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,090
so I can hop in a time machine and throw the doll away.
