00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,270
A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,590
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,070
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,000
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,140
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,620
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,110
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,950
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,640
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,590
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,570
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,200
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,690
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,570
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,060
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,560
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,600
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,170
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,180
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,060
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,670
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,120
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,820
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:00,180
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,120
Episode 31

27
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,000
Teacher. Teacher!

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,150
Yeah?

29
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,490
Is class over or not?

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,660
That's all for today.

31
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,520
Oh, right. Did you see the school's notification?

32
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,500
If you want to go to Birmingham University, please give me your application as soon as possible, okay?

33
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,200
I'll hand in my application.

34
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,260
I'll go to the dining hall to wait in line and buy meals for He Xin. Come find me in a minute.

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,050
Teacher, I want to apply to be an exchange student.

36
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,060
I didn't think wrong of you!

37
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,240
With your talent, you can surely succeed wherever you go.

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,030
Here. Let me take a look at your application.

39
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,030
You still need 0.1 for your points.

40
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,600
And you need four term works. You only joined us in sophomore year, and you only have two.

41
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,280
Teacher, this is mine.

42
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,610
Indeed, if you switch half-way, it wouldn't work.

43
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,900
We already have three term works in our designing department. We only need one more.

44
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,450
- Meng Fei.
- Yes?

45
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,740
You don't have enough either, and you are far away from it.

46
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,880
Off by how much?

47
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,120
Off by 0.6

48
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,930
Xia Miaomiao, what are you laughing about?

49
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,310
You don't have four term works no matter how much you laugh.

50
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,560
I didn't laugh.

51
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,320
I didn't see it.

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,390
- Xinxin!
- He Xin!

53
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,120
- Why are you here?
- We are here to feed our baby.

54
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,550
It's lunchtime already! I'll go to the dining hall.

55
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,780
Let's eat together, Senior.

56
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,130
- Yeah.
- No, my boyfriend is waiting. You guys eat.

57
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,720
Okay. Goodbye, Senior.

58
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,900
Stop writing. Come over and eat.

59
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,520
Are you trying to starve me?

60
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,660
I have just a little bit. I'll be done really soon.

61
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,820
That little bit isn't a little. Come and eat first.

62
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,610
Stop writing.

63
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,620
Be good.

64
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,580
What have you been so busy about? It's been a long time since we've eaten together.

65
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,490
It'll be okay once I finish this. I'm already in the final stages.

66
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,220
It's just the coloring books from Art Club and reading pens from Fang's cooperation.

67
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,170
The Fine Arts Club already finished their work. They're just waiting for your call.

68
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,950
It's just the reading pens then.

69
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,500
I don't know what's happened with the express delivery. It was sent to a neighboring district.

70
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,420
When I called them, they brushed it off and said they'd send it over immediately, but they haven't done it.

71
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,310
Then what will you do?

72
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,040
I'll have to see if we get them before we have to send things off.

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,180
But if that's not good enough. I'll think of something.

74
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,800
Then, could they mail it over?

75
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,380
Or we could gather up the postal fees.

76
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,580
Right. I'll call them and ask.

77
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,010
Oh, right. Tomorrow morning, the Fine Arts Club is going to paint the trunk of the van. Did you know?

78
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,920
I know. Senior notified us about it.

79
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,410
We should just eat. Why are you discussing work?

80
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,750
Now we can only talk about Miaomiao.

81
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,850
But the matter of her underground relationship

82
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,950
is so pure I don't want to talk about it, either.

83
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,420
- We also have...

84
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,990
- Have what? Hurry and tell us.
- Tell us!

85
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,990
Actually, it's nothing. Calm down.

86
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,360
I knew it. Miaomiao's dating life is like that of a little girl's.

87
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,370
How about let's talk about you and Lin Kaituo. Have you made up?

88
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,730
It's not about reconciliation.

89
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,100
Right now, Lin Kaituo isn't my first priority.

90
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,200
I think that the most dependable thing for now is work.

91
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,050
Saying that makes it seem like you're a strong, female CEO.

92
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,660
I don't want to be some sort of an overbearing female CEO.

93
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,460
I want to be a reporter with a sense of social responsibility.

94
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,740
Good. I support you. I want to learn from you.

95
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,570
This time, I have to be one of the people chosen to be an international exchange student.

96
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,270
I want to be a clothing designer with spirit and depth.

97
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,560
It's hardly worth eating. Just eat. It's like we're at a pledge ceremony.

98
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,120
Someone isn't happy. What shall we do?

99
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,710
Then, let's not talk.

100
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,530
Have some crab.

101
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,800
We won't chat. Just eat.

102
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,450
How long are you going to be mad for?

103
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,290
Don't be mad.

104
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,850
I'll give you my sincere apology, okay?

105
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,220
Kaituo!

106
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,110
What are you doing?

107
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,380
Nothing.

108
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,920
Why are you looking for me?

109
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Let me borrow your electric bike.

110
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,690
I need to help Xiaoyue deliver the coloring books from the Art Club.

111
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,510
My electric bike isn't charged. Why don't we go charge it and go together?

112
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,990
It's fine. I'll charge it full for you when I get back.

113
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,730
Hey!

114
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,760
The brakes aren't too good. How about I take you?

115
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,130
What's wrong with you today? Why are you suddenly so nice to me?

116
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,310
You wouldn't have fallen in love with me, right?

117
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,130
Get lost.

118
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,920
Let's go.

119
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,840
Look.
[Name: Xia Miaomiao: 2015-2016 Second Semester- 2016-2017 First Semester]

120
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,790
Your grades for each semester are pretty average.

121
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:20,570
Only your physical education grade pulls your grade down every time.

122
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,890
So as long as you raise your P.E. grade,

123
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,800
you could raise your grade by .1.

124
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,760
But this term's P.E., I was only able to get basketball,

125
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,440
and I'm really not familiar with basketball.

126
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,200
But you're familiar with me.

127
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,620
Pardon?

128
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,400
- You've forgotten that your boyfriend—
- Shhh.

129
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,400
Student Liang Younian, this is a library.

130
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,120
Can you talk quieter?

131
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,330
Xia Miaomiao.

132
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,750
You're getting more and more bold.

133
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,730
I will give you one more chance. Bring your face forward.

134
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,620
Be gentle.

135
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,800
From now on, you should read this.

136
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,730
If you don't understand something, note it down and ask me later.

137
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,380
Okay.

138
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,290
You take care of dinner on your own.

139
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:49,250
Teacher Li is collaborating on a project with the Fang group. He wants us to do some work this evening.

140
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,820
Okay.

141
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,660
You say "okay" to everything. Our Miaomiao is great.

142
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,760
Be careful.

143
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,890
127 Feixing Qi.

144
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,930
I'll go outside and check.

145
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,460
Okay.

146
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,360
You don't need to shoo me out. I'm not here to help you.

147
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,140
Da Chao asked me to help him move some stuff.

148
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,420
Why are you walking so fast?

149
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,500
Da Chao, what did you bring over?

150
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,730
The coloring books from Art Club. Where should I put it?

151
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,430
Put it over there.

152
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,330
Why are you the one moving things for the Fine Arts Club?

153
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,890
I'm just taking advantage of this to show off in front of Xiaoyue.

154
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,490
Maybe she'll be moved someday. Right?

155
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,890
There is no point in doing this.

156
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,460
Why?

157
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,990
If someone doesn't like you, they'll just be annoyed by your efforts.

158
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,090
Then how will I know if she likes it?

159
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,490
I don't know, either.

160
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,600
Hello? Have you decided on a plan or not?

161
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Miss He, even at the fastest pace, we can only deliver the day after tomorrow.

162
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,000
We are about to load and leave tomorrow.

163
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,200
And you are telling me you can't deliver until the day after tomorrow?!

164
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,800
How do you want me to handle it?

165
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,000
We are really sorry.

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,400
Stop saying that you are sorry! Give me a way to solve the problem!

167
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,800
You can apply for canceling online.

168
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,600
It's clearly a problem on your end. Why do I need to cancel it?

169
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,000
Let me do it.

170
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,500
Hello?

171
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,400
Okay.

172
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,600
Let's do it that way then.

173
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
Thanks.

174
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,000
I have talked to them. They will mail the day after tomorrow.

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,200
We can let the students who stay in the news club find a way to mail them.

176
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,400
I have already asked.

177
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,400
They don't even have parcel delivery there. How are we going to mail them?

178
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,800
Don't worry. There must be a way.

179
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,800
If you are too aggressive, it will affect our image.

180
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,400
He Xin, don't go!

181
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,200
Help me ask where Xia Miaomiao is.

182
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,400
Why are you asking about Xia Miaomiao?

183
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,600
I'm not going to be involved in your complex love-hate relationship.

184
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,300
Then can you give me the phone number of Lin Xia?

185
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,800
You want to get to them through me?

186
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,300
I would not do it.

187
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,800
I really need to find them for serious things.

188
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm not helping even if it's about serious matters.

189
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Bye-bye.

190
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,800
I want to eat burgers.

191
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,000
Forget about it. I'll buy you pork braised with vermicelli.

192
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,800
How long has it been? Miaomiao has been very clear.

193
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,600
What else do you want?

194
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,600
Don't be so exaggerated. I don't like Xia Miaomiao that much.

195
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,600
Just ask her. Have I ever bothered her afterward?

196
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,900
No.

197
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,400
I, Lin Kaituo, can take things up and let things go.

198
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,800
She's the one who's blind, for rejecting me.

199
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,400
Right. I'm blind. Okay?

200
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,500
Then what are you here for?

201
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
He Xin has an activity and there is something that's still on the way.

202
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Do you know what is it about?

203
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,700
It seems that there is a patch of reading pens that were sent to the neighboring district.

204
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,000
I want to ask you to help me.

205
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,400
Xinxin!

206
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Why are you here?

207
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,800
We want to pick you up from your work.

208
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,200
Why are you so good today?

209
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,800
Let's go get midnight snacks together.

210
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,400
It's too early for midnight snacks.

211
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm hungry, let's go!

212
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,400
- There's still a bit more.
- Let's go!

213
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,800
Stop doing it!

214
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,200
- Let's go.
- My bag.

215
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
I'll carry it for you.

216
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,600
Let's go! You are so hardworking.

217
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
- You guys are so strange.
- No, we are not.

218
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,000
This kid. A newborn cub is not scared of anything.

219
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,600
What are you talking about?

220
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,200
Nothing, just keep drawing.

221
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,000
- Senior, I'll hold it for you.
- Pardon me?

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,600
There is no need. This chair is really steady.

223
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,800
I feel more assured holding this. Let me do it!

224
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,600
It's nothing. I'm used to doing things myself.

225
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,400
I can do it. It's so dangerous climbing up and down.

226
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,200
There is no need.

227
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,400
What do you think of this blue?

228
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,200
Senior, I think it's a little too deep.

229
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,600
I can add some white clouds in it.

230
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,200
It can make it brighter as a whole.

231
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,800
Okay.

232
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,400
Everyone, take a rest. We bought some drinks.

233
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,900
Okay.

234
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
I have some as well.

235
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,300
Thank you.

236
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,000
We'll put this here.

237
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Hello, Senior.

238
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,800
Are you a freshman of the design department?

239
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,500
Yes, my name is Wang Yutian.

240
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,600
Since we have the same family name, we might have been a family 500 years ago.

241
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,200
I, Big Wang, have a piece of advice, a suggestion for you, Little Wang.

242
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,100
Senior, go ahead.

243
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,700
Stay away from Xia Miaomiao.

244
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,000
Why?

245
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,400
Do you and Miaomiao have any relationship?

246
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,600
What relationship can she have with me?

247
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,500
I just suggested to you not to always stick with her.

248
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,800
Nothing can happen between you two.

249
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Also for you, it might be a little dangerous.

250
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,900
Also for you, it might be a little dangerous.

251
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,000
Isn't Senior single? I have a chance if she is single.

252
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,600
It does make sense.

253
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,200
Okay. It's up to you. Good luck.

254
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,000
- Hello, Senior.
- Hello.

255
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Goodbye, Senior.

256
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,400
Do you have blue, Miaomiao?

257
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,200
It's gone.

258
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,400
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

259
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,200
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

260
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,000
♫ Live inside my eyes ♫

261
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,900
- Xia Miaomiao.
- Yes?

262
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,800
Your crown...

263
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,900
...is missing something.

264
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

265
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:43,800
♫ I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

266
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,600
♫ Regarding what love feels like ♫

267
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,800
♫ I've only heard about it from friends ♫

268
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:59,100
♫ I never thought about when it would be my turn ♫

269
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,200
♫ You are so dazzling and outstanding ♫

270
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,200
♫ I'm just a faint breeze blowing ♫

271
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,200
♫ But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

272
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,200
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

273
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,000
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

274
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,400
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

275
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,000
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

276
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,900
♫ My heart... ♫

277
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:44,000
♫ Being spoiled by you like a child who can never grow older ♫

278
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Let's go, Bro.

279
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,400
Let's paint this a little more.

280
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,600
Hi.

281
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,400
Thank you.

282
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Be careful.

283
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,700
Here.

284
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,400
Thanks.

285
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,600
These are my books, Teacher Jia. Those books are mine.

286
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,000
- Sorry.
- You dropped your dining card.

287
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,400
Teacher Jia, do you have anything emergent? Why are you going in such a hurry?

288
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,800
Nothing.

289
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,400
Oh, last night... did Teacher Lu Peng say anything?

290
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,800
You saw Lu Peng last night? That bastard.

291
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,200
He didn't say anything when he came back.

292
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,000
It's good that he said nothing.

293
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What did you guys say?

294
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,600
We just had dinner.

295
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,400
Why would he tell you if he had dinner?

296
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,200
Because I'm his uncle.

297
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,200
I'm his guardian. I have the right to oversee him.

298
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,000
Yes, it does make sense.

299
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,400
Next time when we have dinner, I'll let him tell you.

300
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,200
Why do you keep following me?

301
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,600
You are walking your way and I'm walking mine. How do you know that I'm following you?

302
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,800
Then you go first.

303
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Why would I go just beacuse you tell me to go?

304
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,400
Are you intentionally going against me?

305
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,200
Teacher Jia, you are hiding from me like I'm some kind of plague today.

306
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,100
What do you mean?

307
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,600
I'll apologize to you then.

308
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Teacher, please.

309
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,800
What's wrong with you today? Lu Peng must have told you something.

310
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,000
Nothing, nothing.

311
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,400
I'll call him then.

312
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,200
I'm hungry. I'm rushing to the dining hall. I'm really hungry.

313
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,400
I'm hungry, too. Let's go.

314
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,000
Why am I not hungry all of sudden?

315
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,200
Then I think I'll ask Lu Peng what it is about.

316
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Okay!

317
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,400
I'm afraid of you! I'll buy you food.

318
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,300
Take this.

319
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,000
Do you know what's the salary of a teaching assistant?

320
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,400
I'm so generous for buying you a meal!

321
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,200
Come on!

322
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,400
Come in.

323
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Here it is. How is it? Big fish ball.

324
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Sorry.

325
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,300
Miaomiao, I've saved the seat for you. Go sit there.

326
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,400
Miaomiao, sit.

327
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,000
Look at this dominating tone.

328
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,200
Is this still our club leader? It seems that I don't know him.

329
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,200
We are buying your food. Just stop talking.

330
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,800
You can't stop us from talking! We'll talk outside, too!

331
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,000
Okay. If you keep talking, Miaomiao is going to bury her head underground.

332
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Right. Our Miaomiao is very shy.

333
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,400
The... how about this? I'll buy you more good food after this. Just let us go.

334
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,800
Look, it's nothing if we go public.

335
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,200
Let's eat.

336
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Aren't you buying me food?

337
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
I don't have the appetite.

338
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,400
What?

339
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,300
I don't have the money.

340
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,640
Where did you have dinner with my nephew?

341
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,800
The little restaurant near school.

342
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,200
Why did you buy him dinner?

343
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,600
A guy as stingy as Lu Peng not coming home for dinner that night—

344
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,000
Teacher Lu is not stingy. He paid.

345
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,700
Lu Peng? Paid the check?

346
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,990
Seems like you are really special to him.

347
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,400
It's because it was a break-up dinner.

348
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,600
Break-up dinner?

349
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Teacher Lu has told me that I'm not his type.

350
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,600
I think that he is not that interested in you.

351
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,200
There is no need for you to remind me again.

352
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,000
It's good now. I feel so light without all the burden of love.

353
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I plan to put all my time into teaching.

354
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,400
I'm going to go change my proposal now, Teacher Li.

355
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,600
Take your time. You can refill if you need to.

356
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,200
Teacher Jia, actually—

357
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,500
What is it? Are you mad?

358
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,200
No.

359
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,300
You are still saying no. You clearly are mad.

360
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,200
You're indeed mad.

361
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,700
Where are you going? Aren't we going to play basketball?

362
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,620
Right.

363
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,100
Xia Miaomiao, your mouth is swollen.

364
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,000
Okay. I'll give it to you.

365
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,600
So are you really mad at me? Why?

366
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,500
I'm not.

367
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,000
Is it because I accidentally stepped on your shoes just now?

368
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,400
No.

369
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,000
Then because I ate your pork rib?

370
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,200
No.

371
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,800
I know. I pulled your hair when we were playing earlier.

372
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
It's because... you promised not to go public.

373
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,600
It's because... you promised not to go public.

374
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,500
And then you did that suddenly.

375
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,800
For that.

376
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,200
Liang Younian officially apologizes to Xia Miaomiao.

377
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,000
Sorry.

378
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,900
Are you smiling? Does it mean that you are not mad?

379
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,800
- Okay. Let's practice basketball then.
- Okay.

380
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,000
You try to shoot first. Let me see what you can do.

381
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,800
You really can't do anything.

382
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,800
Okay. I have a few tricks for you.

383
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,900
Open your hands.

384
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,000
Don't touch the ball with the middle part of your hands.

385
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,200
Empty inside.

386
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,000
Bend your knees.

387
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Here. Let's try one.

388
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,390
I scored!

389
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,200
Did you see?

390
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,000
I did.

391
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,000
You are not shy anymore.

392
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,800
I-I'll practice myself.

393
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:24,400
Xia Miaomiao, if you can score 10, I'll make one of your wishes come true.

394
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,000
What wish?

395
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,400
If you can score, you can ask whatever you want.

396
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,200
Deal!

397
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,400
- I'm going to start.
- Okay.

398
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,600
Architecture Department

399
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,500
Be careful.

400
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,500
Is that everything?

401
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,200
I'm writing it down.

402
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,020
Who is that? We don't have such big cases.

403
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,900
Your reading pens are here.

404
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,600
Thank you.

405
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,800
What else do you need?

406
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,400
All of that.

407
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,300
- I'll help then.
- Okay.

408
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,600
Be careful.

409
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,700
Here.

410
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,500
Thank you.

411
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,600
How did you get the reading pens?

412
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,800
I called them and told them to send the pens.

413
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,800
I must've called more than a hundred times and they wouldn't send it.

414
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,200
Why did your call work?

415
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,690
I made a complaint to their headquarters.

416
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,400
Everyone that has been in this business knows that

417
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,200
if there is a complaint, they will deal with it first.

418
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,600
Thank you.

419
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,600
He Xin, they are all packed. Let's go.

420
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,000
Okay.

421
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,000
Okay.

422
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,700
Be careful on the way. Hide if anything happens.

423
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,200
Don't always rush to the first.

424
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,400
Also call me if anything happens.

425
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,100
- Go on then.
- Okay.

426
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,540
We are all talking about your journalism practicing class.

427
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,600
You need to submit your topic first.

428
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,400
Have you thought about what to submit?

429
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,000
I have submitted it a long time ago.

430
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,200
What did you submit?

431
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,000
Survey of kids education in remote regional areas.

432
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,400
It's an interesting topic.

433
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,800
Keep up the hard work! I'm looking forward to seeing the result.

434
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
I'll try my best to do it!

435
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
I'll make you proud.

436
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,400
Xia Miaomiao. It's the tenth.

437
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,100
Best of luck!

438
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,200
Senior, my wish.

439
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,200
Deal.

440
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,000
Wait a second. There is more.

441
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Your wish.

442
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,000
It's so yummy.

443
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,000
Is it good this way?

444
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,200
Yes, try it.

445
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,500
What are you doing?

446
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,000
Sorry.

447
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's okay. I'll do it.

448
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,500
I've licked it already.

449
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,400
I don't mind.

450
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,800
I'll give you mine. I haven't licked it yet.

451
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,800
It's not that I'm disgusted by you.

452
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,600
I'll buy another one.

453
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,800
You said that you don't mind.

454
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,800
I'll go buy the ice-cream.

455
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,850
Thank you, Senior.

456
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,600
- So your wish is eating ice cream and watching a movie together?
- Yes.

457
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,400
When I watched the movie with you last time, I've been thinking,

458
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,900
It would be great if I watch it with you one more time.

459
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,900
What are we going to watch?

460
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,400
How about Fast and Furious 8? You'll probably like it.

461
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,680
I don't like it.

462
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,300
Then, how about A Chinese Odyssey 2？

463
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,500
I don't want to.

464
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,600
Then do you not want to watch a movie?

465
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,900
If you don't want to, we don't have to.

466
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,200
I'll pick.

467
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,800
Okay.

468
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,000
I never thought that you would like this kind of movie.

469
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,800
I rarely know boys who like romantic films.

470
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,400
You have a girl inside.

471
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,600
If you like romantic films, I can ask for a list for you from Ah Xia.

472
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,800
She has collected all the good romantic movies.

473
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,400
And the romantic novels as well.

474
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,500
You don't you like that too, do you?

475
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:49,200
I do not like them.

476
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Then why did you pick this?

477
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,200
Actually, liking something is just a personal hobby.

478
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,600
Don't be shy about it.

479
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,000
Da Chao likes to play with stuffed animals, doesn't he?

480
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,200
I picked this because I get dizzy watching 3D movies.

481
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,100
But we watched 3D movie last time.

482

Don't you understand?

483
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,300
I watched it with you because I like you.

00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,800
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

Last time we were sitting there, monitored by an aunt to finish our drinks.

492
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,200
I remember it. I had three bottles.

493
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,800
I had two.

Xinxin said that she is going to buy us a big meal when she comes back the day after tomorrow.

516
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,400
I got it, too. But she asked me to pay for it.

517
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,300
It's so great.

518
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,400
Okay. I'm waiting for you to come back.

519
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,270
I sincerely apologize to you .

520
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Why are you still up?

521
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,860
I'll be back tomorrow.

522
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,490
Prepare to welcome me back.

Have you heard?

526

Xinxin held a very successful event this time.

527
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,400
She must be very pleased with herself right now.

528
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,000
Right?

529
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,400
Let her buy a lot of tasty food.

530
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,000
I'm here!

531
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Xinxin!

532
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,700
Here!

533
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
This is for you.

534
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,400
Awesome, Xinxin!

535
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,800
You were just gone for three days and you come back with so many things!

536
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:43,200
Actually, I have something to tell you this time.

537
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Starting next week,

538
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,600
I'll go out of town for my journalism practice paper.

539
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,400
Then how long will you be gone for this time?

540
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,000
I don't know yet. It depends on how the survey goes.

541
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
If everything goes well, one to two months.

542
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,200
If it doesn't, it might take a year.

543
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,200
We'll see once I'm there.

544
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,200
Then where are you going this time?

545
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,400
Is it safe? What's your paper about?

546
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,000
It's about surveying the education of kids in remote regional areas.

547
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,800
The teacher from my department will lead us.

548
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,800
So you ask us to come here to inform this?

549
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,200
Just go. You don't have to tell us!

550
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,400
I just want to tell you about this thing.

551
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,800
No need to send me off when I'm leaving.

552
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,400
You are thinking too much. I'm not going to send you off!

553
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,000
You don't have to send me off if you don't want to!

554
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,600
Why is he like that?
