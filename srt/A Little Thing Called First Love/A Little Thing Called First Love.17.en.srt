00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,290
A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,550
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,150
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,100
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,100
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,650
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,140
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,060
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:40,610
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,610
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,170
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,620
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,560
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,100
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,600
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,690
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,150
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,200
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,120
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,570
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,100
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,950
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:00,200
A Little Thing Called First Love
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,850
Episode 17

27
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,420
- Good Morning, Senior Sister.
- Good Morning.

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,670
Miaomiao, how come your eyes are so red?

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,430
Maybe I cried too much on stage yesterday.

30
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,370
Remember to apply a hot towel to your eyes later.

31
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,800
All right.

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,940
Freshmen and sophomores will attend the survey course together this afternoon. Let's go to the classroom together later

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,860
All right.

34
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,350
Right, do you want me to make your flowers into dried flowers?

35
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,870
There's no need.

36
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,690
Come on, Jingjing. Hold this for me.

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,150
Class, this is the first activity for your elective course,

38
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,070
architectural surveying.

39
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,200
So both freshmen and sophomores are here.

40
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,390
Everyone look here at this traditional architectural structure.

41
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,530
This will be renovated for commercial use.

42
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,900
For our architectural department, the renovation of old structures

43
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,800
is an important opportunity for research.

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,970
When you do your surveys in a moment, you should pay careful attention.

45
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,930
What should you pay attention to? Does anyone know?

46
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,600
Think about the problem of how to

47
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,480
maintain tradition and creation. Do you understand?

48
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,400
In addition, tomorrow there will be a small scale demolition.

49
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,620
So everyone try your best to complete the survey today.

50
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,700
Groups of two.

51
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,520
I will collect them before the Dragon Boat Festival Holiday.

52
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,930
Give us a little more time.

53
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,000
What are you saying?

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,660
One by one, tell me. What do you want to say? You?

55
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,880
Okay, enough. Get into your groups.

56
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,530
Hurry. Hurry up.

57
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,050
Make your groups and begin your surveys.

58
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,650
Younian, you and I can be a group.

59
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,500
What are you doing?

60
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,600
- Huh?
- I'm helping my partner.

61
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,590
- Let's go.
- All right.

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,550
What's up with you?

63
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,810
What do you mean?

64
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,290
You're half dead.

65
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,960
No, I'm not.

66
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,900
What do you mean no? You've measured that door frame three times.

67
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,030
Okay. Don't do the measuring. Come over here and help hold the ladder.

68
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,760
Why did you put your pencil behind your ear?

69
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,860
You look like an old guy.

70
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,330
I don't like other people touching me.

71
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,680
Uh... I'm sorry. That's not targeting you.

72
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,200
It's all right.

73
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,790
I'm really sorry.

74
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,360
I'm really okay. If you keep saying that, then I'll be mad.

75
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,650
Be careful, Younian!

76
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,820
Are you all right?

77
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,210
Give me the ruler.

78
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,980
Xia Miaomiao!

79
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,570
- I said, give me the ruler!
- Okay.

80
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,800
Have you lost your wits? Exactly, what's with you?

81
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,000
I already said it's nothing.

82
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,990
Senior Sister, what happened to you?

83
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,180
I twisted my ankle and I can't walk.

84
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,340
Are you all right?

85
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm all right. Younian is bringing me to the hospital to take a look.

86
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,890
Xia Miaomiao.

87
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,700
Here.

88
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,360
Help me give the tools to the teacher.

89
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,260
Xia Miaomiao.

90
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,540
Here.

91
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,740
Help me give the tools to the teacher.

92
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,600
Who are we waiting for?

93
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,470
I called Da Chao.

94
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,830
How are you? Are you okay?

95
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,700
Do you need an amputation?

96
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,030
Why don't you get one?

97
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,540
So what did the doctor say?

98
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,690
Try not to put weight on it and use a cold compress often.

99
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,200
Change the medicine three times a week. Stay away from water.

100
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,170
Wait, wait. Let me record it. What?

101
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,560
Cold... cold compress.

102
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,000
Change the medicine three times a week.

103
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,330
Change the medicine three times a week. Did you just say one time? Three times, one time...

104
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,150
Change the medicine once a week, no physical exercise, and don't touch water.

105
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,920
Remember to go back for consultations.

106
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,630
Go back for consultations.

107
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,300
- All right. Then let's go.
- Okay.

108
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,250
Let's go.

109
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,620
You guys go ahead.

110
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,280
I need to go back to the model classroom to arrange today's survey data.

111
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,700
All right. Thank you for today.

112
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,870
It's nothing. Go back and recover.

113
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,480
Don't come back to finish the practice survey. I'll sync it for you.

114
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,500
All right

115
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,470
Then, when you're making the chart, I'll help more with that.

116
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,080
Enough, let's go. I'll help you.

117
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,920
Bye-bye.

118
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,550
You scared me!

119
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,700
What's wrong now?

120
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,190
Is it because of Younian and Xiaoyue?

121
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,910
I saw them, too.

122
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,630
Didn't you attend the elective course together?

123
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,870
All of a sudden, why have they become so close?

124
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,960
What happened?

125
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,360
Raise your head.

126
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,460
Fox Fei is staring at you.

127
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,220
Maybe she's cross-eyed.

128
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,420
Senior Sister, what happened to your ankle?

129
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,460
It's nothing, I just sprained it.

130
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,940
Senior Sister.

131
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,650
I just saw you it was Senior Younian who helped you back.

132
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,390
How sweet. Are you two—

133
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,510
No, no! Don't talk nonsense.

134
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,570
You two looked so sweet; yet you still won't admit it.

135
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,720
Can it be that you won't tell us until you're already married?

136
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,880
It's really not so.

137
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,310
- Help me go wash my hands, will you?
- Okay.

138
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,010
Miaomiao, let's go.

139
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,140
Didn't you say that you would run with me?

140
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,550
I am so determined to lose weight this time!

141
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,060
It's all right.

142
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,990
It's alright, it's alright.

143
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,450
How can you eat, when she's like this?

144
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,080
She's been like this for the past few days.

145
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,480
It's not like you didn't know.

146
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,020
But I feel that she's getting worse day by day.

147
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,600
Can you two stop talking?

148
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,280
All right, don't be sad.

149
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,620
Xiaoyue got injured.

150
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,630
It is quite normal that Liang Younian took care of her.

151
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,470
I know that it's normal, but I still feel sad.

152
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,380
Senior Sister is clearly hurt; and she didn't do it on purpose.

153
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,620
But I feel really sad, seeing Senior taking care of her.

154
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,430
I... I'm feel like I'm starting to hate Senior Sister a little bit.

155
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,990
Am I being too selfish?

156
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,530
You can't really say that.

157
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,360
Who doesn't have thoughts like that?

158
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,680
But I know it's not right.

159
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,370
Everyone is selfish when they have someone they like.

160
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,270
Isn't that right, He Xin?

161
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,750
Actually, when I saw Lin Kaituo on stage with you before,

162
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,350
Kaituo was so devoted that

163
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,730
I thought that he and you...

164
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,720
I felt very sad, too.

165
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,460
But I-I’ve already self-reflected and I'm back to normal now.

166
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,860
What were you thinking?

167
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,780
How could Lin Kaituo and I be a couple?

168
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,610
I want to live longer.

169
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,300
If you keep crying like this, you will die soon.

170
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,450
What's wrong with our Kaituo?

171
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,040
My Kaituo is very nice!

172
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,450
My Kaituo will have a prolonged life.

173
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,990
She's crying like that and you're still adding pressure.

174
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,930
All right. Let's sit down and have something to eat.

175
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,170
What is it?

176
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,320
Okay, Aunt. I know.

177
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,260
Don't worry, I will talk to him.

178
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,700
Aunt wants you to go back home during the Dragon Boat Festival for a family photo.

179
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,090
I'm not going back. I'm not your family member.

180
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,420
It's up to you.

181
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,940
I don't want to take photos with you, either.

182
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,860
I don't have the time to plead to you.

183
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,180
Young Master Liang really is so busy.

184
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,900
Busy making all sorts of friends running around with someone on his back.

185
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,260
So loving.

186
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,840
You don't need to ridicule me.

187
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,990
I'm just passing on a message.

188
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,630
I'll just wish you and your family a peaceful and harmonious family picture.

189
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,320
It has nothing to do with me.

190
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,250
You're thinking too much.

191
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,820
I don't intend on taking a family photo, either.

192
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,730
I've already declined it.

193
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,910
I can't believe Young Master Liang would give up the chance to be a dutiful son.

194
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,210
I don't want to waste time talking to you.

195
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,970
I have to go back to finish my survey maps.

196
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,300
After all, my assignment is really important.

197
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,450
I need to secure my first place.

198
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,820
Who says you will take the first place?

199
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,510
If I don't get first place, would it be you?

200
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,970
Just you wait and see. I will be first this time for sure.

201
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,000
Anyone can bluff. Why don't we make a bet?

202
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,960
Bet on what?

203
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,020
The loser will go home for the family photo.

204
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,400
Then wait and see your photo to be hung on the wall.

205
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,830
Your photo may be put on the night stand.

206
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,530
Wait and see.

207
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,660
Thank god, everything is here.

208
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,860
Senior?

209
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,090
Why did you come?

210
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,030
I sent Xiaoyue to the hospital last night.

211
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,630
The data was only half done.

212
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,050
I still need to finish the uncalculated data.

213
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,000
You didn't clear this up yesterday?

214
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,900
Yes. Sorry, Senior.

215
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,240
That's all right.

216
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,830
You gather up this stuff. I'll gather Xiaoyue's.

217
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,830
Hey, hey.

218
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,970
Yesterday, Xiaoyue got hurt because of this tripod.

219
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,210
Let me help you.

220
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,810
No need.

221
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,010
I'll leave the rest of the work to you. I am leaving.

222
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,690
Xia Miaomiao!

223
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,820
It's going to rain soon.

224
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,290
Xia Miaomiao, come to the library to draw the survey map at 9 a.m.

225
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,880
It was all just acting.

226
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,220
If you take it seriously, you will lose. You can't lose.

227
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,210
Xia Miaomiao, come to the library to draw the survey map at 9 a.m.

228
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,690
I am not at school, and I don't know when I will be back.

229
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,680
Don't wait for me.

230
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
What's wrong, Senior?

231
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,790
Remember to ask your mom for 300 yuan ($43 USD), for English Weekly.

232
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,030
Isn't it 200 yuan ($28 USD)?

233
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,730
We need to get the money for basketball.

234
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,510
Have you forgotten about it? Da Chao and I both asked for 300 yuan.

235
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,500
My mother is very sharp. It would be better if I ask her directly

236
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,100
Let's get going. It's about to rain.

237
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,540
Designer Chen is still inside the building.

238
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,030
What happened? I don't know, either.

239
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,010
The bearing wall collapsed. You can't go inside.

240
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,790
English Weekly Fees Notice

241
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,610
Are you okay?

242
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,310
Are you okay?

243
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,700
Is... is everything all right?

244
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,180
It's fine.

245
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,550
It's just that the noise at the construction site is a bit loud.

246
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,330
It's all right, it's all right.

247
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,830
Don't be scared. Don't be scared. It's all right.

248
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,210
It's nothing. Well... the rain will stop soon.

249
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,690
Let's just ignore the sound, okay?

250
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:44,540
Sorry, I didn't intend on doing that. I just wanted to help you.

251
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,840
Listen to this. It will screen out the sound from the outside.

252
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,450
Xia Miaomiao.

253
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,630
She doesn't reply to my messages. What's wrong with her?

254
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,790
Does she want to finish the survey assignment or not?

255
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:28,260
It's really troublesome to be Xia Miaomiao's partner.

256
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,130
It's occupied.

257
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,950
Who?

258
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,230
Did you go swimming?

259
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,630
How can you find me no matter where I am?

260
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,910
Because you are my GPS.

261
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,470
Who is this seat reserved for?

262
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,030
Its none of your business..

263
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,630
Is it... Xia Miaomiao?

264
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,550
I am in the same survey group as her. I want her to draw the maps.

265
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,980
I didn't expect that you would give me an explanation.

266
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,990
Be quiet, please.

267
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,260
What do you think of Xia Miaomiao?

268
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,090
Stupid and lazy.

269
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,390
Do you think she is delicate and innocent?

270
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,950
Not even close! I want to beat her myself.

271
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,180
Don't beat her. She is my best friend.

272
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,400
All right. I am going out for the interview.

273
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,840
Take this.

274
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,750
Ah, here you go. A return gift.

275
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,720
You know that I am obsessive with numbers, right?

276
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:48,580
My mother was killed by a collapse from a construction site.

277
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,120
Because the data engineer did not calculate the data correctly.

278
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,790
So I'm always thinking that if one day,

279
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:04,380
I become an architect, will I be able to

280
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,780
reduce such tragedies?

281
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,110
You will.

282
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,820
You definitely will.

283
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:22,620
The library is closing in two minutes. Why did you bother coming?

284
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:28,790
You said if I don't show up before the closing, you would kill me.

285
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,380
Sorry, I didn't know that my message failed to send.

286
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:40,780
Xia Miaomiao, if you fail to show up before the librar closing, I will kill you.

287
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,550
Take this back for the research. We will do a 3-D model tomorrow.

288
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,320
3D model?

289
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,990
But we were asked to do make 2D drawings for this assignment.

290
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,360
We can only win with 3D model.

291
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,440
What do you mean?

292
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,630
Don't worry. Just do what I tell you. Go back and take a good look at this.

293
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,800
It's a sophomore-level course. How can I accomplish this task?

294
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:20,160
3D modeling is really difficult. It took me 3 days to understand my part of the work.

295
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,730
It's because your IQ is low. I figured it out in three hours.

296
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,820
Senior Sister. Senior.

297
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,250
Good morning.

298
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,600
Miaomiao, where are you guys going?

299
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,540
We are going to draw maps in the library.

300
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,050
Is that so? We are going to the modeling room to draw the maps.

301
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,530
We'll get going then.

302
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,910
Bye-bye. Good luck!

303
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,310
Look here

304
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,940
The length here and the length here needs to be measured.

305
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,560
Here.

306
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,280
Thank you.

307
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,340
It's done!

308
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,150
Really?

309
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,750
Terrace Classroom

310
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,050
Everyone did very well for the mapping activity.

311
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,040
But the most outstanding one is

312
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,820
Second year, Classmate Fang Xiaoyue and first year, Classmate Xia Miaomiao.

313
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,980
Even though Fang Xiaoyue was injured this time, she did a good job completing her homework.

314
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,710
And the calculation portion that Xiao Miaomiao was in charge of

315
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,120
were so precise that I was surprised.

316
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,930
Teacher Li, just reveal the results. Who is first place?

317
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:29,750
You're that anxious? Okay, the person who got first place is

318
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,590
Liang Younian and Fang Xiaoyue's group.

319
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:42,020
Why? Our group used the move intuitive 3D method to do the drawing.

320
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,530
The project this time was to use 2D drawings.

321
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:47,440
You have to remember the objective of the project.

322
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,730
The main mode of architectural display

323
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:54,230
now is 3D modeling. Aren't you too outdated?

324
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,680
Lin Kaituo.

325
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:01,470
In the future, if you don't draw according to Party A's guidelines,

326
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,220
then the results of the project bidding will help you understand

327
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,190
whether you right now is too over confident

328
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,380
or if I'm too old fashioned.

329
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,220
Okay, let's continue the lecture.

330
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,220
Class...

331
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,310
- Family portrait.
- Open your books to page 49.

332
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,070
- Family portrait.
- Open your books to page 49.

333
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,630
- Right, Lin Kaituo just reminded us. During the mid-term exam,
 - I got praised by the teacher

334
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:34,560
- be sure to read the requirements.
- Let's celebrate later.

335
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,280
Okay? Let's continue the lecture.

336
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,180
Your way of celebrating is to borrow the fashion major's books?

337
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,180
Yes, I even invited you to drink water.

338
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,720
It's so suffocating. In order to do well on the mapping assignment,

339
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,230
it has been ages since I have read fashion design books.

340
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,810
If you like fashion design so much,

341
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,710
why don't you change majors?

342
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,960
Change majors? Who wants to change majors?

343
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,870
Is it you, Miaomiao?

344
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,080
I... haven't considered this yet.

345
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,270
Consider it now.

346
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:23,580
If I change majors, my mom will get angry.

347
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,790
First, don't worry about whether your mom will get angry or not.

348
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,590
I'll tell you honestly.

349
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:34,190
Your fashion designs are better than some of the students in our major.

350
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:38,040
Teacher, why are you mocking me.

351
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,290
- Do you like fashion design or not?
- I like it.

352
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:46,850
Then I really urge you to seriously consider changing majors.

353
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,230
I will consider it.

354
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,230
Give me an answer after the Dragon Boat Festival.

355
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,980
Ah... that quickly?

356
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,600
Otherwise, what?

357
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,780
Wait until you've graduated?

358
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,670
You have to make decisions quickly, precisely and fiercely.

359
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:06,180
The longer you drag it on, the more you'll feel indecisive.

360
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,900
Don't read these books. I'll give you some.

361
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,720
Read this one instead, this one is more meaningful.

362
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,680
I'm telling you. I didn't even let other students in our major read this.

363
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,140
- Teacher!
- I'm lying.

364
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,430
Thank you, Teacher.

365
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,270
Let's continue.

366
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,520
You really haven't read this before?

367
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,060
Hurry and read it.

368
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,980
You wanna look?

369
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,960
Senior probably isn't here.

370
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,850
Teacher Liang

371
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,920
I'm bringing over some zongzi.
(Traditional rice dish eaten during Dragon Boat Festival).

372
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,400
That's great.

373
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,230
Miaomaio, the zongzi your family makes are too delicious.

374
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,910
I've already ordered them many times.

375
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,730
Thank you, Teacher Liang.

376
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,080
- Then I'll be going first.
- Okay.

377
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,270
Wait a second.

378
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:18,930
Wait a second. Everyone, stop for a moment.

379
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,910
Those inside, come out for a second.

380
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:25,750
This is your Senior Sister, student Xia Miaomiao.

381
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,940
When she first came to the art club,

382
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,080
her techniques were especially poor.

383
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,070
In your words, her skills were a bit lame.

384
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:38,300
However, under my diligent mentoring,

385
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,070
and through her own efforts,

386
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:43,450
she got into Haicheng University's architecture major.

387
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:50,210
So even if you feel like drawing is very difficult, don't give up so easily.

388
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,100
You have to keep on trying.

389
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,960
Of course, there's a not to learn from

390
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,610
a genius like Liang Younian.

391
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:03,830
Everyone has to learn more from this hard-working style.

392
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,680
Teacher, stop complimenting me. I'm getting embarrassed.

393
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,220
What's there to be embarrassed about? Younian and you are both university students now.

394
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,190
You're definitely role models for their studies.

395
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,880
No, I'm not.

396
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,670
Continue drawing.

397
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,900
Draw well.

398
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,480
Oh, right, Miaomiao. Let me ask you something.

399
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,020
Do you have many interactions with Younian at school?

400
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:31,380
Is Younian seeing someone lately?

401
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,570
Eh... I don't know.

402
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:41,100
This kid seems quite different this time around.

403
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,690
One day, his phone kept on going off.

404
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:48,240
I took a look and it was a girl with the last name Fang. Do you know her?

405
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:56,550
I don't usually contact Senior often.

406
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:03,230
That's true, since one is in first year and one is in second year.

407
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,070
I... have to get going now, Teacher.

408
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,150
- I'll come see you another day.
- Okay, see you.

409
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:33,950
Younian, come here. Sit down.

410
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,950
Try this zongzi, it's really good.

411
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:50,580
Younian, you're already in your second year now.

412
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:54,560
Let me ask you, are there any changes lately?

413
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,560
Changes? What changes?

414
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:03,340
I mean, is there any girl you like

415
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,930
I mean, is there any girl you like

416
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,700
with the last name of Fang?

417
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,530
No.

418
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,260
This child...

419
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,590
Will he be like his mom and only realize his feelings

420
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,870
in hindsight?

421
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,150
- Oh, you're back?
- Yeah.

422
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,950
Business is so good today, why are we closing?

423
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,640
There's a Dragon Boat Festival promotion at a photo studio nearby.

424
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,250
I'm bringing your mom for make-up wedding photos.

425
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,810
- Wedding photos?
- Yeah.

426
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,620
What's wrong?

427
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,900
We've been married for so long,

428
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,670
and we already have two kids, yet we don't even have wedding photos.

429
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,160
Our circumstances weren't good before.

430
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,250
Aren't I making it up to you now?

431
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,810
Let's go, let's go.

432
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,790
Carry my bag.

433
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,180
We're going as well.

434
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,030
- I'm going, too?
- To be a flower girl.

435
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,590
I'm too old for that.

436
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,000
Let's go.

437
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,870
Thank you.

438
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,250
Take a look.

439
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:29,560
Do you think Kaituo will come?

440
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,080
Didn't Younian say that he'll come?

441
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,740
You're so sure?

442
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:43,110
With Kaituo's personality, I keep on feeling like he won't come.

443
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:48,080
How about we wait a little longer?

444
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,980
Have some water.

445
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:56,510
Kaituo! You're here!

446
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,300
See? He came.

447
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,880
Could the two of you please come with me to get changed?

448
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,910
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

449
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:08,310
Kaituo, wait here for a bit.

450
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,370
Wait for me, okay?

451
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,810
