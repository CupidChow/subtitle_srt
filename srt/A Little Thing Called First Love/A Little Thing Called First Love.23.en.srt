[A Little Thing Called First Love]

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,600
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,200
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,200
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,200
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,600
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,600
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,200
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,600
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,200
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,000
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,600
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,000
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,200
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,000
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,200
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

Episode 23

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,300
No.

28
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,100
Throw it up higher! Higher!

29
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,000
It's okay. I will pick it up for you.

30
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Teacher Lu?

31
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,000
Why is it you?

32
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,900
Lu Peng said he can't come.

33
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,150
Why are you following me?

34
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,870
This field is so big. How do you know if I'm following you?

35
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay. Fine, I will let you go first.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,000
It's just that don't you already have a reservation for that restaurant yet?

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
How can you even mention this to me, your EQ is so low.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,400
Why do you always think the worst of me?

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,200
I'll do as I like.

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,600
Erm... Teacher Jia... I think that...

41
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,700
Don't stop practicing.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,600
Do you think it is possible that

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,900
they like each other but aren't aware of it yet?

44
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,200
That's impossible.

45
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,400
How can there be someone so silly?

46
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,200
Here.

47
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,000
Won't you help me get down? My foot hurts a lot.

48
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,810
I will see you later when I've finished my interview.

49
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,980
He Xin's foot isn't hurt. She put the bandage on herself.

50
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,100
If you don't believe it, just take it apart and see for yourself.

51
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,600
He Xin!

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,660
It's just a short interview.

53
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,900
I won't make you wait long.

54
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,400
Is your foot really hurt?

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,740
Yes.

56
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,850
You know I hate people who lie to me.

57
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,200
You can get back by yourself.

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,600
Senior.

60
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,000
- Are you having lunch here alone?
- Yes.

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,600
A Xia returned to the dorm to put something away.

62
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,100
Hello, Xin Xin.

63
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,400
I'm at the bus stop near the welfare house.

64
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,610
Can you come and save me?

65
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,000
I forgot to bring my wallet.

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,600
Okay.

67
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,430
What happened to you?

68
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,110
Lin Katuo found out that I lied to him about my leg.

69
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,600
We'll talk about it later. You come over first.

70
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,300
Okay.

71
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,200
Xin Xin forgot to bring her wallet and so I'm going to pick her up.

72
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,000
It's getting late.

73
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,200
Let me go with you.

74
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,400
Xin Xin, get in the car.

75
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,900
Xin Xin, get in.

76
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,400
Move inside.

77
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,000
Let my love surround you,

78
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,400
like the light of the sun, bringing you splendid freedom.

79
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,800
Good evening, everybody. I'm Ge Zi.

80
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,600
I welcome everyone who has tuned in to "So It Was You" sentimental music channel.

81
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,400
If you like my program, please subscribe to my album.

82
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,600
Every program is prepared with care.

83
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,600
Xin Xin, are you all right?

84
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,600
Do you think Kaituo will treat me the same way as you now?

85
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,640
Don't worry. He can put up with you.

86
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
Put up with me?

87
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,000
It's a rare thing for two people to meet each other.

88
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,400
It's the best thing when two people fall in love.

89
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Meeting up is God's will.

90
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,600
What you have is happiness.

91
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,400
I wish someone would give you love

92
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
and accompany you to places to see the view.

93
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,200
Do you think Kaituo will ignore me forever?

94
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,600
Do you think it will work if I wait outside his dorm for him?

95
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,200
Or maybe I could ask Aunt for help.

96
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,100
He's not returning my messages. What should I do?

97
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,600
Should I write letters to him?

98
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
But he might not read the letters either.

99
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,400
But he might not read the letters either.

100
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,800
I'm done for.

101
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,800
Think about it.

102
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,200
Do you really see Xia Miaomiao as a sister?
♫ Can you see my heart? Can you read my mind? ♫

103
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,800
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

104
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,200
♫ I want you by my side... ♫

105
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,000
It's 9:30 p.m., Beijing time.
♫ Always watching over ♫

106
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,600
Dear listeners, please be more patient.
♫ My heart... ♫

107
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,200
At 9:30 p.m.,

108
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,000
I can confirm that I have fallen for Xia Miaomiao.
♫ My heart ♫

109
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,500
♫ Restlessly beats whenever I see you ♫

110
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:26,400
♫ I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

111
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,600
I knew you could do it.

112
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,200
- One more time!
- Okay.

113
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,400
♫ I can't find a way ♫

114
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,000
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

115
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
♫ I want to give it up ♫

116
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,100
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

117
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,600

♫ At every moment... ♫

147
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,000
Liang Younain took some nice pictures.

148
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You're so smart. By asking Liang Younain to take pictures of Miaomiao,

149
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,600
I thought he wouldn't agree, and I didn't expect him to agree at once.

150
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,000
Did you know that I was so nervous when I saw his camera facing me

151
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
that I didn't even know where to put my hands?

152
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,600
Why did Liang Younain take a picture of this, too?

153
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Miaomiao, look at your bangs and hairline. It's so funny.

154
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,200
Delete it. Send it to me!

155
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,600
No way.

156
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,600
- Xinxin!
- All right, it's deleted.

157
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,400
Xia Miaomiao, when exactly are you sending the dog away?

158
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,000
Like I said before, we'll send it away when we've found someone that will adopt it.

159
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,270
How long has it been now?

160
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,490
I say you're doing this on purpose.

161
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,800
The dog must be sent away by today.

162
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,070
Why do we have to send it off today?

163
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,000
it's not only you that's staying here.

164
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The puppy is tame and it won't annoy you.

165
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,800
Could you please let it stay here for a while?

166
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,800
You don't have to talk to her so much. She's just jealous of you.

167
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,400
You stole her place during the Sports day.

168
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,300
That's right.

169
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Okay, Niannian. It's fine.

170
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,800
That's just the way that sister talks. We won't bother with her. Okay?

171
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Niannian? What kind of name is that?

172
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,300
It's named after Liang Younain.

173
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,000
I haven't reconciled with Lin Kaituo yet.

174
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,400
But you and Lian Younian already have a dog now.

175
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,370
Liang Younain really took some nice pictures.

176
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
He said he wasn't good at taking portraits.

177
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,500
But the photos he took of her are so pretty.

178
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,800
- Xin Xin.
- Yes?

179
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,800
As a professional, could you tell me if

180
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,000
the photos taken by Liang Younain of Miaomiao

181
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,400
seem affectionate?

182
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,000
- I feel the same way too after listening to you.
- Right.

183
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm very envious. When will Kaituo take pictures like these of me?

184
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,200
You should try to get him to talk to you first.

185
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,400
Whose motorbike is parked here?

186
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Hey, what's wrong with you?

187
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,900
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do this.

188
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,530
Kaituo.

189
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,400
Aren't you doing business out of town? Why are you back?

190
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,000
Are you doing a delivery job?

191
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,800
No, I'm not. This bike isn't mine.

192
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,100
Are you looking for me?

193
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,600
No, I'm not.

194
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,570
I don't know.

195
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,900
It's good. It's good.

196
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,200
You've gotten admitted into Haicheng University.

197
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,400
That's very promising.

198
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,200
So... you weren't looking for me?

199
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,200
I have a business deal and had an appointment with someone nearby.

200
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,200
I will leave first. I will see you another time.

201
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,800
Dad, can I get your mobile number?

202
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,800
Mom

203
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Liang Younain, originally, I had the highest hope for you in this competition,

204
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,700
but I didn't expect you to keep making the same mistakes during the preliminary.

205
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,600
To be honest, I'm quite disappointed.

206
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,200
In your work, all I see is safety.

207
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,600
But I don't see any design. Also, I don't see the passion

208
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,400
a designer should have in their work.

209
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,200
So I'm reminding you again.

210
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,800
Stop amending it over and over again, all those bearing walls and columns.

211
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Focus on the design. Okay?

212
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,600
I understand, Professor.

213
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,000
I'll try my best in the first round of the competition.

214
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,700
Good. Keep it up.

215
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,100
Design Scheme

216
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,800
Why should we design a children's park?

217
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,400
It's only a week away. If it weren't for Fang Group Corporation sponsoring this competition

218
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,600
and that If we win the prize, or have a chance to intern there, I really want to quit.

219
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,800
Just quit.

220
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,200
Then I will have one less opponent.

221
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,000
Anyway, I'm not on the same standard as you.

222
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,200
But it's unexpected that you're not in first place for the preliminary.

223
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,400
How could this happen?

224
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,200
You must be obsessed with the calculations for the load-bearing data again.

225
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,600
Do you have some trauma?

226
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
Kaituo.

227
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,600
Your mom just called the dorm, saying you didn't answer her call. She asked that you call back.

228
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,500
I already did.

229
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,600
Kaituo.

230
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,200
Aunt asked if you're coming home this weekend?

231
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,400
Why should I go home?

232
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,500
Aunt wants to celebrate our qualification for the preliminary.

233
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,400
When have you seen me going home for no reason?

234
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,100
This junior of yours,

235
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,000
why does he always look so pissed off, whenever he sees you?

236
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,390
Maybe he's jealous of me?

237
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,600
Let's go for lunch.

238
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,000
No. I'm going back to the model room to continue my work.

239
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,400
Okay. Well, you really do need to get rid of your obsession.

240
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,800
Otherwise, you won't even make the first round.

241
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,900
Don't jinx it, keep your mouth shut.

242
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
I'll draw here. Pass me the ruler.

243
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
- Here take this.
- Okay.

244
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Give it to me.

245
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,600
Which one do you want?

246
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,200
Both.

247
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,100
Give them to me.

248
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,400
It scratched my hand.

249
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,600
Where?

250
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,800
- See for it yourself.
- Let me see. It's fine.

251
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,400
Let me see.

252
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Blow on it for me.

253
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,200
Get over here.

254
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,800
Don't leave. Stay.

255
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,600
Stay and wait for Xiaoyue with me.

256
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,000
Here. I got you some water.

257
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,400
You wait here by yourself. I need to go somewhere quiet to do my drawings.

258
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,000
You and your drawings! Is that the only thing you do now?

259
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,600
Is there even any money in it?

260
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,400
You are a junior now. If you don't get your butt in the game,

261
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,200
you will die a virgin.

262
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,600
You know what this contest means to me.

263
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,000
And what about Xia Miaomiao? She's not important?

264
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'll figure it out.

265
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,400
How? You've never chased a girl.

266
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,000
I have my own ideas.

267
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,600
Stay and wait for Xiaoyue with me!

268
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,400
Kaituo!

269
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,500
Xin Xin, what are you doing here?

270
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Begging Kaituo to forgive me.

271
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,900
Come back later, after class.

272
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,200
No. I need him to know my sincerity.

273
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,200
That's the most important thing in a relationship.

274
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,400
Forget it. You wouldn't understand. Why am I talking to you about it?

275
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
What makes you think I wouldn't understand?

276
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,000
Since small, you were always the one getting confessed to by girls.

277
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,100
What do you know?

278
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,400
But when you meet a girl you like, will you tell her?

279
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,500
I will.

280
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,000
Tell me. If you've met someone you like now,

281
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,300
how will you tell her?

282
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,600
I'll wait for the right moment.

283
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,800
And when is that?

284
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,600
The me that's ready is the best time.

285
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,400
Ready? I thought you were getting yourself ready for the contest.

286
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,200
Yes.

287
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,000
See you later. Good luck.

288
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,540
I never know what that guy is talking about.

289
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,600
It is as if he actually likes someone, though.

290
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,500
Can you please snack somewhere else?

291
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,600
You'll get it all over my fabrics.

292
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,400
All right.

293
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,670
A Xia, can I borrow your chalk?

294
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,800
I ordered some myself but they're not here yet.

295
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,720
Didn't you order it a week ago?

296
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,800
What is taking so long?

297
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,200
No idea.

298
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,600
I checked for like a hundred times online.

299
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,200
I told you not to order it online.

300
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,600
But the packaging is so cute.

301
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,400
You are so cheap with everything else.

302
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
When it comes to fabrics, you pay through the nose.

303
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,000
Is this expensive? How much a meter?

304
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,600
About ¥200 ($30 USD) a meter.

305
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,400
So expensive! And you bought so much!

306
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,100
Stop touching it. You're getting oil on it.

307
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,300
I just want the result to be perfect.

308
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,200
You are not thinking of making it a perfect match for the shirt, are you?

309
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,400
Of course, I am.

310
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,200
You are spending too much on your Senior.

311
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,200
I left a stain on his shirt.

312
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,600
I wonder if he will like this or not.

313
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,200
Who wouldn't like their shirts tailor-made for them?

314
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,400
When do you plan to give it to him?

315
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,200
I don't know. I haven't seen him lately.

316
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,000
He is busy preparing for the design contest.
[Mei You (Female Health App)]

317
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I don't want to distract him.

318
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,300
- Maybe he wants you to distract him.
- Pardon?

319
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,600
Nothing... just hurry up.

320
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,400
We have to feed Niannian or else he'll start barking like crazy again.

321
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,100
All right.

322
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,800
Come on out.

323
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,400
Little Niannian.

324
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,600
You be good and stay here till things quiet down.

325
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,400
I will come and see you every day.

326
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,000
I will bring you yummy food.

327
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,600
What did you say?

328
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,600
You want to see Senior?

329
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,200
We can't. I told you.

330
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,000
He is busy preparing for the contest.

331
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,600
Be a good boy.

332
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,000
Eat away.

333
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,000
Senior, what brought you here?

334
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,000
I came to draw my design for the contest.

335
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,800
What about you? Why are you here?

336
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,000
The dorm manager is enforcing the no-pet rule.

337
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,400
So I have to hide Nian—

338
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,400
...this little puppy here.

339
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,200
Are you having a hard time with your design?

340
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,600
Still working on those metrics?

341
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,400
Struggling to get over my obsessiveness with the metrics.

342
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,400
But I just can't get it the way I like.

343
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,800
What is the theme?

344
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,300
A kid's amusement park.

345
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,100
I will take care of you for the next few days.

346
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,400
You gave him a name?

347
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,800
Just some random name.

348
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
What is it?

349
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
Niannian.

350
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,800
Because... he’s very clingy.
(Nian has same pronunciation as the word for cling)

351
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,000
See? He just snuggles down in your lap.

352
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,810
Niannian.

353
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,020
A cute name.

354
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,600
What's your plan for Niannian?

355
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,400
You can't keep raising him here on the rooftop.

356
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,400
I was thinking of bringing him home this weekend so my mom can help take care of him.

357
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,000
You're going to just suddenly bring a dog home?

358
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,100
Won't she be mad at you?

359
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,300
I don't know.

360
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,100
She won't be, I think.

361
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,600
Universities in Hai City came together for the intercollegiate games.

362
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,800
A major yearly athletic event in the city.

363
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,900
The opening ceremony was held at the Haicheng University.

364
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,600
That's my daughter's school!

365
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,200
Let's take a look at the jubilant gathering.

366
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,800
The ceremony began with the athletes marching into the arena.

367
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,000
Yaoyao! Sit here.

368
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,200
Here come the athletes for the Haicheng University of Technology.

369
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,800
They are followed by Haicheng University.

370
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,000
They are the host of the games.

371
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,600
They walk in an interesting formation.

372
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,400
Leading the team is Xia Miaomiao, a perky Fashion Design major in her sophomore year.

373
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,200
You hear that? Xia Miaomiao, Fashion Design! Your sister!

374
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,000
That's my daughter, everyone!

375
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,400
Wait, what major did he say?

376
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,010
Fashion Design.

377
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,800
Why is the door stuck?

378
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,400
Faulty lock. Once it shuts, you won't be able to open it.

379
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,600
How can it be faulty?

380
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,800
It always has been.

381
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
How do we leave then?

382
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,000
No way to leave.

383
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,800
We have to think of something.

384
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,090
I have asked my roommates to find the key.

385
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,800
How long do we have to wait?

386
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,000
Are you in a hurry?

387
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,600
Not really.

388
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
It's just...

389
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,300
What?

390
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,300
I have a parcel being delivered and it could be here any minute.

391
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,800
All right, don't worry.

392
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,500
My roommates say someone is looking for the key now.

393
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,400
Senior, on television shows when they encounter such a situation,

394
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,400
the door opens when someone uses their body to smash into it.

395
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,200
I think this door should be pretty thin.

396
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,600
- Why don't—
- I don't want to.

397
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,700
Are you afraid of pain? I'm not afraid.

398
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,400
In the past, when you talked to me, you were quite careful.

399
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,000
Now, you're starting to tease me.

400
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,700
What are you doing?

401
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
I'm unlocking it, so you can get your delivery.

402
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,500
Can you open it this way?

403
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,600
Senior, you're amazing!

404
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,000
But why didn't you open the door earlier?

405
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,700
So are you leaving or not?

406
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,400
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

407
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,580
I finally received my delivery!

408
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,030
- You're this happy about receiving a delivery?
- Right.

409
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,580
Receiving deliveries is my happiness.

410
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,200
Here.

411
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,400
I got your delivery too when I was getting mine.

412
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,100
Thank you.

413
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,400
The weather has been a bit dry lately.

414
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,500
You need Winona Skin Care.

415
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,800
My parcel...

416
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,600
Where's He Xin?

417
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,700
She went to an interview.

418
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Why do you ask me about where she went?

419
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,800
Did he wake up on the wrong side of the bed?

420
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,600
Isn't he like this all the time?

421
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,100
My chalk!

422
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,250
You deserve it.

423
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,200
There aren't any that are a whole piece anymore.

424
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,000
File a complaint.

425
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,400
Forget it.

426
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,000
If I file a complaint, it'll cause the delivery man's commission to be deducted.

427
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,800
If he didn't do his job well, you have to file a complaint.

428
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,000
If everyone doesn't file a complaint, what will happen to the people in charge of the Complaint Department?

429
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You just need to think that each time you file a complaint, it's for their Complaint Department to continue operating.

430
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,600
This way, you won't feel guilty anymore.

431
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,200
I'll file a complaint for you.

432
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,600
Let's just forget it.

433
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,600
Let me file a complaint against

434
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,300
this delivery man, Lin Weiguo.

435
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,800
Lin who?

436
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,900
Lin Weiguo.

437
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
What's wrong?

438
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,400
Take your time eating.

439
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,600
You better come home this weekend.

440
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,800
You must miss me now.

441
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,200
Niannian. Niannian.

442
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,600
Senior. Senior.

443
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,700
Niannian is missing.

444
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,100
Niannian.

445
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,600
Niannian.

446
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,300
What are you thinking about? Why did you come?

447
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,600
That...

448
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,600
Senior, do you have time?

449
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,400
I want to take you somewhere.

450
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
You want to take me somewhere?

451
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,000
It's not some weird place. Don't be scared.

452
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,600
I'm not saying that you'd be scared.

453
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,400
It's just that...

454
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,200
This is not a date.

455
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,400
Of course, it's not a date.

456
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,600
Didn't you say something about the design competition?

457
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,400
Anyway, we're not going there to play around.

458
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,100
- You're not leaving yet?
- What?

459
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,800
So you were talking about taking me to an amusement park?

460
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,800
Yeah! Didn't you talk about how you didn't have any inspiration when it came to designing a children's amusement park?

461
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,200
I wanted to take you to do an in-person survey.

462
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,800
Don't you think the architectural color is quite unique?

463
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,000
It is quite pretty.

464
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,600
Senior, what do you like to play on? Pirate Ship?

465
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,600
Or Bungee Jump?

466
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,600
Wait, no.

467
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,600
We are not here for fun. We are here to study the architectural style.

468
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,800
A Xia.

469
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,300
- Miaomiao, hurry up and come back. 
- What's wrong?

470
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,400
The school officials are taking action on stray animals.

471
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,300
- Hurry up and come back to take Niannian away to somewhere else.
- What?

472
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,000
What's wrong?

473
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,800
I'm afraid we have to call it a day.

474
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,400
A Xia said the school is getting rid of any stray animals all of a sudden. I have to get back there now.

475
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,600
How about you take a look around by yourself?

476
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,000
What am I saying?

477
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
How can I leave you alone? I brought you here.

478
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,600
It's fine. We can just come again another time.

479
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,790
Why don't I buy you a balloon? That way we didn't waste our time coming here today.

480
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,800
I'm done.

481
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,610
Get on the bike.

A Little Thing Called First Love

484
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,200
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

485
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,800
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

486
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:52,400
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

487
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,000
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

488
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
♫ My heart... ♫

489
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:14,020
♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

490
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:26,090
♫ I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

491
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,390
♫ Regarding what love feels like ♫

492
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,600
♫ I've only heard about it from friends ♫

493
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:42,800
♫ I never thought about when it would be my turn ♫

494
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,000
♫ You are so dazzling and outstanding ♫

495
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
♫ I'm just a faint breeze blowing ♫

496
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,800
♫ But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

497
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,000
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

498
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,800
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

499
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:07,200
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

500
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,800
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

501
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,400
♫ My heart... ♫

502
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:27,500
