00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,260
A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,610
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,060
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,030
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:24,130
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,550
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,060
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,940
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,630
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,620
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,650
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,150
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,640
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,570
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,540
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,050
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,680
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,640
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,150
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,130
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,060
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,600
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,110
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,880
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,090
A Little Thing Called First Love
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,040
Episode 10

27
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,220
My understanding is that everyone's enthusiasm is quite high at this time.

28
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,560
Many students have already prepared multiple sketches

29
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,100
using different themes and color schemes.

30
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,620
There should be many sketches to pick from.

31
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,940
I'm sure everyone is showing their best.

32
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,350
Hand over all your sketches to Lu Jingjing to collect.

33
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,710
Senior Sister.

34
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,810
This time, Kaituo will have to come, won't he?

35
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,240
He's been ignoring me this whole time.

36
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,540
Am I some illness-causing deity?

37
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,580
Architecture Department

38
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,760
- Are you going out, Kaituo?
- Yes.

39
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,260
He Xin

40
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,000
Hello? Kaituo?

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,630
What do you want?

42
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,070
Don't be so fierce.

43
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,140
If you don't say anything, I'm hanging up.

44
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,290
Uh... There's no sound coming from the microphone in the broadcasting room.

45
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,090
Senior Sister wants you to come and have a look.

46
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,970
Is it plugged in?

47
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,310
Yes.

48
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,060
It's plugged in.

49
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,660
Okay, I'll be right over.

50
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,430
Okay, I'll be waiting.

51
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,170
What can I do? I'm really too smart.

52
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,190
The sketches that you've submitted this time

53
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,010
are quite unevenly matched.
(All over the place)

54
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:54,800
We've picked out a couple of sketches that can be painted directly on top of the maintenance manhole covers.

55
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,450
I'll call out the names.

56
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,350
Li Baiyang.

57
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,780
Chai Dao.

58
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,580
Si Munan.

59
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,050
Yes!

60
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,750
Lai Linlin.

61
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,060
Zhao Maizi.

62
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,980
For those who did not have their names called, don't be discouraged.

63
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,660
Before we start, there will be another opportunity to get chosen.

64
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,410
Senior Sister...

65
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:42,050
May I ask if there was something wrong with my sketch?

66
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,240
Actually, I also want to know the reason.

67
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,900
I thought I did quite well.

68
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,090
Okay, then I'll explain to you.

69
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,500
Tang Mengfei's draft drawing is too busy.

70
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,100
While Jing Meng's drawing is too complicated so it will be difficult to paint on a manhole cover.

71
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,420
Xia Miaomiao's draft drawing...

72
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,400
there's nothing special about it.

73
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,680
But those two had problems with their skills,

74
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,210
my problem is a bit vague.

75
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,950
I still don't quite understand.

76
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,600
Younian, why don't you explain it. He's more specialized. (Professional)

77
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,070
Okay.

78
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,320
Your draft was the very first one that I eliminated.

79
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,110
Because if you have a look at it,

80
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,400
you just drew a very simple head.

81
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,510
I could not see any creativity or individuality shown in your sketch.

82
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,530
I don't think this is the standard that would have come from a fine arts artist.

83
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,050
Do you understand?

84
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,210
I understand.

85
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,950
Thank you, Senior.

86
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,020
Ah, okay. I guess I overthought it.

87
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,230
Sorry, if it weren't for me, then you wouldn't be like this.

88
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,320
Eat one.

89
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,230
Okay.

90
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,600
You're so impressive.

91
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,940
You'd only asked if the microphone had been plugged into the outlet

92
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,400
and I said yes. I didn't lie.

93
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,530
Do you think this is fun?

94
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,520
Hey, Kaituo! Why don't we go out and eat together?

95
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,910
We haven't eaten together for a long time.

96
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,480
Kaituo!

97
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,590
I'm really hungry. Let's go out and eat.

98
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,150
Is he trying to lose weight?

99
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,250
Add more white, it'll make it look lighter.

100
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,600
When you've finished, take it over there.

101
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,060
Okay.

102
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,980
Once you've finished the draft, hurry and start painting it on the maintenance cover.

103
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,920
Don't take too long. There's not much time left.

104
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,680
Isn't that your snail?

105
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,640
Yes.

106
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,800
How do you plan on drawing it there?

107
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,820
- After I paint the colors, I want to add a silhouette outline.
- Make it look fuller then.

108
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,320
Okay.

109
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,740
Make the red brighter.

110
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,260
Understood.

111
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Your drawing this time is pretty creative.

112
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,950
Thank you, Senior.

113
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,800
But why is it still Doraemon? Do you like him?

114
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,110
Do you have any sort of sunscreen spray?

115
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,070
- Xia Miaomiao.
- Yes?

116
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,460
Do you have any sunscreen I can spray on?

117
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,570
The sun is killing me. Soon, I'll be as dry as a salted fish.

118
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,880
I don't have any.

119
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,090
Wait a second.

120
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,480
I do have one in my bag.

121
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,680
- Thank you.
- You're welcome

122
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,050
It's really refreshing. Why don't you spray some on?

123
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,810
Looking at you, your skin will begin to peel soon.

124
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,200
It's fine. No need.

125
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,860
Everyone, let's go and take a break in the shade.

126
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,950
Haicheng University

127
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,500
Tang Mengfei is so fair-skinned.

128
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,900
This must be effective.

129
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,700
Xia Miaomiao, Xia Miaomiao

130
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,950
Architecture Department's Xia Miaomiao.

131
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,050
Please come to the Security Office immediately.

132
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,820
Please come to the Security Office immediately.

133
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,430
Li Baiyang, do you know where the Public Security Office is?

134
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,360
I don't.

135
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,150
I'll take you.

136
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,930
Why did you leave home?

137
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,210
I had a fight with Mom.

138
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,860
She told me to scram.

139
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,680
Why did you fight with her again?

140
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,330
Can you please stop throwing tantrums? Hurry up and go home.

141
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,300
She docked my allowance.

142
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,600
I can't go back right now.

143
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,090
If I go home, she'll definitely hit me.

144
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,820
So you think I won't hit you?

145
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,610
You're lucky that I haven't hit you yet.

146
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,630
Senior, sorry about this.

147
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,950
May I take my sister back to the dorm first and then come back to paint the maintenance cover?

148
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,190
Go ahead. Take your time.

149
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,000
As long as you find time to finish it today, it's fine.

150
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,070
Thank you, Senior.

151
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,000
Thank you, Senior.

152
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,160
Yaoyao!

153
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,750
Sister Ah Xia, when will my sister be back?

154
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,550
She'll be back when she finishes.

155
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,150
But you're so old now, why are you still doing the whole "run away from home" thing?

156
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,130
Mind your own business, you're not my sister.

157
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,100
Hey! The person who can mind your business is here.

158
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,480
I'll get some snacks.

159
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,320
Sister, I want to drink some water.

160
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,010
Pardon?

161
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,240
It's hot!

162
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,130
Bringing your family to stay in the dorm and then not even talking quietly,

163
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,600
Aren't you afraid that the dorm manager will check on us?

164
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,220
You blow it yourself.

165
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,550
Uh, you loaned your sunscreen to me earlier.

166
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,240
When I was drawing, I wanted to return it to you.

167
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,620
But I couldn't find you. Thank you.

168
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,300
I've already withdrawn from that Art Society's rotten art event.

169
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,320
Whoa.

170
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,140
You used a lot.

171
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,790
I'm sorry.

172
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,610
That's really taking advantage.

173
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,760
Old witch, who are you talking about?

174
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,020
What? Old witch? Xia Miaomiao!

175
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,440
She called me an old witch.

176
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,050
What did you say?

177
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,660
You're not being taken advantage of.

178
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,050
You're just stingy.

179
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,580
Look at my sister; if she used it all, why is she still so dark?

180
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,690
Sister, don't take anymore valuables from the old witch. I'll buy them for you.

181
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,780
Xia Yaoyao, that's not very polite.

182
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,100
Call me "old witch" again and I'll call the dorm manager and have her kick you out.

183
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,140
It's so dark outside. Let's see where you can go.

184
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,550
Enough. My mom's coming to fetch her tomorrow.

185
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,300
Don't scare her. She won't bother you for very long.

186
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,650
- Yaoyao.
- You're stirring up trouble again?

187
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,590
I didn't. She's the one who bullied my sister first.

188
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,410
"Only I can be mean to my sister."

189
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,320
That's Xia Yaoyao's motto.

190
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,360
Enough, you two. Get ready for bed. Go and wash.

191
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,750
Oh, my ancestors!

192
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,490
Sweetie!

193
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,110
I don't know who this little miser resembles.

194
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,950
I'm like you.

195
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,030
Fiesty.

196
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,860
I just cut up some oranges for you. Have some.

197
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,030
It'll make you beautiful. Here.

198
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,560
Good girl.

199
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,060
Why are you digging all this out?

200
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,590
I want to buy some skincare products for my sister.

201
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,860
Her dormmates always laugh at her for being so tan.

202
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,790
I'm going to buy a bunch of skincare products for her.

203
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,910
True. Say, when other people go to the university,

204
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,680
they get prettier and prettier.

205
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,730
But when your sister goes to university, she gets sunburned.

206
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,950
My beautiful, cute mother,

207
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,790
help me out a bit. (like a sponsor)

208
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,730
My beautiful, cute sweetheart,

209
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,200
I can only help you out with my labor. I'll take you to buy them.

210
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,000
A little miser changing her direction.

211
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,230
Then I'm going to buy my sister the best one.

212
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,040
There's this brand called...

213
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,370
Winona. I've heard it's very good.

214
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,770
Then I'll buy that one.

215
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:17,150
- Okay. Let's get ready and go.
- Okay.

216
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,740
Why are you looking at me?

217
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,760
I suddenly feel like you look different.

218
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,290
You're not playing another one of your cheap tricks on me, are you?

219
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,760
- I know what it is.
- What?

220
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,860
Your skin looks better.

221
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,310
Don't you think her skin looks better?

222
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,850
Really?

223
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,350
It has suddenly turned so pale, it's as if you got a disease.

224
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,730
You're the one that's got a disease.

225
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,150
Have you seen this?

226
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,730
This is the Prinsepia Utilis Reparative Moisturizing Spray that her sister bought for her.

227
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,340
I heard it's great for the skin. She sprays it happily every day.

228
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,850
Really? Then I'll have a try.

229
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,480
What's wrong with you? Stop wasting my spray.

230
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,380
What a waste.

231
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,780
You wasted my spray and even sprayed it into my eyes. You really do have a problem.

232
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,370
The copycat scholar even joined our Cosplay Club.

233
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,260
She's not necessarily copying you. Don't overthink it.

234
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,720
But that's exactly it. You don't even know that

235
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,680
she even secretly bought the same spray as you.

236
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,200
So annoying.

237
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,590
Ah Xia...

238
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,600
I got into the Fine Arts Club.

239
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,950
- Really?
- Yes.

240
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,760
Miaomiao, over here.

241
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,850
Senior.

242
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,530
Senior!

243
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:56,960
Uh, I got into the Fine Arts Club.

244
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,510
I know. I'm the Club President.

245
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,680
Oh... R-Right.

246
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
Heavens! I haven't seen you for a few days.

247
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,850
How did your skin improve so much? Hurry up and tell me.

248
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,800
You're exaggerating.

249
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,840
I'm not exaggerating. Your skin is so much nicer.

250
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,920
If you don't believe me, ask him. Liang Younian, look.

251
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,090
Has it? I don't see any difference.

252
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,600
Liang Younian... Are you blind?

253
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,440
So... Exactly what did you use?

254
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,390
Hurry and share it with me.

255
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,080
Uh... It's just something my sister bought for me.

256
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,400
Uh... It's just something my sister bought for me.

257
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,610
I'm going to buy some now.

258
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,080
Xia Miaomiao.

259
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,950
None of the proportions in this drawing of the Ethics and Philosophy Building are correct.

260
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,680
What?

261
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,530
Take it back and re-do it.

262
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,050
Didn't I tell you that there was a problem with your drawing?

263
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,940
But you still wouldn't believe me.

264
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,330
That's impossible.

265
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,990
In order to draw it accurately,

266
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,730
I specifically looked up the design blueprints for the Ethics and Philosophy Building online.

267
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,820
I drew it with a proportion of 1 to 500.

268
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,170
You used the scale and it still turned out like that?

269
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,330
This shows a lack of natural talent and overexerting your effort.

270
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,710
Did I say something wrong?

271
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,300
I just drew it casually and Teacher Li accepted my midterm assignment right away.

272
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,100
He even praised me.

273
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,970
Unlike some people who have to re-do their drawing.

274
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,890
Okay. You're the best, all right?

275
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,140
You're so impressive. Can you stop always sitting next to me?

276
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,660
I just need some of your dumbness to offset some of my intelligence.

277
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,970
Those of you who need to re-do their drawing, please take notice.

278
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,400
Before next week— Good.

279
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,730
You need to hand in your assignment.

280
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,030
Otherwise, you won't get a grade for your midterm assignment.

281
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,520
Now, I'll give you a friendly reminder.

282
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,510
The grade of your midterm will count as half of your final grade.

283
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,520
It's already Friday. What am I going to do?

284
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,280
So exactly what are you going to do?

285
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,360
I also don't know what I should do.

286
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,720
The thing is, I don't know what the problem with my drawing is.

287
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,530
So I don't even know how to even start revising it.

288
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:05,440
So you're saying the teacher praised Kaituo's work?

289
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,180
I just knew that when he got to the university,

290
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,350
his accomplishments would begin to shine.

291
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,430
It's cloudy out here. Why are you applying that?

292
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,300
Come on. Ultraviolet rays are everywhere, okay?

293
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,800
It seems like I saw Senior Sister using that UV ray protector.

294
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,620
True.

295
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,950
So, you could say there are only lazy women in this world.

296
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,850
There are no ugly women.

297
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,050
Senior Sister works hard at it, so she's beautiful.

298
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,140
She is beautiful. Then, hard-working woman,

299
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,000
did you hear what the two of us were just talking about?

300
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,640
I heard.

301
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,030
Don't worry. Just re-draw it.

302
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:54,160
Just look at me. I have to hand in an in-depth report for my midterm.

303
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,930
I've already been out conducting interviews for a week.

304
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,740
Lots of people didn't want to be interviewed. It wasn't easy, but I finally found someone.

305
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,810
But the recorder didn't record. I have to do it again.

306
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,580
But the more obstacles I encounter, the braver I get.

307
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,390
Didn't I tell you not to buy anything from Senior Da Chao? He's not reliable.

308
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,800
Cheap products are of poor quality.

309
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,830
Miaomiao, I've thought of an idea.

310
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,020
Let Liang Younian coach you, like in high school.

311
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:28,300
Hey, everyone. Help me stop Wang Yichao. He's making me buy stuff again.

312
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:34,140
No way. He'll force me to buy his stuff in a little while.

313
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,680
I don't want to, either. He'll make me buy stuffs, too.

314
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,490
Have you seen Senior Younian? Senior Wang Yichao is looking for him.

315
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,220
No.

316
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,280
- I'll go find him myself.
- Uh, you can't.

317
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,730
Why can't I?

318
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:10,090
I... I... I want to ask you a question.

319
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,410
Are you happy studying fashion?

320
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,220
What?

321
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,520
Actually, I also wanted to study fashion before,

322
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,040
but my mother secretly changed my selection.

323
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,320
So I had to go to the Architecture Department. But—

324
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,070
What does that have to do with me? Why are you telling me this?

325
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,450
Xia Miaomiao.

326
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,440
Senior.

327
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,780
Xinxin says they're going to the cafeteria first to get seats.

328
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,490
Let me take you there.

329
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:30,520
- Let's go.
- Okay.

330
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,500
We're here.

331
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,050
Thank you, Senior.

332
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:41,250
Uh, Senior, aren't you eating?

333
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,960
I'm in a hurry to buy some things.

334
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,530
Oh, right.

335
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:52,890
He Xin says your architecture midterm assignment has a problem and you wanted to ask me about it.

336
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:59,040
Right. But I don't know if Senior has time for that.

337
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,980
I have time tomorrow.

338
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,070
I also have time tomor—

339
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,290
Then I'll meet you in the model classroom tomorrow afternoon.

340
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,860
Okay.

341
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,170
Where did you go? Come and help me sell this stuff.

342
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,090
I went out to buy swim trunks.

343
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,620
Swim trunks? Then why didn't you buy them from me?

344
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,620
How could you go to other people?

345
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,270
You have no shame.

346
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,660
I bought swimming trunks from you last time and the colors faded,

347
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,500
but I still need them for my midterm exam.

348
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,350
I don't want to wear a pair of swim trunks that loses its color.

349
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,800
That's impossible.

350
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,830
Oh!

351
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,410
Student, sorry about that.

352
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,150
Ah. Student, it's fine.

353
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,370
He's calling me a student?

354
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,560
Hey! Student!

355
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,540
Your bag! Student!

356
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,780
Hello, Student.

357
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,490
I'm their homeroom teacher.

358
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:14,820
I brought them here to tour Haicheng University today.

359
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,540
- Student.
- Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

360
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,130
Was this left behind by that student just a few minutes ago?

361
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,480
I know him. I'll return it for you.

362
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,820
Okay, I'll have to trouble you then.

363
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,420
Come here, Students. Gather over here!

364
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,440
We will be going to tour Haicheng University's library next.

365
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,390
Come! Students in the back, please hurry up a bit! Come on, this way.

366
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,820
Teacher, who were you talking to just now?

367
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,420
Chu chu ke ling.
(Literal translation is "lovely and pitiful")

368
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,320
Baidu Baike explains it as being fragile and cute.
(Idiom means generally "delicate and charming")

369
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,820
To begin with, you need to learn to be adequately fragile.

370
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,750
To begin with, you need to learn to be adequately fragile.

371
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,000
Come, come! Students, keep close to me!

372
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,520
Look!

373
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,860
Has that woman been

374
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,050
hit on a vital pressure point or something?
(Martial arts move which renders a person immobile)

375
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:01,150
That's our Assistant Teacher from the Fashion Department, Ms. Jia Yin. She recently came back from abroad.

376
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,970
She's famous for having a really weird temperament.

377
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,620
I heard she almost got into a fight with the Director of the Architecture Department.

378
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,820
Wait, what? The Director of the Architecture Department?

379
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,140
Isn't that Teacher Li Sichen?

380
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,150
Our Teacher Li doesn't seem like the type to fight with someone.

381
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:21,080
That's why I said she's famous for having a super weird temperament. Too weird.

382
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,010
- Hurry. I'm going to help you research how you can be delicate and touching.
- Hey...

383
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:28,170
- Hurry. I'm going to help you research how you can be delicate and touching.
- Hey...

384
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,680
Teacher, are you here freeloading at the pool?

385
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,460
Long time, no see. Are you speaking sarcastically to your teacher the first time you see him?

386
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,720
I brought the HDFZ students here to tour Haicheng University today.

387
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,520
No wonder I just saw a bunch of HDFZ students.

388
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,850
Isn't this yours?

389
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,690
Huh?

390
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,990
It was with you?

391
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:58,550
I was just worrying about what to do for swim class.

392
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,060
Aren't you already wearing your swim trunks?

393
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,190
Wow, you...

394
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,660
Teacher. Do you understand why now?

395
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,080
What happened?

396
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,120
Teacher, you can laugh if you want.

397
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,830
Xia Miaomiao, what are you doing pacing back and forth the entire night?

398
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,380
Didn't I schedule a meeting with Senior tomorrow?

399
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,460
I have to prepare well.

400
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,160
Let me see what you've prepared.

401
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,500
This is pretty good.

402
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,390
Let me tell you. When you go on a date, your foundation can't be too light.

403
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,940
And you must bring along a lipstick.

404
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:22,020
These are the things you've been preparing the whole night?

405
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,580
Yeah. Why?

406
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,080
I'm back and I bought you guys your favorite sushi.

407
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,230
Thank you, Senior!

408
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,910
- Thank you, Senior.
- No problem.

409
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,730
You're on your own.

410
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:38,390
- Give me a piece.
- No you have a date so you need to diet.

411
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,600
Let me have just one.

412
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,240
Good morning, Senior.

413
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,320
Oh, so early?

414
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,860
Senior.

415
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,120
This is my drawing.

416
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,700
Teacher Li said there are some issues with the proportions in my drawing.

417
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,160
But I strictly followed the design sketch online

418
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,080
and used a decreasing scale of 1 to 500 to draw it.

419
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,890
Logically speaking, there shouldn't be any problems.

420
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,150
So I am not sure how to edit it.

421
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:23,610
Don't worry, have you had breakfast yet?

422
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,630
Here's a bun for you.

423
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,530
Thank you, Senior.

424
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,100
Hey, wait!

425
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,750
Wait a second.

426
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,240
The drawing paper comes first, the ruler comes second.

427
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,960
Cut off one finger and you will still have 9 left.

428
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,290
What does that mean?

429
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,750
Basically, it means that when you're about to cut the drawing paper,

430
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,600
you would rather cut a finger than harm the ruler.

431
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,070
Even more importantly, you can't let any blood get on the sketching paper,

432
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,930
because it can never be dirty.

433
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,740
Oh, I understand now.

434
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,700
- You drew the Ethics and Philosophy Building, right?
- Yes.

435
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,910
There are indeed some issues with the proportions.

436
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,000
Do you have a scale ruler?

437
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:46,620
That's weird. The proportions do look off

438
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,030
so why is it that when I measure it, it's correct?

439
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,450
I am also not sure.

440
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,210
Bring the chalk and the tape measure. Let's go out for a moment.

441
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,180
Why?

442
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:15,480
I'm thinking that the proportions of the design blueprint you found online were off.

443
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,760
We will go and check it out, it's one of our school buildings after all.

444
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,120
Okay.

445
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,000
Senior, you treated me to breakfast I will treat you to a drink.

446
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,550
Senior, you treated me to breakfast I will treat you to a drink.

447
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,070
Sure.

448
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,100
Even if you wanted to treat me, you didn't need to buy this much.

449
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,130
I didn't know what flavor you liked so I bought a few more.

450
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:57,030
I didn't know what flavor you liked so I bought a few more.

451
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,560
You two continue.

452
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:22,370
Aunt, we've already drunk five bottles in a row.

453
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,320
Why don't you drink two?

454
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,640
I will need to go to the restroom if I drink too much.

455
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,910
I will come back later. Take your time drinking them.

456
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,210
Take your time!

457
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,400
Why don't we go measure the Ethics and Philosophy Building first?

458
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,170
I agree.

459
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,950
- In a bit, you hold it, and I'll measure it.
- Okay.

460
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:04,570
Actually, as long as we get the distance of the two pillars,

461
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,530
we will know if there is a problem with your ratio or not.

462
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,120
Okay.

463
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,310
- Be careful.
- Okay.

464
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,020
You must be careful.

465
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,590
When the tape measure retracts back, it's extremely scary.

466
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,250
Yes.

467
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,240
Okay, let's continue.

468
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,120
Why can't it go back in?

469
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,090
This has happened to me before.

470
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,560
It should go back in if I shake it.

471
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,220
- Shake it?
- Yeah.

472
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,010
Hold this.

473
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,230
Be careful, Senior.

474
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,150
Be careful!

00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:29,060
♫  My heart... ♫

481
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:40,870
♫  My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

482
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:54,160
♫  I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

483
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,860
♫ Regarding what love feels like  ♫

484
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,950
♫  I only heard about it from friends ♫

485
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,540
♫  I never thought about when it would be my turn ♫

486
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:12,270
♫ You are so dazzling and outstanding  ♫

487
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,270
♫ I'm just a faint breeze blowing  ♫

488
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:21,250
♫  But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

489
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,370
♫  Can you see my heart? ♫

490
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,950
♫  Can you read my mind? ♫

491
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:33,610
♫  Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

492
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:38,980
♫  I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

493
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,300
♫  My heart... ♫
