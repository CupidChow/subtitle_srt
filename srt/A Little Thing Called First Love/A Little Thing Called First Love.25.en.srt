A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,600
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,200
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,200
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,200
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,600
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,600
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,200
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,600
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,200
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,900
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,600
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,200
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,600
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,200
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,000
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25

Episode 25

27
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,800
Architecture Department

28
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,400
A Xia, later on, hang this banner from here to there.

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Got it.

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,700
I've bought it!

31
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,200
Oh, my goodness,

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,800
Why were you away for so long? Did you go to the pushpin factory to make one?

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,600
I went to the stationary store in front of the campus.

34
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,800
It's cheaper than the school supermarket.

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,900
You're so stingy.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,800
Maybe I've inherited my mom's good traits.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,400
If you're so stingy,

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,000
then I've thought of an extremely suitable task for you.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,400
What task?

40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,000
A task that will allow Liang Younian and you to sweetly shop in the supermarket together.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,300
Go with him to the supermarket later to get the food and drinks.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I love you!

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But dear, you have to make sure to control the budget.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,200
Liang Younian never looks at prices when shopping.

45
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,500
- Okay, I guarantee to accomplish the mission.
- Go on!

46
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,600
I protest!

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Why do I have to suffer here pumping these balloons while they get to go shopping together so sweetly?

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't worry, everyone has benefits.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,100
Later on, I'll bring you

50
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,000
somewhere that'll make you grin from ear to ear.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Really?

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,200
Let's hang this banner up first.

53
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,700
Okay.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,600
That side.

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
I'm going to take a break.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,800
That's fine. Thank you, no need.

57
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Not bad, right?

58
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,640
Someone looked for me at school today.

59
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,000
It seems to have to do with you.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,200
Did something happen to you?

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,400
What are you doing? Trying to choke me to death?

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,110
Why are you bullying Liang Younian?

63
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,900
- Even if you're going to beat the dog you have to see who its owner is first.
- Hey!

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,800
Great, now that you guys have reconciled,

65
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,600
my good days have ended.

66
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,400
This is so infuriating.

67
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,700
I'm leaving first.

68
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,800
What's wrong?

69
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,000
My dad is looking for me.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,300
We'll go with you.

71
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,200
What happened?

72
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,800
Just now, it seems like there were two people

73
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,100
planning to hold up Kaituo because of Uncle Lin's matter.

74
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,200
Then let's go together.

75
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,600
It's okay. Dad's just looking for me, I can handle it on my own.

76
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Hexin's asking me to go to the model classroom to blow up balloons.

77
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,800
What is she up to again?

78
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,600
Senior, we have a tight budget.

79
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,200
It's okay, let's deal with it when we pay.

80
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,400
We can't get these.

81
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,800
Why not? These are really delicious.

82
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,000
But they're expensive.

83
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,000
We can't get this, it's too expensive.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,200
It's not expensive! It's only ¥49 ($7 USD).

85
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,400
But the stationery store at the front sells it for ¥20 at most.

86
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,300
But this chessboard is made of wood.

87
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,200
It's not like wood is going to make you jump further

88
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,900
But it'll look better when I make my moves.

89
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,900
Then just buy it. I can't control you.

90
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,060
If student Xia Miaomiao disallows it, then I won't buy it.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Then I'll let put back the chocolate too, for you.

92
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,000
Just keep it.

93
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,300
Okay.

94
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,400
No way, did I get money for this?

95
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,800
Why should I be the party planner?

96
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,100
Hexin, I'll tell you what! I'm not doing this anymore!

97
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,400
I'm leaving now, you figure out what to do yourself.

98
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,700
What are you doing here?

99
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,000
What about you? Did you come to draw?

100
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Hexin took over your model classroom.

101
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,400
How about you go to our fashion design rooms to draw?

102
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,000
I didn't come to draw.

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,800
Hexin asked me to come help decorate the room.

104
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,400
I came to help, too.

105
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,900
How about we help each other out in decorating?

106
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,400
We'll decorate together.

107
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,000
Weren't you just about to leave?

108
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,000
I was just going out for some fresh air.

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Sis Xin, I'm so grateful. Long live SIs Xin. You'll always be 18 years old.

110
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Hurry up. I need to go after writing these, I'm in a rush to go home.

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
I'll be done right away.

112
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,600
Wang Yichao!

113
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,200
Right away!

114
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm in a rush to go home.

115
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,700
I'm a little nervous.

116
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,400
Little Tuo.

117
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,800
Little Tuo, are you okay? Did they make trouble for you?

118
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,400
I didn't run into them. Just what on earth happened to you?

119
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
It's good that you didn't run into them.

120
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,800
It's no big deal, don't worry.

121
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Oh, right. In the future, if someone comes to school to find you,

122
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,900
just tell them that you grew up with your mom since you were young.

123
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,200
You don't know me, okay?

124
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,800
Why? What happened to you?

125
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,460
Don't worry about it. Just focus on your studies.

126
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,800
Take care of your health.

127
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,200
I'll contact you again after I've handled the situation.

128
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,400
Makes things clear before you go.

129
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,600
Don't worry, I'm really okay.

130
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Lin Wei Guo.

131
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,600
You still remember the loan you got from President Chen, right?

132
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,300
I remember, I remember.

133
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,700
Let's talk elsewhere.

134
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,610
Dad, who are these people?

135
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,800
What loan?

136
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,540
Little Tuo, go back to school first.

137
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,600
This is my business, I'll handle the matter here.

138
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,000
Hurry and go.

139
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
If you were able to handle it, then why would you avoid us?

140
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,400
Both of you, can we not speak of this in front of the child?

141
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,000
How much does my dad owe you?

142
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,600
I'm gathering it.

143
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,200
¥200,000 ($28,500 USD).

144
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,700
That much?

145
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,000
It's not that much.

146
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,470
It's just that your dad didn't repay it on time.

147
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,600
Otherwise, President Chen wouldn't have sent the two of us here.

148
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,800
- Then how much does my dad still owe you?
- Little Tuo.

149
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,500
Including the amount he didn't return from half a year ago, about ¥50,000 ($7200 USD).

150
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,000
I have ¥10,000 in my card, the password is your birthday.

151
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,600
Repay it first, I'll think of ways to get the rest.

152
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,300
- L-Little Tuo!
- Wait!

153
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
I beg the two of you,

154
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,400
my son has grown up with his mom all his life.

155
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,000
I didn't raise him for even a day.

156
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I can't use his money. Give me a few more days grace period.

157
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,400
I'll definitely think of a way to gather the rest of the money.

158
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,700
- Why should we trust you?
- I...

159
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
We already know who his son is now.

160
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,000
If you can't repay it within ten days, we'll find your son directly.

161
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay, okay. Thank you.

162
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,200
Miaomiao, how is shopping going?

163
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,000
We're still shopping.

164
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,300
You have to help me keep an eye on Liang Younian.

165
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,400
Asides from stuff for the birthday party, he's not allowed to buy anything else.

166
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,200
Whether I'm able to have another meal this month will depend on you!

167
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,000
How much money is in the card you gave me?

168
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,400
¥180 (~$25 USD).

169
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,800
I have ¥90. (~$15 USD)

170
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,500
That means we have ¥270 (~$40 USD).

171
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,400
Even if we have ¥270, you can't spend it all!

172
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,200
Don't forget, you've inherited your mom's stingy genes.

173
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,900
You have to carry forward this gene.

174
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,000
It's delicious, right?

175
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Don't finish it all.

176
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,800
- I know.
- I won't have enough left.

177
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,000
Mom, I want coke!

178
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Why coke? I'll buy you milk.

179
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,700
Xinxin, I'm going to hang up.

180
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,000
Senior, are you finished?

181
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
No, we still haven't gotten the ingredients for hotpot.

182
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,200
Then, let's play a game first.

183
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,000
I really don't know why I'm playing this with you.

184
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,400
I also don't know why you

185
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,200
are playing such an immature game with me, ha ha.

186
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,000
Senior, just give up.

187
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,400
When I got my lasik surgery,

188
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,400
they taught me how to keep my eyes open!

189
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,200
Then let me tell you,

190
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:25,700
the words "give up" do not exist in my vocabulary, ha ha.

191

192
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,500
You lost! You lost!

193
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,400
You cheated! I disagree. It doesn't count. You cheated.

194
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,200
I don't care, it's not like we established any rules.

195
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,300
Anyway, I won.

196
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,600
You can fit that many words?

197
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,000
You can feel my efforts, right?

198
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,800
Yes. If Lin Kaituo still doesn't forgive you,

199
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,000
then he's not a person.

200
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,600
A Xia, can you check the group messages.

201
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,980
Miaomiao said they're done shopping and are heading back to the model classroom.

202
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,300
Ask her how much it cost.

203
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,150
Xia Miaomiao, how much did you spend?

204
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,200
She said Senior Liang Younian paid.

205
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,300
Liang Younian is finally acting like an older brother.

206
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:51,410
Tell Miaomiao to help me wrap the present that's at the corner.

207
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,800
Hexin asked you to wrap the present that she left in the corner.

208
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Senior Dachao said they're already done decorating the room and asks when we're heading back.

209
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,800
Senior Dachao said they're already done decorating the room and asks when we're heading back.

210
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,100
I'm almost done, don't rush me.

211
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,500
Tell him yourself.

212
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,200
I'm almost done, almost done, don't rush me.

213
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,400
Dachao, remember to go with Liang Younian to block Lin Kaituo.

214
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Bring him to the model classroom at precisely 7 p.m.

215
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,600
If you were able to handle it, why would you need to avoid us.

219

Half a year of my part-time job wages amounts to ¥3,600 *(~$500 USD).

220
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,200
It's still not enough.

221
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,700
Kaituo, Happy Birthday

222
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,200
Why did you come back by yourself?

223
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Didn't Senior go to find you?

224
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,200
Happy Birthday.

225
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,000
I-I'll give them a call and tell them to come back.

226
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,000
Actually, I quite detest celebrating my birthday.

227
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,700
Because when I was young, I'd always hope that my dad could come back and celebrate my birthday with me.

228
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,680
But that wish has never been fulfilled.

229
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,800
Then...

230
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,600
But today because of you, I feel like celebrating my birthday is quite a happy occasion.

231
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,600
Thank you.

232
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,400
No, no. I didn't prepare these.

233
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,800
It was Xinxin. She was also the one who bought this basketball for you.

234
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,200
She said you've always liked this brand of basketball.

235
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,100
She saved up money for quite some time in order to buy you this.

236
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,600
For-give me.

237
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,400
Then where's the present you prepared for me?

238
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,200
I... didn't prepare anything.

239
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,200
Why did Kaituo head back to the model room on his own?

240
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,040
Senior.

241
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Here, scan this quickly.

242
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,100
- Come on.
- Hurry and scan it.

243
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,400
Come on.

244
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,600

251
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,000
Let's blow it together.

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,600

Oh, my god. Did you write a whole short story on the cake?

255
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,200
It's the first time that I have seen somebody writing the character "cripple" on a cake.

256
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Seeing how much work you put into this,

257
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,600
I guess... I will forgive you.

258
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,200
Really?

259
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,800
I will announce that Kaituo is the best-tempered person in this world.

260
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,300
Then there's no one else in this world.

261
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,400
I want to eat the cake.

262
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,800
- I can't hold it.
- I'll take out the plates.

263
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,700
Let's go get the drinks.

264
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,200
I'll go get the wine.

265
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,800
The thing I bought for him,

266
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,400
- it runs around in the sky, like wu wu wu, and in the sky.
- Kite!

267

It's hot and I take this off and I change for another.

273
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,800
- Tear! Exchange presents!
- Right!

274
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,100
Senior.

275
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,400
Didn't you say you weren't going to buy it?

276
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,200
When did you buy it?

277
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,000
I put it in secretly.

278
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,800
This is for you.

279
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,500

280
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,600

- Miaomiao.
- Yes?

285
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,300
Don't catch a cold.

286
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,800
Thank you, Senior.

287
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,600

Come here.

291
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,140
Kaituo, have you drank too much?

292
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,400
No, I didn't.

293
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,600
Xia Miaomiao, I have something to tell you.

294
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,440
Say it when you're fully sober.

295
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,520
Xia Miaomiao, I like you.

296
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,200
Did you hear what I just said?

297
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,600
I said I like you, Xia Miaomiao!

298
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,700
Yes, I heard you,

299
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,000
but I don't like you.

300
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,800
- He Xin!
- Xinxin!

301
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,200
Xinxin!

302
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,800
Xinxin!

303
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,600
Take care of her. It's late. I'll go check the others.

304
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,200
Xinxin!

305
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Xinxin, wait for me!

306
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,200
Xinxin, let's talk!

307
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,400
Xinxin!

308
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,000
- Xinxin!
- Stop running.
- Stop following me!

309
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
The more you guys are like this, the more you're making me pitiful.

310
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,200
He Xin, Miaomiao doesn't like Lin Kaituo.

311
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,400
But Kaituo likes Miaomiao.

312
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,800
It's the speculation that I always didn't dare to admit,

313
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,200
but in the end it turned out to be true.

314
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,000
The person that I've liked for so many years

315
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
has fallen for my best friend.

316
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,400
What should I do?

317
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,400
Xinxin...

318
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,600
I am sorry.

319
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,200
I know that you didn't do anything wrong,

320
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,800
but I really can't talk to you right now.

321
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,200
You guys, don't be like this!

322
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,000
We should all calm down, sit down, and have a talk.

323
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,300
Miaomiao.

324
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,700
Let me go, okay?

325
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,300
I am sorry.

326
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,400
I'll go find her. I'll persuade her to come back.

327
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,000
I said I like you, Xia Miaomiao!

328
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Please don't run, I'll promise I won't say anything.

329
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,400
♫ The second that we pass each other ♫

330
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,400
A Xia said she found Xinxin, don't worry.

331
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,700
♫ Let the summer last forever ♫

332
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,400
Come on, stop crying.

333
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,000
♫ The thing on the mind is called love ♫

334
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Xinxin is smart, she'll be able to think it through in a couple of days.

335
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You don't need to worry.

336
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
If you continue crying, I'll need to ask you to pay me.

337
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,300
Look, your tears and snot are all on my jacket.

338
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,400
I'll wash it.

339
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:56,200
♫ Your hands are my little heaven ♫

340
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Let's go, stop crying.

341
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,200
It's getting late so I'll take you back to the dorm first.

342
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,100
I still need to go and clean up the modeling classroom.

343
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,800
I said I like you, Xia Miaomiao!

344
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,800
Just now... Lin Kaituo, he...

345
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,200
Can you not misunderstand me?

346
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I didn't think you'll be so decisive when it comes to rejecting people.

347
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,900
Let's go.

348
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,200
Is he human or not?

349
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,800
After talking about everything, he just fell asleep like that.

350
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,600
I think that Xiao Miaomiao and He Xin probably won't get any sleep tonight.

351
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,450
I really want to go and kick him.

352
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It took so many years for the two of you to reconcile your relationship,

353
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,400
and now there's a Xia Miaomiao.

354
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,200
Will you two go back to having a bad relationship again?

355
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,400
Shut your jinxing mouth.

356
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,400
Have you ever considered the issue?

357
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,900
You've always given in to Kaituo since the two of you were young.

358
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,200
If Kaituo asks you to give up on Miaomiao this time, would you?

359
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,000
If Kaituo asks you to give up on Miaomiao this time, would you?

360
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,700
I won't quit.

361
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,600
I have been busy all day for this stupid birthday.

362
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,100
I don't even know why.

363
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,600
In the end, everybody left unhappy.

364
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,800
And I don't know who to blame.

365
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,800
Xia Miaomiao.

366
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,230
He is calling her name even during his sleep.

367
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,090
He is really hurt by being rejected so harshly.

368
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,600
Xiao Miaomiao usually looks as timid as a little hamster.

369
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,200
I've never thought that she can be so harsh when she rejects people.

370
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,700
I'm so glad that I don't love her.

371
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,250
You better watch out.

372
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,800
Time to get up.

373
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,600
What?

374
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,200
Let's talk.

375
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,600
Why are you acting all crazy so early in the morning?

376
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,800
You confessed your love to Miaomiao last night.

377
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,100
What are you trying to say?

378
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,400
I like Miaomiao, too.

379
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,200
What do you mean?

380
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:17,010
I just think that I need to let you know.

381
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Then I need to let you know, too.

382
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,800
Although I was drunk last night,

383
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,800
what I said were all true.

384
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,300
Do you want to have some breakfast?

385
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,000
Let's eat together.

386
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,800
We need to finish this first, and then...

387
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,000
- But I don't know how to do it.
- I think this instruction is not necessary.

388
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Can you teach me about it?

389
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I really don't know what to do.

390
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,600
Xia Miaomiao.

391
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,600
I'll go to save your seat in the classroom. Hurry and don't be late.

392
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,400
What's the matter?

393
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,200
About last night—

394
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,000
Last night, you were drunk and I didn't remember anything.

395
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,200
I remembered it all.

396
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,200
And whether I was drunk or not,

397
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,000
I really do like you.

398
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,800
Okay. If you are serious, then I will reject you seriously one more time.

399
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,600
Okay. If you are serious, then I will reject you seriously one more time.

400
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,400
My answer is the same as yesterday. I don't like you.

401
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:32,260
I know that, but I have the confidence to make you like me.

402
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,000
You can only bring my troubles this way.

403
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,430
Troubles?

404
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,600
Is it because of He Xin?

405
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,000
It has nothing to do with Xinxin.

406
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Is it Liang Younian?

407
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
The fact that I don't like you has nothing to do with anyone else.

408
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,400
I'm sorry.

409
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,500
Because of me?

410
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
What did I do?

411
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,200
Who did I provoke?

412
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,400
Okay.

413
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,200
Don't worry. Ten days.

414
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,400
Within ten days, I will get ¥50,000 to pay for the loan.

415
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:57,930
Or I will take all the criminal penalties that you talk about.

416
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,800
But, wait, wait...

417
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,000
Also, from now on,

418
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,600
in the future, don't go and find Little Tuo at school, okay?

419
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,000
He doesn't have money.

420
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Okay. Thank you.

421
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,600
- Student.
- Hello, what is the matter?

422
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,800
Can I please ask which way is it to the Architecture Department?

423
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,200
Architecture Department?

424
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,800
Who are you looking for in the Architecture Department??

425
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,600
I'm looking for Lin Kaituo from the architecture department. Do you know him?

426
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,800
Who are you? Why are you looking for him?

427
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,400
I-I'm...

428
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,200
I'm his relative.

429
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,500
It's not possible. I know all his relatives.

430
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,800
Stop right there!

431
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,600
Don't disturb Kaituo anymore.

432
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,100
I know the reason you divorced.

433
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,790
If you don't want him to know the truth,

434
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,810
you better stay away from him.

435
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,900
- And you are...
- I'm He Xin who lives next door to you.

436
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
You are Little Xin!

437
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,640
You are so tall now!

438
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,200
I didn't mean to disturb him.

439
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,500
I'm here to give something to him.

440
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,250
What is it?

441
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,100
Can you give this card to Kaituo for me?

442
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,200
Is it Lin Kaituo's bank card?

443
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,400
Why do you have it?

444
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,100
There is some misunderstanding. He gave the card to me.

445
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,000
Okay. I know then.

446
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,600
You can go.

447
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,000
Thank you, Little Xin.

448
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,100
Hello? I saw your advertisement for hiring at Haicheng University.

449
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,600
I'm okay in taking a night shift.

450
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,810
But can you give me the salary every day? I really need some money recently.

451
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,200
Hello? Can you hear me? Hello?

452
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,400
Hello?

453
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,400
Yes, I'm here.

454
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,800
Yes, I can come to work at any time.

455
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,500
Thank you.

456
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,300
