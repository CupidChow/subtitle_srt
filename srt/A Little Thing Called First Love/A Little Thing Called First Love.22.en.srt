A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,550
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,130
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,050
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,120
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,610
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,090
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,990
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:40,600
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,530
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,570
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,220
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,620
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,550
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,360
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,040
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,790
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,630
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,060
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,060
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,070
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,630
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,040
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,950
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:00,060
A Little Thing Called First Love
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,100
Episode 22

27
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,780
You're going to participate in the competition, too?

28
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,790
Is it difficult?

29
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,730
Can people not in the architecture major register to enter?

30
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,990
No... and aren't you here to find Younian?

31
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,310
Why do you keep on talking to me?

32
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,160
I'm not going to chat with him.

33
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,250
Look, he treats me so coldly.

34
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,430
Th-Then, why do you keep on pestering him?

35
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,030
I— The more coldly he treats me, the more it increases my

36
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,270
desire to conquer him.

37
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,760
Not only will I keep on pestering him, I'll also force him to watch the 3D movie with us.

38
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,630
Right, Younian?

39
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,600
Look, I happen to have exactly three tickets left.

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,360
One, two—

41
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:33,120
That, last time I used Younian's camera

42
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,130
and conveniently took a photo of you.

43
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,460
And when I looked back at the photos,

44
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,360
I was surprised at my own photography skills.

45
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,730
So I developed the photo.

46
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,830
I put it in my wallet to

47
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,600
conveniently show it off. Right, Younian?

48
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,960
I have a matter I need to step out for.

49
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,110
Senior! That...

50
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,740
I want to ask you...

51
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,760
if you like to a watch movie?

52
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't think I can ask like this.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,260
If he says he doesn't like to, then the conversation just ends right there.

54
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,690
Senior! Thank you for being my model.

55
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,200
I want to treat you to a movie.

56
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,690
I think saying it this way is better.

57
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,970
- Senior!
- Yes?

58
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,990
S-Senior.

59
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,090
What's better?

60
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,090
Y-You scared me.

61
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,500
What are you talking to yourself about?

62
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,650
That...

63
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,310
Which?

64
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,110
Senior, thank you for being my model.

65
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,320
I want to treat you to a movie.

66
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,890
Okay.

67
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,260
Don't feel pressured, I don't mean anything by it.

68
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,260
If you don't want to watch,

69
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,530
I can also think of ways to sell the tickets.

70
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,400
Wang Yichao.

71
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,760
Yes?

72
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,770
I have two tickets. Help me sell those, too.

73
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,720
Oh, okay.

74
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,190
Che Zhi Bao, a website specializing in collecting cars.

75
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,260
If you're trying to sell your car, use Che Zi Bao.

76
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,570
Car collections from across the country, to ensure the best price.

77
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,330
Same day cash for cars.

78
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,400
A website specializing in collecting cars.

79
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,750
Teacher Jia.

80
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,850
Where's Teacher Lu?

81
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,230
He's busy tonight.

82
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,390
He'll come after he's done with his other matters.

83
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,600
Teacher Jia, you're not going to leave?

84
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,590
None of your business.

85
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,440
Thank you.

86
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,490
Don't be flustered when an emergency occurs and listen to the commands.

87
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,040
You mustn't be reluctant to leave your belongings.

88
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,630
Senior, you're not going to put them on?

89
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,160
- I will.
- All right.

90
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,330
Stay close to the wall in going forward.

91
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,950
Elevator.

92
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,660
When there's a fire, you must not leave by elevators.

93
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,080
Senior, are you feeling unwell?

94
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,650
Your knowledge of fire protection is very important. Do you remember everything?

95
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,810
No.

96
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,130
It's starting.

97
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,110
Some fishes can never be constrained,

98
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,520
because they're a part of the sky.

99
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,820
Who are we?

100
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,340
Where did we come from, and where are we going?

101
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,150
You can fly.

102
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,270
The heavy rain for this season is abnormal.

103
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,250
The raindrop is deformed.

104
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,710
Did you like the movie from earlier?

105
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,390
Yes, it was okay.

106
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,920
What did you think?

107
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,850
It was okay.

108
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,730
Too shallow.

109
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,810
After watching "Big Fish & Begonia",

110
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,980
and it didn't talk about this old village.

111
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,310
How can you not discuss this old village,

112
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,120
nor have even mentioned China's ancient architecture?

113
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,440
Must you insist on buying a red scarf?

114
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,940
Yes. I insist on buying a red scarf and it needs to be long enough to strangle you to death!

115
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,210
Let's hurry and go.

116
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,580
What's wrong?

117
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,160
- Don't let others find out that we're their students.
 - How about I buy the pop this time.

118
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,410
Go, go, go.

119
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,000
Hey, I—

120
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,450
This "Big Fish & Begonia".

121
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,420
Hello, Senior.

122
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,330
See you next semester.

123
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,020
When we come back next semester, you'll be a second-year fashion major.

124
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,630
Or I could be a first-year architecture major.

125
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,700
You don't have confidence?

126
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,180
I do.

127
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,290
That's more like it.

128
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,090
What's wrong?

129
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,040
Nothing.

130
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,390
Senior, did you like the movie from earlier?

131
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,160
You teased me for falling asleep.

132
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,150
Now you're the one who stayed awake, but you're asking me, the one who slept through.

133
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,110
I was watching something else.

134
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,000
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

135
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,950
- You were obviously saying something.
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.

136
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,940
This classroom, the design seems really good.

137
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,460
Very natural. I like Professor Lin a lot.

138
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,950
We'll be going to class together from now on!

139
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,730
-We can go to class together now!
 - You have to always stay with me.

140
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,310
Good morning, everybody!

141
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,860
The first class of the new semester is mine.

142
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,130
Isn't it unexpected? Isn't it surprising?

143
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,690
Yes.

144
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,250
What's the meaning of this?

145
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,770
You're already making me look bad as soon as school starts.

146
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,990
I will be upset if it's like this.

147
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,390
Teacher, let's hurry and get started.

148
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:27,530
Our Miaomiao can't wait for her first official course in fashion major.

149
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,360
Miaomiao?

150
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,120
All students, please take a look at Lin Xia's side.

151
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,500
Sitting beside her is

152
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,600
our new classmate this semester, Xia Miaomiao.

153
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,100
Miaomiao, introduce yourself.

154
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,840
Hello, everyone. I'm Xia Miaomiao.

155
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,780
I transferred over from the architecture major.

156
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,300
Thank you, everyone.

157
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,540
Okay. Before class starts, I still have two things to announce.

158
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,100
First, all universities are preparing for the joint sports day.

159
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,820
And Teng Mengfei from our major has been chosen

160
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,560
as a candidate of Haicheng University's phalanx commander.

161
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,870
The second thing is that because I am just too outstanding,

162
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,740
I've been entrusted by our university to train these commanders.

163
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,750
Please give a big hand of applause.

164
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,630
The new student is more supportive.

165
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,290
Okay, let's start class.

166
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,020
Where's the pen?

167
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,100
The Art of Fashion Design

168
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,420
The Art of Fashion Design- Tailoring Chapter

169
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,540
Good! Another one!

170
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,480
Another one!

171
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,360
Why aren't you continuing?

172
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,300
Are you guys watching a monkey perform?

173
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,040
Do you think you're as skinny as a monkey?

174
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,300
What's wrong? Can a fat monkey not perform?

175
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,410
I have good value in the market, too. Okay?

176
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,700
Look over there at the skinny monkey's market.

177
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,630
Stop eating so much and save some for me.

178
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,710
If she wasn't so despicable, I'd want to go over and befriend her, too.

179
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,030
I think Xinxin throws it better.

180
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,900
You know your stuff.

181
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,600
Is the "little golden tube" (referring to the sunscreen) any good?

182
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,660
I think it's pretty good. Don't I look whiter?

183
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,840
You should buy one, too.

184
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,560
Is it expensive?

185
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,040
It's acceptable.

186
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,750
Hexin, your Lin Kaituo.

187
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,680
Why aren't you going to him?

188
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,400
I'm mad at him.

189
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,450
Why are you mad at him?

190
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,040
At the end of last semester, he gave you movie tickets, but not me.

191
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,520
You mean the movie tickets he left behind at the library?

192
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,590
He gave you movie tickets, too?

193
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,300
What do you mean "too"?

194
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,950
Last time, he randomly gave me a stack of movie tickets but I didn't take them.

195
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,520
I think he must've gotten tricked by Senior Dachao.

196
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,510
He bought a bunch with no one to give them to.

197
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,520
- So he didn't just give them to Miaomiao.
- Pardon?

198
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,110
Nothing.

199
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,480
I said Student Lin is a cheapskate!

200
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,220
Why did he become Student Lin? Isn't he your Kaituo?

201
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,300
He gave you both movie tickets, only I didn't get them.

202
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,860
That means he treats you especially well.

203
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,600
- You can interpret it that way, too?
- Yes.

204
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,440
You don't understand.

205
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,140
I don't understand, either.

206
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,800
Where's your explanation? You're so late.

207
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,100
I'm angry.

208
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,600
I don't plan to explain to you.

209
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,920
Stop bickering, let's play.

210
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,500
He'll be off to work on the competition stuff later.

211
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,390
I'm angry, now aren't you going to console me?

212
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,550
Here, high five.

213
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,770
You're so absent-minded today.

214
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,870
Can you put some heart into it?

215
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,020
Even if you're not scared of an eye spasm, we're worried you'll hit us.

216
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:22,410
I beg you. Between watching Lin Kaituo and throwing the baton, just choose one.

217
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,850
Give it to me!

218
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,820
Work harder.

219
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,570
Keep it up!

220
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,060
Go farther away.

221
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,920
Let's stand farther.

222
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,290
Lin Kaituo, do you still remember me?

223
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,800
No.

224
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,860
- Very cool.
- Amazing!

225
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,850
What is Teng Mengfei doing?

226
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,250
Where's Liang Younian?

227
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,100
Why is she pestering my Lin Kaituo?

228
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,060
Xinxin!

229
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,930
Let's get this straightened.

230
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,020
Walk slower.

231
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,660
Calm down, she's been chased out.

232
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,470
Watch out!

233
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,700
- Miaomiao!
- Aren't you playing anymore?

234
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,020
Are you okay?

235
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,850
I'm okay.

236
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,350
Let me see.

237
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,360
Are you okay?

238
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,800
I'm okay. Hurry and see if Xinxin is all right.

239
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,160
Can you stand?

240
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,320
Yes.

241
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,480
My leg.

242
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,600
I'll send you to the infirmary.

243
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,350
Are you okay?

244
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,760
I got hurt, too.

245
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,270
Why didn't anyone take me to the infirmary?

246
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,330
Your hand is injured but your legs are fine.

247
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,560
Can't you just walk over on your own?

248
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,380
Here, get on my back. Sis will send you over.

249
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,710
Something's wrong with you.

250
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,920
You really have a problem.

251
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,970
Based on your description, it doesn't seem like there's a big issue.

252
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,480
Bones.

253
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,100
I think my bone is definitely fractured.

254
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,630
Then take off your shoe. I'll take a look for you.

255
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,730
Student, can you support her a bit so she doesn't move around.

256
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,230
Wasn't Xia Miaomiao here just now?

257
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,520
When did she disappear?

258
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,070
Hurry and support me.

259
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,930
Why are you laughing? It smells.

260
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,450
No it doesn't.

261
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,790
Stop fooling around.

262
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,490
If the bone is really fractured, it's quite serious.

263
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,220
You hear that?

264
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,200
I'm guessing everybody knows about the competition.

265
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,590
Everyone's GPA is above 3.9, that why I recommended you to compete.

266
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,550
I called everyone over today,

267
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,980
to inform you that the pre-selected deadline has been brought forward by a full week.

268
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,420
So whether you've started preparing or not, note that the time is running out. Understand?

269
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,540
All right, Go and get ready.

270
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,810
Thank you, Teacher.

271
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,200
Liang Younian, wait a moment. Come, have a seat.

272
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,980
Why is Lin Kaituo not here?

273
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,520
My cousin got hurt, and he took her to the infirmary.

274
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,630
- Then pass the message onto him when you see him.
- All right.

275
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,690
Liang Younain.

276
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,230
Professor Wu.

277
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,940
Professor Lin said that you were participating in the competition, too.

278
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,100
Yes.

279
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,140
Chen Hui also participated in the competition that time.

280
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,390
And she got a place, too. It was first place.

281
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,660
Yes, of course.

282
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,090
You can do it just like your mom, too.

283
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,750
Thank you, Professor.

284
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,570
Haicheng University

285
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,730
I've selected you from so many and been training you so hard

286
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,560
And you give me this in return.

287
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,190
Are you not happy with me?

288
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,570
Teacher, why don't you get the third substitute?

289
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,670
How am I going to get her back? I've eliminated her.

290
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,140
Do you want me to look shameless?

291
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,400
Stop acting now.

292
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,560
Look how worried Teacher is.

293
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,790
No way, Lin Kaitou is finally taking care of me.

294
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,700
I have to act this way until the end.

295
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,540
Teacher, I'll just need to rest for a few days and I'll be fine.

296
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,990
- After that, I'll...
- It's fine, it's fine.

297
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,630
Go and rest.

298
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,510
Teacher, Miaomiao wants to throw the baton.

299
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,070
She is talented and learns fast.

300
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,540
Also, she can catch things fast, accurately and steadily.

301
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,450
It's you then.

302
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,300
Throw. Throw. Throw it up.

303
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,130
Teacher, I really can't do it.

304
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,420
It's fine. Just throw it up higher.

305
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,690
Senior. Are you all right?

306
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,180
Why did you hit me?

307
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,510
I didn't mean to.

308
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,000
Let me take a look.
 [Architecture Department]

309
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,740
Y-You squat down.

310
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,100
Let me see if your head is all right.

311
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,400
It's a little red. I'm sorry.

312
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,400
Are you all right?

313
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,200
- I'm all right.
- Good.

314
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,000
He's all right. Come practice now.

315
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Hurry up.

316
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,400
I'm going back to the model room.

317
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,200
Throw it up. Higher!

318
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,100
Hurry! Toss it up!

319
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,200
Miaomiao! Higher, please!

320
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
One more time! Hurry up! Higher!

321
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,200
Xiaoyue. You're finally here.

322
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,400
Are you here to draw?

323
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm here to get something. I've got to go now.

324
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,700
Hey...

325
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,700
Liang Younaian, are you laughing at me?

326
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,000
I didn't say anything.

327
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,100
Your eyes are speaking.

328
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
Did they say that...

329
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,900
You are a bit of a scaredy-cat when you fall for someone?

330
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,990
Fine, you're the only one that's not a scaredy-cat.

331
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,000
I think there's something wrong with you.

332
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,460
You tear drawings one after another.

333
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,600
Open windows when the air conditioner is on.

334
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,700
Don't you know how to be environmentally friendly?

335
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
This... toss it upward.

336
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,800
Higher. Toss it.

337
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,600
You have the nerves to tease me for being a scaredy-cat.

338
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,700
Unlike someone who doesn't even know he's in love.

339
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,400
Wh-What... What are you talking about?

340
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
What am I talking about?

341
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,000
Think about it yourself.

342
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,900
Do you really treat Xia Miaomiao as a younger sister?

343
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,700
Teacher, it hurts.

344
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,070
That's right then.

345
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,800
Just get hurt a few more times, you'll get it then.

346
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,400
Keep it up!

347
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Teacher!

348
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,700
Just getting hurt a few more times and it'll be fine.

349
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,200
Keep practicing. I'll find someone to bring you food.

350
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
Don't give up.

351
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,400
Is it going to be all night training?

352
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Kaituo, you're here.

353
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,200
Your injury is serious to this extent?

354
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Didn't the doctor say it is not necessary to dress it?

355
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,200
I got it looked again by another doctor,

356
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,000
and he said it is necessary to dress the wound as it was very serious.

357
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,000
Let's go.

358
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,400
Aren't you going to carry me?

359
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Do you believe that I'm going back to work on my design now?

360
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,400
All right. At least help me to carry something.

361
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,400
Slowly.

362
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,200
Miaomiao, what are you doing?

363
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,000
I didn't even catch the baton once.

364
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,600
It's for you.

365
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,400
Can't you just talk nicely?

366
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,100
Kaituo, Miaomiao is going to have lunch soon. Can you help her find the baton?

368
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,000
No. I can find it myself.

369
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,800
You eat, I'll go.

370
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
I'm starving.

371
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,400
How long is this wound dressing going to last?

372
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,000
I don't know either, but it works really well.

373
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,700
Look. I asked him to find the baton for you, and he listened to me.

374
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,300
What do you like about him? Look at the way he runs.

375
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,400
I was wrong.

376
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,800
- It's delicious, right?
- Yes.

377
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,600
Delicious! Xinxin is the best.

378
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,790
This is so light. Is it that hard to do?

379
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,600
I can get it just by watching.

380
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,000
Show us if you can.

381
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,200
- Sure.
- Wow!

382
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
It looks so cool.

383
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,000
It hasn't even started yet.

384
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,600
Not bad. Not bad. Better than Miaomiao.

385
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,200
I just miscalculated the parabola.

386
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Hold on. Let me recalculate the parabola.

387
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,400
Yes.

388
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,760
Kaituo is right.

389
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,400
This is just a matter of dynamics.

390
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Why don't you say it's about gravity?

391
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,310
I'm begging both of you, go and do whatever you should be doing.

392
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,200
Don't interrupt my training here.

393
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,600
Wait.

394
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,600
Just go. Okay.

395
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,400
I'll try again.

396
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,600
Just hurry and leave.

397
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,200
If you're still not going to ask him to leave, I'll tell him that your leg is actually fine.

398
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,600
Kaituo. Oh, my. Let's go.

399
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Teacher Jia is coming back soon.

400
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,400
- Let's go.
- Okay. Okay.

401
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,500
Be careful.

402
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,000
My goodness.

403
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,200
How to tell if you like someone.

404
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,400
At any time, you'll always want to glance at places where she appears.

405
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,000
Why am I so unlucky?

406
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,500
I wish I were taller.

407
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,500
Can someone help me?

408
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,000
I can.

409
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,800
S... Senior.

410
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:37,420
Why are you here?

411
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,360
I was just passing by.

412
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,400
Passing by?

413
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,900
Are you trying to take that down?

414
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,000
Let me help you.

415
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,600
♫ Can you see my heart ♫

416
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,200
♫ Can you read my mind ♫

417
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,800
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

418
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,400
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

419
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,700
♫ My heart... ♫

420
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:41,400
♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

421
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,400
What is that sound?

422
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
Just now.

423
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,600
Don't be afraid. I'll go and check.

424
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,700
Hello, you're so cute.

425
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,470
It's so cute.

426
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:32,500
Senior, how can someone be stone-hearted as to abandon such a cute puppy?

427
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,200
True.

428
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,000
It's late right now. I'll have to take it back to the dorm with me.

429
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm sorry about that just earlier.

430
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
How about you take it off and give it to me?

431
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I'll wash it for you.

432
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
It is okay. I'll wash it myself.

433
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm so worried right now.

434
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,800
I've been practicing all day to catch the baton,

435
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,100
but I still can't catch it.

436
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,000
You've indeed just been hitting your head.

437
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
How did you know that I kept hitting my head?

438
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,900
Wasn't I hit by you once today?

439
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,900
That is true.

440
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,790
Let's go down and move around.

441
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,310
Unfortunately, pets aren't allowed on the campus.

442
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:40,600
I need to find a good household to adopt you.

443
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,100
You better come over here.

444
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,700
Little baby.

445
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,200
It's so cute.

446
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,900
Look. Her bright eyes, they're like Kaitou's?

447
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,600
I know you've pretended to limp lately, and that relationship between you two has developed fast.

448
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,200
But you can't just lie in this way.

449
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,400
In my mind, Kaituo does indeed have bright eyes.

450
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,600
Xinxin, could you help me make a post

451
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,000
in the university forum to find someone to adopt this puppy?

452
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,600
Don't you want to raise it?

453
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,000
I...

454
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,200
Some people aren't letting her keep it.

455
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,400
Okay, then I'll help you and post it when I get back to my dorm.

456
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,850
When are you going to send it away?

457
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,600
The room is full of people because of it.

458
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,400
It's so annoying.

459
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,680
I'm sorry.

460
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,200
After I find someone to adopt it, I'll send it away.

461
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,600
Xia Miaomiao! Take a look at this yourself.

462
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,300
What's wrong?

463
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'll wash the table cloth for you in a bit.

464
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,200
Forget about "in a bit", I'm going to throw it out now.

465
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,200
No, don't.

466
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Tang Mengfei, turn around.

467
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,000
What are you doing?!

468
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Go ahead and throw it.

469
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,100
If you dare to do so, I'll record it and post it on the university forum.

470
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,600
And let everyone see how our university Belle bullies such a small animal?

471
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,600
And let everyone see how our university Belle bullies such a small animal?

472
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,400
Take it, take it.

473
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,600
Delete it now!

474
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,800
Okay, I'll delete it.

475
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,200
Look at what you've done.

476
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,600
- What happened?
- Well done.

477
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,200
Where did this puppy come from? It's so cute.

478
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,000
I picked it up from somewhere, Senior Sister.

479
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Look at it.

480
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Architecture Department

481
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,100
I think the proportions of the swimming pool is a bit...

482
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,800
Look.

483
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,400
The location of the office area...

484
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,800
I'll talk to you later.

485
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,000
Your food delivery.

486
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,820
I bought it for Liang Younain, and for you too in passing.

487
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Am I right?

488
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,000
Why are you still amending this drawing?

489
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,900
Then why do you keep coming to our classroom?

490
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,800
I've only been here a few times, but not as many times as you amended this column.

491
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,800
Get out. Don't bother me while I'm drawing.

492
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,200
No, I just don't understand. It's just a broken column, is it necessary to amend for so many times?

493
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
- Right, Xiaoyue?
- Yes.

494
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,800
What are you drawing?

495
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,600
It's a swimming pool.

496
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,800
Swimming pool?

497
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,900
I love swimming. Let me take a look how it's coming along.

498
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,400
My goodness. It looks so realistic..

499
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,530
It looks just like a real swimming pool.

500
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,800
My god. I feel like going to swim there now.

501
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
Awesome.

502
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,200
Let me finish drawing first.

503
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,720
It's so much better than Liang Younians.

504
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,200
It's really a good drawing.

505
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,800
Don't need to draw it again. You'll definitely get first place. [Chinese-Style Courtyard]

506
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,400
It's drawn so well.
[Chinese-Style Courtyard]

507
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,420
And she got a place, too.

508
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,600
It was first place.

509
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
I will as well.

510
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,800
Slowly, slowly.

511
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,400
Actually, it would be even faster if you piggybacked me.

512
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
Hurry up, you have time to speak such nonsense.

513
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,000
It hurts, it hurts.

514
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,700
Then will you wait for me outside when I do the interview later?

515
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,930
Do you think I have a lot of time on my hands?

516
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,200
I still need to participate in the competition.

517
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,010
Just when will your foot be better?

518
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,600
Soon, soon!

519
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,800
Actually, it doesn't seem to hurt that much today.

520
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,990
Hello? Help me look up a phone number.

521
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,800
Lin Kaituo.

522
