A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,540
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,150
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,060
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,170
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,590
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,140
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,010
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,580
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,580
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,600
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,210
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,660
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,610
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,470
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,070
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,310
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,600
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,180
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,090
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,060
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,630
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,140
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,060
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,120
[A Little Thing Called First Love]
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

Episode 28

27
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,510
Why aren't you here yet? We've been working all day.

28
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,830
We're just waiting now for you to do the brush script lettering.

29
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,370
Why do you only pester me, and not Liang Younian for this?

30
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,450
Younian is busy with the contest.

31
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,950
I'm also busy with the contest.

32
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,800
It's not like you don't know how much he cares about this contest.

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,900
Get over here quickly. Why do you have so much to say?

34
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,030
I'm on my way.

35
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,490
Hello, Mr. Wang.

36
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,020
Sure.

37
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,030
It must be He Xin again.

38
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,490
When will she grow up?

39
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,310
Why isn't the part time staff here yet?

40
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,860
It seems we'll have to postpone our radio program.

41
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,620
Shouldn't he be here soon?

42
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,930
It's fine. Don't you have an interview?

43
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,100
Go on. I can handle this myself.

44
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,790
All right, call me if anything comes up.

45
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,440
By the way, about the post on the bulletin board,

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,740
I saw someone post a clarification.

47
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,320
I misunderstood you. Sorry.

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,110
It's fine.

49
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,160
Did you unplug it again?

50
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,210
Take a look yourself.

51
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,180
Cao Jun, take a look at my revision of the script for me.

52
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,920
You've had it revised. It's better than mine.

53
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,670
Yours is even better. Take a look.

54
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,590
I'm not. I'll take a look.

55
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,280
This still needs revision.

56
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,670
It's done. The cables came undone.

57
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,310
I've secure it in place. Just don't touch it.

58
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,520
Sure, thanks.

59
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,400
Anything else?

60
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,750
I... I'll get going then?

61
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,190
Bye-bye.

62
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,000
Yi Chao, it's the end of the term. You're still making us do this for you.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,810
This is too much.

64
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,850
Is the end of term exam or my romance more important?

65
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,860
The exam.

66
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,470
Fine. Even if my romance doesn't matter,

67
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,800
you should take Xiaoyue's romance into consideration.

68
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,880
Doesn't she deserve a grand love confession?

69
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,100
I actually think that Xiayue would prefer to attend the contest quietly.

70
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,150
Exactly. You picked a really lousy time to confess to her.

71
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,520
Xiaoyue is going for the contest. Do you need to confess to her at such a time?

72
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,160
Does this make sense to you?

73
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,800
What difference is the timing? The best time to confess is now.

74
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,180
Plus, if I don't do it now, how would she know that I like her?

75
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,550
If she goes abroad, it'll be too late for me to regret it.

76
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,890
You're so good at being dramatic.

77
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,760
I think whether Xiaoyue goes abroad or not, there's no chance for you.

78
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,050
Are you jinxing me?

79
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,660
I'm confessing to her only because I want her to understand how I feel.

80
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,460
I think that if I like someone, I should tell her.

81
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,750
Should I keep admiring her in secret until the end of time?

82
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,810
Am I right, Xia Miaomiao?

83
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,490
I'm going to the restroom.

84
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,830
Hey, Yichao.

85
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,360
She hasn't been quite herself these days.

86
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,080
So not only do you know how to accuse He Xin wrongly,

87
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,940
but there are also times that you care about her?

88
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,800
When did I accuse her wrongly?

89
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,940
Didn't He Xin tell you?

90
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,430
She tracked down the one who posted the hate post. It's Tang Mengfei.

91
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,150
Hey, aren't you going to do the brush script for me?

92
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,050
Hello? What is it?

93
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
Nothing.

94
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,950
I just heard you found the post author.

95
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,030
Actually, last time, I didn't really mean to suspect you.

96
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,290
I was just annoyed by you.

97
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,700
Can you get to the point. I'm pretty busy.

98
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sorry. I misunderstood you.

99
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,410
All right, I got it.

100
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,790
Okay.

101
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,960
How about I treat you to a meal?

102
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,570
Just think of it as my way of apologizing.

103
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:23,470
No need, thanks. I have to start the broadcast.

104
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,590
Good evening. Welcome to Haicheng University's radio program.

105
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm your host for today, He Xin.

106
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,960
Today, we're going to talk about how to confirm your feelings.

107
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,400
Feelings are the most difficult thing to think through in the entire world.

108
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,600
At times, even if we're the involved party,

109
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,100
we can't truly understand how we feel.

110
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,520
Throughout our lives, we'll come across many people.

111
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,400
How can we be sure who among them do we like?

112
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,950
Are you Ms. Fang Xiaoyue?

113
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,120
I am.

114
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,730
The bus is at the entrance. Good luck with the entrance.

115
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,340
Senior, this is for you.

116
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,250
For me?

117
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,900
The lady of the day is here.

118
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,740
My goodness.

119
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,660
Woah. She's so pretty.

120
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,550
Wang Yichao!

121
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,590
What are you doing?

122
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,720
Fang Xiaoyue.

123
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
I like you!

124
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,500
Wow!

125
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,650
I'll turn you down.

126
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,310
You don't know me at all.

127
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,080
What I dislike the most is this grand scale of some exaggerated display

128
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,310
That attracts everyone's attention.

129
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,080
Yichao really embarrassed himself.

130
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,590
Luckily, we had exams and couldn't be there.

131
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,630
But I'm still impressed by Da Chao's power of execution.

132
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,320
But I'm still impressed by Da Chao's power of execution.

133
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,710
Is everyone like you?

134
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,570
How man years have you secretly admired Younian? Let me count.

135
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,080
Don't count. I know.

136
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,860
I'll consider it well.

137
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,520
Do you have time to think about it?

138
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,280
How do I not have the time?

139
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,380
Senior and I are both healthy.

140
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,200
What if Younian wins the first prize and is ready to go abroad?

141
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,320
But...

142
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,560
But what?

143
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,460
But Senior is so outstanding.

144
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,200
I'm... so ordinary.

145
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,240
I always feel that if I confess my feelings to him,

146
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,430
it'll bring trouble to him.

147
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,900
Just let there be trouble then.

148
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,860
He's so outstanding, yet he has met you.

149
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,190
This means he is destined for such misfortune.

150
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,580
Or is it that you don't like Younian as much as you did before?

151
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,180
Has the unreciprocated love dwindled as time goes by?

152
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,200
I didn't.

153
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,800
I still really like Senior.

154
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,600
I'll go.

155
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,800
Why did you swear at me?
 (Sounds like she said "damn it")

156
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,400
I mean... I'll go confess to him.

157
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,600
Okay, when?

158
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,200
Next term.

159
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Why didn't you say your next lifetime?

160
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,800
If you're too scared to do it, just say so. Stop bluffing.

161
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,400
It's already the end of this term. I don't get to see him.

162
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,600
Then you can have him cornered.

163
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,800
That's really rude.

164
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,800
As if. You sound as if you dare to confess to him if you see him.

165
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,400
I do, I'll definitely dare to do it.

166
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,800
Why isn't anyone sick of this post?

167
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Can the post be deleted?

168
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,970
The point is that Yichao even replied to this post,

169
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,000
begging you for forgiveness.

170
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,200
Miaomiao, remember to come to the Arts Club this afternoon.

171
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,200
We're introducing the new members.

172
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,400
Okay.

173
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,200
Will all the club members show up?

174
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,400
Yes, we're also discussing the plans for activities for the next term.

175
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,100
Why did I bluff for nothing?

176
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,200
How do I confess to him?

177
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,800
One is super introverted, while the other is super extroverted.

178
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,200
We'll talk about the content during our meeting.

179
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,600
Why are you here?

180
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,600
What are you doing here?

181
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm Liang Younian's family.

182
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,300
Right, Liang Younian?

183
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,200
Is everyone present?

184
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,500
We would like the two new members to introduce themselves.

185
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,500
Hello, everyone.

186
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,200
I am a fashion design freshman, Wang Yutian.

187
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,800
Isn't he too introverted?

188
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,000
He's completely the opposite of you.

189
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,390
Hello everyone. I am arts freshman, Wang Ze.

190
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,600
I've always wanted to join the Arts Club.

191
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,440
But I missed the recruitment at the beginning of the term.

192
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,800
I'm very happy to still have the opportunity to join this club.

193
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,330
In the future, I'll be sure to participate in club activities actively

194
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,200
and contribute to the club.

195
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Thank you, everyone.

196
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Welcome to the Arts Club.

197
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,300
Thank you, Senior Sister. I'll learn from you well.

198
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,400
Right, there's one other important matter.

199
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,200
Before the winter break,

200
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,000
we need to discuss a direction for next term's club activities.

201
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,400
That way, during the break, we'll be able to come up with proposals.

202
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,700
Please express your opinions now.

203
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,400
I think we can collaborate with other clubs in the next term.

204
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,600
To work on graduation related events.

205
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,800
I think we can work with the Animation Club to make comic books.

206
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,690
We can also work with the Journalism Club

207
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,800
to do an illustration for the campus newspapers.

208
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,500
I think we can work on charity related events.

209
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,800
It's beneficial to the society.

210
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,800
Senior Sister, what are you doing?

211
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm thinking about... Senior Xiaoyue's questions.

212
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,400
Then it's decided.

213
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,620
During the winter break, come up with some proposals.

214
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,900
Then we'll decide when the new term starts.

215
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,000
That's all for today. I wish everyone a Happy New Year.

216
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,400
Happy New Year.

217
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,300
- Mr. Li.
- Hey, hey.

218
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,800
Well, Kaituo just said he's going to play basketball with us.

219
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,850
All right.

220
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
The results of the design contest are out. It was notified through text.

221
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,800
Take a look quickly.

222
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,600
I won third prize.

223
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Congratulations.

224
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,410
Shouldn't you ask Younian right away?

225
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,940
Right.

226
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,600
If you go abroad, what about Miaomiao?

227
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,600
What does me going abroad have to do with Miaomiao?

228
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,800
There are six prizes in this contest. My students won three.

229
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,100
How would the teachers from other universities feel?

230
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,200
- Sir, you asked to see me?
- Liang Younian.

231
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,400
Come here. Come in. Have a seat.

232
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,400
Congratulations. You won the first place.

233
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,000
Thank you, Sir.

234
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,190
You'll get ready to go abroad this summer.

235
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Get your passport and IELTS done, understood?

236
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,800
Yes.

237
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,400
The Architecture Department in Edinburgh

238
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,000
is the one place all architecture majors dream of going.

239
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,600
- You know that, right?
- Yes.

240
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,600
They focus more on cultivating the architect's visual aesthetics.

241
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,800
That's your weakness. You must pay more attention.

242
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,000
- Got it?
- Yes.

243
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,270
In addition, nothing else is more important than this right now.

244
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,700
You mustn't make me lose face.

245
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,400
- Understand?
- Yes.

246
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,800
Good.

247
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Remember, nothing else is more important than this.

248
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,400
- Understand?
- Yes.

249
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,200
- All right, get going.
- Thank you.

250
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,900
Senior, can you come to the rooftop?

251
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,400
♫ This late night is very quiet ♫

252
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,900
Senior.

253
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,000
♫ I want to hear your voice ♫

254
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,000
I have something I want to say to you.

255
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,600
♫ This familiar melody ♫

256
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,480
I like you.

257
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,200
I've liked you for a really long time.

258
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,940
♫ Take you to travel ♫

259
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,950
Ever since I was little, I was always a meek and timid person.

260
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,200
♫ I want to live in your heart, inseparable forever ♫

261
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,000
However because I started liking you,

262
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,160
I started to change myself.

263
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,000
I studied hard and became more confident.

264
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,000
I got into Haicheng University and joined the Arts Club.

265
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,400
I switched majors successfully to become a more outstanding person.

266
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,600
All of this was so I could get closer to you.

267
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,000
♫ I want to go to see the sunset with you ♫

268
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,300
You might not know...

269
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,000
Because of you,

270
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,400
I've done a lot of the silly things.

271
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,400
♫ This familiar melody ♫

272
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,000
♫ Seems to hug and hide you in my arms  ♫

273
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,600
What was that sound just now?

274
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,800
♫  Feels like time has stopped ♫

275
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Liang Younian.
♫ I want to live in your heart, inseparable forever ♫

276
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:53,200
♫ I want to go to see the sunset with you ♫

277
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,000
♫ Wishing together, crazy together ♫

278
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,800
♫ And without being afraid to get lost ♫

279
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:09,200
♫ I want to live in your heart, inseparable forever ♫

280
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,900
Liang Younian

281
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,400
Senior, thank you.

282
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,200
♫  I want to chat with you until dawn breaks  ♫

283
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,800
♫ I want to live in your heart, inseparable forever ♫

284
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,600
I should've told you long ago.

285
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,080
♫ I want to go to see the sunset with you ♫

286
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,760
I like you.

287
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,600
♫ Wishing together, crazy together ♫

288
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,600
♫ And without being afraid to get lost ♫

289
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,600
♫ Wishing together, crazy together ♫

290
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,800
Can you give me a bit more time to give you the answer?

291
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,340
Who would've known?

292
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,180
Miaomiao really dared to confess her feeling.

293
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,470
Even a rabbit can bite when cornered.

294
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,620
Come on, you haven't moved for half an hour.

295
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,790
Are you having dinner or not?

296
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,480
Go without me. I don't have an appetite.

297
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,010
Let's go! We'll get dinner for Miaomiao.

298
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,090
Senior, can you come to the rooftop?

299
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,750
Can you give me a bit more time to give you an answer?

300
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,470
Give you some time...

301
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,150
How long is that?

302
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,990
A Xia, tell me...

303
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,530
How long is "some time?"

304
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,500
Be good. "Some time" might be a week.

305
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,650
You said it was three days before.

306
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,030
It can also be a month. Everyone's concept of time differs.

307
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,050
Wait patiently.

308
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,680
But...

309
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,770
Stop asking me. You already asked me three hundred times.

310
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:40,430
You're exaggerating. When did I ask you three hundred times?

311
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,020
- Senior Sister.
- Yes?

312
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:57,240
How long do you think most people mean by "a bit of time"?

313
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,060
What is it about?

314
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,190
Nothing, I'm just asking.

315
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,970
I'm going to the library to return books.

316
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,430
Bye-bye.

317
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,300
I think I also have library books that I haven't returned yet.

318
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,270
Go and return it for me.

319
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,590
What time did you order for the cab to arrive in the afternoon?

320
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:25,550
At 2:30 p.m., how about you? When exactly are you going home?

321
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,970
Are you still waiting for Younian's reply?

322
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,300
You can also wait at home.

323
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,010
Xinxin says Senior hasn't gone home yet.

324
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,620
What if I can bump into him at school?

325
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,900
You live so close to each other.

326
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,560
Why does time go by so slowly?

327
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,700
Sis, when are you coming home?

328
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,250
Niannian seems to miss you a little bit.

329
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,360
Only Niannian misses me? You don't miss me?

330
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,960
I don't miss you at all.

331
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,400
You clearly miss me a lot.

332
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,300
Senior.

333
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,570
What is it?

334
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,660
My sis just sent me a picture of Niannian...

335
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,350
I just happened to run into you, so I thought I would show it to you.

336
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,090
It's quite cute.

337
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,170
Is there anything else? I'm very busy.

338
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,990
Then I'll go first, Senior.

339
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,380
Mom, I'm home.

340
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,300
Didn't you say you were busy and wouldn't be able to come home?

341
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,410
Why did you come home suddenly?

342
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,620
It's nothing.

343
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,200
Sis!

344
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,750
Can you be more dramatic? You miss your sister.

345
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,220
It's not that. It's your dog that misses you.

346
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,910
You say no, but you mean yes.

347
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,800
If you didn't miss me, then why did you run so fast?

348
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,370
- Mom.
- You miss your sister.

349
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,480
It's because Mom is taking me to get new clothes, right?

350
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,000
Oh, yes. You came home in time. Just come with us.

351
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,210
I won't join you. I'm going to tidy some things up at home in a bit

352
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,520
and play with Niannian for a bit.

353
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,790
I want you to come with me.

354
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,200
Let your sister get some rest.

355
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,680
She can keep watch. Go. Go to your sister.

356
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,320
Niannian misses Sister.

357
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,980
Stay home and keep watch. We'll be going.

358
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,370
Come on.

359
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,520
Isn't it just a rejection?

360
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,000
Is it so hard to just say it?

361
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,470
Hello, Liang Younian? What is it with you?

362
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,330
Didn't you say you'll help me deliver books to the welfare center?

363
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,700
Something came up and I went home. I'll send Kaituo over.

364
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,890
Why didn't you ask me first? I don't want him to help me.

365
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:44,170
I thought... you would be so happy if I sent Kaituo over.

366
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,790
Call him right away. Make him turn around.

367
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,740
I can do it myself.

368
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,500
I already came.

369
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,180
That's all, I'll hang up now. Bye-bye.

370
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,560
No need. I can do it myself.

371
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,600
Go back, thanks.

372
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,320
I already apologized to you about that matter last time.

373
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,060
Do you have to behave like this?

374
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:23,100
What's the matter? I think that I'm being quite polite.

375
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,340
You might not know this,

376
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,020
but I treat all my "ordinary" friends this way.

377
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,710
Do you what you want!

378
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,420
Thanks!

379
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,260
Younian, congratulations. You won the first prize.

380
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,900
Xiao Tuo should learn from you.

381
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,530
Thanks, Aunt.

382
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,040
Xiao Tuo is only a sophomore.

383
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,570
He has done very well in getting through to the finals.

384
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:31,630
In the future, don't keep comparing Xiao Tuo to Younian in front of Xiao Tuo.

385
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,100
Otherwise, he's going to get mad again.

386
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,760
Liang Younian, it's all your fault!

387
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,230
Xiao Tuo, if you have something to say, say it nicely.

388
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,930
Mom, stay out of this.

389
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,380
I didn't know you both had a fight.

390
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,400
I think you did it on purpose.

391
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,950
Will you die if you stop accusing people for a day?

392
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,600
You still say you didn't do it on purpose?

393
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,350
Did He Xin tell you that I accused her wrongly?

394
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,920
How could I have time to meddle with you guys?

395
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,760
Calm down, boys. What exactly happened?

396
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,320
Xiao Tuo, we're a family. We're having dinner.

397
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,490
We're having dinner. Do you want to join us?

398
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,230
Yes.

399
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,990
Where's my bowl?

400
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,080
Chopsticks? Do you have any sense?

401
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:48,270
Eat it if you want. Leave quickly if you don't.

402
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,700
You can leave if you want. I'm starving.

403
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,760
Aren't you starving? Eat more.

404
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,990
You like shrimps. Have more.

405
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,560
Sure, you can have your favorite soy-braised pork.

406
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,110
Eat some more.

407
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:16,450
Then shut your mouth up while you're at it.

408
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:30,090
I'm pretty much full. I'll go get the bill.

409
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,660
Miss, the bill.
Miss, the bill!

410
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,260
How much is it for table one?

411
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,140
52 Yuan. ($7.50)

412
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:04,900
Boss, some chilli sauce, please!

413
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,150
Boss, do you hear me?

414
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,980
Boss!

415
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,720
You're so lazy. I'm here! Sorry about that.

416
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,540
I'm here! Sorry about that.

417
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,790
Call me again if you need anything.

418
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,820
Hey, what are you thinking all day long? You're so lazy.

419
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,580
Do I owe the Xia family anything in my previous life?

420
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:36,200
Your dad only cares about the sea. He hasn't even returned yet for the New Year.

421
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,500
My eldest child behaves like this.

422
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,990
The youngest one is like a stray dog. She's never home.

423
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,770
I wonder how I sinned in my previous life.

424
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,500
Go! Bring Xia Santu back, and give Niannian a bath.

425
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,770
It's New Years, and the dog stinks.

426
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:04,050
Where are you going? It's in the backyard!

427
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,860
My goodness.

428
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,330
- Hello.
- Ma'am, give us the menu please.

429
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,700
Sure, give me a second.

430
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,030
Senior.

431
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,230
Niannian. Niannian, come here.

432
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,420
Look, I have goodies for you. What is this?

433
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,000
Come on, chase after me.

434
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:09,920
Niannian, come quickly.

435
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,310
Tonight at half past nine, I'll be waiting for you at the lighthouse.

436
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,390
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

437
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:06,100

00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,400
♫ I'm just a faint breeze blowing ♫

480
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,220
♫ But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

481
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:57,400
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

482
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,180
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

483
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:06,600
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

484
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:12,160
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

485
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,990
♫ My heart... ♫

486
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:27,100
