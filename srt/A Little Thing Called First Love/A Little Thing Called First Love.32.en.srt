A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,600
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,050
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,100
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,070
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,620
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,040
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,990
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:40,600
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,590
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,570
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,160
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,640
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,520
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,620
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,530
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,590
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,130
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,060
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:44,090
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,570
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,120
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,800
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,100
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,150
Episode 32

27
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,570
I think it'll definitely work.

28
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,490
What is it?

29
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,060
Hey, look.

30
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,680
Kaituo... He didn't think Xinxin would leave.

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,030
That's why he's in this state right now.

32
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,170
Do you mean... Him and Xinxin...

33
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,490
Can't you tell?

34
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,330
Our Xinxin has finally turned the tables.

35
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,870
- I'll go to him.
- Okay.

36
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,500
Then I'll get back to my department to work on my big assignments.

37
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,300
Get going first then. Tell me when you're done.

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,520
- I'll pick you up.
- Okay.

39
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,100
Xia Miaomiao.

40
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,150
What are you both doing here?

41
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,770
- Because it's now our turn to feed our sweetheart.
- Right.

42
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,170
Look at the time. When do you guys eat?
 [Senior, I've been too busy recently and didn't have time to spend with you, I'll give you a little defense. I will work hard! - Miaomiao]

43
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,120
Anytime is a good time to eat when you're hungry.
[Senior, I've been too busy recently and didn't have time to spend with you, I'll give you a little defense. I will work hard! - Miaomiao]

44
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,480
Stop drawing. Let's eat.
 [Senior, I've been too busy recently and didn't have time to spend with you, I'll give you a little defense. I will work hard! - Miaomiao]

45
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,830
Here's a little protective charm for you.

46
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,760
Give it to me.

47
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,250
I also want a little guardian.

48
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,720
You get to go abroad with the person you like.

49
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,550
How nice. Don't you only need two more works?

50
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,280
Why are there so many?

51
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,360
She draws dozens of hours a day.

52
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,290
Apart from practicing basketball with Younian, she hasn't left this place.

53
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,630
Didn't I already talk to Ms. Jia?

54
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,780
She said that if I wish to apply as an exchange student at Birmingham University,

55
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,520
apart from my GPA, the fashion design portfolio is the most important thing.

56
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,080
Therefore, I think that I must pick out the works I'm most pleased with.

57
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,680
By doing so, even If I'm not accepted,

58
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,810
I would have done my best and I'll have no regrets.

59
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,440
Our Miaomiao has grown up.

60
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,280
You can do well without me being by your side.

61
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,520
Let me ask you, are you really planning on leaving?

62
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,280
What about Lin Kaituo?

63
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,690
What about him?

64
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,530
Without me by his side, he's all the more happy and relaxed.

65
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,550
He'd love for me to leave earlier.

66
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,000
I think he can't bear to have you leave.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,650
Besides, his current attitude towards you is different from back then.

68
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,290
I think so, too.

69
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,080
Your stylus pens are delivered.

70
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,550
Forget it. It's best not to overthink.

71
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,620
No one should bother guessing what Lin Kaituo's thinking.

72
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,600
The more you guess, the more you'll become confused.

73
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,270
He Xin, don't guess what Kaituo is thinking.

74
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,850
- But...
- No buts. He told me to leave sooner.

75
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,320
I don't want to put up with his mood swings and grumpiness again.

76
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,360
My grumpiness?

77
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,480
She doesn't consider anyone's feelings at all. She leaves as she wishes!

78
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,630
Is it that she didn't consider others' feelings

79
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,240
or that she didn't consider... your feelings?

80
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,100
I'm just—

81
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,180
I'm just worried that she's going so far away by herself.

82
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,980
She's so short-tempered and can't take care of herself.

83
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,170
And she's not reliable at all. She keeps bringing trouble to others.

84
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,170
Don't you know?

85
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,460
Xinxin is only unreliable when it comes to you.

86
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,150
You're her older cousin. She's your younger cousin.

87
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,740
You'll definitely take her side.

88
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,700
Let's not forget that you're also my younger brother.

89
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,970
I'm just stating the facts, not siding with family.

90
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,640
I've never acknowledged you as my older brother.

91
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,970
Fine. I'm going to pick up my girlfriend.

92
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,390
Get lost. As if you're the only one with a girlfriend.

93
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,120
You got that right.

94
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,310
Think over it on your own.

95
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,450
Why don't you want He Xin to leave?

96
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,080
Kai and Xin

97
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,260
Miaomiao.

98
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,370
Senior.

99
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,030
What brings you here?

100
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,760
He's here to visit the prisoner as well.

101
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,630
Miaomiao, why are you treating us differently?

102
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,460
I didn't.

103
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,130
When we showed up earlier, I didn't see you come running out to welcome us.

104
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,570
Ignore her. She's just envious.

105
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,250
Who's envious?

106
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,980
I just can't stand seeing certain people show public display of affection.

107
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,640
You can leave if you can't stand it.

108
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,830
I got it. He finds us a hindrance.

109
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,590
We'll leave.

110
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,780
Xinxin.

111
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,760
Don't bother explaining.

112
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,330
I now have a huge issue with your boyfriend.

113
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,270
Let's go.

114
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,630
Xia, let's not be the third wheel.

115
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,310
Here.

116
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,600
Keep drawing. I'll keep you company.

117
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,620
Senior, between these two, which one do you think is nicer?

118
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,270
Pardon? Aren't they the same?

119
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:04,060
They aren't. One has buttons and the other doesn't.

120
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,690
I see.

121
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So which one is better?

122
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,210
Without buttons?

123
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,170
Really?

124
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,820
But with buttons as embellishments, I think it will create a unique visual focus.

125
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,610
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

126
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,900
So the one with buttons then?

127
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:38,920
But I'm worried that with buttons, it will draw people's attention away from the cut of the skirt.

128
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,750
Then without buttons.

129
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,330
Xia Miaomiao, I'll pick whatever you pick.

130
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,830
I'm asking you because I can't decide. Then you—

131
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,430
Forget it. I'll think on my own.

132
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,830
Don't panic. I'll take another look?

133
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,230
Here, let me see.

134
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,110
So in terms of fashion design, does having a button or not really make such a big difference?

135
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,790
It makes a really huge difference.

136
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,960
The embellishments on garments can add sparkles to the outfit.

137
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:20,480
Through different styles, colors and accessories, they can make up for weaknesses of the garments.

138
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,370
It's actually a type of formative art that has been overlooked.

139
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,850
It's actually a type of formative art that has been overlooked.

140
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,920
Our Miaomiao is so hardworking and professional.

141
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,470
You'll surely get into the exchange program.

142
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,200
I'll do my best.

143
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,000
You can do it. But at the same time, don't wear yourself out.

144
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,040
I'm not tired at all. Did you know?

145
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,070
Ever since I decided to go abroad with you,

146
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:49,070
I suddenly realized that in terms of fashion design, I have so much that I don't understand.

147
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:56,030
So... If I get to study abroad, it will also be a great chance to challenge myself.

148
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,990
I was worried that you only wanted to go abroad because of me.

149
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,800
Who knew that I have actually thought too highly of myself.

150
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,710
You matter a lot to me.

151
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,750
I wanted to study abroad because of you in the first place.

152
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:18,020
But now, it's also for my own sake.

153
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,390
Stop feeding me. I have to focus on drawing.

154
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,740
When exactly will you return?

155
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,100
Don't worry.

156
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,160
If you get to study abroad, I'll rush back to see you off even if my research isn't done.

157
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,430
I don't buy it.

158
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,830
Don't forget to eat when you're busy. Do you hear me?

159
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,810
I heard you.

160
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,350
Hey, He Xin, take this sunscreen with you.

161
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,110
Don't get tanned.

162
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,350
All right.

163
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,100
Yichao said they are trying to get hold of Kaituo right now, but they haven't been able to get through to him.

164
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,580
They asked you to wait for a while. They'll come here in a bit.

165
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,410
Who needs him to see me off?

166
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,630
I'll get going.

167
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,950
Just wait for a while.

168
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,300
I've waited many years for him.

169
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,820
I'm not waiting anymore.

170
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,020
Here, give it to me.

171
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,840
Thank you.

172
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,670
He Xin!

173
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,350
What is this?

174
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,340
Something I prepared for you.

175
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,750
- Thanks. Then I'll get going.
- Wait!

176
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,230
I still have something I want to say to you.

177
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,870
If you have something to say, just call me.

178
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,880
I like you!

179
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,630
Do you know what you're saying?

180
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,980
I do.

181
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,910
But I think you don't really like me.

182
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:17,950
You're just... used to having me pester you all the time.

183
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,150
Once I ignore you, you can't help but feel down.

184
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,950
It's just like those toys you didn't like when you were a kid.

185
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,060
You didn't think much of them when you had them.

186
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,470
But if you lost them...

187
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,990
you would get upset.

188
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,280
He Xin!

189
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,830
He Xin?

190
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,860
- Where's He Xin?
- Coming!

191
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,350
Whether you believe me or not,

192
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,730
I know that I sincerely mean it.

193
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,270
Then I'll also sincerely reject you.

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,920
I had no idea that Lin Kaituo could do this kind of thing.

212
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,570
He's making things difficult.

216
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,020
Hello.

217
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,110
Ah, hello. Are you Miss He Xin?

218
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,030
Who's this?

219
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,470
I'm from the logistics company.

220
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,690
Your friend, Mr. Lin Kaituo, borrowed an electric pedicab from us.

221
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,790
Please ask him when he will return it to us.

222
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,680
What?

223
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,910
Why did he borrow a pedicab from you guys?

224
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,400
He came here at the crack of dawn to pick up a package of digital pens.

225
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,690
Exactly what's going on?

226
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,100
I'm bringing out the materials right now.

227
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,140
No problem.

228
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,970
Okay. Just leave this matter with me.

229
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,470
Don't worry. Okay, good.

230
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,870
Those inside, move faster!

231
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,790
Everyone go faster. The sooner we get it done, the sooner you get off work.

232
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,380
Hello, I want to pick up an express delivery package.

233
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,150
Express package? What express package?

234
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,020
This is the tracking number.

235
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,860
Originally, this was supposed to go to the Haicheng University, but it was mistakenly sent here.

236
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,220
We're in a hurry, so I came myself to pick it up.

237
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,390
Oh, this package? They've been rushing us for about 180 times already.

238
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,870
- It's there. Those two.
- Thank you.

239
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,970
Be careful there, guys. Don't break it.

240
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,760
Buddy, can you loan me one of those pedicabs?

241
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,860
The boxes are too big; they won't fit on my bike.

242
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,150
We can't do that. If you take it and don't bring it back, what would I do?

243
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,730
I'll rent the pedicab for a 100¥ ($15.00 USD) day. Then...

244
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,630
I'll leave 500¥ ($60.00 USD) as security deposit. Then there's my electric bike.

245
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,710
I can leave it all with you as security. Will that work?

246
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,590
Okay. Then, when you bring it back, don't forget to charge the battery.

247
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,030
No problem. Thank you.

248
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,310
He left really early in the morning.

249
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,180
Even though our electric car is a little slow, but he should have arrived by daybreak.

250
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,080
It's already been over a week.

251
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,140
The security deposit he left isn't enough.

252
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,570
He was supposed to return it a few days ago.

253
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,450
But he hasn't brought it back. Now, his phone isn't even ringing.

254
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,680
Buddy, don't say anymore.

255
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,340
Right now, I feel a lot like crying.

256
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,790
Lin Kaituo

257
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,700
Sorry, no one is answering the number you dialed. Please dial again later.

258
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,550
I'm done for. Lin Kaituo must be mad.

259
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,950
- Hey!
- Kaituo, let's play some basketball.

260
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,350
What's wrong? Did you eat some dynamite?

261
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,390
What are you doing in our dorm?

262
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,060
I've been calling you all day and it's not ringing.

263
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,070
He Xin left today. Why didn't you come to see her off?

264
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,630
It broke yesterday.

265
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,640
Who provoked our buddy, Kaituo?

266
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,350
If your phone is broken, just get it repaired.

267
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,750
I've been a little unlucky recently.

268
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,230
What bad luck? Tell me about it.

269
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,460
Get out.

270
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,770
How can I give you advice if you don't tell me about it?

271
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,820
She actually refused me. Tell me, does she have a heart?

272
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,910
So you're saying, you picked up and brought that express package to He Xin from so far away.

273
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,980
Then, you even borrowed a pedicab from someone; then on the way back to return it, it broke down.

274
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,050
They've been trying to repair it for over a week and aren't done yet.

275
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,480
Then, you carefully prepared a gift for He Xin and while you were in the process of preparing it, you dropped your phone and broke it.

276
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,790
Finally, you confessed to He Xin and she didn't think you were sincere.

277
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,870
Did you have to repeat all that?

278
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:56,390
Our buddy, Kaituo, really... it's enough to bring me to tears.

279
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,190
So what's your advice?

280
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,190
You have really suffered.

281
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,230
My advice is...

282
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,630
run into a wall.

283
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,710
Not calling anymore. Do as you wish!

284
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,480
Then I sincerely reject you.

285
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,790
Then I sincerely reject you?

286
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:56,880
He Xin, He Xin, why were you pretending to be cool?

287
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,070
How do you still have the face to call him now?

288
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,430
Is there really no one in the model classroom?

289
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,910
I'm worried that the seats in the fashion major classrooms are all taken.

290
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,020
There's really no one. Ten minutes won't make a difference so eat slowly, don't choke.

291
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,170
I can't. My schedule is really packed.

292
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,670
I said that take-out was fine but you insisted on making me come to the cafeteria.

293
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,490
Let's go.

294
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,670
I'm full.

295
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,150
I'll bring it back to the classroom to drink.

296
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,430
Sit down and finish it.

297
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,720
I have to make clothes and practice basketball.

298
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,050
And you're even making me sit down and finish this.

299
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,980
What are you saying?

300
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,280
Nothing.

301
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,670
I'm finished, can we go now?

302
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,270
- Okay, let's go, let's go.
- You take the tray.

303
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,350
When I was younger, this was how my mom helped me stop the bleeding.

304
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:04,380
- Right now...
- What is it?

305
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,860
You really look like a vampire.

306
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:11,070
- Hurry and finish this, so we can go back.
- Yes.

307
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,280
Senior, look!

308
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,830
Haicheng University

309
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,260
It's almost the end of the term. When are you coming back?

310
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,750
You call me once a day urging me.

311
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,150
Those who don't know us probably think you're my boyfriend.

312
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,270
I'm about to die from loneliness.

313
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:41,550
After Miaomiao submitted all her applications, she's been stuck in the library studying for her IELTS.

314
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,640
I'm the only person in this dorm all day.

315
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,630
I'm so lonely that I'm even starting to miss Tang Mengfei.

316
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,380
Where did Tang Mengfei go off to?

317
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,280
I think she's signed on with a modeling company.

318
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,950
She's rarely here.

319
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,080
That's good then.

320
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,660
He Xin!

321
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,940
Coming!

322
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,390
- I've got to go. Bye-bye.
 - What?!

323
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,900
Do you want to eat one?

324
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,570
- Senior Sister!
- What's wrong?

325
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,750
You're back?

326
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,840
I'm so lonely, keep me company.

327
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,540
Let's go eat.

328
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,960
But I have to go back to my dad's company later.

329
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,630
He has a project recently that I need to learn from.

330
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,470
It's okay.

331
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,860
Why is everyone so busy?

332
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,350
- Hey, A Xia.
- Yes?

333
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,730
That...

334
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,270
Does this taste good?

335
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,930
- It's okay. If you want it, you can have it.
- All right.

336
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,060
It must be pretty busy for those in your major lately.

337
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,630
It's not busy.

338
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,830
Then it must be pretty busy for those in year three.

339
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,460
That's true. They're getting ready for internships.

340
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,830
That Senior Da Chao of yours hasn't been showing up lately, has he?

341
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,000
Senior Da Chao?

342
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,160
I heard he recently entered a famous fashion company as an intern.

343
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,800
He comes back totally exhausted every day.

344
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,160
- Oh, Senior Sister!
- Yes?

345
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,390
If you're looking for him for anything, I can help connect you guys.

346
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,180
No, no. I'm not looking for him, I'll head off first.

347
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,420
Bye-bye!

348
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,590
What are you doing here?

349
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,150
Where are you going? I'll go with you.

350
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,550
- You're just getting back?
- Right.

351
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,140
I just got off work, it was an all nighter.

352
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,150
Then you better go back and get some rest.

353
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,110
It's okay, I'm wide awake.

354
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,070
Where are you going? I'll go with you.

355
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,790
It's really okay. It's not really convenient where I'm going.

356
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,230
That's true. You didn't like me tagging along to begin with anyway.

357
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,570
Th-That's not what I meant.

358
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,980
It's okay. Then I'll go back and catch up on sleep. Take care on the road.

359
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,140
Bye-bye.

360
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,530
Senior Sister Miaomiao.

361
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,220
Hello.

362
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,470
Wow, you have such a great mindset.

363
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:32,980
The results for the exchange students come out today, yet you're still studying here so calmly.

364
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,600
You truly are so great.

365
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,240
Today?

366
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,880
Yeah.

367
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,940
I forgot! I thought it was tomorrow.

368
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,890
Don't be anxious, Senior. I already helped you check it.

369
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,640
Thanks.

370
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:57,510
Take a look. This is the initial design draft submitted by the overseas architect.

371
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:01,980
Honestly, compared to our initial draft,

372
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,300
his draft is more practical.

373
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,030
Teacher, didn't we already get the project?

374
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,360
How come there's still an overseas architect participating?

375
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,950
This is how the Fang Corporation has operated all along.

376
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,380
They have domestic architects and international architects collaborate

377
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,820
to create the best design.

378
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:25,670
Then if that's the case, will disagreements over design ideas cause us to be unable to work together?

379
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:30,110
After you guys enter the industry, you'll find that these sorts of collaborations are very common.

380
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,930
It especially tests your communication skills.

381
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,230
I think my communication skills are fine.

382
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,570
Is this Frank the last Pritzker Architecture winner?

383
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,750
That's right.

384
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,850
Wow, he's that amazing?

385
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,670
Then isn't it to our benefit that we get to be on the same project as him?

386
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:52,420
That's why having you guys join the project will broaden your horizons.

387
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,700
It's just too bad that Liang Younian can't stay around for the entire project.

388
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,880
Teacher, you can't abandon me.

389
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,210
Even if I'm abroad, I still have internet. I can share my progress with you at any time.

390
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:07,320
Okay. Take back the design draft and think about it.

391
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,940
Then we'll analyze it in detail and next time, we'll head to Fang Corporation for a meeting.

392
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,510
Okay.

393
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,010
It's Miaomiao. Go without me.

394
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,650
You prioritize your girlfriend over your friend.

395
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,140
Hello?

396
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:41,150
Senior. I got into the exchange program.

397
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,120
Really? Where are you now? I'll go to you.

398
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,070
I'm at the entrance of the library.

399
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,700
Xia Miaomiao.

400
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,330
What is my name?

401
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,760
I don't.

402
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,550
You don't have a brain?

403
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,310
I'll pack up right now.

404
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:22,760
- Hello, Senior.
- Hello.

405
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,710
I can start applying for my passport.

406
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,790
Miaomiao, when will you apply for your passport? Recently, I also—

407
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,590
You'll also be doing what?

408
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,910
Nothing.

409
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,380
Let's go.

410
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,910
Senior, we don't need to be in such a rush to get a head shot.

411
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,790
We need to get our pictures taken today in order to apply for passports tomorrow.

412
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:25,340
It's already Friday. What then? Should we wait until Monday?

413
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,490
We'll still be in time on Monday.

414
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,910
Besides, I haven't taken the IELTS yet.

415
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,940
We'll apply for our passports whenever you say.

416
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,520
There isn't any class tomorrow anyway.

417
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:50,280
Senior, what's wrong?

418
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,160
Nothing.

419
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,790
Why does Wang Yutian still keep...

420
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,610
Look!

421
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,340
You're on the display window, Senior.

422
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,990
You look great.

423
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,640
Excuse me. Do you want to get your photo taken?

424
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,990
Yes.

425
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:19,030
Yes, she needs to have a passport photo for her visa.

426
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,110
Sure, we can do that. Chang, get this done.

427
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,710
All right, come with me. This way.

428
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,420
Wait for me.

429
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:34,370
By the way, Sir. Why is my photo in your display window?

430
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:39,580
This photo was taken very well. I only put it up after I asked your dad for his consent last time.

431
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,940
But I personally didn't know about this.

432
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,540
Please take it down. This is a bit awkward.

433
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,230
I see. Sure, I'll get them to take it down later.

434
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,580
Have a seat first.

435
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,140
- Thank you.
- Head shots are fast.

436
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,150
- Thank you, Sir.
- Sure.

437
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,110
Pick up your photos tomorrow with this slip.

438
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,790
Sure, thank you.

439
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:19,920
Young man, your girlfriend just said that when her head shot is ready, she wants it displayed with yours.

440
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,590
- But you just said—
- Sir!

441
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,230
Just leave it up then.

442
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,870
- Let's go.
- Sure.

443
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,940
- Thank you.
- Take care.

444
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,190
It's great to be young.

445
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,590
Student, why do you keep looking at me?

446
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,460
I didn't.

447
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,790
I just... I just really want to thank you.

448
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,700
What for?

449
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:18,510
Thank you. You've made me into a better person.

450
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,670
Thank you for treating me to this drink.

451
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,370
Just for that?

452
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,870
How do you plan on thanking me?

453
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,230
I'll buy you some as well.

454
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,790
How many?

455
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,740
Ten cups.

456
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,420
Then you'll have to make it ten times more.

457
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,720
I can't afford that many. How about something else?

458
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,790
Something else?

459
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,100
What are you two doing?

460
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:09,700
My neck doesn't feel great these days.

461
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,910
- What are you doing?
- Walking the dog.

462
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,970
Are you done?

463
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,820
Let's go home.

464
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,930
Sure.

465
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,140
Let's go.

466
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,500
Niannian.

467
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,220
Xia Santu.

468
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:52,540
A Little Thing Called First Love

469
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,160
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

470
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,890
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

471
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:17,200
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

472
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,770
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

473
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:26,860
♫ My heart... ♫

474
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:39,230
♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

475
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:51,680
♫ I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

476
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:58,360
♫ Regarding what love feels like ♫

477
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,510
♫ I've only heard about it from friends ♫

478
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:06,500
♫ I never thought about when it would be my turn ♫

479
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,850
♫ You are so dazzling and outstanding ♫

480
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:13,960
♫ I'm just a faint breeze blowing ♫

481
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,800
♫ But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

482
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,950
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

483
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:25,640
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

484
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:32,000
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

485
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:37,750
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

486
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:41,640
♫ My heart... ♫

487
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:52,740
