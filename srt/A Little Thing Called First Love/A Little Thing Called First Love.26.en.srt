00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,290
A Little Thing Called First Love

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,490
♫ I can't find a way ♫

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,140
♫ To prove that love is biased  ♫

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,120
♫ I want to give it up ♫

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,090
♫ But I keep fighting with myself ♫

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,570
♫  Pretending that I don't care ♫

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,130
♫  Pretending to be busy every day ♫

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,850
♫  But in the end, I could not endure it ♫

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,560
♫ I want to know what you're up to right now ♫

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,500
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,630
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,140
♫ I must control myself and forget you ♫

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,650
♫ Not willing to fall into the trap of love just like this ♫

14
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,610
♫ At every moment, you're all that I see ♫

15
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,560
♫ My heart misses you every minute, every second ♫

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,220
♫  I want to control myself and forget you ♫

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,010
♫ But I unknowingly wrote about you in my diary ♫

18
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,590
♫ If this is love ♫

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,120
♫ Why does it feel strange? ♫

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,090
♫ Don't know how it came so suddenly ♫

21
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,060
♫ Maybe time will slowly bring the answer ♫

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,580
♫ Reach out your hand ♫

23
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,140
♫ And drive away my uneasy dreams ♫

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,030
♫ According to you, our encounter ♫

25
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,050
♫ Is the result of heaven's favor ♫

26
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,190
Episode 26

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,830
"Due to cultural exchanges between the east and the west, a lot of new clothing appeared during the Tang Dynasty.

28
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,060
The costumes of Hu Tribe had a strong influence on the era.

29
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,680
Clothes gradually became more free-spirited.

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,160
They emphasized the aesthetics of the physical form.

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,490
Baldric and Hu hat, as well as shoes.

32
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,480
Aside from cloud-shaped toe cap shoes, there was the little barbarian boots."

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,940
This illustrates that back then, we—

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,510
Wake up! Stay alert!

35
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,280
This elective class might be very boring but this isn't where you start dreaming.

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,490
You don't treat elective courses seriously.

37
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,430
That's true. There isn't any credit for elective courses.

38
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,630
Aren't you pushing us into a fire pit?

39
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,250
- Exactly.
- That's right.

40
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,340
Speaking of credits,

41
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,370
I have good news for you.

42
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,660
- You have known about the university's Cultural and Creative Week?
- Yes.

43
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,150
Your performance during this Cultural and Creativity Week will count towards your grades.

44
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,990
So you should clean up your act.

45
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,760
Also this time, you'll also be collaborating with the freshmen.

46
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,660
I've already made the list.

47
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,400
Awww.

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,900
Ms. Jia, can we not?

49
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,590
What's with all the nonsense?

50
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,110
Pass these down.

51
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,540
Ms. Jia, you've even prepared the list.

52
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,160
This is premeditated.

53
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,680
- We're a team
- Yes.

54
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,700
Look, we're working with a junior sister named Wang Yutian.

55
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,320
Her name sounds like the name of a gentle and cute girl.

56
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,140
Why are we on the same team as her?

57
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,010
- Lin Xia.
- Yes?

58
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,410
I think that the clothing of the Tang Dynasty suits you. Make yourself an outfit someday.

59
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,690
Ms. Jia. Make me one. I can be your model.

60
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,150
You're talking nonsense again?

61
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:33,000
Academic Affairs Office Notice: Fashion and Design Architecture Department Collaboration.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,210
Counselors are to contact Instructors of Architecture Department.

63
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,490
Check email for corresponding name list.

64
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,230
This can't be.

65
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,280
Mr. Lu! Mr. Lu!

66
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,590
Ms. Jia, what a coincidence?

67
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,720
It's not.

68
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,960
Is something the matter?

69
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,870
I asked you out last time to dinner and a movie. You didn't show up.

70
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,060
- Actually...
- It's fine.

71
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,180
I've come here this time to invite you to take part in our campus's Cultural and Creative week.

72
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,580
- This, I—
- If you turn me down again, it means you look down on me.

73
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,230
Let me think it over.

74
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,050
Don't think it over. It's decided.

75
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,470
If you really don't show up again, I'll be angry.

76
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,870
Revise this. Okay?

77
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,820
As for the contest's boot camp, it's the same as previous years.

78
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,020
You'll have to draw a draft yourself. The topic is still the science and technology center.

79
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,460
After you've done drawing it, you can hand it over for me to look over.

80
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,740
Right, there's one other matter. It's the Cultural and Creativity Week.

81
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,670
We're collaborating with the Fashion Design Department this time.

82
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,440
I know you're all busy with the boot camp.

83
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,190
As for participating in it or not,

84
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,800
It's up to you. All right?

85
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,950
Start drawing.

86
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,760
Where is Lin Kaituo?

87
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,100
It's been quite a while since I've seen Lin Kaituo.

88
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,670
Liang Younain, do you know why lin Kaituo isn't attending the boot camp?

89
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,980
I can't find him, either. I'll message him in a bit.

90
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,890
- Hey, Li Baiyang.
- Here!

91
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,270
Don't you share a dorm with Lin Kaituo?

92
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,260
I don't know where he is. But Kaituo has been out early and came back late recently.

93
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,100
Go on and draw.

94
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,840
Why aren't you attending the boot camp?

95
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,840
Who has some spare time to go to the Fashion Design Department for me?

96
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,320
To retrieve the proposal for Cultural and Creativity week.

97
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,840
Sir, I'll go later.

98
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,360
All right. Remember to do it.

99
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,530
What are you doing here?

100
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,080
Why are you looking at advertisements for loans?

101
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,950
When did you start following me?

102
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,560
Answer my question first.

103
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,280
Stop asking so many questions. Go back to the university first.

104
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,360
Is it because of your dad?

105
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,940
Did Xia Miao Miao tell you?

106
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:30,250
So even Miao Maio knows that your dad has returned?

107
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,680
Am I the only one who doesn't know?

108
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,070
I told her not to tell you.

109
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,210
I know you've always had a prejudice against my dad. I'm worried you'll act up.

110
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,240
I don't have a prejudice against him.

111
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,290
He really isn't as good as you imagine.

112
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,650
Don't be fooled by him.

113
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,020
Who are you to say that about my dad?

114
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,680
Because I know about the things he's done!

115
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,880
What awful things? Tell me about it.

116
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,470
Anyway, your dad isn't decent.

117
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,210
He Xin, get lost right now.

118
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,050
Serves you right to be deceived.

119
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,000
What's wrong?

120
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,510
About the team Ms. Jia assigned us,

121
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,370
we have a freshman junior sister, as well as Tang Mengfei.

122
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,070
It's my worst nightmare.

123
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,390
Who knows? The freshmen might be a genius in design.

124
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,320
It's impossible. When I was a freshman, it took me three days to attach a button.

125
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,480
The worst thing was after working on it for three days, I realized it was on the wrong side.

126
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,970
Senior.

127
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,080
Senior, what are you doing here?

128
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,880
I'm here to pick up documents for the department head.

129
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,400
How's your preparation for the finals?

130
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,760
It's all going very well.

131
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,400
Did you know that the Architecture and the Fashion Design Departments are collaborating for Culture and Creativity week?

132
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,510
- Pardon?
- Really? How?

133
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,500
Senior Miaomiao.

134
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,290
- Are you calling me?
- Yes.

135
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,270
I'm Wang Yutian. I'm on your team.

136
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,890
Excuse, I didn't hear you clearly.

137
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,600
He said He's Wang Yutian. He's on your team.

138
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,180
You can even hear well in such a low volume?

139
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,470
I'm pretty used to it.

140
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,840
So you're the freshmen, Wang Yutian?

141
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,330
Yes.

142
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,470
I'm sorry. I thought you were a junior sister when I first heard your name.

143
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,140
You...

144
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,340
So you're here to talk to us about Culture and Creativity week?

145
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,960
I would like to buy the sophomores a meal to discuss our project.

146
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,410
Hey, Junior Brother, look at my figure.

147
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,990
Estimate how much I can eat. Do you think you can afford it?

148
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,460
Then I'll buy you a meal.

149
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,350
Sure, Senior.

150
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,830
Don't be too worried, it's actually very simple.

151
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,380
Weren't you also confused in your freshmen year?

152
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,360
I was a bit better than you.

153
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,090
Thank you, Senior. You've burnt a hole in your pocket.

154
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,210
Senior, Wang Yutian also graduated from Haicheng Affiliated High.

155
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,920
He said he knows both of us.

156
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,460
- Really?
- Yes.

157
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,000
I also attended classes at Mr. Liang's art class.

158
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,690
Miaomaio came to deliver rice dumplings once. Mr. Liang even praised her.

159
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,260
What did he say?

160
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,990
He said that MiaoMiao is awesome. He said she improved very quickly.

161
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:11,120
After Miaomaio left, everybody said she's really pretty. I think so, too.

162
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,190
Thank you.

163
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,340
Xin Xin.

164
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,450
A-Are you also here for lunch? We asked you over WeChat.

165
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,600
You probably didn't read it.

166
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,190
Join us for lunch.

167
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,550
Yes, Xin Xin. I promise not to snatch meat from you.

168
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,990
I already ate. Enjoy your meal.

169
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,500
Forget it. Let's eat first.

170
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Have some.

171
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,330
No, thanks.

172
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,930
Stop sighing. You already sighed forty-one times tonight.

173
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,290
What exactly do I have to do to make Xin Xin forgive me?

174
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,220
Become a nun.

175
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,830
Ms. Jia, just informed us. "For tomorrow's event, meet up at the terrace classroom first and

176
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,260
the teachers will assign the sites."

177
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,790
Aren't we collaborating with the Architecture Department?

178
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,000
If we do, you'll get to see your senior again.

179
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,800
I don't think it's compulsory for the Architecture Department to sign up.

180
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,410
Senior is busy with the finals, I don't think he has time for this.

181
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,160
That's the 42nd sigh. Have you brushed your teeth?

182
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,630
Let's go. I'm going to take you to get your teeth brushed.

183
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,750
Let's go.

184
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,020
I don't want to move.

185
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,850
Jeez.

186
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,270
Haicheng University

187
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,450
My goodness. Xia MiaoMiao really revealed her true colors.

188
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,010
Miaomiao?

189
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,720
Why is everyone looking at me? Did I lose weight?

190
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,510
I don't know. Sit down quickly.

191
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,650
JingJing.

192
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,420
What has happened, JingJing?

193
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,840
Take a look at the campus bulletin board. It seems someone posted something to slander you.

194
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,400
Where is the Culture and Creativity activity being held?

195
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,230
Li Ran just left. He seemed to be going to the terrace classroom.

196
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,840
Where is he going?

197
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,750
Good Morning, everyone. Welcome to Haicheng University's "Sound of the Morning" program.

198
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,510
I'm your host, He Xin.

199
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,440
The annual Culture and Creativity Week is about to begin.

200
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,410
The journalists from our club have found out from every department,

201
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,520
Professional skills are applied to bring their talent into full play.

202
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,420
- Why are they quarrelling so...
- They are in full swing to design their products.

203
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,020
Why? Why should we go to your classroom for the event?

204
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,110
We have our own classrooms.

205
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,150
Our model classroom is huge.

206
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,640
Our classrooms are the same size, okay?

207
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,690
I'm in charge of this event. I call the shots!

208
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,530
Liang Younain.

209
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,220
Come here.

210
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,990
Take this list of names to your classroom.

211
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,420
I told you to do it, not Liang Younian.

212
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,460
Besides, Liang Younian is busy with the contest. He didn't sign up for this event.
 [First Team: Xia Miaomiao]

213
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,470
Sir, I'm going to sign up for it now.

214
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,270
It can't be Xin Xin. Someone definitely did it on purpose.

215
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,680
I think so, too.

216
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,070
Everyone, Ms. Jia just handed me a list.

217
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,760
The names that I read out will come with me to the model classroom.

218
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,970
Xia MiaoMiao, Lin Xia, Lu JingJing

219
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:02,180
Li Ran, Wang Yutian, Tang Mengfei.

220
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,450
Senior, don't want to be in a group with a certain someone.

221
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,550
Fine, then I'll cross you off of the list.

222
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:18,490
That's not what I meant. It's because of... Xia Miaomiao.

223
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,500
I'll convey your opinion to Ms. Jia.

224
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,410
The others will come with me to the model classroom.

225
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,470
Let's go.

226
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,180
Are you here to eat or to look for him?

227
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,030
The university's food is good and cheap. It's convenient.

228
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,630
Hey.

229
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,930
Why are you here again?

230
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,310
Your dad broke his promise.

231
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,710
He didn't pay us back with anything.

232
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,930
We have come to you again.

233
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,930
How is that possible? I gave him my debit card right before your eyes last time.

234
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,590
He took the card and said he could pay us back in ten days.

235
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,880
Now, he still hasn't paid.

236
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,460
What can we do? We don't want to make things awkward, either.

237
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,650
Just give me some more time.

238
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,640
I'm joining a contest. The prize is 20,000 Yuan. (~ $3,000 USD)

239
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,680
- When can you get it?
- During the winter break.

240
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,120
Why don't you say next year?

241
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,200
Then give me another week. I'll think of a way.

242
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,820
We don't even trust your dad. Why should we trust you?

243
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,880
I'll hand over my identity card and campus card.

244
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,410
Don't bother. We have your details. It's pointless.

245
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,030
Then what do you want?

246
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,110
Well, your scooter. Leave your scooter with us.

247
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,410
How much is a scooter? What do you want it for?

248
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,390
The only valuable thing on him is this scooter.

249
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,310
His cell phone is pointless.

250
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,850
A second-hand cell phone isn't worth a penny.

251
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,770
Ask him for his mother's number!

252
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,570
Hello, Little Tuo?

253
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,050
What is it? Are you all right?

254
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,530
Did anyone come for you?

255
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,010
Didn't I give you my card?

256
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,370
Why didn't you pay them back?

257
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:21,200
Your card? I told He Xin to return it to you. Didn't she?

258
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,670
Kaituo, I'll take care of this myself.

259
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,000
Don't worry.

260
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,900
All right.

261
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,980
Hello?

262
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,960
How much longer are you going to be?

263
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,810
Hurry up. Hawkeye will definitely be doing a roll call.

264
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,580
Do it for me. I need to handle some matters first.

265
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,480
What matters?

266
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,030
Are you handling that hate post about you and Xia Miaomiao?

267
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,230
What hate post?

268
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,690
You'll know after you read the campus bulletin board.

269
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,370
- Is this Xia Miaomiao?
- Yes.

270
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,100
- My goodness.
- I never imagined that she would be such a person.

271
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:04,160
The script during Culture and Creativity Week will follow this format.

272
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,200
He Xin.

273
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:15,340
I heard you. Well... I'll send it to you when I'm done writing it in a bit.

274
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,380
Are you all right?

275
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,110
What is it?

276
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,640
I saw the post on the campus bulletin board.

277
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,520
By doing so, it's actually bad for you and the radio station.

278
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,200
It wasn't me. How could I have possibly done that?

279
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
I'll head back first.

280
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,150
What's the point in doing so?

281
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,700
So you also think that I posted it?

282
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
You don't have to like me.

283
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,000
But you don't have to accuse me.

284
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
There's solid proof. Yet the guilty party is playing the victim first?

285
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,600
I'm playing the victim?

286
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,800
I really must have been blind to have fallen for someone like you.

287
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Someone like me?

288
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,200
At least, I won't act limp to deceive others

289
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,000
nor keep someone's card without returning.

290
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,500
Or even post on the bulletin board to slander your own friend!

291
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,180
So in your mind,

292
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,400
I'm actually that kind of person.

293
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,100
What more do you want?

294
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,900
Give me back my card.

295
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,200
Delete the post. Now!

296
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,800
Take your card back. That's really not my post. I can't delete it.

297
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:07,200
Moreover, whatever happens to you after this, it will be none of my business.

298
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,300
Sir, can we finish the question first?

299
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,400
Aren't you in charge of the event?

300
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,200
We'll do whatever you tell us.

301
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,090
Fine.

302
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,200
We'll give priority to the Architecture Department.

303
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,400
Let's do some brainstorming. We'll see what products we can make.

304
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,600
Why should we give priority to the Architecture Department?

305
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,000
I now announce that

306
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
we give priority to the Fashion Design Department to make T-shirts.

307
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,200
I disagree. We said this was a collaboration.

308
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,100
What do T-shirts have to do with architecture?

309
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,400
You can do the sewing.

310
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,600
- We'll do sewing? I...
- Teacher.

311
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,200
We can draw the elevation of our university's symbolic building, Advanced Studies Building, on the T-shirts.

312
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,600
What's elevation?

313
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,200
It shows the finished appearance and furnished vertical height dimensions.

314
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,000
Senior, do you have one of the sketches?

315
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,000
It's roughly like this.

316
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,500
This looks... pretty good.

317
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,400
But your department has this covered. What will our department do?

318
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,800
Ms. Jia, we can color them by hand.

319
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,500
We can either use tie-dying or wax-resist dying.

320
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,600
We can actually do it freely.

321
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,000
Then the T-Shirts will have different shades.

322
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,400
All right. You should get your equipment and materials ready.

323
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,800
We'll start tomorrow, all right?

324
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,600
Ms. Jia, aren't you leaving?

325
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,400
Who says I'm not?

326
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,200
- After you.
- I can leave by myself. Don't usher me out.

327
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,400
Miaomiao, I've texted He Xin to ask if she'll join us for lunch.

328
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,700
She's still not replying.

329
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,800
Get going first.

330
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,500
- Miaomiao, you're so awesome.
- Pardon?

331
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,000
You even know what elevation is.

332
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I majored in architecture in my freshmen year. I only transferred to fashion design this year.

333
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,400
It's so hard to get into Haicheng University's Architecture major. You got in, and you even switched majors.

334
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,200
Senior, you're really both ambitious and outstanding.

335
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,900
Thank you.

336
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,800
It's none of your business however outstanding she is.

337
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,300
He Xin, listen up. You mustn't admit defeat.

338
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,800
Why did you have to drag Wang Yutian to the canteen for fried chicken thigh?

339
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,800
Go without me. I won't join you.

340
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,300
I just saw Xin Xin. I'll hang up now.

341
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,300
Xin Xin.

342
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,100
Are you all right?

343
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,400
Did people gossip about you?

344
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,000
I had so many people talking behind my back all day.

345
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
That person who wrote that post deliberately used that name.

346
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,300
He or she must be up to no good.

347
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,000
You didn't suspect me of posting it?

348
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,260
How is that possible? You write so much better than them.

349
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,800
Stop crying.

350
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,380
I shouldn't have blamed you.

352
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,500
It's Kaituo who's blind!

353
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,000
No, I mean he must be blind that he doesn't like me.

354
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
No, I mean he must be blind that he doesn't like me.

355
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,300
But I'm really sorry.

356
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,910
No apology is needed between us.

357
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,800
Here, have this.

358
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,800
So Kaituo has been doing part-time jobs like crazy lately

359
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,800
to save up money to pay off his dad's loans?

360
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,700
If you want to butt in, I can't hold you back.

361
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,000
It isn't as if you don't know what he is like. How can I talk him out of it?

362
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,300
Then what do you plan on doing?

363
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,320
I'll help him gather the money. We'll discuss the rest later.

364
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,200
I want you to stop him,

365
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,300
not assist him in making mistakes.

366
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,700
Someone came to corner Kaituo at school a few days ago.

367
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,160
If I didn't help him, Mr.Lin might have gotten into trouble.

368
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,800
Judging by how Kaituo is, he is likely to get into a mess.

369
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,200
What does this mean? What did He Xin tell you?

370
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,900
You're in urgent need of this, so use it first. Just pay me back later.

371
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,400
Don't bother.

372
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,100
See? I told you he won't take it.

373
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,400
Then pay me interest for it.

374
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,200
How about this? We'll go by the bank's interest rate.

375
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Both of us will benefit from it.

376
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,300
Get this matter settled first.

377
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,600
Thank you.

378
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,000
Don't thank us. Count these quickly to see if it's enough.

379
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,600
I have 12,000 Yuan (~$1,800 USD). Liang Younain has 7,000 Yuan (~$1,000 USD).

380
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
- It's still not enough.
- What?

381
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:13,200
Then... What's left is just... free labor.

382
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,600
Everyone, I'm also taking part in the Culture and Creativity Week.

383
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Now, we've bought a batch of fabrics.

384
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,800
During the event, not only are we going to display our work,

385
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,800
But also run a business. We'll sell our handmade T-Shirts.

386
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,470
We'll deduct the cost and share the profit among us.

387
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,600
How about that?

388
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,100
Not a problem!

389
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,200
Not a problem.

390
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,400
Good. It's the end of the term, so we're all short of money.

391
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,000
Besides, I would like to get a lipstick. Right, Li?

392
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,600
Everyone agrees, right?

393
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,200
Good, let's get to work.

394
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,800
- Yes, let's get started!
- Here, carry these over. Come.

395
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,400
- Tidy up.
- Take these away.

396
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm done drawing.

397
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,800
Is this a large size?

398
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,200
Liang Younian, come and try this on.

399
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,000
I'll hold it for you.

400
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,700
Senior.

401
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,900
Why do I feel like something's missing?

402
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,200
Hold on.

403
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What are you doing?

404
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,800
Relax. I just want to cut a few holes.

405
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,800
I want to make it into a ripped T-shirt.

406
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,800
I'll be careful

407
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,400
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

408
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
I'm fine.

409
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,440
Students, good afternoon.

410
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,200
I'm the host of the campus radio station, He Xin.

411
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,400
The Culture and Creativity Week we've been anticipating

412
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,800
has finally started today.

413
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,600
- No, are you sure? Look.
- It's said that every department's

414
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,400
products will be revealed today.

415
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,200
Be careful when you paste it.

416
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,400
- Be careful when carrying things.
 - The culture and creativity week will be held...

417
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,200
- Don't overcrowd the stall. Spread out
- ...in every classroom.

418
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,100
Don't overcrowd the stall. More needs to be done there.

419
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,200
Students who are interested should take a look at classrooms.

420
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,300
The campus radio will continue to follow up on more news.

421
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,400
"Infinite Creativity"
[Campus Culture and Creativity Week]

422
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,400
The organizer of the event...

423
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,400
Our part is already running. Why aren't you even here yet? You sure like to put on airs.

424
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,100
Where are you? I'll come now...

425
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,600
Mr. Lu, why are you here?

426
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,800
Lu Peng? Mr. Lu... Tell Mr. Lu Peng...

427
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,000
Tell him to take part in our Culture and Creativity Week.

428
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,600
You know, Uncle... When will this soap opera episode with Ms. Jia come to an end?

429
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,000
You know, Uncle... When will this soap opera episode with Ms. Jia come to an end?

430
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,100
Almost. We're almost there.

431
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,400
You keep lying to her that I will show up.

432
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,200
But I never did. Aren't you worried she'll get mad?

433
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,000
The deception that stems from love, isn't called a deception.

434
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,400
The deception that stems from love, isn't called a deception.

435
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,000
What is it then?

436
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,000
It's an act of romance.

437
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,400
Anyway, just hurry up. You keep lying to her. I don't feel good about it.

438
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,200
You don't get it.

439
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,790
Uncle, I suddenly feel like going to...

440
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,800
Haicheng University's Culture and Creativity Week to have a look. What do you think?

441
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,600
Mr. Lu Peng, I'll make you dinner tonight. I'll mop the floor.

442
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,800
I'll help you wash your smelly socks. How about that?

443
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,600
What about rent?

444
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,200
No rent. I'll even pay you.

445
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,600
You don't have to pay me.

446
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,000
I'll see how you behave.

447
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,800
As for this culture and creativity week, I won't attend it.

448
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,400
Thank you.

449
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,000
Mr. Lu Peng, I won't walk you out.

450
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,400
That tea is very expensive.

451
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
- Your two T-shirts.
- Thank you.

452
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Thank you for your support.

453
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
I want one.

454
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,000
One medium size, right?

455
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,000
- Thank you for your support.
- Thank you.

456
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,200
Show me your order.

457
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,000
Thank you.

458
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,000
Medium size.

459
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,000
Thank you.

460
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,400
Can I pay in cash?

461
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
- Yes.
- Thank you.

462
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,000
- What size?
- L.

463
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
L... er...

464
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,000
Okay, thank you.

465
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You paid for a photo. Hold on.

466
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,800
Here, take a photo over here.

467
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,800
Look into the lens. Three, two, one.

468
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,300
Good.

469
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
- Take care.
- Thank you.

470
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,800
- Thank you.
- Put them here.

471
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,600
- One medium.
- One medium, just one?

472
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,600
- Put them here first.
- Thank you.

473
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,100
Thank you.

474
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,300
All right, over here.

475
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,600
You're providing services. Can you smile?

476
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,600
Good.

477
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,800
Medium size.

478
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
- One medium.
- Drink this first.

479
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,400
One medium.

480
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,600
- Three large ones. Pack them.
- Okay.

481
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,100
- Here, take a photo.
- Sure.

482
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,900
Three, Two, One.

483
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,800
Let's tidy up for them.

484
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,400
Are you tired?

485
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,600
Try looking into the distance.

486
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,400
Then roll your eyes.

487
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,600
Thank you.

488
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,200
You're welcome.

489
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,700
We made 8,000 Yuan today!
 (~$1,200 USD)

490
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,200
That much?

491
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,600
The power of fans is massive.

492
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,400
I mean, does everyone make this much?

493
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Yes, aren't we sharing profits?

494
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,200
Younian and I don't count. Didn't we say we'll work for free?

495
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,200
Don't get all wishy-washy. See if you have enough.

496
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,100
We still need a bit more.

497
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Still?!

498
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,400
You know, why are you so poor? Didn't you start doing part-time jobs from grade 11?

499
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,000
Your savings are less than mine.

500
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,390
What did you spend all your money on?

501
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,100
A Little Thing Called First Love

502
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,800
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

503
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,600
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

504
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:46,000
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

505
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,600
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,500
♫ My heart... ♫

507
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:07,200
♫ My heart restlessly beats whenever I see you  ♫

508
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:19,980
♫ I'm afraid to look up, I'm scared you might catch me blushing ♫

509
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,100
♫ Regarding what love feels like ♫

510
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,100
♫ I only heard about it from friends ♫

511
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:36,400
♫ I never thought about when it would be my turn ♫

512
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,600
♫ You are so dazzling and outstanding ♫

513
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,800
♫ I'm just a faint breeze blowing ♫

514
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,600
♫ But fortunately, I ended up in your hands ♫

515
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,700
♫ Can you see my heart? ♫

516
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,400
♫ Can you read my mind? ♫

517
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:01,000
♫ Live inside my eyes, tell me words of love tenderly ♫

518
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,400
♫ I want you by my side, always watching over ♫

519
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,900
♫ My heart... ♫
