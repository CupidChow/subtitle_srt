1
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,593
Ah... my head.

2
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,484
Even the dreams are chaotic.

3
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,030
Wait a minute.

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,949
Ah...

5
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,579
What should we have for lunch?

6
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,503
Assistant Manager Park.

7
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,630
Is your external schedule finished already?

8
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,715
Pardon?

9
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,967
Han-gyul told me.

10
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,804
I saw you leaving hurriedly this morning for an external schedule, Assistant Manager Park.

11
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,142
We finished the meeting well amongst ourselves.

12
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,103
Yes.

13
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,980
May I leave now?

14
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,816
Our team leader really hates tardiness.

15
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,484
Just because of one person...

16
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,570
I also don't want the atmosphere to get messy.

17
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,033
Don't get me wrong.

18
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,451
I just...

19
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,328
handled it for business reasons.

20
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,498
Han-gyul.

21
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,707
Did you happen to... last night...

22
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,876
In a public setting, my private life...

23
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,466
I'd prefer you didn't ask about it.

24
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,969
And since we have a lot of work,

25
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,430
let's try to be on time, shall we?

26
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,353
Yes.

27
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,986
Oh, yes, Team Leader.

28
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,116
Ah... Department Head Kang?

29
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,369
Yes, understood.

30
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,247
Assistant Manager Park?

31
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,947
Do you know Department Head Kang?

32
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,408
No, it's my first time seeing him.

33
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,661
Since this project involves dispatch...

34
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,707
Well, you'll know when you meet him.

35
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,458
Don't let it get to you.

36
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,919
He's just that kind of person.

37
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,171
If you just play along a bit,

38
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,547
it will be over soon.

39
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,593
Judging by what the team leader said today,

40
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,511
it doesn't seem like he came for anything serious.

41
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,100
Just send him off nicely without getting angry, okay?

42
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,751
I've seen the proposal, but...

43
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,253
Well.

44
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,423
Isn't it too textbook?

45
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,843
It lacks a sense of the field.

46
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,012
If I don't say this,

47
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,057
it would just look like a student assignment.

48
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,728
Uh, we prepared three options.

49
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,813
Are you unsatisfied with all of them?

50
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,567
Could you please explain more specifically?

51
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,276
If we go through them one by one here, we'll be here all night.

52
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,904
Maybe if we were having a drink, it might be different.

53
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:02,158
Then we could have a more honest conversation.

54
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,204
Maybe we could understand each other.

55
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,000
Uh... that's a bit difficult today, Department Head.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,710
If you send it in writing,

57
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,963
we will try to reflect it.

58
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,673
Mr. Han-gyul.

59
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,175
Are you uncomfortable with me?

60
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,889
Or are you uncomfortable with places like bars?

61
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,645
Looking all pretty like that...

62
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,605
Do you like men or something?

63
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,023
Is it like that?

64
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,825
Oh my, why so sensitive?

65
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,535
I just wanted to lighten the mood...

66
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,246
and give you feedback over a drink.

67
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,624
Assistant Manager Park.

68
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,669
Isn't it your job to cater to the client?

69
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,337
You people from outsourcing agencies...

70
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,965
Your job is to pour drinks for the client.

71
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,884
Why are you acting so noble? Huh?

72
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,304
Department Head Kang.

73
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,682
Aren't you an employee of a public institution?

74
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,226
I am aware that demanding entertainment is illegal.

75
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,729
Ah, this jerk...

76
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,272
What?

77
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,065
Look at the way he talks...

78
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,401
It's not the way I talk, it's...

79
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:24,615
a principle.

80
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,952
Who do you think you are trying to teach me?

81
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,913
Where did you get those bad manners?

82
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,042
Don't you know I hold your company's livelihood in my hands?

83
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,463
I apologize, Department Head.

84
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,964
I apologize!

85
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,515
Are you crazy?

86
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,153
Haa...

87
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,409
Talk to me.

88
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,787
I have nothing to say.

89
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,413
Why can't you say anything?

90
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,165
You were so confident in front of me!

91
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,541
If I speak...

92
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,670
it will just cause unnecessary trouble.

93
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,299
Rumors will spread, my image will get worse...

94
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,177
I'm sick of that.

95
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,766
So what if there are rumors?

96
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,604
You just have to say it's not true.

97
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,946
You say that so easily because you don't care about what others think, right?

98
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,074
I'm not like that.

99
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,202
It's more beneficial for me to hide my true self.

100
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,497
Now that you know...

101
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,793
If you just bottle it up like that...

102
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,796
are you okay inside?

103
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,265
What does it matter if I get hurt.

104
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,811
I can just leave again.

105
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,814
To wherever.

106
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,068
Is disappearing that easy for you?

107
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,073
Cutting people off like that...

108
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:37,915
Is it as easy as breathing for you?

109
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,879
If I'm tired of people and sick of relationships...

110
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,256
it's better to just disappear.

111
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,800
I don't think that's wrong.

112
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,599
That's my way of enduring.

113
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,314
So, was it that easy for you back then too?

114
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,284
Don't go.

115
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,008
Don't go, Han-gyul.
