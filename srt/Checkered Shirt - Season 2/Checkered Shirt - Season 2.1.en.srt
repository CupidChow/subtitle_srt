1
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,890
I told you I was sorry.

2
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,975
For what?

3
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:18,768
For spreading rumors that

4
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:19,811
I was stalking you unilaterally, Sunbae?

5
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,187
Or...

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,981
For ghosting me out of nowhere?

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,233
Hey, back then...

8
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,694
I told you I did it because I was scared.

9
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,572
Our photo got posted on the campus app, so...

10
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,450
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,535
Please forgive me.

12
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,330
I won't ever...

13
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,667
Don't come looking for me again.

14
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,795
Hey!

15
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,218
You think Park Jeong-woo won't be like that?

16
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,763
When things get disadvantageous, it's human instinct

17
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,514
to hide and cut ties to save one's own skin.

18
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,267
You think he's any different?

19
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,186
That jerk is probably exactly the same.

20
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,108
That person...

21
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,819
is different from you.

22
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,745
It's a bit awkward to do introductions right now,

23
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,455
so I'll have to ask first,

24
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,956
and I'll introduce you later.

25
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,541
Ask first?

26
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,001
Wow, look at this guy.

27
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,836
He said he couldn't even breathe in front of Min-ji,

28
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,254
but look at him now acting all mighty.

29
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,924
Tell me about it.

30
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,676
Hey.

31
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,803
Still,

32
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,181
how about keeping some distance from Lee Han-gyul?

33
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,850
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,774
Min-ji saw a post on the campus app the other day.

35
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,776
He was already famous at that college.

36
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,069
Something about his "preferences,"

37
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,404
or that he goes around sleeping with everyone.

38
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,033
So I'm telling you to be careful.

39
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,828
Be careful of what?

40
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,121
Jeong-woo.

41
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,706
I know you care a lot about Han-gyul,

42
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,166
but you have to go to the army soon.

43
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,418
What are you going to do if weird rumors start spreading?

44
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,379
In human relationships, if you cross one bridge,

45
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,089
everyone knows everyone.

46
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:11,965
Hey, Moon Jae-seop.

47
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,551
What?

48
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,887
Don't speak carelessly about people you haven't experienced yourself.

49
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,226
Did I wake you?

50
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,314
No.

51
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,157
What's this scratch?

52
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,660
Ah...

53
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,912
Well...

54
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,874
I had a little tussle with a cat with a nasty temper.

55
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,181
Tell me what it looked like.

56
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,016
I'll get revenge for you.

57
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,436
It's okay.

58
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,363
Hyung.

59
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,616
Do you like being with me like this?

60
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,743
Of course I do.

61
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,165
Suddenly...

62
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,709
What if I disappear?

63
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,630
I'll be by your side no matter what.

64
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,674
Always.

65
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,518
Hello?

66
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,604
This is Park Jeong-woo's phone, right?

67
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,815
Who is this?

68
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,692
I'm Lee Han-gyul's ex-boyfriend.

69
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,111
Regarding Lee Han-gyul,

70
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,113
are you dating him knowing what he's really like?
