1
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,616
Hey, what on earth is Park Jeong-woo doing these days?

2
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,120
Jaeseop...

3
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,000
Jaeseop, I think I'm going crazy...

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,334
Is something wrong?

5
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,631
Hey, Jeong-woo.

6
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,466
Park Jeong-woo!

7
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,614
Are you awake?

8
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,827
Hyung, why are you here?

9
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,956
Because I'm the one who saved the kid who collapsed on the street.

10
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,293
Do they call that a lifesaver?

11
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,630
Or do they call it fate?

12
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,597
Aren't you busy with work?

13
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,184
I am busy, that's why I'm doing this.

14
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,544
Since you care so much,

15
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,340
why didn't you pick up the phone?

16
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,176
Ah...

17
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,554
Just because.

18
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,562
He's more of a romanticist than he looks.

19
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,774
Who?

20
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,695
Mr. Park Jeong-woo.

21
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,700
I heard he almost got a criminal record because of his first love?

22
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,251
Hey.

23
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,087
I...

24
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,302
I even did an open run at the department store.

25
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,470
For what?

26
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,182
A proposal.

27
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,059
You are a romanticist.

28
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,854
But you know what?

29
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:13,151
The real romanticist is our Jeong-woo.

30
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,362
Why?

31
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,739
For his first love,

32
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,909
he's a guy who even went to a holding cell.

33
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,163
Holding cell...?

34
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:30,043
Ah... our poor Jeong-woo.

35
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,506
When was that?

36
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,726
A few years ago?

37
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,620
What are you talking about?

38
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,545
His first love...

39
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:18,424
It seems they were bullied pretty badly by their ex.

40
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,637
So he beat him up for them,

41
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,139
and ended up in the holding cell.

42
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,226
But the ending is obvious, isn't it?

43
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,107
Let's break up.

44
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,032
They say he went to the army as soon as he settled.

45
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:50,206
But why didn't they contact him?

46
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,128
Must have forgotten.

47
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,010
Or...

48
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,512
The timing...

49
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,393
Was completely off.

50
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,006
Seeing you sober up,

51
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,592
I guess I can go now.

52
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,326
You shouldn't say that, Team Leader.

53
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,869
Department Head Kim,

54
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,705
You clearly made a sexual harassment remark to Mr. Lee Han-gyul.

55
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,207
Go ahead!

56
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,293
But if you act like there's no problem,

57
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,587
I really won't let this slide.

58
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,605
Mr. Yuchan...

59
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,777
By any chance...

60
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,655
Lee Han-gyul's house,

61
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,492
do you know where it is?

62
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,122
Why?

63
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,836
I have something I want to say.

64
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,287
Where are you?

65
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,998
I'm home.

66
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,711
I'm coming.

67
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,005
Right now?

68
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,048
Yeah.

69
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,139
You know where my house is?

70
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,266
I know,

71
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,894
where you are.

72
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,937
Now everything...
