1
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,638
Since Hangyeol prefers coffee,

2
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,265
I'll drink this.

3
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,103
It's an Americano, right?

4
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,700
While this UI maintains familiar patterns,

5
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,119
we need to design something new.

6
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,288
This structure looks very familiar, doesn't it?

7
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,627
Relax a little.

8
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,047
You're our team's best ace.

9
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:51,426
Ah,

10
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,135
and,

11
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:52,802
in this proposal,

12
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,055
the AR fitting feature was added,

13
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,348
why did you drop it?

14
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,103
You don't need to worry about that.

15
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,898
I consulted with other developers,

16
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,940
but due to device compatibility issues,

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,526
I already received an answer that it's difficult.

18
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,449
I think it's possible though.

19
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,579
We can handle iOS cross-platform with WebGL fallback,

20
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,123
and just scale with Kubernetes on the server side.

21
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,751
How does that sound?

22
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,464
Okay.

23
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,132
Give it a try.

24
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,974
Shall we take a short break?

25
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,684
The meeting is overflowing with energy.

26
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,436
It's sucking the life out of me.

27
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,587
You haven't changed.

28
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,590
Just holding the cigarette without lighting it.

29
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,386
Don't follow me for no reason.

30
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,099
I'm not following you.

31
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,767
Just,

32
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,310
coincidentally, like in the old days.

33
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,405
In front of people at the company,

34
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,782
please don't act like you know me.

35
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:41,327
I don't want to.

36
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,663
Even if we force up past connections,

37
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,126
only uncomfortable memories will remain.

38
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,213
They aren't just memories,

39
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,300
they are cherished moments.

40
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,724
To you, am I

41
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,310
just a mediocre memory?

42
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:15,278
I don't even remember it well.

43
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,670
Humans,

44
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,756
need to have good memory, remember dates.

45
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,343
Wife's birthday, mother-in-law's birthday,

46
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,512
father-in-law's birthday, wedding anniversary...

47
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:41,888
Ah,

48
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,680
now I'm more scared of my wife

49
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,308
than my mom, seriously.

50
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,478
Hey.

51
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,189
But why have you been like that since earlier?

52
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,400
What about me...

53
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,652
No,

54
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,072
your eyes look like a dead fish at the mart.

55
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,698
Why?

56
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,991
Is work tough?

57
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,453
It's not work,

58
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,957
if I had to say, it's because of a person.

59
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,125
Hey, but you dug your own grave.

60
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:11,584
Your fate,

61
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,336
you twisted it yourself.

62
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,422
My headhunter friend said he'd introduce you to a better company,

63
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,340
but you said you were moving,

64
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,009
and you insisted on going to that company.

65
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,095
I guess I was possessed by something.

66
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,849
Oh! Here.

67
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,144
My friend I was supposed to meet later.

68
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,438
Ah, he said he arrived early.

69
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,148
You're okay, right?

70
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,442
See you here.

71
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,069
So soon.

72
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,279
Again.

73
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,240
What will you drink?

74
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,158
Good.

75
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,204
What is that?

76
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,999
A cocktail.

77
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,209
Blowjob.

78
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,044
Ah...

79
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,255
So that's what it is.

80
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,339
What?

81
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,799
Is this that famous?

82
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,969
I don't know about that,

83
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,431
but you know this isn't my style, right?

84
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,473
What are you talking about?

85
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,600
Speak clearly, dude.

86
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,270
There is something like that.

87
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,230
Could I get the menu, please?

88
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,195
Drink this.

89
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:21,446
What?

90
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,947
It was tasty.

91
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:36,461
You seem to know Hangyeol, don't you?

92
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:41,716
It doesn't seem necessary to talk about the company here.

93
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,218
Company talk?

94
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,014
I'm just talking about a person.

95
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,560
Hangyeol,

96
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,311
when you work with him,

97
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,146
he really stands out.

98
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,982
He's diligent,

99
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,444
and sometimes cute too.

100
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,406
Talking about others so carelessly,

101
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,534
isn't that rude?

102
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,790
Why?

103
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,875
Are you uncomfortable?

104
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,713
Manager Park,

105
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,590
why you become so cautious only in front of Hangyeol,

106
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,427
I'm curious.

107
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,183
Because there's a reason.

108
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,190
Hey.

109
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,692
Why is the atmosphere like this?

110
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,902
Did you guys fight?

111
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,820
No, since we're from the same company,

112
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,196
we should stick together.

113
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,281
We were just having a nice chat.

114
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,659
It didn't look like that.

115
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,830
Manager Park.

116
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,582
I have something to discuss with my friend today,

117
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,087
so I'm sorry but...

118
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:05,091
could you give us some space?

119
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,856
Ah, yes, Mr. Courier.

120
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,482
About the package I inquired about yesterday.

121
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,195
Ah...

122
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,280
That is my old address.

123
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,492
Ah, yes, understood.

124
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,874
Haa...

125
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,586
Where is my mind?

126
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,080
Why are you here?

127
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,544
Because I missed you...

128
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,718
This isn't my house.

129
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,473
I know.

130
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:29,402
Hangyeol.

131
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,823
I'll ask just once.

132
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:39,412
Are you okay?

133
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,378
Yes.
