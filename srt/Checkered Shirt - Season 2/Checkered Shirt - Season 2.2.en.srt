00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,569
Hello?

2
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,281
I'm Lee Han-gyul's ex-boyfriend.

3
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,700
Do you really know who Lee Han-gyul is before dating him?

4
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,787
Lee Han-gyul hit on you first, didn't he?

5
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,124
No, that's just how he is.

6
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,793
Why do you think he's suddenly preparing to transfer universities?

7
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:47,047
It's because he has a guilty conscience about something.

8
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,132
He...

9
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,925
Do you know his relationships with guys are messy?

10
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:51,968
Hey.

11
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,805
If you badmouth Lee Han-gyul one more time,

12
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,725
I won't let it slide.

13
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,625
So good...

14
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,335
Your smell, Hyung.

15
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,462
When did you wake up?

16
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,173
Just now.

17
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,718
I was shocked because I thought you disappeared, Hyung.

18
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,263
Why would I disappear?

19
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,851
Why do you think he's suddenly preparing to transfer universities?

20
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,020
It's because he has a guilty conscience about something.

21
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,773
Do you think it'd be good if I transferred to our school?

22
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,944
I'm excited.

23
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,904
About the people and the classes too?

24
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,992
Even though I won't be there?

25
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,832
I'll wait for you.

26
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,584
While thinking, "Hyung must have taken this class too"?

27
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:10,922
Ay...

28
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,259
Aren't you supposed to smile when your boyfriend says something like that?

29
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,345
You're making it obvious you've never dated before.

30
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,486
I don't know...

31
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,488
I'm going to do it my way.

32
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,217
Long time no see.

33
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,803
Hey.

34
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,723
Are you still mad?

35
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,980
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,445
I was short-sighted, man.

37
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,989
If you know, then it's fine.

38
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,827
Hey, but what are you doing?

39
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,746
Searching for a bakery.

40
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,498
My boyfriend said he really wants to go to Uptown Bakery.

41
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,334
Hey, I heard that place is super famous.

42
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,711
I think there's only one branch in Seoul, at Donghan University.

43
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,545
Donghan University?

44
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,296
Yeah.

45
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,007
I went there with Minji last week.

46
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,635
Wow, it was swarming with Donghan students.

47
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,637
I thought they were lining up for the school cafeteria.

48
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:07,121
[Jung-woo Hyung: Almost there]

49
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,960
Do you think Park Jung-woo wouldn't do that? Huh?

50
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,586
That jerk is probably exactly the same.

51
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,520
They say this is the most famous thing at Uptown.

52
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,772
You said we'd go together.

53
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,776
Well... I heard the waiting line was super long.

54
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,028
Ah, we still should have gone together.

55
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,365
The weather's bad anyway, let's just stay home, okay?

56
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,034
I heard a lot of fun stuff came out on OTT platforms.

57
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,414
Are you doing this on purpose?

58
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,960
You never even watch movies until the end.

59
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,090
Next time, you have to go with me, for sure.

60
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,719
Shall we go on a trip?

61
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,890
Suddenly?

62
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,520
I heard there's a branch of that bakery on Jeju Island too.

63
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,273
How about we go after your transfer exam is over?

64
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,986
Two days after I take the exam...

65
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,322
is your enlistment, Hyung.

66
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,950
That's exactly why we should go.

67
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,041
Well... do you like that idea?

68

[Day of Jeju Island Trip]

[Lee Han-gyul: I just arrived!]

70
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,035
Hyung!

71
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,851
Oh, Han-gyul, it's Jaeseop Hyung.

72
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,937
Yes.

73
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,064
Ah...

74
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,525
The thing is, Jung-woo...

75
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,860
He says he can't make it to Jeju today.

76
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,946
He asked me to tell you not to wait for him.

77
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,825
Ah, why are you telling me that, Hyung...?

78
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,204
Listen...

79
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,999
Jung-woo might contact you, so just wait for now.

80
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,126
Huh?

81
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,293
I'm hanging up.

82
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,629
H-hello?

83
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,213
Hyung.

[Lee Han-gyul: Why can't I reach you?]

86
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,621
Since that day,

87
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,874
to anyone, about Jung-woo Hyung's news...

88
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,835
I couldn't hear a thing.
