1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,677
Who cares if I get hurt?

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,389
I can just leave again.

3
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,100
To anywhere.

4
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,105
Is disappearing that easy for you?

5
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,027
When I get tired of people and sick of relationships,

6
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,446
it's better to just disappear.

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,447
I think that's wrong.

8
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,032
I don't think so.

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:38,830
Because that's how I endure.

10
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,754
So was it that easy back then too?

11
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,599
Don't go.

12
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,530
Don't go, Hangyeol.

13
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,024
Why are you looking at me like that?

14
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,736
The one who left me first,

15
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,738
was you.

16
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:09,105
That day, if I had made a different choice,

17
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,066
would we have been different?

18
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,298
I thought Hyung had disappeared...

19
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,550
I was so scared.

20
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,973
Please pretend you don't know me in front of people at the company.

21
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,518
I don't want to.

22
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,604
Even if we force out a past connection,

23
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,192
only uncomfortable memories will remain.

24
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,821
But I know myself well.

25
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,535
Even if I go back to that day,

26
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,456
I know I would make the same choice.

27
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,921
What are you smiling at?

28
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,547
Someone enlisting in the army the day after tomorrow.

29
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,799
Jeju Island.

30
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,635
Ah, right, you're going to Jeju Island, aren't you?

31
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,595
Did Minji send you the restaurant list?

32
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,264
Yeah.

33
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,684
Hey, but why did you say you were going with your mom?

34
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,686
Hey, if you said you were going with your lover,

35
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,480
Minji, who set up the blind date, would feel 'so great'.

36
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,277
How does this bastard date with this kind of sense?

37
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,330
Hey.

38
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,956
What?

39
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,707
Give me your hand.

40
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,666
Why?

41
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,127
Hurry!

42
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,380
Check it somewhere with no people.

43
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,721
Ah, he's crazy, seriously...

44
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,555
Ah, put it away quickly.

45
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,889
It's a leftover from yesterday.

46
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,391
Ah, you use it.

47
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,065
Have a safe trip!

48
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:31,497
Lee Hangyeol?

49
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,585
I heard he's preparing to transfer universities?

50
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,420
Crazy.

51
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,213
Hey, do you believe that?

52
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,091
I'm Lee Hangyeol's ex-boyfriend.

53
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,844
Do you really know who you're meeting?

54
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:49,015
Lee Hangyeol, he hit on me first.

55
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,850
Ah, he's like that.

56
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,644
Why would he suddenly prepare to transfer?

57
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,562
Because he has a guilty conscience.

58
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,022
Right?

59
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,233
What's this wound?

60
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:03,363
Ah... this...

61
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,783
I had a fight with a cat that has a nasty temper.

62
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,243
He stalked me.

63
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,914
Of course I feel wronged.

64
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,293
If he transfers schools,

65
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,878
I'm going to spread rumors right away.

66
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,048
Hey, of course I'm the victim.

67
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,467
I told you, he stalked me!

68
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,933
Hey.

69
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,066
Ha... you lunatic.

70
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:40,942
Someone going to the army tomorrow,

71
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,319
what happened to your face?

72
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,914
Where's my phone?

73
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,252
Did you contact Hangyeol?

74
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,045
Go and get a haircut.

75
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,007
I'll take care of fixing your phone.

76
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,262
Is it okay to go without seeing him?

77
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,599
What's the point of showing him this mess?

78
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,685
I can contact him later.

79
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,105
What about that jerk?

80
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,191
Do you think he'd dare go to school out of embarrassment?

81
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,611
He's a bastard badmouthing Hangyeol because he doesn't want to be outed.

82
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,573
You are really...

83
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,577
Hopeless.

84
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,615
Hangyeol, I'm sorry.

85
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:37,058
Excuse me... isn't this Hangyeol's place?

86
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,560
Ah... he moved overseas.

87
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,897
Overseas?

88
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:43,981
Yes...

89
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,902
I see...

90
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,326
Hyung.

91
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,454
What?

92
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,875
Do you like being with me?

93
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:07,296
What if I suddenly disappear?

94
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:13,678
I'll be by your side somehow, forever.

95
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:21,060
That day, if I had made a different choice,

96
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,854
would we have been different?
