1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:01,918
Uh

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,631
Minji, I told you it's not like that

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,301
No, no, seriously, it's not

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,512
I told you Jung-woo has a girlfriend

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,015
Yeah

6
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,726
No, he's my best friend

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,352
Why would he lie about something like that?

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,147
Jung-woo?

9
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,734
I heard he's doing well at the training center

10
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,069
Yeah

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,739
Got it

12
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,284
Don't talk about that rumor anymore

13
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,911
It's better to just let it be buried for now

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,873
Okay?

15
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,791
Yeah, okay

16
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,638
Haa... Park Jung-woo, seriously

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:13,448
Hyung, what on earth is going on?
Why can't I reach you?
Where are you... really...?
I'm worried, just contact me, please...

18
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,119
I finally realized it now

19
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,581
What I was holding onto and forgetting wasn't you, Hyung

20
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,459
But my...

21
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,128
Faith towards you, Hyung

22
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,144
5 Years Later

23
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,956
Excuse me...

24
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,584
Do you happen to have a girlfriend?

25
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,712
Ah...

26
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,885
That man

27
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,264
Is seeing someone

28
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,102
Ah... okay

29
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,739
Who am I seeing?

30
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,324
Me!

31
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,243
You're seeing me

32
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:41,995
Right here, right now

33
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,169
I came back from a business trip to Japan after two weeks

34
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,712
Give me some attention

35
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,088
We're going to see each other at the meeting anyway

36
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,631
Why bother calling me out?

37
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,011
Don't you get tired of seeing me?

38
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,934
You said this meeting is important

39
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,187
I'm busy preparing for tomorrow

40
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,148
Okay

41
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,608
Work excuse again?

42
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,694
But you know, right?

43
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,115
That I'm someone who doesn't take damage from rejection

44
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,451
Here we go again

45
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,579
Lee Han-gyul

46
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,456
Let's date

47
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,170
Seriously

48
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,964
Don't you get tired of saying that?

49
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,676
Nope, it's new every time

50
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,510
Because you

51
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,055
Still haven't accepted me yet

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,611
The language school dorm we lived in back in Tokyo

53
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,779
It's gone now

54
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,113
Really?

55
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,033
And the bench where you used to drink

56
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,494
And get all emotional until dawn, that's gone too

57
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,788
Everyone said

58
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,959
That you 100% came back after getting dumped in Korea

59
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,422
No, I just did that to sober up

60
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,176
You can't fool a ghost (Yeah, right)

61
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,389
Blowjob?

62
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,100
Well, the cocktail name is just like this

63
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,144
Hey, don't drink that

64
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,437
Why?

65
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,566
It's not your style

66
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,712
Ah, yes, Team Leader

67
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,509
Yes, of course

68
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,014
Yes, understood

69
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,643
I apologize

70
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,372
I've heard a lot about you

71
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,125
You're famous at the Incheon branch, aren't you?

72
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,084
Not at all

73
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,670
Ah, here he comes

74
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,630
Our team's planner

75
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,548
Mr. Lee Han-gyul

76
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,939
I'm Park Jung-woo, and I'll be working on this project with you

77
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,403
I look forward to working with you

78
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,926
Ah, yes, Team Leader

79
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,137
Uh... I have some personal matters this time

80
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,099
How about assigning this project to another planner...?

81
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,893
He-hello?

82
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,020
Team Leader?

83
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,666
It's been a while

84
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,756
I didn't know you worked with our company for this long

85
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,843
Isn't that something I don't need to know?

86
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,694
I'll speak bluntly

87
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,946
I...

88
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,949
I feel uncomfortable with you, Assistant Manager Park Jung-woo

89
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,451
So, I would like you, Assistant Manager Park

90
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,578
To leave this team first

91
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,958
What's the reason for being uncomfortable?

92
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,252
You said you're a pro

93
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,672
Or

94
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,050
Is there any other reason you can't do it?

95
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,498
I missed you

96
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,222
Do you believe those words?

97
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,767
The look on your face right now, Assistant Manager Park

98
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,645
That is my reason

99
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,191
It's not like we loved each other for a thousand years

100
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,527
I don't know why you're making that face

101
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,369
I hope I don't see you here tomorrow

102
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,422
I missed you too

103
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,675
Han-gyul
