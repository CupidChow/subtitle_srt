(Xiyan)

00:03:03,712 --> 00:03:05,728
(Three years later)

10
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,880
It's Lady Xiyan.

11
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,800
Truly the disciple of Qingmei.

12
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,920
Alluring yet refined.

13
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,960
If you ask me,

14
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,600
she'll surely be the top courtesan.

15
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:18,800
Exactly!

16
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,960
Lady Xiyan.

17
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:27,872

=Episode 2=

19
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,960
Master,

20
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,240
I heard the Prince Regent
returned victorious.

21
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,000
All officials paid tribute.

22
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,600
The Governor of Huzhou summoned
the top courtesan from Meixiang House.

23
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,400
Master,

24
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
may I go with you?

25
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,520
The Governor wanted the top courtesan.

26
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,000
Therefore,

27
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,920
only the top courtesan may go.

28
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,920
Unless,

29
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,880
you wish to replace me?

30
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,440
You're not prepared.

31
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,960
Master,

32
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,720
I've prepared for three years.

33
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,000
Lady Qingmei,

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,040
your palanquin awaits.

35
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Lady Qingmei.

36
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,520
Lady Qingmei?

37
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,840
Are you okay?

38
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,760
You...

39
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,160
You ungrateful fool!

40
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,200
I'll report to the authorities.

41
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,400
Report if you must.

42
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,360
But Madam,

43
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,800
how will you explain

44
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,600
to the Governor?

45
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,560
I know you value

46
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,760
loyalty above all.

47
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,920
But

48
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,440
circumstances dictate otherwise.

49
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,640
Qingmei's face is ruined.

50
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,480
From now on,

51
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,720
I am the top courtesan here.

52
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,440
The one attending the banquet

53
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,960
shall be me alone.

54
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:35,072
(Prince Regent's Mansion)

55
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,480
Pei Ji,

56
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,480
to frame a crime,
excuses are never lacking.

57
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,400
You slaughtered court officials.

58
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,408
Heaven will not...

59
00:06:57,555 --> 00:07:01,120
(Pei Ji, Prince Regent)

60
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,040
Officials of rank one to four

61
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,800
almost have been killed.

62
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Summon the Governor of Huzhou.

63
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,960
Present the gift.

64
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,400
Your Highness, watch out!

65
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,400
Cease your panic.

66
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:09,880
Leave us.

67
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,720
- Understood.
- Understood.

68
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,200
You really thought
you can assassinate me?

69
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,160
Your Highness,

70
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,400
the courtesan acted alone.

71
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,440
I knew nothing about it.

72
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,520
Spare me, Your Highness!

73
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,360
Even if senile,

74
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,960
you wouldn't hire

75
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,600
a defenseless woman for assassination.

76
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,400
You appear wise,

77
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,240
yet prove utterly foolish.

78
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,560
What?

79
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,160
By the Governor's commission,

80
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,360
I came to entertain you.

81
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,520
But your mind appears set.

82
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,760
Any tribute offered

83
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,160
becomes these officials' death warrant.

84
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,480
Since death awaits regardless,

85
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,760
I'll stake my life

86
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,800
to protect my patron.

87
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,240
Though your foolish loyalty is absurd,

88
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,640
you're better than the learned villains.

89
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,360
I fight for the kingdom,

90
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,400
while you plot corruption.

91
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,480
Even a courtesan shows more integrity.

92
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,120
Get lost.

93
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,880
This old fool's fate concerns you not.

94
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,920
You praised me,

95
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,240
seeming pleased.

96
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,600
But you didn't spare the Governor.

97
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,480
I don't understand.

98
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,000
Are you satisfied with me

99
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,200
or not?

100
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,760
You're the first

101
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,200
who tried to assassinate me

102
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,320
and still keep your head.

103
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,840
You are also the first

104
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,640
whose wish I failed to fulfill

105
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,920
with my performance.

106
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,960
You make it sound as if I'm ignorant.

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,240
Your Highness, dare you

108
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,080
make a wager with me?

109
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,720
Wager the Governor of Huzhou

110
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,680
and your life.

111
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,040
As

112
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:40,840
your wish.

113
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,480
No, Your Highness!

114
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,840
I don't want to die.

115
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,600
They say your archery skills are divine.

116
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,720
You can pierce an enemy's throat
from a hundred paces,

117
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,120
crushing the northern forces.

118
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,840
This fan holds four jade beads.

119
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,880
If I complete my dance

120
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,120
and you shoot down all the beads,

121
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,840
you win.

122
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,800
If you fail,

123
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,040
spare the Governor.

124
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,880
Is that acceptable?

125
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,200
Start the music.

126
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,560
Your Highness, thanks to your grace.

127
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,040
