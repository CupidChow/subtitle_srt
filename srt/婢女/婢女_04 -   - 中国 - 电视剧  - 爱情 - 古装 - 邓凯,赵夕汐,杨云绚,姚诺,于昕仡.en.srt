00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:34,144
=Episode 4=

3
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,040
Your Highness?

4
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,560
How did you know this tune?

5
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,440
It was taught to me by a musician
who once served in the palace.

6
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:20,128
Had no idea it'd offend you.

7
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,040
I shall never play it again.

8
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,040
Finish playing.

9
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,688
(Pei Ji's Disciplinary Record)

10
00:02:42,688 --> 00:02:44,080
(Pei Ji's Background, Pei Ji's Merits)
This is all that could be found

11
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,160
regarding Pei Ji.

12
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Starting today,

13
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,600
I'll strive to understand you

14
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,520
more than I understand myself.

15
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,560
(Pei Ji, this was the piece
you composed)

16
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,360
(after your mother's death
in the cold palace.)

17
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,160
(Do you know what efforts I've made)

18
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,760
(to reach this day?)

19
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,920
Your Highness?

20
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,320
This place is too secluded.

21
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,200
Let me take you elsewhere.

22
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,240
I'm merely a courtesan recovering
at the mansion.

23
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,200
I'll return to Meixiang House tomorrow.

24
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,880
No need to trouble you.

25
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,880
From now on,

26
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,360
you shall be my concubine.

27
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,320
Move to the side courtyard
near the study.

28
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,200
Want to harm me?

29
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,880
Perfect. I'll just use this chance.

30
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,520
Don't touch my mother.

31
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,560
Don't touch my mother!

32
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't touch my mother.

33
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,480
Shen Yuqing,

34
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,080
today

35
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,680
will be your last day.

36
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,760
You're not...

37
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,960
With my mother's murder
and child theft still unavenged,

38
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,520
how dare I die?

39
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,104
What?

40
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,120
Still trying to send word
to Shen Yuanjin?

41
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,280
You won't get the chance.

42
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,920
When the coroner
examines the scene tomorrow,

43
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,040
he'll find you broke
into my chamber to steal,

44
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,400
and then

45
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,160
accidentally burned to death.

46
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,608
Unjust?

47
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,680
My mother and I suffered
greater injustice than yours.

48
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,920
Yet you showed no mercy.

49
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,560
(Yuanjin, the show begins.)

50
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:58,800
(The Prince Regent you pine for)

51
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:01,480
(will become my sharpest blade)

52
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:03,232
(to wield as I please,)

53
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:05,120
(avenge me,)

54
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:07,392
(and claim your life.)

55
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Your Highness, bad news.

56
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,200
His Highness carried that courtesan
into his study

57
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,440
and promoted her to concubine.

58
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:20,288
(Changyi, Eunuch of the mansion)

59
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
Where's Que'nu?

60
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,360
Thank you, Your Highness,

61
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,640
for granting me status.

62
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,640
You schemed to know me

63
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,720
and approached me.

64
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,880
All to seduce me, right?

65
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,280
Then my purpose

66
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,240
has been achieved?

67
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,440
Now I shall see

68
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,080
what other tricks you possess.

69
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,880
It's you?

70
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,000
(Could he have recognized me?)

71
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,600
How many women have you favored?

72
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,760
Or are you mistaking me

73
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,400
for someone else?

74
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,520
(No floral mark. Not her.)

75
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,400
Your Highness,

76
00:09:10,696 --> 00:09:11,936
the side courtyard caught fire.

77
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:13,360
Que'nu was burned alive inside.

78
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,520
Que'nu stayed safe in my mansion

79
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,080
for three years.

80
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,840
After one day with you,
she lost her life.

81
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,240
It seems your goal

82
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
extends beyond just me.

83
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,920
I stayed in your arms all night.

84
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,760
Had I been the one burned tonight,

85
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,760
would you have pitied me

86
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,840
and sought justice?

87
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:50,304
Your Highness,

88
00:09:50,304 --> 00:09:52,026
the Princess Consort requests
your decision.

89
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,360
Such domestic matters

90
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,080
shall be handled by her.

91
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,560
Her Highness still awaits you.

92
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,040
You should go.

93
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,840
You're dismissing me?

94
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,000
My mood has soured tonight.

95
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,440
Tomorrow I'll serve tea
to the Princess Consort.

96
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,280
If you truly care,

97
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,760
you should go now.

98
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,240
(This woman intrigues me.)

99
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,240
(I'll observe a while longer)

100
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,400
(to discern her true intentions.)

101
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,360
Mother,

102
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,200
don't worry.

103
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,760
I'll send

104
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,000
each of them down

105
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,040
to meet you.

106
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

107
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,840
Last night, you gifted me a raging fire.

108
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,480
Today,

109
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,000
I shall return the favor
with a small gift of my own.

110
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,400
Lady Ye holds a noble status.

111
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,640
It's truly difficult to meet you.

112
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
Qingmei,

113
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,040
this place isn't for you.

114
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
Considering our master-disciple bond,

115
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,600
I don't wish to be ruthless.

116
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,760
Hurry back to Meixiang House.

117
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,400
So eager to send her away.

118
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,280
Are you afraid she'll expose
what you've been desperately hiding?

119
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,440
Shen

120
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,720
