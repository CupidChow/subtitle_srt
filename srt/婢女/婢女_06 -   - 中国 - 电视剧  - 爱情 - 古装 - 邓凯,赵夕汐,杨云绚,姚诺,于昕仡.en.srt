00:01:31,572 --> 00:01:34,368
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,480
No more escaping.

4
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,400
Got you now.

5
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,520
Just give it a try.

6
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,760
Just give it a try.

7
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,384
Try it.

8
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:57,280
Let go!

9
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,304
Let me go.

10
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,120
Try it.

11
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,440
Open the door!

12
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,160
Lady Jifu is attacking
the Princess Consort!

13
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,280
Someone help!

14
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,160
Let go of me!

15
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,128
Lady Jifu.

16
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:09,880
Lady Jifu.

17
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,680
Lady Jifu, this is the Princess Consort!

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,360
(Shen Yuanjin, Lin Jifu became like this
because of you.)

19
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,600
(You sowed the evil seed.)

20
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,760
(Now you shall reap the bitter harvest.)

21
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,840
Lady Jifu, release her now.

22
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Wake up, Lady Jifu.

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
Someone help!

24
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,440
Lady Jifu, this is the Princess Consort!

25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,040
Shen Yuanjin,

26
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,840
how dare you hit me?

27
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,040
Confiscate all the euphoria powder!

28
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,680
No more usage until the banquet!

29
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,760
- You...
- Understood.

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,800
I warned you.

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,640
Ye Xiyan is no longer the Shen Yuqing

32
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,280
who bowed low and suffered humiliation.

33
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,440
Snap out of your delusions.

34
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,080
Stop being her puppet.

35
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,920
Hypocrite.

36
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,760
You only know how to play

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,720
the docile little wife before Pei Ji.

38
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,120
Aren't you tired?

39
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,080
After the ladies' banquet,

40
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,640
I'll fulfill you wish.

41
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
You'll be the capital's noblest lady.

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,040
receiving the Empress Dowager's honors.

43
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,160
Who needs that?

44
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,200
After the ladies' banquet,

45
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,800
you'll be married off to Jiangnan.

46
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,320
We all want you
to have a glorious wedding.

47
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,440
These few days,

48
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,240
just behave obediently.

49
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,920
Once in Jiangnan,

50
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,000
your husband's family
will rely on your connections.

51
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,520
You won't need to act so restrained
like in the capital.

52
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,600
Today, His Highness

53
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,240
will cast her aside.

54
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,680
Your Highness, you normally

55
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,040
toil with state affairs.

56
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,720
Only after the winter hunt each year

57
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,000
does the household reunite joyfully.

58
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,880
We

59
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,560
shouldn't just enjoy your fine wine

60
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,600
and fresh meat,

61
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,560
but must showcase

62
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,880
our signature talents for entertainment.

63
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,880
Where's Lady Xiyan?

64
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,360
Her beauty and talents

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,400
should grace the opening.

66
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,480
My cousin Jifu is visiting today.

67
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,440
Your Highness, you know she's playful.

68
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,120
And Xiyan is from the Meixiang House.

69
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,000
They've been chatting delightfully

70
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,600
all day long.

71
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,040
They're probably exhausted now.

72
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,240
Lin Jifu?

73
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,280
Greetings, Your Highness.

74
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,960
Someone will never

75
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,720
taste this venison.

76
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,880
My mansion keeps no drug users.

77
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,000
I knew you detest euphoria powder,

78
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,360
but dared not defy Lady Jifu.

79
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,840
So I secretly replaced it

80
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,920
with sachet powder
when she wasn't looking.

81
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,360
If you doubt me,

82
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,200
the sachet's on the table.

83
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,880
Have the physicians examine it.

84
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,200
Then why are you like this?

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,560
I merely used pleasure house methods.

86
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
This powder mimics
euphoria powder's scent,

87
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,120
but when heated,

88
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,720
it becomes an aphrodisiac.

89
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,720
Please leave first, Your Highness.

90
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,120
After the effects subside,

91
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,160
I'll accept punishment.

92
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,200
Knowing it was an aphrodisiac,

93
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,320
why consume it?

94
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,680
To avoid taking euphoria powder,

95
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,240
or to seduce me?

96
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,440
I can't bear your disdain.

97
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,520
My actions today...

98
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,200
You won't blame me, will you?

99
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,320
(Oh, no.)

100
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:31,072
♪Wind comes but never stays by her side♪

101
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,144
♪Like fleeting memories reborn♪

102
00:08:34,784 --> 00:08:37,536
♪As raindrops mark passing years♪

103
00:08:37,536 --> 00:08:40,928

♪A fleeting light warmed the dark♪

105
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,920
Though I long to serve you,

106
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,280
I'd never use vile drugs

107
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,000
to tarnish your honor.

108
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,240
It was you that night.

109
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,120
I must know

110
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,760
the complete truth of that night.

111
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,280
What are you referring to?

112
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,400
I saw the floral mark.

113
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,440
You fancy the floral mark?

114
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,240
You bathe in cold water?

115
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,880
I am easing discomfort.

116
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,880
The imperial physician must have
a harmless remedy.

117
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,640
I don't want

118
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,000
to make it known to everyone.

119
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,080
I'll have ginger broth prepared.

120
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,200
She clearly consumed euphoria powder.

121
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,680
Yet His Highness kept her

122
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,720
and stayed in her chamber so long.

123
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,160
I only drugged him once.

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,040
Now he treats me with constant coldness.

125
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,640
Yuanjin,

126
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,120
give me the powder.

127
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,520
I want to see

128
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,600
how long Pei Ji will tolerate her.

129
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,720
If she acts deranged after taking it,

130
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,240
revealing her hideous nature,

131
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,200
we'll see if Pei Ji remains unbothered.

132
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,280
No.

133
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,560
Forget it.

134
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,240
Properly-bred ladies like us

135
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,000
can never outsmart her.

136
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,840
Que'nu just met misfortune.

137
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,360
I won't risk your safety.

138
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,400
If anyone in this realm dares harm me,

139
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
they'll answer to the Empress Dowager.

140
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,080
What exquisite beauty.

141
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,040
Pity though,

142
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,280
between these brows

143
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,120
lacks the floral adornment.

144
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,720
Heat it up.

145
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,360
I thought we shared
rare rapport yesterday.

146
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,120
I believed us kindred spirits.

147
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,760
Who'd have guessed

148
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,720
you're just
the Princess Consort's lapdog?

149
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,640
She points,

150
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,480
and you bite.

151
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,744
You...

152
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,440
Ye Xiyan!

153
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,960
A mere concubine,

154
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
yet so arrogant.

155
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,560
Have you no sense of propriety?

156
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,520
Today,

157
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,120
I'll knock out

158
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,840
your teeth one by one.

159
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,680
Then slice your tongue inch by inch.

160
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,040
Let's see how you'll court favor then.

161
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,480
Forgive me, Lady Jifu.

162
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,680
These are imperial jewels

163
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,360
for the Princess Consort to wear
at the ladies' banquet.

164
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,800
This emerald-feathered phoenix hairpin

165
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,000
exudes royal magnificence.

166
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,272
L-Lady Ye,

167
00:13:46,272 --> 00:13:47,072
this...

168
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:48,520
T-This breaches protocol.

169
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,880
A courtesan

170
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,960
overstepping like this.

171
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
You should know it's a capital offense.

172
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,640
Only you can properly carry

173
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,120
this phoenix hairpin,

174
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,904
