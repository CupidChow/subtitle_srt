Will you continue to work part-time?

194
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,590
Yes, currently.

195
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,560
I need to get my thoughts in order.

196
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,490
And I help my parents a little.

197
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,190
.Correct

198
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,960
You need to be financially independent to live without being reprimanded.

199
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,320
Is the bike ready?

200
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Yes, ready.

201
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,220
-Take it when you leave. -Okay.

202
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,820
...that bike

203
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,660
Did the owner lend it to you?

204
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,820
What's up?

205
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:58,720
.You

206
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,890
I'm not that curious.

207
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,590
.I'm serious

208
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,220
You look stupid.

209
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,560
What is that?

210
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,620
Do you work in food delivery?

211
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,120
No, my bike broke down, so I borrowed it.

212
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,490
My bike is junk.

213
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,960
Are you tired?

214
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,420
You broke your record today.

215
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,490
I'm not tired at all.

216
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,260
Hey sister, what about international sign language?

217
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,290
It is very difficult to learn.

218
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,160
It's very confusing.

219
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,460
But it can be learned quickly.

220
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,460
I have to take you to the Olympics.

221
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,590
The Olympics are just a dream.

222
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,030
I would be grateful if you could make it to the auditions.

223
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,060
No! You can do it.

224
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,320
...Good

225
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,690
truly?

226
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,860
Yeah, let's go. I'm hungry.

227
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,160
Don't you listen to me?

228
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,420
It went in one ear and out the other.

229
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,620
Provocative

230
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,800
[The bike will be ready tomorrow morning]

231
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,960
[ Welcome? ]

232
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,120
[Your bike is ready]

233
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,820
[ Am I a victim of fraud? ]

234
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,660
[Sorry, I was very busy yesterday.]

235
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,960
[It's okay, your bike is ready.]

236
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,290
[Really? Thank you very much.]

237
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,820
from?

238
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,190
Who owns the bike?

239
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,790
woman?

240
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,560
[When will we exchange?]

241
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,690
It must be a woman.

242
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,390
Is she beautiful?

243
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,420
.I am waiting

244
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,890
Is she pretty? - Wait.

245
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,620
[What about ten o'clock?]

246
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,990
[Let's meet in that alley one last time!]

247
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,320
What's up?

248
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,560
Nothing, let's eat.

249
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,390
.Good

250
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,060
.I finished

251
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,660
"Lee Young Joon"

252
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,790
It's very clean.

253
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,820
I washed it with water this morning.

254
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,660
.Thank you

255
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,090
How much did it cost?

256
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,420
No problem, it's just a simple fix.

257
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,890
...however

258
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,520
No problem really.

259
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,820
...I

260
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,820
Twenty six years.

261
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,360
And you?

262
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,190
I am 26 years old too.

263
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,920
We are the same age.

264
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,490
So, instead of the cost of repair,

265
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,990
Let's be friends.

266
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,420
Why?

267
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,260
There are no honorific titles in sign language anyway.

268
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,820
So we've been friends since the beginning.

269
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,560
Is this acceptable?

270
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,990
Your name in the reference suits you.

271
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,790
I'm not weird.

272
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,460
...actually, yesterday

273
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,990
I asked your sister.

274
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,060
Because I wanted to be friends.

275
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,120
.Sorry

.decent

277
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,020
You must have earned that name because you always smile like that.

278
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,320
...Sorry, I didn't even ask you your name.

279
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,390

284
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:58,190
"It means 'Take a picture of my face and save it forever.'"

...let's have a meal

288

meal?

289

.or something else...

290

Iced coffee, okay?

291
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,190
You fixed my bike.

292
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,360
So on my account.

293
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,020
.Thank you

294
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,560
Sorry, I have to go.

295
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,920
Give it to me, I'll throw it my way.

Are you too busy?

300
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,020
A little bit, I have an internship and a part-time job.

301

...training and...part-time job

302

[ No matter how busy you are, you must eat ]

311

Have a coffee.

312

"Jae Jin has arrived."

313

What does he do?

314
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,090
Look at him, he's suddenly gone crazy.

315
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,790
What?

316
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,020
It tastes good.

317
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,120
Is it good? - Yes.

318
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,290
It's good.

319
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,560
Uncle, this might be better than looking for a job.

320
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Right?

321
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,590
Oh dear, that's his job.

322
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,820
Let him do it.

323
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,290
.Be quiet

324
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,420
Why is there so much food?

325
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,560
I didn't know what you liked.

326
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,960
So I cooked a little of each.

327
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,620

Praise be to God.

330
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,320
You don't have much time, do you? Eat it quickly.

331
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
What is your opinion?

332
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,160
truly?

333
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,060
Let's eat together.

334
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,790
I can eat it at the restaurant.

335
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,920
So, I'll take it all in.

336
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,060
Enjoy your food.

337
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,320
Eat slowly.

338
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,390
how much?

339
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,690
It's okay, you don't have to pay.

340
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,690
It is for sale, you cannot distribute it for free.

341
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,120
Is that enough?

342
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,960
Thank you. I will take it well.

343
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,920

...you-.yes-

349
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,460
Why did you start cooking suddenly?

350
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
Like this for no reason.

351

You can't.

355

You said you would find a job within three months.

356
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,260

What took you so long?

563
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,620
Get it to this address, quickly.

564
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,290
What is this? I'm busy. - Just this once.

565
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,990
Impossible - Just this once -

566
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,360
I'm too busy! I can't.

567
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,760
I can't, I'm sorry.

568
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,620
-I'll set you up on a date. -Shall I take her to this address?

569
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,760
Be careful.

570
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,360
The landlady is difficult to deal with.

571
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:45,220
If you can, place the order at the door and leave.

572
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,990
That's what everyone is doing these days.

573
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,060
But how hard is it?

574
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:51,160
It's harder than you think.

575
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,690
Anyway, don't say anything.

576
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:00,090
Date next Thursday? - Hurry! The food's getting cold, idiot.

577
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:03,390
I am leaving.

578
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,190
It's so cool.

579
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,090
Strange - Beautiful!

580
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:21,760
.This is amazing

581
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,660
..ugly - great!

582
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,520
Not great! - It suits me! -

583
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,420
What is your opinion?

584
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,690
~Yaaaaa

585
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,920
What? Is there something on my face?

586
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,620
No, no.

587
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,860
What are we going to do today?

588
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,190
Are you hungry? Shall we go eat?

589
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,360
...by the way

590
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,790
Do I look like I'm doing nothing but eating?

591
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,420
No, no! Why?

592
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:14,760
Every time we meet, you ask me if I have eaten?

593
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,660
All you ask for is food, food and more food.

594
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,320
.Sorry

595
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,420
This is because my parents run a restaurant.

596
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:29,820
So, what do we do?

597
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:35,490
Let's just go!

598
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:14,890
Great, right?

599
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:16,760
Yeah, great.

600
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,990
When I was a child, my sister and I always played here.

601
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,790
Have you lived here?

602
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,590
My parents still live here.

603
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,420
I come here sometimes to help my parents.

604
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,920
Or when my mind is heavy with thought.

605
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:45,720
Looking at the river helps me calm my mind.

606
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,490
[How's your date going? Don't answer!]

607
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,690
What is your dream?

608
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:11,260
My dream?

609
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,660
My sister's participation in the Olympic Games.

610
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:17,060
Not your sister's dream, but your dream.

611
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,620
.Okay

612
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:22,190
Seeing my sister participate in the Olympics.

613
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,420
What next?

614
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,420
after that?

615
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,020
My dream?

616
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:41,120
.I don't know

617
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:46,790
I didn't think much about it.

618
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:51,220
You should think about it.

619
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,160
.Okay

620
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,160
What about your dream?

621
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,360
I?

622
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:09,320
Actually, I don't know either.

623
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:18,920
I loved playing with my friends during my studies.

624
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:24,290
I graduated from university and received my documents.

625
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:28,360
But I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life.

626
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:34,090
I continued sending my resume.

627
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,090
And I kept getting rejected.

628
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:53,220
I'm not good at anything and I don't know what I want to do.

629
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,920
Just like me.

630
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:00,490
.Okay

631
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,420
...in this case

632
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:06,960
Would you like to find out with me?

633
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:08,360
What?

634
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,620
...as you know

635
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:15,560
We haven't figured out what we want to do yet.

636
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:21,760
If we search for it together

637
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:26,390
We might be able to find it.

638
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,520
We will be able to do it!

639
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:39,860
"Young Joon"

640
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:48,460
I thank you

641
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,420
On my friend request

642
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,120
Is anyone inside?

643
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,390
...a few moments ago

644
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:13,590
Thank you for your friendship.

645
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,120
...but

646
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,520
...from

647
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,660
...the first time i saw you

648
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,090
Sorry, wait a moment.

649
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:54,120
Patient So Ka-yeol was taken to the emergency room at 7 p.m. after suffering from suffocation from a fire.

650
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,360
.Sorry

651
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:38,690
I just inhaled some smoke.

652
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:43,390
Don't tell my parents, or they'll worry.

653
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,320
I'm really fine.

654
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:52,160
How are you doing?

655
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:54,520
Say you're not okay when you're not feeling well.

656
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,220
...how does this happen right before the competition?

657
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,120
.sorry

658
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,260
No, I'm sorry.

659
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,820
I should have been with you.

660
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,960
I'm really fine.

661
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:25,160
They said I could be out of the hospital soon.

662
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,720
What if you can't make it to the auditions?

663
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:38,190
...you suffered for ten years in cold water

664
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,960
What suffering!

665
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,520
I feel warm and comfortable in the water now.

666
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,020
So don't worry.

667
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:50,620
I even set a new record today, so I can take a little break.

668
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:28,290
["Young Joon"]

669
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:12,520
We'll leave first.

670
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,720
Yes, bye.

671
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,890
[They told me I could go home.]

672
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:41,820
[ So fast? Okay, I'll be right back ]

673
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:59,890
It's okay, you don't have to come, sister. The coach is coming and I'll start training.

674
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:25,960
If you pick up this phone, please bring it to [[. Mijung Lunch Box Restaurant. Please, thank you in advance.

675
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,390
Are you well?

676
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,990
How about we grab something delicious to eat before we go back?

677
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:20,090
No, go before me. I have my own plans.

678
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,920
Can I come too?

679
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,020
Why?

680
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,820
I have a topic I want to discuss with my friends.

681
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:42,390
[I'm going to training, you don't have to come.]

682
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:21,320
Are you well?

683
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,920
What happened?

684
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:33,920
I tried to reach you. Didn't you see my messages?

685
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,820
Yes, I haven't seen it.

686
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:43,590
Sorry, but let's not meet anymore.

687
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,620
And please don't call me either.

688
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:07,020
Why all of a sudden?

689
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:09,760
What happened?

690
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,020
.nothing

691
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,320
Did I wrong you?

692
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:16,020
.both

693
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:18,790
So, what's the problem?

694
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:21,320
Give me a reason at least.

695
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,160
You don't have to know!

696
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:33,560
Do you know how worried I am about you?

697
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,720
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

698
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,190
How can you not think of me?

699
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:48,090
Should I be worried about you too?

700
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:53,120
My life is hard enough.

701
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,320
Just leave, please.

702
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,660
Do

703
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,720
Made

704
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:12,620
Life is hard for you?

705
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:10,360
He'll keep delivering food, right?

706
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,360
I?

707
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:20,560
Just go.

708
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,790
Should it be connected?

709
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,120
- I'll deliver it. - Okay.

710
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,720
He is fine.

711
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,360
.I finish

712
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:01,060
I can't access the auditions.

713
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,020
.sorry

714
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,360
"I'm sorry, Ka-yul.

715
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:19,420
It's my fault.

716
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:23,220
...because of me, your dream

717
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:25,990
What about your dream?

718
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:32,020
What is your dream, sister?

719
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:38,060
Do you only care about my dream?

720
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:43,360
Your dream is my dream.

721
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,660
How is that possible?

722
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:50,060
My dream is mine alone.

723
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:53,890
Why would you sacrifice your dreams for mine?

724
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:57,420
What do you mean? What's wrong?

725
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,020
Don't you understand?

726
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:04,920
Pick me up and drop me off every day.

727
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,820
Part-time work to pay for my training.

728
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:11,490
And you even come to the pool every day.

729
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:20,260
When will you live your life?

730
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:26,260
It's all because of me.

731
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:33,160
Do you know how I feel when I see you like this?

732
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,690
I feel like I'm dragging you with me.

733
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:43,560
...I

734
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:47,620
My life...my dream

735
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,160
Even if I wanted to rest, I couldn't.

736
01:16:54,160 --> 01:17:00,060
Even if I wanted to give up, I couldn't.

737
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:04,260
Your disappointment hurts me more

738
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:12,290
.From not making it to the auditions.

739
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:17,390
It makes me feel guilty.

740
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:07,290
Are you here?

741
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:11,860
What's the matter? Did something happen?

742
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:26,390
...delivery, same day

743
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:32,690
Who was at that girl's house you like?

744
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:36,890
Have you seen her?

745
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:40,190
No, I left the order and came back.

746
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:43,390
But who are you?

747
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,090
Her younger sister.

748
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,720
Her younger sister.

749
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:50,820
Her younger sister was...

750
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,260
You must have worked hard.

751
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:58,890
What kind of effort and diligence?

752
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:04,160
It doesn't matter anymore. It's all over.

753
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:06,560
What do you mean?

754
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,320
.Emigration

755
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:12,320
This is not good.

756
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,590
.I finish

757
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:21,790
Nothing ends until it reaches the end, right?

758
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:24,220
What are you talking about? It's over between us.

759
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:27,160
So, call her.

760
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:31,720
Call her, apologize and beg her.

761
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:33,520
Say it's your fault.

762
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:35,190
.I cannot

763
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:38,220
Why can't you? Just call her.

764
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:40,220
Just this once.

765
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:43,620
Just this once.

766
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:45,490
She is deaf.

767
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:55,420
She also told me not to go see her or text her.

768
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,020
So that's it.

769
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:07,720
I didn't even know that.

770
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:13,490
You must be going through a tough time.

771
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:21,910
...is her younger sister too?

772
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:26,690
Deaf?

773
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:29,520
.Okay

774
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,160
What's going on?

775
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:55,060
.nothing

776
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:58,190
Ka-yul trains very well and eats the best food.

777
01:20:58,190 --> 01:21:00,890
I was asking about you.

778
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,820
...my mom, my dad

779
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:14,490
Why did you give birth to me?

780
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:17,390
Because you are our daughter.

781
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,160
.exactly

782
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,290
when you gave birth to me

783
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:27,690
Weren't you afraid I would become deaf?

784
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:30,520
Why are we afraid?

785
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:33,560
Because life gets harder.

786
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,990
.at all

787
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:37,560
Are you scared?

788
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,820
Of course not.

789
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:02,960
Have you been abandoned, son?

790
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,920
It seems so.

791
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,190
Was it clear, Mom?

792
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:16,490
Who does she think she is to make my son sad?

793
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:21,520
...that it

794
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,420
She loves her sister very much.

795
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:35,660
You work hard.

796
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,620
She lives her life very seriously.

797
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,160
So much so that she doesn't even have time to eat.

798
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:57,760
You never once thought about what you wanted to do.

799
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:59,390
Why?

800
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,420
Because she is very kind.

801
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:12,120
She always cares about others instead of herself.

802
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:18,760
Maybe that's why you left me.

803
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,920
Because our relationship might be difficult for me.

804
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:25,220
Why might it be difficult?

805
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:27,990
She can't hear.

806
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:34,720
You can't hear or speak.

807
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,090
Oh my mother

808
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:45,220
Wouldn't you like me to help you?

809
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:47,860
.Okay

810
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:49,960
Why?

811
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,860
Wouldn't it be better if I helped you?

812
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,090
...Yes, but

813
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:59,620
Helping others at your own expense is a burden to them.

814
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:06,290
But wouldn't it be easier if you helped?

815
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,760
Do you know what your help is called?

816
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:11,760
A dutiful daughter.

817
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:13,760
.both

818
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:15,320
What?

819
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:21,420
.pity

820
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:28,660
Why do you say that, mom?

821
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:33,860
We are family, so it's only natural that I help you.

822
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:36,220
...I know? But

823
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:41,360
You can't live someone else's life instead of him.

824
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:47,660
Family is about believing in each other and supporting each other.

825
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:49,960
I don't want you

826
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:54,590
You will only help us if we contact you.

827
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,260
.sorry

828
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:02,260
...Mom, I

829
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:04,160
"It's okay, Yu-Rem."

830
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:13,060
I hope you live the life of "Yoo-rim" from now on.

831
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:19,090
"Not as our daughter or sister," Ka-yul said.

832
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:21,860
"But you are" Yu-Rem

833
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,420
{\an3}.Sorry -

834
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,420
{\an1}.Sorry -

835
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,720
The summer birds haven't come here yet.

836
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:04,990
.Okay

837
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:07,790
I can't see a single bird.

838
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:13,090
I wanted to see them, it's been a long time.

839
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:31,020
Sister, why didn't you meet Young Joon?

840
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,360
I'm not thinking of dating anyone.

841
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:37,460
Why?

842
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:40,090
Because of disability?

843
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:44,160
Because of me?

844
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:49,520
I don't want to be a burden to you, sister.

845
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:52,790
You are not a burden to me. Honestly.

846
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:57,790
Just me

847
01:26:57,790 --> 01:26:59,590
I love seeing you

848
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:01,460
You smile like that

849
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:07,020
This is how you smile when you are in the water.

850
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:10,620
So, can't you trust me?

851
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:15,860
I will start over and make progress on my own.

852
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,020
Yes, I trust you.

853
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:21,620
"So, meet Young Joon.

854
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:25,060
I am the reason you left him.

855
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:30,820
I will not give up swimming.

856
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,120
And you shouldn't give it up either.

857
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:44,890
What did Young Joon say?

858
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:46,220
Have you been abandoned?

859
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,090
What's wrong with our son?

860
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:52,890
...Should I?

861
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:55,190
Don't listen.

862
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:56,760
Don't you hear?

863
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:57,860
Do you mean the ears?

864
01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:00,520
Did I mean the nose?

865
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,520
Nose

866
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:06,120
She is deaf.

867
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:09,190
So don't listen and don't talk.

868
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:13,690
That's why he left.

869
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:15,690
"Because she didn't want to bother Young Joon.

870
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:21,560
So, should I try talking to her?

871
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,020
Would you mind?

872
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:27,490
In what?

873
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,390
She is deaf.

874
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:33,190
so what?

875
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:35,690
Isn't it important that a person's character is good?

876
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:40,260
Frankly, there are those who have been blessed with speech and all the senses, but communicating with them frustrates you.

877
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:49,790
.Correct

878
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:53,520
That's why my heart leaned.

879
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:55,990
Where did he go?

880
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:57,760
This is what bothers me.

881
01:28:58,090 --> 01:28:59,860
Why are you upset now?

882
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,220
"Sorry, Yu-Rem.

883
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:35,420
I'm also sorry for saying I'm sorry.

884
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,820
I apologize to you because

885
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:45,820
I don't think I fully understood you.

886
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:53,290
I thought I understood

887
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:57,220
But I don't seem to understand.

888
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:00,420
...therefore

889
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:03,620
.I'm sorry

890
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:06,220
...and also

891
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:10,290
I didn't know I was the hardest thing for you.

892
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:13,320
Sorry about that too.

893
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:20,220
...therefore

894
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:28,360
We parted ways a little.

895
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:31,120
,both

896
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:32,620
I was abandoned.

897
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,160
...but

898
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:44,020
I don't like it.

899
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:47,120
I don't really like it.

900
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:51,360
Because you don't take care of yourself

901
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,060
I want to take care of you.

902
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:00,660
...Good

903
01:35:02,590 --> 01:35:05,320
I love seeing you smile.

904
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:08,260
And I want to make you smile.

905
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:12,660
.Correct

906
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:21,760
...what I'm trying to say is

907
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:25,820
...I

908
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:46,890
Do

909
01:36:47,190 --> 01:36:49,320
You want to work part time

910
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:55,220
At my parents' restaurant?

911
01:36:56,890 --> 01:36:58,760
Why?

912
01:36:59,290 --> 01:37:03,820
I think it would be great if we worked together.

913
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,090
I am deaf

914
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,960
Are your parents okay with that?

915
01:37:14,890 --> 01:37:17,890
They will understand.

916
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:25,420
How kind your heart is

917
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:30,660
How hard you work!

918
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:46,660
We agreed?

919
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:48,320
.We agreed

920
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:22,490
.Help yourself

921
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:27,160
Sit down.

922
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:32,360
It's beautiful.

923
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:40,490
"Mom and Dad, this is Soo Yu-rim.

924
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:43,420
This is her name in sign language.

925
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:46,320
Because she smiles a lot.

926
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:51,220
I almost forgot!

927
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:55,490
Look here.

928
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:58,090
"I'm Young Joon's father."

929
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:01,490
"I'm Young Joon's mother.

930
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:05,590
Nice to meet you.

931
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:10,790
Our son Young-joon may be childish.

932
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,060
And sometimes stupid.

933
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:14,190
.My mom

934
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:18,130
Sometimes he can be rude and annoying.

935
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:22,360
But when he's by your side, he's competent.

936
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:26,190
Our son "Young Jun" when he was young

937
01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:28,390
He was eating and defecating a lot.

938
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:29,690
.my dad

939
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:38,090
What do you think about the idea of ​​getting back together?

940
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:43,460
Mom, why are you asking something like this?

941
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:45,560
She's here for a job interview.

942
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:49,220
You can date while working or work while dating.

943
01:39:50,290 --> 01:39:51,390
Yes, I like it!

944
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:06,160
"I like it," I said.

945
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,490
She can talk.

946
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:12,360
She is talking.

947
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:18,420
I thought you weren't listening.

948
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:20,220
.both

949
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:23,460
I thought you weren't listening.

950
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:37,660
...So, what I said yesterday

951
01:40:40,590 --> 01:40:41,790
You heard everything.

952
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:50,820
...So, when you said "I like it" a moment ago

953
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:53,920
...I

954
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:56,690
...or

955
01:40:57,690 --> 01:40:58,890
Job?

956
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:09,520
...I

957
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,690
I like you.

958
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:16,920
What did she say?

959
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:27,690
What did she say?

960
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:29,320
Be patient!

961
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:31,990
I did this.

962
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,820
When I was a freshman in college, one of my senior classmates cheated on me.

963
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:56,890
He said that sign language is a form of body language.

964
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:00,060
You can use it to communicate anywhere in the world.

965
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:03,790
So if you want to travel abroad, make sure to learn sign language.

966
01:42:05,890 --> 01:42:08,090
...for this reason - for this reason? -

967
01:42:08,090 --> 01:42:09,620
That's why I learned sign language.

968
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:11,220
Because you believed him?

969
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:25,090
...if

970
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:30,120
...in your family

971
01:42:31,820 --> 01:42:33,660
Are you the only one who can hear?

972
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:36,260
.Okay

973
01:42:40,790 --> 01:42:45,520
At first, I thought everyone was like that.

974
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:49,420
But they weren't.

975
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:54,490
Only our family lived in a different world.

976
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:58,460
Don't live like you're deaf because of us only.

977
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:07,890
You are different from us, but you are not in a different world.

978
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,560
We, as a family, live in the same world.

979
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,220
