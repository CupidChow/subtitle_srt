1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,400
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION,
CREATED SOLELY FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,920
WITH NO INTENTION TO INCITE VIOLENCE
OR DISCREDIT ANY ORGANIZATION.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,600
Wow! We have
some juicy gossip for you all today.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,640
Some young actress

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,200
has released a video clip
with a mysterious man

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,600
who happens to have the same tattoos

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,400
as a love interest of another actress

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,400
- under the same channel.
- Ooh. And online folks are so fast--

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,400
At this rate, our audio clip
will be forgotten, Ma'am.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,320
Call Yi and ask where she is.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,560
I've tried calling her many times,
but she didn't pick up.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,480
SECRET CLIP OF ACTRESS
WITH A LEADING MAN RELEASED

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,400
COUPLE BROKEN UP AFTER VIDEO LEAKS

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,720
Are our people at the construction site

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,440
ready to do what we've asked?

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,320
They're ready.

17
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,080
He's my friend's father.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,040
But a few days ago,

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,160
my friend fell from a scaffolding

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,000
and lost consciousness
after his head hit the ground.

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,360
He was like that for a few days,

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,800
and then he died.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,040
The employer wanted him in the pit where
the concrete will be poured next week.

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,080
Seems like there are
a lot of corpses in this pit, Ma'am.

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,160
Bodies from everywhere end up in that pit.

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,120
It's full of workers' corpses.

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,640
I really have no idea

28
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,960
how to turn their attention
to us as quickly as possible.

29
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,880
I was born without blessings…

30
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,240
Yes, Somkwan.

31
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,120
I want to ask you about that audio clip.

32
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,880
It sounds a lot like you.

33
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,280
What audio clip again?

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,920
Sorry. I've been busy lately.

35
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,920
Never heard of it,

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,480
so I don't have
any answers for you. Sorry.

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,160
Fuck you. What a lawyer answer.

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,360
Well, I am a lawyer.

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,680
Let's do this.

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Send that clip to me.

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,680
Once I've listened to it,
we'll talk again.

42
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,000
But don't forget to check for me

43
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,200
where that clip came from.

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,760
If there's any update,
please keep me posted.

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,520
…Your path is bright and colorful

46
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,920
But mine is full of darkness…

47
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,960
It's almost time to go back to your Madam.

48
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,720
Why don't we do it

49
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,920
a few times more?

50
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,520
How dare you hurt me!

51
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,760
You bitch.

52
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,880
You bitch!

53
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Doctor! Fucking doctor!

54
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,280
Move your ass to my safe house now.

55
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,960
My safe house, not my house, got it?

56
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,480
Come here fast! Bring the first aid box!

57
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Mathee.

58
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,120
- How many times did I tell you--
- Shut your damn mouth.

59
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,880
I have to take someone to Buss!

60
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,800
Get here fast!

61
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,320
I'd like us to pour concrete

62
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,600
in that area

63
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,960
as soon as possible.

64
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,400
Yes.

65
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,520
And if someone comes to inspect

66
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,600
but they're not our people,
don't ever let them in.

67
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Right.

68
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,160
There it is.

69
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,360
What now?

70
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,200
What can we do

71
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,760
to make it big so the press
and the police have to come?

72
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,640
That could be done.

73
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,160
How?

74
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,360
Just that crane is enough.

75
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,320
Topple it, and it's serious.

76
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Will it look suspesious
if a crane topples over all of a sudden?

77
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,080
Will you be in trouble?

78
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,960
That crane is all rusty.

79
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,040
No one has ever inspected it.

80
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,600
It exceeds payload limits all the time.

81
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,000
No one would be surprised
if it's broken down.

82
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,080
To make sure
my son's death wasn't in vain,

83
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,000
I will do anything!

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,880
Shit!

85
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,000
Hello?

86
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,560
The crane fell over the pit
that we're pouring the concrete.

87
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,320
Holy shit.

88
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,320
Yeah.

89
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,760
That's all I'm telling you. We're fucked!

90
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,400
WOROT

91
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,800
- You're ignoring me now, asshole?
- There is no acknowledgement from--

92
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,240
Has anyone told you
about the toppled crane?

93
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,960
Go check whose line
has been alerted and tell me!

94
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,360
BOSS

95
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,040
- Yes, Boss.
- Your side is in deep trouble, Worot.

96
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,120
Will you clear this up yourself?
Or should I clear you out?

97
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,880
I'll clear it all up, Boss.

98
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,240
Damn it!

99
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,280
Born and die… Born and die…

100
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,440
NITIKON

101
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,040
Help me, Doctor.

102
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,960
Help me.

103
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,360
Can you hear me?

104
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,520
I'll treat your wounds. Can you hear me?

105
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,480
Fucking Doctor!

106
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,480
- I'm right here, asshole.
- You asshole.

107
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,560
I called you to help me,
not that bitch! Fuck you!

108
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,560
Come and treat me!

109
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,000
You alright?

110
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,960
Can you get up?

111
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,640
I'll get you to the hospital.
One, two, three.

112
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,200
I don't have a passport.

113
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,280
I'll be arrested.

114
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,240
That won't happen today.

115
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,600
I'll help you.

116
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Try to get up.

117
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,200
Stop!

118
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,920
Born and die… and die… and die…

119
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Many times, but there’s no chance

120
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,160
That us two will be together

121
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,280
Born and die many times
but we're not equal

122
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,240
You and I are night and day

123
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,440
You can smile now…

124
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,480
Everyone…

125
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,120
You can smile now.

126
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,640
I'll have to report this to the police.

127
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,320
But…

128
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,560
I'll be the witness for everything

129
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,800
about what you've been through.

130
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,160
I'm sorry

131
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,040
that I let any of this happen.

132
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,680
It…

133
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,560
It happened with Thicha too.

134
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,200
Many people
have been hurt in Buss's house.

135
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,480
I had to go there and treat them

136
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,240
all the time.

137
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,120
Some could be saved.

138
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,160
But some…

139
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,720
There was one girl

140
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,360
I had to treat her wound.

141
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,440
It was so deep
I had to stitch it up on the spot.

142
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,240
She must have been in so much pain.

143
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,320
But she didn't make a sound.

144
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,920
I recognized that wound

145
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,880
when I treated Thicha on her wedding day.

146
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,040
I'm sure…

147
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,720
Thicha is that girl.

148
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
Cha!

149
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Thicha!

150
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,800
Is Thicha here?

151
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,119
She's not.

152
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,680
She rushed out

153
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,319
and didn't answer our calls.

154
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,200
Mathee said

155
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,599
he’d take me

156
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,160
to Ms. Buss.

157
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,079
Take you? To her?

158
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,520
Ms. Buss knew

159
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,640
I was secretly helping Ms. Thicha.

160
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,680
Helping?

161
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,560
I don't know much, but

162
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
I think…

163
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,320
Ms. Thicha

164
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,360
is trying to expose Ms. Buss's crimes.

165
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,000
UNCLE NITIKON

166
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,400
Excuse me.

167
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,440
- Hello?
- Is Thicha with you, Phat?

168
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,800
She's not with me.

169
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,200
I might be wrong, but I think
Thicha's going to see your mother.

170
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,280
What did you say?

171
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,800
I'll keep it short.

172
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,560
Mathee is dead now.

173
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,760
I'm here with Phoo.

174
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
I'll take her to the hospital.

175
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,840
Before this, your mother told Mathee
to bring Phoo to her house.

176
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,160
I'm not sure if Thicha knows about this.

177
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,400
Okay.

178
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Thank you.

179
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,480
What happened?

180
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,040
Mathee's dead.

181
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,360
And Phoo is injured.

182
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,760
But Uncle Nitikon
is taking her to the hospital.

183
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,040
What about Yi?

184
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,560
He said

185
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,120
she's going to my mother's.

186
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,120
Could you

187
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,760
go see Phoo at the hospital? I will

188
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,720
send you Uncle Nitikon’s number.

189
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,680
PHATCHAI

190
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,320
Whatever it takes,

191
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,840
whoever you used to be,

192
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,840
we'll go through this together, alright?

193
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,880
MISSED CALL - PHATCHAI

194
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,240
If you want to see your mother,

195
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,640
you might have to help dig her up.

196
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,960
Sak ran away like a bitch.

197
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,680
Typical labor worker.

198
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,840
Willing to do anything when I pay him.

199
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,360
But when there's trouble,
he's the first to run.

200
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,800
Do you know why your mother
is under this olive tree?

201
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,920
It’s because no alien worker
has ever hurt me before.

202
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,240
Your mother was the first.

203
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,240
That’s why I keep her near.

204
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,400
To step on her

205
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,920
and spit on her grave whenever I want.

206
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,320
When she was alive,

207
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,920
she was barely useful.

208
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,200
But as fertilizer?

209
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,560
She’s perfect.

210
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,240
Where is Phoo?

211
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,240
Look at you.

212
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,640
Kids these days

213
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,480
don't even care about their parents.

214
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,640
I just told you
I was stepping on your mother’s grave,

215
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,320
but you're obsessed with someone else.

216
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,640
This kind of attitude.

217
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,160
So you tricked my son,

218
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,760
not for your mother
or any ridiculous revenge, huh?

219
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,440
How much does your labor network

220
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,720
want from me?

221
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,640
- Where is Phoo?
- I said she'll be here!

222
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,600
Tell me what you want

223
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,080
so we can end this.

224
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,040
Do you want Phoo?

225
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,080
Money? Do you even still want my son?

226
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,920
Tell me what the hell you want from me

227
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,520
and leave me alone!

228
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,480
I want to send you to jail.

229
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,840
I'm your mother-in-law.

230
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,600
The baby in your womb is my grandchild.

231
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,120
You're just an illegal alien

232
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,640
who stole someone’s identity.

233
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,680
You want to send me to jail?

234
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,320
It's your fault!

235
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,400
We’ll go to jail together, Mother.

236
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,840
Side by side.

237
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,680
And if we want to spit on each other

238
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,360
or step on each other’s faces,

239
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,920
we can do it there.

240
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,520
Do you want your child to be born in jail?

241
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,600
To be the child of an inmate?

242
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,040
You might be a good daughter,

243
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,240
but you’re a shitty mother.
You’ve never thought about your child.

244
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,360
I'm not as shitty as you.

245
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,960
You're related to me now.

246
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,080
We're family now,

247
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,840
like it or not.

248
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,880
You already have a child with Phatchai.

249
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,360
People

250
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,120
don’t get everything they want.

251
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,320
If you want to send me to jail,
think again.

252
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,200
- Can you afford to lose Phatchai?
- Do you really think

253
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,440
your son will choose you?

254
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,640
Go live your life.

255
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,600
Let all of this go.

256
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:32,040
Give your child the good life
your mother could never give you.

257
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,160
Don’t try so hard to save the world.

258
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,400
I'm not even the most horrible person
in this fucked-up world.

259
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,560
Where is Phoo?

260
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,440
Hello, this is the police.

261
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,800
Thank you, Doctor.

262
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,760
AMBULANCE

263
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,320
Sir.

264
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,560
Please come to the station
to give a statement.

265
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,360
Yes.

266
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,880
Hello.

267
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
Sir.

268
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,760
There was an incoming call just now,
but it hung up as soon as I answered.

269
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,040
Unknown number.

270
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,880
Check whose number made the last call.

271
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,240
A crane toppled over at a site.
A lot of corpses. Watch the news.

272
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,760
A crane has toppled over at a contruction
site on the outskirts of the city,

273
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,080
with no injuries reported so far.

274
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,080
However, in a shocking twist,
as the crane fell,

275
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,120
human body parts
were seen flying from the impact.

276
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,600
It is suspected that the remains belong to
immigrant laborers employed at the site.

277
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,880
The contractor, Somphong Laochindachote,
has fled the scene.

278
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,800
We will provide updates
as more information becomes available.

279
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,600
Sir.

280
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,760
There's another phone.

281
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,920
It was left on, but it hasn’t
made or received calls in two days.

282
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,920
What number was the last one to call?

283
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,600
It shows "Bussara", Sir.

284
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,840
Not sure if they are both the ones
in that leaked audio clip.

285
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,560
Look into it right now.

286
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,280
A few minutes ago, it was reported that
Mr. Mathee, a well-known lawyer,

287
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,720
was found dead in a rental house.

288
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,640
Mr. Mathee is one of the people

289
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,000
in the leaked audio clip
that surfaced recently,

290
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,720
which involves deceased labor workers.

291
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,720
Although there is no concrete proof yet,
there is a strong possibility

292
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,560
that these events are connected.

293
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,920
Thicha! I'll kill you!

294
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,480
I'll kill you!

295
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,560
Be with your mother!

296
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,880
Damn you.

297
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,280
You! Thicha!

298
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Mom!

299
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,920
Stop!

300
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,160
- Run, Thicha!
- Phatchai! Let go!

301
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,760
Die!

302
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,080
Die!

303
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,800
My Phatchai is the best,

304
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,920
right?

305
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,920
Stay with me.

306
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,800
Phatchai!

307
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,520
Phat.

308
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,440
Phat, Phat.

309
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,560
Phat.

310
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,680
Phat.

311
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,320
Phat.

312
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,600
Phat, Phat. Phatchai. Phat.

313
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,880
Phat. Phat. No, no.

314
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,560
It shouldn't end like this, Phat.

315
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,600
No. No, Phat.

316
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,280
No. Not like this. Phat. Phat.

317
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,240
Phat. Call an ambulance!

318
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,640
Phat.

319
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,080
No, no. Phat. Don't do this.

320
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,040
Phat.

321
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,840
Call an ambulance!

322
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,200
I'm giving a statement

323
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,040
as a witness for the girl

324
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,880
whom I suspected has been harmed.

325
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,640
Have you seen a suspect

326
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,880
- or a perpetrator?
- Uh, I…

327
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,040
Call a fucking ambulance!

328
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,680
- What?!
- I can't.

329
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,440
I can't.

330
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,880
Nitikon doesn't pick up!

331
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,240
I can't!

332
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,480
I can't let anyone else come here!

333
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,760
I can't.

334
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,080
Call for help! Do it!

335
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,680
This is your damn son!

336
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,560
Phat.

337
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,000
Phat. Phat.

338
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,880
Call someone to help. Please.

339
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,760
I'll give you anything. Please.

340
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,480
Call someone. Call for help!

341
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,760
I can't.

342
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,000
Call someone for help!

343
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,040
I can't let anyone in here!

344
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,000
Phat, Phat. Phat. Help.

345
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,120
- Phat.
- Stop!

346
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,880
Phat!

347
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,280
It will look like
nothing has happened here.

348
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,240
This place

349
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,440
will soon be spotless.

350
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,800
I'll be fine

351
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
because you're a mad

352
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,920
alien bitch

353
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,320
who tricked my son.

354
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,160
You were here to kill me

355
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,160
but Phatchai came to stop you,

356
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,200
and you killed him.

357
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,840
You shot your husband

358
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,840
and were about to kill me.

359
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,240
I needed to defend myself.

360
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,800
All of this is your fault, Ou Yi.

361
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,800
You've killed Phatchai.

362
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,160
You've tricked him.

363
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,080
You were wrong to mess with me.

364
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,240
You were wrong
from the moment you were born!

365
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,240
Thicha!

366
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
Phat…

367
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,840
Phatchai!

368
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,040
I'm filing a report.

369
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,600
PHATCHAI - VOICEMAIL

370
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,800
Please let me
listen to the voicemail first.

371
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,520
I'll prepare a filing form.

372
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,320
PHATCHAI

373
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,360
Whatever it takes,

374
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,120
whoever you used to be,

375
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,480
I've

376
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,600
decided that

377
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,640
I'll let go
of everything that has happened

378
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,160
and move on with you.

379
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,760
We'll…

380
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,600
continue together

381
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,920
without looking back.

382
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,360
Okay?

383
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,840
We'll go through this together, alright?

384
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,840
I love you.

385
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,440
See you soon.

386
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,640
If I decide to love someone

387
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,280
There are no need for reasons

388
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,600
But to have each other

389
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:55,000
It might not be simple
Cause it seems impossible

390
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:00,720
If there's a place we can hide

391
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:08,000
From all the things in life
I'll put all the reasons aside

392
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:21,200
Let our story be just love
Let our love grow closer

393
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,640
Let me be with you together

394
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,000
No reasons needed

395
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,360
I'll have you right here

396
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,640
I'll have you by my side

397
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:41,160
Let the love fly us far away into the sky

398
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,560
Even if it's just a dream

399
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:51,040
Even if it's all we can have

400
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,000
In the world, the population
of immigrant labor workers

401
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,760
is as high as 169 million people,
or five percent of all workers worldwide.

402
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,400
There are over three million
immigrant workers in Thailand

403
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,080
and many more that are untraceable.

404
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,320
After the death of
Bussara Thanakitcharoenphon,

405
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,480
the police still continue
to gather evidence

406
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,800
and found a shocking truth that

407
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,040
Bussara was behind the agency

408
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,240
that is responsible
for illegal alien labor trafficking.

409
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,200
Illegal labor worker trafficking

410
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,200
causes the death
and loss of workers in transit.

411
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,440
And the police have arrested
Somphong Laochindachote,

412
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,560
a contracter in the network

413
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,160
which also involves
Mathee Phonwisetlertsakul,

414
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,000
a well-known lawyer who has recently died.

415
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,480
And it's even more shocking that

416
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,520
Police Lieutenant Colonel
Worot Phisutthikorn

417
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,320
is one of the players
in this organized crime.

418
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,720
And the bodies found
in a crane accident are just a few

419
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,800
in the countless incidents
where their lives have been harmed

420
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,800
and lost in the crisis
of illegal immigrant labor workers

421
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,920
and human trafficking that have been
issues in society for a long time.

422
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,760
Every person
should receive basic needs as a human.

423
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,480
This is about the illegal alien workers
that were brought into Thailand.

424
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,720
A crane fell over and caused
the death of seven Myanmar workers

425
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,280
in Pluak Daeng District, Rayong.

426
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,040
This led to the strike
for compensation from the employer

427
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,520
after claiming that they've been
taken advantage of for a long time.

428
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,160
The current serious situation
led to the question…

429
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,440
It's reported that they're the Rohingyas
from Rakhine State in Myanmar

430
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,120
who've been brought…

431
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,200
The simplest form of equality

432
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,040
is kindness toward each other as humans.

433
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,320
For every life, every dreamer

434
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,160
who hopes for a better life,
for their loved ones.

435
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,200
