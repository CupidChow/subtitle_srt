1
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,280
Mom.

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,720
This is Thicha.

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,640
Thicha Insali.

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,240
I've been busy looking up that word.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,400
Mom?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,960
It means "the one who was born twice."

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,080
Nice to meet you, Mother.

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,160
I'm not used to girls calling me "Mother."

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not used to calling
another woman "Mother" either.

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,680
You're quite interesting.

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,200
I have a gift for you.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,880
I'm not sure if you'll like it.

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,320
Normally, every piece in this house

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,920
was specifically curated by me.

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,160
Like this one,

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,480
and this one,

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,440
especially this one.

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,800
I'm the one who chose it.

19
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,720
Phoo, put it in the guest area.

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,480
I really have no idea where to put it.

21
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,760
I think it looks fine here.

22
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,840
It's empty anway.

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,240
Cha.

24
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,759
Would you mind waiting outside?
I have to talk to Mom about something.

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,920
Phoo.

26
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,520
Take her to the snacks I've prepared.

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,800
Yes, Ma'am. This way please.

28
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,960
Where did you find this girl, Phatchai?

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,880
You must know where she's from already.

30
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,160
Didn't you always spy
on everyone I was with?

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,440
Phatchai!

32
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,520
I'm here to marry her.

33
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,440
You want to marry a girl
I’ve only met for five minutes?

34
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,240
But I’ve been with her for a while.

35
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,600
It's only been four months.

36
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,800
There you go. You knew all along.

37
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,440
You didn't give me any time
to understand anything.

38
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,880
We haven't even sat down.

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,200
I'm seeing you for the first time
in over ten years.

40
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,200
Yet you always knew how I was doing.

41
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,280
I wouldn't know a thing
if I didn't do that.

42
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,280
You avoided me every time
I was there to visit.

43
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,160
You rarely answered my calls.

44
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,760
How do you expect me to feel?

45
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,400
You want me to feel
like I'm nothing to you?

46
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,280
I actually didn't want to come back.

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,760
But Thicha's adoptive mother is sick,
so I followed her here.

48
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,360
And if we must stay
in Thailand for a while,

49
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
we might as well get married.

50
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,400
Don't you worry.

51
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,640
I won't ask anything from you.

52
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,640
I don't understand
why you're so angry with me.

53
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,560
I'm not angry.

54
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,800
At least this time…

55
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,240
You didn't drive me away.

56
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Are you still upset about that?

57
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,760
Mom…

58
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,280
I will marry this girl.

59
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,160
The one you’ve met for five minutes.

60
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,600
I will marry her.

61
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,080
Ma’am, would you like
some lemongrass juice,

62
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,440
tea, or coffee?

63
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,160
The lemongrass juice is Ms. Buss's recipe.

64
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,280
It's aromatic and delicious.

65
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,000
Lemongrass juice, then.

66
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,360
I haven't had it for a while.

67
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,680
Have you been here a long time?

68
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,960
Less than a year, Ma'am.

69
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,400
Did you come alone?

70
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,480
I came with my friend.

71
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,280
Where is your friend?

72
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,280
Have you two been in contact?

73
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,080
We also have some fruits.

74
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,760
I'll bring them to you in a bit, Ma'am.

75
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,600
I like to eat watermelon.

76
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,600
I have some volunteer friends.

77
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,480
They taught me some words.

78
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,120
Ma’am, please don’t tell anyone.

79
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,280
I…

80
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,840
Don't have the permit?

81
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,960
Ms. Buss will arrange it for me,

82
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,080
but she told me

83
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,920
the documents are still not finished.

84
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,680
The documents aren't that hard to do.

85
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,720
But if your employer
doesn’t register you in the system,

86
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,680
that means you don't exist.
You can’t go anywhere.

87
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,360
No one will know if you disappear.

88
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,200
Cha.

89
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,120
Bring the fruits.

90
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,880
Wanna try the lemongrass juice?
It's refreshing.

91
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,680
Are you okay? You haven't eaten anything.

92
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,560
I'm not hungry.

93
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,520
Then I think we can leave.
I’m not really hungry either.

94
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,200
She prepared all this,
so I just tried some.

95
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,680
That's right. Have some.

96
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,200
These are your favorites.

97
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,800
Phatchai told me
your adoptive mother is not well.

98
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,720
If you need skilled doctors,
I can recommend some for you.

99
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,040
Oh, and if she could,

100
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,360
tell her I’d like to
invite her over for dinner.

101
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,080
What's wrong?

102
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:37,039
Why can't I meet your fiancée's family?

103
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
I'll have Phoo prepare a room for you.

104
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,040
It's alright.

105
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,320
We've booked a place to stay, and it's…

106
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,240
in the city,
so it’ll be easy to get around.

107
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,520
What?

108
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,920
Why don't you stay here?

109
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,640
I think it's fine if we stay here.

110
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,080
We can commute. It’s not that far.

111
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,760
Let's stay here.

112
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,920
You should be with your mother.

113
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,840
What are looking for?

114
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,240
A hairpin.

115
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,640
You use a hairpin?

116
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,000
No, I don’t use it. It’s old,

117
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,840
and I kept it with my accessories.

118
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,600
I just realized it's gone.

119
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,880
Did you leave it there?

120
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,880
No, I remember putting it in my luggage.

121
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,920
Did it fall off?

122
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,120
Isn't it just a hairpin?
No need to get upset.

123
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,680
It belonged to my mom.

124
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,760
Come on.

125
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,520
It must be somewhere.

126
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,680
You might've just dropped it.

127
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,880
We’ll go back there soon.

128
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,160
Actually,

129
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,480
I'm so grateful

130
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,560
that you agreed to stay here with me.

131
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,920
I know you're doing this for me.

132
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,480
We can stay for a few days, and then

133
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,080
go stay at the hotel.

134
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,680
That won't be too bad.

135
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,480
Hmm.

136
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,160
I think you should stay here
until the wedding is over.

137
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,480
- For real?
- Mmm.

138
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,960
This is the only time
you'll be living with your mother.

139
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,840
We’ll be leaving soon,

140
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,200
and I don't think
you'll have many chances to visit.

141
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,360
I can stay here, no problem.

142
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,160
I'll go take a shower.

143
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,040
Mmm.

144
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,240
You can't deliver it now.

145
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,640
My son is here.
Later tonight will be fine.

146
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Enter through the back door.

147
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,240
I'm sorry. I coudn't sleep.

148
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,520
No one smokes in this house.

149
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,640
I quit a long time ago.

150
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,480
But I’ll have one tonight.

151
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,280
I couldn’t sleep either.

152
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,720
Does Phatchai smoke too?

153
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,960
Only at parties.

154
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,280
Strange, isn't it?

155
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,040
I have to get to know my own son

156
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,480
through other people.

157
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,360
What do you like about my son?

158
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,560
He's a good person.

159
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,560
Kindhearted.

160
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,320
He's nice to everyone,

161
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,920
no matter who they are.

162
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,920
I was so impressed on our first date.

163
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,359
The waitress made a mess,

164
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
but Phatchai

165
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,040
didn’t scold her, not even once.

166
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,119
That's why he can't see through anyone.

167
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,320
Next time you want to smoke,

168
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,840
you can do it upstairs on the balcony.

169
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,480
No need to come all the way down here.

170
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,360
I'll tell Phoo to prepare an ashtray.

171
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,880
Thank you, but I also like to take walks.

172
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,280
Your garden is beautiful.

173
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,440
All the plants are so green and fresh.

174
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,640
I happen to have good fertilizer.

175
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,080
If there’s ever a time I can’t sleep,

176
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,040
would it be alright
if I take a walk here again?

177
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,400
Phatchai asked me to walk with him too,

178
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,040
but he just fell sleep.

179
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,480
I’m meeting the bridesmaids today.

180
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,760
No need for the groom-to-be to come.
See you in the evening.

181
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,640
THICHA

182
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,440
I'm okay as long as
it's not because of my mom.

183
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,080
You already know

184
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,320
I'm not one to run from trouble.

185
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,400
Tell me if you need a ride back.

186
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,560
Here.

187
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,640
What kind of banknotes did you see?

188
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,080
New ones stacked together or the old ones,

189
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,680
rolled up?

190
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,920
Old banknotes, rolled up.

191
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,320
This is exactly the same
as what we paid to cross the border.

192
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,600
If we can find both
the money and the passports

193
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,440
they seized from our brothers and sisters,
it will make things easier.

194
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,440
All of that must be in the office.

195
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
But we’ve got a problem.

196
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,400
The hidden camera in the object

197
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,400
will only last three days.

198
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,840
We need to replace it?

199
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,720
It connects to my phone

200
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,600
wirelessly, but
the battery needs to be replaced.

201
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,520
I've tried looking for other models,
but couldn't find one.

202
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,680
And that room is
nearly impossible to access.

203
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,360
Bussara has CCTVs almost everywhere.

204
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,520
You can't do the hard work without allies.

205
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,880
I tihnk I can find one,

206
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,880
but I need to be sure

207
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,760
if she’s willing to cooperate.

208
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,440
We'll never know

209
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,600
whose side she will be on.

210
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,360
That's true. You need to be careful.

211
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,800
No one wants trouble
with Bussara’s agents.

212
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,080
What we're doing

213
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,720
is making sure
our brothers and sisters are safe,

214
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,200
including you.

215
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,000
I'll be careful, Mom.

216
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,920
You need to watch out too.

217
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,800
Bussara’s been looking for intel on me.

218
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,400
I'm not sure how much she knows.

219
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,320
So, about the dinner, what do you say?

220
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,560
My daughter is marrying into their family.
How could I refuse?

221
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,160
Besides, I haven’t met Phatchai.

222
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,560
I’ve only heard from you
that he’s a good man.

223
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,560
But I've told everyone
you’re not in the best health.

224
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,760
It’s alright if you don’t go.

225
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,760
I'll be there.

226
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,600
I want to see for myself
what that woman's gaze looks like.

227
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,440
What makes her so heartless?

228
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,840
Thank you, Ma'am. Thank you!

229
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
You didn’t get enough sleep, did you?

230
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,400
When there's a party coming up,

231
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,040
you have so much to do, right?

232
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,560
Let me know if you need anything.

233
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,880
I'm fine, Ma'am. I can handle it.

234
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,120
I wasn't talking about the party.

235
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,840
I meant

236
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,880
when you have to endure terrible things.

237
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,000
If you need help, just tell me.

238
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,480
Thank you, Ma'am.

239
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,200
I thought you’d never come back
to see your mother again.

240
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,600
Well, I got a job there,

241
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,040
and it took up all my time. I didn’t
have a chance to clear my schedule.

242
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,680
But suddenly you’re available
when it’s time to get married?

243
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,800
Surprising, isn't it?

244
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,440
You've got a daughter-in-law now.
It all seems rushed.

245
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,080
I’ve always been hasty.

246
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,360
Your mother’s friend
suspects I’m pregnant.

247
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,920
I understand why you would think that way,

248
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,640
but shotgun weddings
aren’t a thing anymore.

249
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,040
Pregnant or not, people nowadays don’t
rush into marriage if they don't want it.

250
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,640
How does your adoptive mother
feel about all this?

251
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,120
Parents usually agree on things like this.

252
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,360
I bet she wouldn't think that,

253
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,080
but you can ask her yourself.

254
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,560
She should be here by now.

255
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,400
Good Evening.

256
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,560
Good Evening.

257
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,880
We finally meet, Phatchai.

258
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,920
Forgive me. I've been

259
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,600
so busy and not in the best health lately.

260
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,960
It's totally fine.
How are you feeling now?

261
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,040
On and off. Very normal for us old folks.

262
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,440
Please, let me know when

263
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,880
your next doctor’s appointment is.
I’d be happy to accompany you.

264
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,400
Shall we go?

265
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,040
Excuse me.

266
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,640
Good Evening, Ms. Warin.

267
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,760
Good Evening, Ms. Bussara.

268
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,520
Welcome to our home.

269
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,320
Is everything going fine lately?

270
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,360
How is your icehouse?

271
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,920
I’ve heard these days

272
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,480
small businesses aren't doing so well.

273
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,040
Is yours doing okay?

274
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,240
We've managed without any hardships.

275
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,040
So sufficient.

276
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,360
That’s impressive.

277
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,000
I rarely see anyone running a business
without aiming for wealth.

278
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,360
How could a small icehouse make you rich?

279
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,960
It’s not the kind of business
that takes advantage of people.

280
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,320
We live with what we have.

281
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,760
And your business?

282
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,560
I’m sure it’s doing well, isn't it?

283
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,200
Please give me advice sometime.

284
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,680
I think we each

285
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,160
have different management styles.

286
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,280
Is anyone hungry? I think

287
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,320
we should continue this over dinner.

288
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,480
This way please.

289
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Thank you.

290
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,600
Seems like the ice business pays well.

291
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,240
Her bag, her heels,

292
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,960
pretty pricey.

293
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Come on.

294
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,800
Accessories rentals
for special occasions are everywhere.

295
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,120
Don't you know?

296
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,520
As the mother of the groom,

297
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,840
I'd like to ask you straight away
about the dowry.

298
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,320
Mom.

299
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,240
I told you I'll handle this myself.

300
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,520
Um… Mother.

301
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,080
It can be whatever amount you see fit.

302
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,600
I’ve never thought about it.

303
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,520
All the time I've spent raising Thicha,

304
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,240
I never imagined one day
receiving a payment in return.

305
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,160
I just wanted her to meet a good person.

306
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,560
You can decide how much
is appropriate for Thicha

307
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,840
that works with what you have.

308
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,760
Not too much, not too little.
That’s what’s best.

309
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,640
I leave my daughter in your hands.

310
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,120
Thicha might be a bit rough

311
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,520
only because
she had a difficult childhood.

312
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,800
I’d better get going now,

313
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,920
so the two families
can talk about the wedding.

314
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,200
Please excuse me, Ms. Warin.

315
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,520
Phat, Thicha,

316
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,600
could you see Aunt Rattima out for me?

317
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,440
Go ahead. I'll discuss
more details with Ms. Bussara.

318
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,520
Go.

319
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,960
Your dress is beautiful.

320
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,880
The closer I look,
the more stunning it is.

321
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,080
It’s definitely unique.

322
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,640
It's minimal.
I’m not sure if it really fits this place.

323
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,760
It's not just you.

324
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,440
Thicha doesn't fit this place either.

325
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,920
Then what do you suggest we do about it?

326
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,840
Phatchai likes Thicha so much

327
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,040
he asked her to marry him.

328
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,840
For us, people
who you think are different,

329
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,240
we’re not always comfortable with this.

330
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,720
The poor becoming rich
is easier than the other way around.

331
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,920
It will be easy

332
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,160
for your side to adjust.

333
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,840
You have nothing to lose. But for me?

334
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,240
I couldn't stand it,

335
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
to be honest.

336
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,280
You have to understand

337
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,360
that it involves financial status,

338
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,280
reputation, and livelihood.

339
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,760
I’m not sure
how I could explain this to others.

340
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,920
I understand.
And I believe Thicha does too.

341
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,120
If you don't agree with this union,

342
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,720
you need to talk to your son, not me.

343
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,240
I welcome Phatchai with open arms

344
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
because he seems like a kind person.

345
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,760
He doesn't think like you at all.

346
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,440
That’s probably the best thing

347
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,120
about not being raised by you.

348
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,760
Phatchai.

349
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,240
Your mother has something to tell you.

350
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,240
What?

351
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,360
Make yourselves comfortable, everyone.

352
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,240
Why didn’t you tell me there was a party?

353
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,680
Whoa. Oh.

354
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,160
Ow.

355
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,240
Why didn't you tell me you would be here?

356
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,720
Oh, sorry, I forgot. Hang on.

357
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,080
Hello, Buss.
Can I crash at your place? Thank you.

358
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,560
Just kidding.

359
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,680
I had dinner with friends
and thought about where to go next.

360
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,320
Then I realized

361
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,360
this place has some good stuff.

362
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,760
My house is not a brothel.

363
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,880
Stop messing with my workers.

364
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,200
Okay, okay. Just calm down, okay?

365
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,920
It's not a big deal, Buss.

366
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,040
What’s lying under the tree
isn’t a big deal?

367
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,520
Ah…

368
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,200
But what’s under the tree
isn’t my fault, Buss.

369
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,400
You know that.

370
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,320
Or do you want everyone else to know too?

371
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,160
Just tell that girl to bring a towel

372
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,360
and wipe me down…

373
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,600
You're a fricking psychopath.

374
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,840
Thanks for the compliment.

375
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,320
I know you're too stubborn,

376
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,800
but I’m serious.

377
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,360
Don’t do anything you shouldn’t.

378
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,120
Otherwise, I won’t let it slide this time.

379
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,600
I warned you!

380
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,320
Copy. Roger that.
I won't cause any problems.

381
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,960
You know that girl isn’t for me.

382
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,720
She's way too old for my taste.

383
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,680
Phoo, put it down.

384
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,680
Prepare a refreshing towel for our guest.

385
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,520
Prepare a refreshing towel
for the guest in the tea room.

386
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,360
Now.

387
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,360
I should get going.

388
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,400
If you have anything further to discuss,
feel free to contact me.

389
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,679
As for what we've talked about,
I'll tell my son myself.

390
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,719
Go see your mother out.

391
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,560
It's been a pleasure
meeting you, Ms. Warin.

392
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,320
We might meet again soon.

393
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,239
Thicha.

394
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,880
Thicha.

395
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,640
Are you okay? You look exhausted.

396
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,080
What's wrong?

397
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,160
I have a headache. I need some rest.

398
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,880
Can you see her out for me?

399
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,640
I'll lead the way.

400
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,680
Do it properly.

401
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,480
Lie down! On your stomach!

402
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,680
Here you go!

403
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,080
Please…

404
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,760
What? What are you saying?

405
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,200
Damn you!

406
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,000
You bitch, come here!

407
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,200
Get back here!

408
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,760
Get down!

409
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,960
Will you stop moving?

410
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,920
Let go!

411
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,240
Phatchai's girl?

412
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,680
I told you to let her go!

413
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,920
Mind your own business.
Get out and shut the door.

414
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,240
This bitch is just a maid.

415
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,360
It's okay…

416
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,560
Stop!

417
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,800
You're stubborn, aren't you?

418
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,240
Fine, I'll play with you.

419
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,040
Damn it!

420
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,000
Cha! Are you okay?

421
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,160
Mathee! Again?

422
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,400
You broke my stuff again!

423
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,920
Phat.

424
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,680
Do you remember my friend, Mathee?

425
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,880
What happened?

426
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,280
I heard the glass breaking,
so I came to check.

427
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,360
There’s broken glass on the floor,

428
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,160
and it cut my hand.

429
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,120
Phat.

430
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,480
Bring Thicha to the hospital.

431
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,640
Let's go.

432
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,400
What happened back there?

433
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,440
Phoo didn’t look okay, or you either.

434
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,400
Just like your mother said,

435
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,680
her friend was drunk and threw a tantrum,

436
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,520
breaking stuff.

437
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,680
Phoo must be shocked.

438
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,840
I remember him.

439
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,800
He’s always been like this
since I was young.

440
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,440
I don't know how Mom is okay
with a friend like that.

441
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,760
It's alright.
We'll be back in the UK soon.

442
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,160
Don't overthink these things.

443
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,000
Okay. You're right.

444
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,560
Don't think about it too much.

445
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,040
Phatchai.

446
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,440
Come with me to the office.
We need to talk.

447
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,000
Go. I'll go take a shower.

448
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,320
I'm safe now.

449
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,040
Do you understand
what I mean by "help" now?

450
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,840
Could you please bring me
to England with you?

451
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,680
I promise I'll do anything for you.

452
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,000
I promise.

453
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,400
Thank you…

454
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,200
Thank you.

455
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,240
But you must help me.

456
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,160
Wait for me to tell you what to do.

457
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,880
When will you have the wedding?

458
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,280
As soon as possible.

459
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,880
I don’t expect many guests,

460
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,080
and there’s pretty much
no one from Thicha’s side.

461
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,760
We can keep it simple.

462
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,240
Let's do as you planned.

463
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,280
But I ask one thing,

464
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,120
don’t register a marriage certificate.

465
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,240
It's up to Thicha. If she wants to,
I'm happy to register.

466
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,200
I also think she's not interested
in using our last name.

467
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,240
That's good.

468
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,720
If she's really not interested,
that's perfect.

469
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,680
It's the only thing I ask of you.

470
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,080
If you want to get married, go ahead.

471
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,680
But you’ve only known her
for a short time.

472
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,400
Someday, you might not get along well.

473
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,440
Then it will be easier to part ways.

474
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,320
She's beautiful,

475
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,600
smart, and independent.

476
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,840
It doesn't take much for you to like her.

477
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,720
But know this, it doesn't take much

478
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,800
for me not to like her.

479
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,120
Just keep in mind,

480
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,080
I’m allowing this
because I want you to be happy.

481
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,040
As for the wedding ceremony,

482
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,600
let me take care of it.

483
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,600
It's the least I can do for you.

484
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,520
Hmm.

485
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,240
Thank you.

486
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,480
Let me talk to Thicha about this.

487
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,920
Hey.

488
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,920
I forgot to ask.

489
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,320
Would you be okay if

490
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,560
I prefer not to register
a marriage certificate?

491
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,720
Huh?

492
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,920
It came to me when I saw the mothers talk,

493
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,560
so I figured I should ask.

494
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,440
Are you okay with that?

495
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,840
I just don't want to handle those
complicated document changes.

496
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,840
I wouldn't mind if you don't want to,

497
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,040
but honestly,
I wanted to register it with you.

498
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,280
That way, you'd know I’m serious about us.

499
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,360
But I get it, you're not really
into these kinds of things.

500
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,040
Then…

501
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,960
Let's go

502
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,400
register it when
we’re in our 60s, alright?

503
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,720
Well,

504
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,800
I’m not sure if

505
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,440
you’re comforting me or being romantic.

506
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,680
What I’m trying to say is…

507
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,520
We’ll be together until we grow old.

508
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,480
Why are you still not sleeping, Mom?

509
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,200
I'm worried, you know.

510
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,160
If you can't make it,
come back to our place, Poo.

511
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,560
If I go back,
I won't have money for school, Mom.

512
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,400
I can handle it.

513
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,800
And I’m about to get a new job.

514
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,560
I have a new boss too.

515
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,240
Good, good! Have you eaten yet?

516
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,240
I'm eating right now.

517
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,480
Mom, make sure you eat a lot too.

518
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,760
Your mom's outdoing herself.

519
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,160
The venue looks amazing. Small wedding,

520
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,520
but everything’s perfect.

521
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,880
I'm surprised too.

522
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,160
I didn't think my mom
would put this much effort in.

523
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,040
- Some snacks, Sir.
- Right.

524
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,960
Thank you.

525
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,080
Thank you.

526
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,320
Mom. Yes.

527
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,360
You can be here around 7 p.m.

528
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,840
I'll send someone to pick you up.

529
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,120
I'm doing well. We’ve got the tailors

530
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,480
and also food and snacks.

531
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,640
No need to worry.

532
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,120
Yes.

533
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,360
Right.

534
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,600
Oh, please feel free to take a break.

535
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,680
Mom, I'll call you back.

536
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,440
‪I have a welcoming gift
‪for my soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

537
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,040
‪For us women,

538
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
‪a wedding day

539
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,920
‪is a special day.

540
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,760
I hope

541
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:29,280
you'll remember this day
for the rest of your life.

542
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,560
You're the cheese,

543
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,680
I'm the wine. Forever.

544
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,720
I'll be your cheese…

545
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,160
Forever.

546
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,080
Cha…

547
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,080
Cha! What's wrong?

548
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,480
Thicha!

549
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,440
Cha, Cha.

550
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,880
Hey!

551
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,640
Cha!

552
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,680
- Thicha!
- Thicha!

553
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,160
Cha!

554
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,680
- Cha!
- Thicha!

555
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,920
Call an ambulance!

556
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,000
Cha!

557
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,080
Thicha!

558
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,520
Cha!

559
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,480
- Thicha!
- Thicha! Thicha!

560
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,600
Thicha! Thicha!

561
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,680
No one knows

562
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,880
how fun it is to watch

563
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,400
creatures struggle for their lives.

564
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,760
Especially the struggle
of someone who always thinks

565
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,240
she’s a step ahead of everyone else.

566
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,040
It's much more fun.

567
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,400
And if that struggle

568
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,560
is because of our own doing,

569
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,520
Did your mother
get along well with Thicha?

570
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,800
Could you keep this from my mom?

571
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,360
You can't keep this up.
Don't you understand?

572
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,960
What do you think I should do, Mother?

573
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,640
