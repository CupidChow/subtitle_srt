THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION,
CREATED SOLELY FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES,

00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,920
WITH NO INTENTION TO INCITE VIOLENCE
OR DISCREDIT ANY ORGANIZATION.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,480
Are you sure

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,120
that you've never
contacted anyone before Bob?

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,120
Your friend has an assistant,

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,360
colleague,

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,120
or supplier

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,760
named Thicha?

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,760
She's a Thai woman.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,760
Is there anyone

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,720
named Thicha on the decorating team?

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,400
You know what? I'll check it again.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,520
Her name is Thicha, right?

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,520
Before being an interior designer,

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,080
what did you want to do?

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,800
And where did you graduate from?

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,280
From Thailand.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,000
Why? Do you want to
bully me about my college, English guy?

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,520
No, I don't want to bully you!

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,000
I just want to know

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,320
because I don't know anything about you.

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,200
If we spend more time together,

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,200
we'll get to know each other better.

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,000
When do you finish work today?

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,520
I could drop by.

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,240
I'm not sure about that.

27
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,280
Let's meet another time.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,040
Hello.

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,040
How are you?

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,960
I'm okay.

31
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,720
Not too nauseous anymore,
but still a little dizzy.

32
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,160
How about you?

33
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,160
I'm good.

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,240
I ran into Arthur today.

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,840
He was with his friend Bob,
who's an interior designer.

36
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,120
How is he doing?

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,600
He's doing well.

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,120
I might run into him again.

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,160
Anything you'd like to tell him?

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,640
He might not remember me.

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,000
What are you up to today?

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,560
House tours?

43
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,600
No.

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,200
I'll call you later.

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,200
Bye.

46
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,680
Good Afternoon.

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
How may I help you?

48
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,440
Good Afternoon.

49
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,840
I have an appointment with my friend.

50
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,800
Can I have her name

51
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,520
and her company name?

52
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,120
Thicha.

53
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,240
She's Thai,

54
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,040
working for DC Company.

55
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay, let me check for you.

56
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,120
Sure.

57
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,040
Hello.

58
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,840
There's someone here to meet Miss Thicha.

59
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,320
She's Thai.

60
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,000
Sorry, which department?

61
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,520
Interior.

62
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,320
Interior.

63
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,040
I'm sorry,
but there's no one named Thicha here.

64
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,200
Have you seen her?

65
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,600
I've been working here for five years and
I've never heard of anyone named Thicha.

EPISODE TITLE

69
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,600
When will Phatchai be back?

70
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,080
I didn't ask him yet.

71
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,520
But as far as I know,

72
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,720
he has house tours for a few more days,

73
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,480
then he's meeting clients.

74
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Also,

75
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,800
he said he'd pack things up,

76
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,280
which could take a while.

77
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,480
During this time,

78
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,680
I plan to release
the sound clip I got first.

79
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,880
I'll play it for you.

80
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,880
Hi, Mathee.

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,880
Buss.

82
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,440
Accident at the construction site.
Three dead, five injured.

83
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,920
How many of them died?

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,400
And how many are injured?

85
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
Send Worot to talk to the police station.

86
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,040
They've mentioned
Mathee and Worot's names.

87
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,440
Yes, loud and clear.

88
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,440
What's your plan after releasing the clip?

89
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,080
I'll see how Bussara reacts

90
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,320
to gauge how deep her connections are.

91
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,680
This clip is quite intense.

92
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,320
If they can bury this,

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,400
it will show how powerful they are.

94
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,600
It's smart to test the waters first.

95
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,600
I've heard

96
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,800
that one of the kids in our home

97
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,160
is training as a journalist, right?

98
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,080
Yes, Ma'am.

99
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,320
- Tell that kid I want to talk.
- Yes, Ma'am.

100
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,360
I'll do the talking

101
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,680
so no one can trace the clip's source.

102
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,960
Uncle Sak is digging the soil
in the garden and disposing of it.

103
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,760
I don't know why.

104
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,880
It might not be just the soil.

105
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,520
Then what is it, Ma'am?

106
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,280
Try to get as close as possible
and take photos of those piles of soil,

107
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,200
but stay where you'll be safe.

108
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,280
Yes.

109
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,360
I've dug deep enough.

110
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,440
I'll try to get them all up.

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,160
Right.

112
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,800
Hello.

113
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,000
Found any houses you like?

114
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,520
Not yet.

115
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,320
Okay.

116
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,960
Keep looking.

117
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,160
No need to rush.

118
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,000
If you find one, let me know.

119
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,720
Yes.

120
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,920
Talk to you later.

121
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,520
Fuck!

122
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,120
Fuck!

123
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,160
I really love you.

124
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,760
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,440
No. Stop saying sorry.

126
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,560
You didn't do anything wrong.

127
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
What are you looking for?

128
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
A hairpin.

129
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,840
- My hairpin.
- You use a hairpin?

130
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

131
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,600
- Mom.
- Phatchai.

132
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,200
I can't talk right now.

133
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,680
I'm at the airport.

134
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,240
Suvarnabhumi.

135
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,520
I'm back.

136
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
I saved up and bought the ticket myself.

137
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,000
My total score is the highest in my class.

138
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
You told me

139
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,720
if I got the highest score,
I could come home.

140
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,080
- Uh, I'm going to--
- I'll send someone. Stay there.

141
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,320
Mom, I can go home by myself.

142
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,480
I said stay there!

143
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,280
Should I take her
to Mr. Mathee now, Ma'am?

144
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,800
Not yet.

145
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,440
Help Sak plant the tree and cover it up.

146
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,360
- Hurry.
- Yes, Ma'am.

147
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,120
Hi.

148
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,680
I need your help.

149
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,560
Phat.

150
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,720
Your mom asked me to pick you up.

151
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,160
Sorry for troubling you.

152
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,760
I told her I can get home myself.

153
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,400
She said…

154
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,600
She wants you to stay at a hotel first

155
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,120
and fly back tomorrow.

156
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,320
I'll handle the ticket for you.

157
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,400
Why?

158
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,560
She's busy.

159
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,520
She said she's sorry,

160
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,800
but she's really busy right now.

161
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,080
She said that

162
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,920
she'll meet you
as soon as her work is done.

163
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,280
Am I bothering her that much
just by coming home?

164
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,800
Come on.

165
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,640
She's doing all this work
to take care of your education.

166
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,320
I can study anywhere!

167
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,440
PUBLIC HOUSE

168
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,240
Have a safe flight, Phatchai.

169
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,080
Send the girl to Mathee.

170
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,520
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Yes.

171
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,720
- Hurry up.
- Let's take turns carrying her.

172
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,960
Yeah, I'll help you.

173
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,400
Let's finish this quickly.

174
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,480
Come here!

175
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,000
So feisty, aren't you?!

176
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,560
Mom.

177
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,880
Tidy it up.

178
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,040
Don't leave any bloodstains
on the surface, Sak.

179
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,080
Burn all their clothes and belongings.

180
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,760
My Phatchai

181
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,319
is the best,

182
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,480
right?

183
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,400
MATHEE LAW FIRM

184
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,880
- Ms. Buss wants two background checks.
- Yes.

185
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,000
NIWARIN, THICHA INSAREE

186
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,120
Niwarin and Thicha Insaree.

187
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,480
Dig deep, as deep as you can.

188
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,000
- Do it fast.
- Yes, Sir.

189
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,640
‪Sir,

190
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,320
a social justice page
released a sound clip.

191
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,120
The fuck is that?

192
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,240
Hi, Mathee.

193
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,440
Fucking hell.

194
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,800
Buss. Accident at the construction site.
Three dead, five injured.

195
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,120
How many of them died?

196
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,720
And how many are injured?

197
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,760
Do they all have permits?

198
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,080
How did you handle
the ones who died on-site?

199
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,520
We did as usual.

200
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,680
The worker who caused it
is at the police station.

201
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,080
Send Worot to talk to the police station.

202
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,040
Shit.

203
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,840
Yeah, but he wanted 20,000 baht for that.

204
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,080
This is not the time to ask!

205
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,920
- He said that from now--
- No.

206
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,920
No.

207
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,520
He can't have that now.

208
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,640
Clear everything up first.

209
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,440
Damn it!

210
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,000
He can't have that now.

211
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,200
Clear everything up first.

212
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,320
Do you recognize from the voice

213
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,600
that it's Bussara?

214
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,240
Those who don't know her might not.

215
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,200
There are some comments.

216
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,840
"Isn't that Worot a policeman?"

217
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,800
Can we have our people use fake accounts
to target them in the comments?

218
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,960
Yes.

219
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,600
And comment with links
to news about that accident as well.

220
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,760
- Keep it trending.
- Okay.

221
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,960
Mr. Mathee.

222
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,480
The police are doing
a press conference about that clip.

223
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,480
Why are they working so fast now?

224
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,640
We have to investigate

225
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,840
what really happened thoroughly

226
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,840
because there are names clearly mentioned.

227
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,040
But sir,

228
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
people are already speculating

229
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,280
that one of them is Mr. Mathee,
the well-known lawyer,

230
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,120
and that Mr. Worot
is part of the police force.

231
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,720
Don't jump to conclusions.

232
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,400
Please let us investigate further.

233
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,400
There are many people

234
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,600
named Mathee and Worot.

235
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,960
Asshole.

236
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,680
You said my name too many times.

237
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,520
But if I find

238
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,800
this falls under my jurisdiction,

239
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,600
I won't let it slide.

240
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,040
Damn it.

241
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,200
This asshole clearly
doesn't see eye to eye with Worot's CO.

242
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,040
- He wants to take him down.
- Duh.

243
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,920
If not, he wouldn't be moving this fast.

244
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,640
Damn it!

245
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,920
Tell the messenger to hurry and
deliver the sweets to Ms. Buss and Worot.

246
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,840
Go!

247
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,200
Got it.

248
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,240
Hey, wait.

249
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,160
Tell the messenger
to take off our uniform first.

250
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,160
Right.

251
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Today,

252
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,800
it will be too late for you to quit.

253
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,720
I want to say it again,

254
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,560
you can still walk away from this.

255
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,120
Go be with Phatchai

256
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,280
if you still want a family.

257
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,200
Then,

258
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,120
you can even help our brothers and sisters

259
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,000
or adopt someone,

260
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,960
like I did with you.

261
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,480
Helping

262
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,080
is just a way
to fix what's already happened.

263
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,840
Preventing it from happening again

264
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,480
is a better thing to do.

265
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,000
We just have to
do our best to make it better

266
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,080
for everyone.

267
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,320
Just like how you helped me.

268
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,640
I felt that

269
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,840
I should do something for others.

270
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,280
I can feel it.

271
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,560
We're so close, Mom.

272
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,160
But you already know

273
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,320
Bussara

274
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,200
isn't the only agancy doing this.

275
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,960
There are so many others,

276
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,920
willing to go even further.

277
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,720
It will never end.

278
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,600
I understand.

279
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,920
The whole world is like this, Mom.

280
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,240
People hurt each other.

281
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,080
If there's still injustice every day,

282
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,120
we must help each other every day.

283
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,200
We can't ignore it.

284
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,080
We can't accept it.

285
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,080
And we can't just let it go.

286
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,120
If we act like it doesn't exist,

287
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,200
if we're indifferent

288
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,720
and don't do anything,

289
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,640
we're no better than the oppressors.

290
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,200
Very well.

291
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,280
If you're

292
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,560
determined to see this through,

293
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,600
we must go all the way.

294
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,480
Bussara

295
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,920
and her friends will rot in prison.

296
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,080
Mr. Mathee sent these sweets for Ms. Buss.

297
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,960
No need to take them.

298
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,640
Keep them in the box
or they'll lose their shape

299
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,520
Hand them to her now.

300
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,720
Yes.

301
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,880
Yes?

302
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,200
Phoo, if Mathee
or Bussara's men show up at the house,

303
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,000
tell me immediately.

304
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,520
Yes, Ma'am.

305
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,880
If you notice anything unusual,

306
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,400
let me know as well.

307
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,720
Someone from Mathee's office
just came by to deliver sweets.

308
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,600
But Bussara doesn't like sweets.

309
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,000
I thought so.

310
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,720
And Mathee never sends anything like this.

311
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,200
Can you open it, Phoo?

312
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,640
Open it?

313
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,160
But

314
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,720
if it's opened, I'm as good as dead.

315
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,280
Try to do what you can, Phoo.

316
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,320
This might be important.

317
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,360
Yes, Ma'am.

318
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,880
Buss. Accident at the construction site.
Three dead, five injured.

319
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,600
How many of them died?

320
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,960
And how many are injured?

321
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,160
Do they all have permits?

322
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,240
How did you handle
the ones who died on-site?

323
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,760
We did as usual.

324
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,040
The worker who caused it
is at the police station.

325
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,160
MATHEE

326
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,520
Hi, Mathee.

327
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,440
Buss. Accident at the construction site.
Three dead, five injured.

328
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,280
And the bodies?

329
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,720
Where did you dispose of them?

330
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,000
We did as usual.

331
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,120
The worker who caused it
is at the police station.

332
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,360
I think it looks fine here.

333
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,200
It's now empty anway.

334
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,600
ONLINE

335
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,640
Yes?

336
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,760
Phoo.

337
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,000
Go to Bussara now.

338
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,040
But I still can't open the sweet box.

339
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,080
Go see her first. Hurry!

340
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,520
Now.

341
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,520
Ms. Buss.

342
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,120
Mr. Mathee sent these sweets for you.

343
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,600
Get out.

344
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,040
Yes, Ma'am.

345
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,680
Same place, 10 p.m. tonight.

346
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,920
Don't let anyone see you leave the house.

347
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,080
We'll use burner phones
to communicate from now.

348
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,400
Prepare to explain

349
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,200
what the hell was that clip.

350
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,080
Phoo.

351
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,680
Give me your phone.

352
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,160
Give me your phone.

353
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,560
I said, give me your phone!

354
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,200
DELETE

355
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
Phoo.

356
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,280
Bussara and her friends
are meeting tonight.

357
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,320
Seems like they're rattled
by the clip we released.

358
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,080
The police told the press
that they'll investigate as well.

359
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,200
If we can get the photos of their meeting,

360
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,520
and release them,
it'll be like adding salt to their wounds.

361
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,000
But…

362
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,880
We don't know where "same place" is.

363
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,920
Shall we tail them?

364
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,920
Start tracking in the evening.

365
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,520
Follow them wherever they go.

366
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,320
INCOMING CALL

367
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,880
When I call you and it's safe to talk,

368
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,720
say "Yes." when you pick up.

369
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,720
If you're silent, I'll hang up.

370
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,600
Who called you?

371
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,600
Pack your clothes.

372
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,200
What?

373
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,440
Why? Where are we going?

374
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,240
I'll send you to work for Mathee.

375
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,600
Ms. Buss.

376
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,600
Please don't send me there.

377
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,920
You can hit me

378
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,040
or punish me however you want.

379
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,200
I won't go to England.

380
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,920
Just don't send me to Mathee.

381
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,320
- I said go pack your clothes!
- Please don't leave me with Mathee.

382
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,000
I said go pack your clothes!

383
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,840
I'm begging you.

384
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,440
When you're there, I'll return your phone.

385
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,280
And from now on, you should call him

386
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,760
Mr. Mathee.

387
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,680
Here you go!

388
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,040
Please…

389
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,120
What? What are you saying?

390
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,200
Being alive,

391
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,600
no matter how hard it is,

392
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,040
we still have our chances

393
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,880
to keep fighting,

394
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,280
to one day

395
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,080
have a better life.

396
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
Move over.

397
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
That's Phoo.

398
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,159
They must be taking her to Mathee.

399
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,800
Do you think

400
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,920
Bussara is in the car too?

401
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,080
Possibly.

402
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,480
What do we do?

403
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,840
Tail them.

404
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,800
I'm sorry.

405
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,480
No. Stop saying sorry.

406
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,600
You didn't do anything wrong.

407
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,360
Come on.

408
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,680
Hello, Chi.

409
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,160
How are things on your side?

410
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Not a single one of them.

411
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,400
They're meeting at 10 p.m.

412
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,120
They should be leaving now.

413
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,000
Come join us.

414
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,400
I think I'm following Bussara.

415
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,320
Yes, Ma'am.

416
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,920
Bussara is really here.

417
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,720
They brought Phoo too.

418
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,960
Mom,

419
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,080
where's Uncle Chi?

420
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,480
He might take a while.

421
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,280
- Then I'll go.
- No.

422
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,920
It's just taking photos.

423
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,480
I can zoom from afar.

424
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,400
We need evidence of their meeting.

425
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,840
Tell Uncle Chi to bring help.

426
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,000
We can't let them take Phoo away.

427
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,920
No. We can't let them
know about us right now.

428
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,480
We'll talk about that later.

429
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,800
I won't let Phoo suffer.

430
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,280
I promised her.

431
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,920
PHATCHAI

432
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,760
Yes?

433
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,280
I'll ask you one time

434
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,880
and one time only.

435
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,400
You have just this one chance.

436
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,640
PHATCHAI

437
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,680
Can we talk later?

438
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,480
Now I'm--

439
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,760
Who are you, really,

440
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,320
Thicha Insaree?

441
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,920
What are you planning to do?

442
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
Answer me.

443
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Come on. Answer me.

444
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,320
What are you planning to do?

445
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,200
Answer me.

446
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,520
Come on. Answer me.

447
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,360
You just had to ask for trouble.

448
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,760
They're all inside.

449
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,000
Chi, you must act fast.

450
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,400
Yes, Ma'am.

451
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,600
Who did you record my voice for?!

452
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,600
What the fuck is this?!

453
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,560
I'll fucking kill you!

454
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,160
I asked who the hell are you?!
