1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,280
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,120
CREATED SOLELY FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES,

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,920
WITH NO INTENTION TO INCITE VIOLENCE
OR DISCREDIT ANY ORGANIZATION.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Who are you really,

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,760
Thicha Insaree?

6
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,080
What are you planning to do?

7
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,000
PHATCHAI

8
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,440
Come on. Answer me!

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,360
PHATCHAI

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,160
So, how did that audio clip get leaked?

11
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,120
Your voice was so loud and clear.

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,200
It must've been leaked from your side!

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,320
- Relax.
- How the fuck can I relax?

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,360
I couldn't get more bribe money from you,

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,480
and the audio clip
got leaked the next day!

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,880
What great timing!

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,600
You really think I did that?

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,800
When Mathee called you that day,

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,520
where were you?

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,880
At home.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,640
- In my office. Alone!
- Are your sure?

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,680
Any listening devices
or cameras in the room?

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,080
Have you checked?

24
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Mr. Mathee sent the sweets for you.

25
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,520
Phoo!

26
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,040
- Come here.
- Come here, bitch.

27
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
Get in there.

28
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,280
Hello.

29
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,640
They took Phoo in there.
Where's Uncle Chi?

30
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll ask him.

31
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,560
Stay put. Don't do anything yet.

32
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,800
Yes?

33
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,600
Chi, you must act fast.

34
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,680
Yes, Ma'am.

35
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,360
- Ready?
- Go!

36
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,600
Who did you record my voice for?

37
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,240
Help me!

38
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,640
Help!

39
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,360
Wait.

40
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,080
Careful. Don't let anyone see you.

41
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,720
- Yes.
- Sak.

42
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
If things are not looking good, just run.

43
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,080
Looks like you two knew
you were being followed.

44
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,880
You're fucking paranoid.

45
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,280
What are you doing?

46
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,960
I can do anything.

47
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,800
I'm a police officer.

48
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,120
And if someone plans to get rid of me,

49
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,880
I won't go down alone.

50
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,520
Get a good look that way.
I'll go this way.

51
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,440
Yes.

52
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,640
What the fuck is this?!

53
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,200
- We need to run.
- Go! Run!

54
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,040
The fire department
will be here soon. So will the police.

55
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,280
Buss.

56
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,200
Who did you tell about this?

57
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,320
Who's helping you?

58
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,840
Buss!

59
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,920
Time to run!

60
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,560
I'll question this bitch myself.

61
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,360
Pick that cigarette up. It's your DNA.

62
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,920
Hey, wait!

63
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
He has a gun.

64
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,080
What are you doing?

65
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,960
What are you trying to do?

66
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,320
What is all this, Ma'am?

67
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,640
Let's talk at home.

68
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,680
Fine.

69
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,120
But Thicha must come with me.

70
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,960
Whatever we're going to talk about,

71
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,640
however it ends up,

72
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,320
I love you.

73
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,840
There are reasons behind everything.

74
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,040
There are stories.

75
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
Talk nicely to each other.

76
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,920
How do you want to start?

77
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,400
Who are you?

78
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,640
What did my mother do?

79
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,360
Okay.

80
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,040
Let's start over.

81
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,560
Let's start with this hairpin.

82
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Who are you?

83
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,120
Who are you,

84
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,040
Thicha Insaree?

85
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,840
Whose hairpin is this?

86
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,080
How are you related to them?

87
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,840
How did you get it?

88
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,000
You did say it's your mother's.

89
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,160
Who is your real mother?

90
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,520
Who is your mother?

91
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,800
Who is your mother?

92
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,200
I asked who the hell are you?!

93
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,040
My name is Phatchai.

94
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,240
I'm sick!

95
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,760
Depression.

96
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,160
Panic attacks.

97
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,000
I've been sick like this for ten years.

98
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,520
It all started from one night.

99
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
That night,

100
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,720
I flew back from England

101
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,200
and arrived home.

102
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,720
Instead of seeing my mom,

103
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,880
I saw a girl.

104
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,800
That girl was being carried away.

105
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,680
In that moment,

106
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,760
she used all the strength
she had left to grab this hairpin.

107
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,480
The thing is, this pin
fell right in front of me.

108
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,840
But the worst part

109
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,040
was watching her being brutally assaulted

110
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,480
and dragged away.

111
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,360
You can't imagine how bad

112
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,360
what I saw really was.

113
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,000
How horrifying it was.

114
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,040
And then there was my mother.

115
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,280
Usually, she was so well-dressed.

116
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,080
I don't even know
what fucking mess she was covered in.

117
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,800
I've had nightmares
about that night for years.

118
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,320
I tried to find answers
about what happened that night.

119
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,880
Those stains could be my mother's blood.

120
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,440
That must be my mother's blood,

121
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,520
all over your mother.

122
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,640
And…

123
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,000
When I was assaulted,

124
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,000
it…

125
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,920
It didn't hurt.

126
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,080
It was like

127
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
I had lost all feeling.

128
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,720
It didn't hurt

129
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,320
from the moment
I saw my mother in that pit.

130
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,280
It just felt like I was

131
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,400
dying,

132
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,400
but I didn't die.

133
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,480
There was no pain.

134
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,200
No exhaustion.

135
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,160
No hunger.

136
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,720
Nothing.

137
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,640
It was like

138
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,960
I wasn't human anymore.

139
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,120
No!

140
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,640
My mother

141
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,640
worked so hard for years,

142
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,320
saving up to bring me here.

143
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,320
She said

144
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,800
we'd have a better life.

145
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,360
We're about to be born again.

146
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,000
And it seemed like we had.

147
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,000
We had a bathroom in our bedroom.

148
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,280
I can even sleep here.

149
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Everything was so clean and tidy.

150
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,160
I did my best

151
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,560
to endure,

152
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,800
even when your mother

153
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,520
hit me right here.

154
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,480
On my back.

155
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,760
She told me not to make a sound.

156
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,720
Yeah.

157
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,000
Don't make any noise.

158
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,080
If I did,

159
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,040
she'd hurt my mom.

160
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,280
So I stayed quiet.

161
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,280
I never made a noise.

162
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,760
But my mother died anyway.

163
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,160
My name is Ou Yi.

164
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,480
That hairpin

165
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,359
belongs to my mother.

166
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,600
Thicha.

167
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,000
Please don't do
what you did last night again.

168
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,040
You're pregnant.

169
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,960
Last night

170
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,560
was necessary.

171
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,320
Ou Yi…

172
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,160
Would you love me

173
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,680
more than you hate my mother?

174
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,800
That depends

175
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,160
on whether
you will let your mother's injustices

176
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,200
continue or not.

177
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,080
Your mother sends girls to Mathee.

178
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,680
That night, I tried to run away

179
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,200
because Mathee was about to rape me.

180
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,520
And last night, I had to risk everything

181
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,240
to help Phoo.

182
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,480
Your mother is a big agent

183
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,880
who traffics our people into Thailand.

184
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,440
Your mother

185
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
has done so many horrible things.

186
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,680
I don't know how many.

187
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,720
But what I do know is that

188
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,280
my mother

189
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,280
is now under the tree

190
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,600
in your mother's office.

191
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,040
I lied…

192
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,360
and I know it's unforgivable.

193
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
But I had to do it.

194
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,080
I never thought I'd fall in love with you,

195
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,160
but I love you so much.

196
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,480
No matter what you decide now,

197
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,800
I'll understand it all.

198
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,160
You have the right to choose.

199
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,320
But I won't stop what I'm doing.

200
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,360
I didn't do it for myself.

201
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,880
I did it so countless others

202
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,240
won't have to suffer the same fate as me.

203
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,520
My mother…

204
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,920
is now under the tree

205
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,080
in your mother's office.

206
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,360
Whether you will let
your mother's injustices

207
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,920
continue or not.

208
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,320
When will this be done?

209
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,960
If I'm doing it alone,

210
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,880
it might take two days.

211
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,360
Find someone to help.

212
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,080
Someone you can trust.

213
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,600
Yes, Ma'am.

214
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,960
But…

215
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,720
The room will be a bit messy for a while.

216
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,600
I had to leave this pile of soil here.

217
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,880
Once we get the bones, we'll put it back.

218
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,080
What?

219
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,960
Listen carefully, Buss.

220
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,000
Niwarin used to be an immigrant worker.

221
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,120
And Thicha is using a dead person's ID.

222
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,880
I'll send you
all the documents I can find.

223
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,160
You can see for yourself
who the hell they are.

224
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,600
I think this is
part of a bigger operation.

225
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,360
But we stil don't know

226
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,760
what the hell they're after.

227
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,960
Hello, Buss?

228
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,320
Buss?

229
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,920
I think it looks fine here.

230
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,240
It's empty now anyway.

231
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,680
Hi, Mathee.

232
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,640
Buss. Accident at the construction site.
Three dead, five injured.

233
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,360
- Thicha was the one who released the clip.
- Huh?

234
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,160
She worked with Phoo!

235
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,280
Force the answer out of that bitch.

236
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,120
Find out exactly what the hell they want!

237
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,800
Fuck you!

238
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,240
Sorry, there is no acknowledgement from--

239
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,080
They must have taken Phoo's phone away.

240
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,760
No one is answering.

241
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,240
Mae also told me

242
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,200
Mathee's house is quiet.
His car is gone too.

243
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,880
Does he have another safe house
we don't know about?

244
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,760
- A condo or…
- From how he dragged Phoo,

245
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,320
it doesn't seem like a condo.

246
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,040
It must be somewhere else.

247
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,400
I'll tell Mae
to ask someone from Mathee's firm.

248
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,320
Good, Uncle Chi. Keep us posted.

249
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,320
Wherever we have people,

250
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,160
- find out where Mathee is keeping Phoo.
- Right.

251
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,280
Another person who must know

252
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,120
is Bussara.

253
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,880
I'll try to get Phatchai
to call his mother.

254
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,880
Go ahead.

255
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,160
Sorry, the number
that you've dialed cannot be connected--

256
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,960
Phatchai didn't pick up.

257
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,680
Maybe he doesn't want anything
to do with me anymore.

258
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,480
Give him some time.

259
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,280
It's hard for him to process all this.

260
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,720
Right now, let's focus on
finding a way to help Phoo.

261
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,480
Where are you going?

262
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,400
Mathee's house.

263
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,160
His car isn't there,

264
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,600
but he might have parked somewhere else.

265
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,800
He must be somewhere.

266
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,080
You can't do that, Yi!

267
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,080
I can't just sit and wait.

268
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
Yi!

269
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Yi!

270
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,120
Thicha…

271
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,400
Thicha…

272
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,480
Who is…

273
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,560
Thicha, Dear?

274
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,920
And…

275
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,920
what did she

276
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,040
ask you to do?

277
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,720
Speak.

278
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,040
Speak.

279
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,080
I told you to speak!

280
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,640
Change your clothes then!

281
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,040
Please don't do this to me.

282
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,160
Say that again.

283
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,160
Say it again. What did you say?

284
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,720
Please don't do this to me, Sir.

285
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,560
If you say that
in a Japanese schoolgirl outfit,

286
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,280
you would be so cute.

287
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,000
Don't you think?

288
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,040
Change your clothes.

289
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,160
Hurry, get changed.

290
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,360
Get changed.

291
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,360
Get changed.

292
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,000
And say it again.

293
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,240
Say it.

294
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,040
I told you to say it!

295
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,800
If you don't wanna say it,

296
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,960
go get changed.

297
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,760
Go!

298
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,960
Take it all off.

299
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,440
Now!

300
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,680
MRS. NIWARIN INSAREE

MISS WASSANA MEEBUNYANG

00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,680
Her name is Ou Yi.

THICHA

Thicha Insaree.

309
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,400
I've been busy looking up that word.

310
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,960
It means "the one who was born twice."

311
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,800

Ou Yi?

315
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,600
You and Phatchai
will leave this place in no time.

316
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,160
Why do you care about what happens here?

317
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,200
A girl was about to be raped.

318
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,720
Stop!

319
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,400
She's just a maid.

320
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,280
A Maid

321
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,560
is a human too.

322
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,120
Human.

323
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,680
What are you trying to achieve

324
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,720
from all of this, Thicha?

325
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,880
I just want to be a good daughter-in-law

326
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,480
and make my husband happy.

327
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,400
How dare you lie to my son?

328
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,040
Phat.

329
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,960
When did you come back?

330
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,720
Phat.

331
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,520
Thicha has been deceiving you.

332
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,760
All the things she told you,

333
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,000
her education and her work,

334
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,400
were all a lie.

335
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,680
She was nothing more
than a low-life alien.

336
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,080
She assumed the ID of a dead person.
Look. This girl is dead.

337
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,200
And this.

338
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,600
This is Thicha!

339
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,080
Thicha is Ou Yi.

340
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,720
Her mother is Yoaw,

341
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,160
your maid when I was in England.

342
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,160
Let's talk in the office.

343
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,160
Wait, wait. No. We can't.

344
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,400
Right now, my office

345
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,680
is so messy.

346
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,320
Sak is changing the fertilizer.

347
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,040
Phat.

348
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,000
Phat.

349
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,800
Phat.

350
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,680
Hey! Phatchai.

351
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,560
- Get out, Sak.
- Don't.

352
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,880
Go on.

353
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,360
- Uh, I…
- Keep working.

354
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,160
Go on.

355
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,600
If Mom told you
to dig the soil or whatever,

356
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,880
just do it. No need to go anywhere.

357
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,960
I said keep working!

358
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,360
Phatchai! What is this?!

359
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,000
Is her mother under that tree?

360
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,360
I asked you,

361
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,800
is the body of Thicha's mother under here?

362
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,360
What?! There's nothing like that in here!

363
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,040
Who told you this?!

364
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,640
Was it your wife?

365
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,280
You know she's a liar,
and you still believe her!

366
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,640
She doesn't even love you!

367
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,880
She never did!

368
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,920
She lied to you to get revenge on me!

369
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,440
- She never loved you!
- Then what did you do to her?!

370
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,640
What did you do to her?

371
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,600
Didn't you hear me?

372
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,560
Answer me.

373
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,280
She's just a low-life.

374
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,080
A little punishment,
and she acted all weak

375
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,440
and so fragile!

376
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,800
All weak?

377
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,960
So fragile?

378
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,280
A little punishment?

379
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,639
How was it little?

380
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,120
Beating?

381
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,239
Sending her to your friend to rape?!

382
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,639
You killed her mother

383
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,040
for protecting her own daughter.

384
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,719
Then, you stripped
half-naked in front of Sak

385
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,239
and burned your dress!

386
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,520
Yes.

387
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,480
Thicha didn't tell me.

388
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,800
But I know

389
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,400
because I saw it.

390
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,560
I was here that night.

391
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,400
I saw everything

392
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
but didn't understand what happened.

393
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,880
The only thing I know is that

394
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,560
it must have been horrible.

395
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,720
But I kept lying to myself

396
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,920
that it wasn't.

397
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,560
It wasn't horrible.

398
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,320
My mom is a good person.

399
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,520
I tried to find the reasons

400
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,560
and excuses for you,

401
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,000
why you did it.

402
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,280
And you know what?

403
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,760
Who has ever done anything to you?

404
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Did they hurt you?

405
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,760
Why did you do it?!

406
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,240
Is it for me?

407
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,240
I don't know.

408
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,240
Now, tell me the truth.

409
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,720
The truth

410
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,080
has many sides to it, Phatchai.

411
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,200
Your version of truth and mine

412
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,840
are different.

413
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,480
You will never be able

414
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,000
to accept my truth
and what I did my whole life.

415
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,960
Just know that

416
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,240
what you are and have now

417
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,640
are the results of my efforts.

418
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,080
I went through a lot.

419
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,800
I did it for you, and for myself.

420
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,400
We can do anything for others.

421
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,960
But we shouldn't hurt anyone.

422
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,880
Let's do it this way.

423
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,720
I'll talk to Thicha.

424
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,720
We'll talk about all that happened.

425
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,280
And I'll ask her that

426
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,120
if the three--

427
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,880
No.

428
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,120
The four of us,

429
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,560
including my grandchild.

430
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,320
If we have to live with each other,

431
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,880
how should we handle it?

432
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,840
Money? Take it.

433
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,920
How much? You tell me.

434
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Marriage certificate?

435
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,800
Have it.

436
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,640
I won't stop her.

437
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,120
But about what was done,

438
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,680
she must stop.

439
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,800
And then,
if you want to live with her in England

440
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,520
and never come back to see me,

441
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,520
I'm okay.

442
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,200
Let me see my grandchild sometimes.

443
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,640
The only thing Thicha wants

444
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,760
is justice.

445
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,960
Is that what you want too?

446
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,920
Yes.

447
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,360
Yes.

448
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,600
You can start
making it right at this moment.

449
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,400
Where is Phoo, Mom?

450
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,800
You think that maid bitch
is more important than me?!

451
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,120
Mom.

452
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,920
You're blinded by love
and believe everything she says!

453
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,080
She'll send me to jail,

454
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,040
and you're helping her!

455
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,200
You want me to leave everything behind

456
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,880
just to save that alien bitch?!

457
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,400
- I am your mother!
- You need to stop now.

458
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,360
And admit you're wrong.

459
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,760
You ungrateful brat!

460
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,760
You ungrateful brat!

461
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,600
You ungrateful brat!

462
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,760
You ungrateful brat!

463
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,800
Why did I even have you?!

464
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,880
I'll fucking show something to you.

465
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,200
The Gossip Fanpage, at your service.

466
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,720
This is Buss.

467
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,880
Oh, hello, Ms. Buss.

468
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,520
I was about to give you a call.

469
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,800
About the audio clip, right?

470
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,680
Could your page

471
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,320
hold off the posts about this news?

472
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,600
I think someone is using AI to frame me.

473
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,120
I need some time

474
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,600
to clear it all up.

475
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,560
Yes, Ma'am. We'll post some news about
celebrities fighting in the meantime.

476
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,360
We can go with that for a few days.

477
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,920
Good luck.

478
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,280
Thank you.

479
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,840
Let's have dinner sometime.

480
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,480
Do you think

481
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,000
people really care about justice?

482
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,000
Celebrities fighting.

483
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,880
Actors breaking up.

484
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,800
Someone sleeps with another person.

485
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,000
Most people

486
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,200
don't pay attention to what they should.

487
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,960
You know what?

488
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,920
You made it so much easier for me.

489
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,880
What?

490
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,400
Phat.

491
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,080
Phatchai!

492
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,000
Phatchai!

493
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,200
Phatchai!

494
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,680
You choose it yourself, Phatchai!

495
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,920
How is that bitch?

496
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,040
Phoo?

497
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,960
Feeling good, I think.

498
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,680
But didn't say much.

499
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,240
Probably afraid I'll like her too much.

500
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,160
Bring her to my house tonight.

501
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,560
Hey, Buss.

502
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,360
I just had her. I'm not done with her yet.

503
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,400
Take a photo of her and send it to me!

504
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,400
Bring her to my house tonight!

505
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,400
What are you-- Hello. Buss.

506
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,560
Damn it, Buss.

507
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,560
Smile.

508
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,640
I'll just use filters then.

509
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,880
I'll be back, Dear.

510
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,240
Almost forgot.

511
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,720
I happen to be a collector.

512
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,000
Wait here.

513
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,560
Smile.

514
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,880
Smile.

515
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,560
Smile.

516
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,240
Smile…

517
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,360
If you don't, I'll make you.

518
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,960
Come on. Smile.

519
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,120
No one has ever smiled.

520
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,960
143 LAWYER MATHEE'S HOUSE

521
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,000
Phoo!

522
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,160
Are you in there, Phoo?

523
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,880
Open the door! Phoo!

524
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,000
BUSSARA

525
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,720
What?

526
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,840
Why don't we find the best solution

527
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,760
between a mother-in-law
and a daughter-in-law?

528
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,920
If anything happens to Phoo…

529
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,160
She's alive,

530
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,520
as you can see in the photo.

531
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,200
If you want to help her,

532
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,920
meet me at my house

533
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,960
alone.

534
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,640
I think Thicha's going to see your mother.

535
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,120
What did you say?

536
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,640
Where is Phoo?

537
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,360
I'll send you to jail, bitch.

538
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,720
You're a fucking illegal alien.

539
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,960
It's your fault!

540
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,760
I'm your mother-in-law.

541
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,840
Did your son really choose you?

542
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,840
Don't try so hard to save the world.
I'm not even the most horrible person

543
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,520
in this fucked-up world.

544
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,880
Thicha! I'll kill you!

545
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,400
