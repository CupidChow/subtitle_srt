1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,920
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION, CREATED FOR
ENTERTAINMENT ONLY.

2
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,000
Nitikon, could you make time
for my appointment?

3
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,360
I'll take my daughter-in-law
for a pregnancy test.

4
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,240
I'll go today.
Shouldn't take more than two hours.

5
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,240
Tell the driver to get ready.

6
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,880
Let's go in the same van.

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,080
Yes, Ma'am.

8
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Mother.

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,400
For the doctor,

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,520
can I choose one myself?

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,640
That's right.

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,520
Why don't we go

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,800
for antenatal care with maternity doctors?

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,040
Thicha just had a food allergy

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,640
and took a lot of medicine.

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,800
Let's just go to Dr. Nitikon
and tell him you realized you're pregnant.

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,240
If you're really pregnant,

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,160
the food allergy

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,080
must be one of your concerns, isn't it?

20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,880
Are you saying Thicha is lying?

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,280
Relax.

22
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,240
Many people have misunderstood
and thought they were pregnant.

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,600
Lack of sleep,

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,160
delayed periods, stress.

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm just worried about the medicine

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,160
affecting the baby.

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,680
Go have a check-up,

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,480
so you can take care of yourself.

29
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,320
But if we have the tester,
we can test it ourselves.

30
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,160
Should I send someone to buy it?

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,840
Okay, I think

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,280
we should let Dr. Nitikon check first.

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,480
Then, if we want to

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,320
continue antenatal care
with another doctor,

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,000
we can decide then.

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,680
Then I'll go get ready.

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,200
- I'll help you.
- It's fine. I'll be back in a jiffy.

38
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
Understood.

39
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,200
- Hello.
- Mom.

40
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,520
I'm in trouble.

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,520
I lied to Bussara that I'm pregnant.

42
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,240
She insists on taking me
for a pregnancy test now.

43
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,160
Why did you say that?

44
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,560
You know
Bussara wouldn't let you off easily.

45
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,400
It was necessary.

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,000
Please find a way out for me now, Mom.

47
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,360
What should I do?

48
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,320
"PHATCHAI"

49
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,320
MOM: TELL ME WHERE THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE IS

50
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,640
Tell me where the doctor's office is.

51
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,720
Which floor is Dr. Nitikon's office again?

52
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,400
Third floor.
I just visited him the other day.

53
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,440
He has an examination room there.

54
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,920
Very convenient.

55
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,680
You don't have to worry.

56
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,600
Third floor. With personal exam room.

57
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,680
Hello.

58
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,480
Hello.

59
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,280
- Hello.
- Hello, Ma'am.

60
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,520
I'm bringing my daughter-in-law
for a pregnancy test.

61
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,200
I'm going to be a grandmother.

62
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,880
Congratulations.

63
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,720
The maid, who is one of us,

64
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,360
will wait on the third floor.

65
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,080
She's pregnant.

66
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,160
Contact me
when they ask for a urine sample.

67
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,520
I'll tell her to give her sample to you.

68
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,600
Hello, Doctor.

69
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,360
Hello.

70
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,600
We bring good news this time.

71
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,800
My daughter-in-law is pregnant.

72
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,840
Hello.

73
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,800
Mr. Nitikon,

74
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,680
will the food allergy medicine
that Thicha took

75
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,360
have any effects on our baby?

76
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,480
Shall we take a pregnancy test first?
If she's pregnant,

77
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,320
- we'll talk about that.
- I agree with her.

78
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,080
Let's take a test.

79
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,680
Then let's go ahead
with the blood draw and urine test.

80
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,240
Blood test?

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,160
We can just do a urine test, actually.

82
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,520
It will show the result right away.

83
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,880
If it turns out you're pregnant,
we can test your blood for any risks.

84
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,160
Diabetes, thalassemia,
hepatitis, and so on.

85
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,520
Don't forget to let the nurse know
when your last period was.

86
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,440
Let's go.

87
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,640
Can I have the container?

88
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,000
I also want to use the bathroom.
I'll collect it there.

89
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,520
You can do it in here.

90
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,440
The outside bathroom
has a lot of patients.

91
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,760
Nurse.

92
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,600
This way, please.

93
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,080
Bussara wants me to stay in the room.
Can't go outside.

94
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,880
THICHA: BUSSARA WANTS ME TO STAY
IN THE ROOM. CAN'T GO OUTSIDE.

95
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,440
What will you do?

96
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,440
MOM: WHAT WILL YOU DO?

97
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,600
You've played it big yourself.

98
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,600
Go ahead with it.

99
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,920
If it says you're not pregnant,

100
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,760
I bet you'll come up with something else.

101
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,559
There's always a way.

102
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,200
I'd probably just blame it
on stress and confusion.

103
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,400
Stress-induced vomiting,

104
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,520
due to having a harmful mother-in-law.

105
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,480
And when I'm alone with him tonight,

106
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,000
I might show him my mouth wounds

107
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,600
and tell him what happened.

108
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,840
Then, you'll be able to see Phatchai again

109
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
only at your funeral.

110
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,200
Nurse.

111
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,920
My daughter-in-law must be ready.

112
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,120
You don't have to worry.

113
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,760
The medicine you took

114
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,560
shouldn't have any effects on the baby.

115
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,760
Even if it does…

116
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,080
we'll do our best
to take care of him or her.

117
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,960
The result is in.

118
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,840
Ms. Thicha might be
three to four weeks pregnant.

119
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,760
Cha.

120
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,360
We're going to have a baby!

121
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Cha!

122
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,440
I'll cut him out of this equation

123
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,320
and find another way to get to Bussara.

124
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,160
We're going to have a baby!

125
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,200
You can't keep this up.
Don't you understand?

126
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,800
Because you love him.

127
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,640
Hey, wait.

128
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,760
What's the matter?

129
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,560
What happened?

130
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,720
I shouldn't be a mother.

131
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,960
I'm not good enough.

132
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,360
- I'm not ready…
- Calm down.

133
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,000
Just calm down.

134
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,280
You're just in shock.

135
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,880
I'm not ready either.

136
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,560
I don't know if
I'm going to be a good father.

137
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,680
But I'll do my best.

138
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,360
I'll give it my all.

139
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,880
And I believe you can do that too.

140
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,800
You'll be a good mother.

141
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,840
And we'll be a good team.

142
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,120
Trust me.

143
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,000
Come on.

144
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,400
Right? Come on.

145
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,720
Don't cry. Don't cry.

146
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,600
I love you so much.

147
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,960
I really love you.

148
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,640
I don't want our baby to get hurt.

149
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,480
The baby
shouldn't have to go through this.

150
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,360
I'm sorry.

151
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,160
No, stop saying sorry.

152
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,360
Why do you have to?

153
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,920
You didn't do anything wrong.

154
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,320
Will anything happen to my grandchild?

155
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,760
The timeline of the pregnancy

156
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,520
and the wedding day is so close.

157
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,600
I'll send her to the maternity ward

158
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,400
and recommend

159
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,880
some doctors
that we can trust with the case.

160
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,360
MATHEE

161
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,880
INCOMING CALL

162
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
What?

163
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,800
We need to talk.

164
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,480
About what?

165
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,200
Come to my office.

166
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,280
I'm busy.

167
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,000
Now!

168
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,760
During this time,
please avoid any demanding exercises.

169
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,160
Have nutritious food
and take care of yourself.

170
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,400
After four months,
we'll have an amniotic fluid test

171
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,560
to see if there are any problems.

172
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,360
Did Dr. Nitikon tell you

173
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,520
about the medicine I took recently?

174
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,440
Yes.

175
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,360
Ms. Buss told me
to check everything thoroughly.

176
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,480
Please don't worry.

177
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,720
Mom.

178
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,480
Can you speak English now?

179
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,880
- Now.
- No.

180
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,160
No.

181
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,960
Yeah, not "Now".

182
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,560
Speak clearly.

183
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,880
- Calmly.
- Clearly.

184
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,920
Calmly.

185
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,160
Clearly.

186
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,960
Calmly.

187
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,160
Mom.

188
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,640
What should I do?

189
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,520
What should I do?

190
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,160
What should I do?

191
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,200
Ms. Thicha.

192
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,480
Ms. Thicha,

193
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,040
do you want something in that room?

194
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,960
I saw a rat in there.

195
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,520
Huh? Where?

196
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,040
On the bookshelf.

197
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,640
I'm not sure if it's a rat.

198
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,319
I just caught a squirrel the other day.

199
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,079
Must be hard to maintain,

200
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,720
with a tree in the house.

201
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,320
It's necessary.

202
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,960
This is a large garden.

203
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,640
Taking care of it by yourself

204
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,160
must be so tiring, right?

205
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,720
No one else can do this

206
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,880
because we have good fertilizer.

207
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,400
Every tree

208
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,800
has its own fertilizer.

209
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,200
MATHEE LAW FIRM

210
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,200
Additional entrance fee of 5,000 each?

211
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,680
Yes.

212
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,840
From the border to Bangkok,

213
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,760
there are four main checkpoints.
It will be a bit over 1,000 each.

214
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,120
For any case of death
that we must clear with the police,

215
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,800
that will be another 10,000 each.

216
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,800
Wow. Do you need money that much?

217
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,120
What? We have to
talk to them with money, right?

218
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,160
If the case goes to the police station,

219
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,280
we'll keep their mouth shut without money?

220
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,440
I understand this 10,000 extra
because it's accidental.

221
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,640
But the extra bribe is too much.

222
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,640
Gasoline, workers, documents…

223
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,640
I'm the only one who pays.

224
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,040
How could I pay that much?

225
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,480
Will the police take it over? Huh?

226
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,280
You didn't invest a dime.

227
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,600
You just sit and wait for the money.

228
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
We might need to hurry up.

229
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,960
We have a worker transfer
scheduled for this week.

230
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,200
We can't really leave it hanging.

231
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,200
Then let's cut it from everyone's share.

232
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,120
What?

233
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,360
If we pay, we pay together.

234
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,760
What if I told you

235
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,440
I have another way
without paying any extra?

236
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,040
If you're sure
that you'll face the other networks,

237
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,440
you have to make sure there's no evidence.

238
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,560
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble later on.

239
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,240
Are you threatening me?

240
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,320
I'm not.

241
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,680
But the other networks might do something.

242
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,560
All documents can be forged.

243
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
If they want to do something to you,

244
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,000
there are plenty of ways to do so.

245
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,520
Are you sure you'll be safe?

246
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,720
You know what?

247
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,960
I'm starting to get what Mathee said

248
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,080
about you playing both sides.

249
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,720
We'll just have to wait and see.

250
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,680
I'm just not sure

251
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,680
if illegal labor trafficking

252
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,720
will have punishment as severe
as murder cases with evidence concealing.

253
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,000
You can ask Mathee about that.

254
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,160
I'm just not sure

255
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,120
if illegal labor trafficking

256
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,240
will have punishment as severe
as murder cases with evidence concealing.

257
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,080
I want to clear up
the fertilizer under the trees.

258
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,160
Do you remember where everything is?

259
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,920
Why are we doing that?

260
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,960
I don't want to keep them here.

261
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,600
What about Master Phatchai?

262
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,120
I'll deal with him.

263
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,880
Prepare all the tools you need.

264
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,360
We might be able to start soon.

265
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,400
Feeling nauseous?

266
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah. During this time,

267
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,680
I might have to
hug the toilet instead of you.

268
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Let's go. I'm ready.

269
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,440
Where are you going?

270
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,600
Well,

271
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,440
to rub your back

272
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,720
and have morning sickness with you.

273
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,440
Please don't. I don't want anyone
to see me when I'm ugly.

274
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,680
I'm telling an agent
to find a house for us.

275
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,400
Our house in England?

276
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,680
When you're feeling better,

277
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,840
we'll move

278
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,280
and give birth to our child there.

279
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,000
I think we should complete
the moving process before the baby's due.

280
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,000
I also looked for
some three to four-room flats.

281
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,200
For your mother and our kid.

282
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,840
I'll go see Mom tomorrow.
Can I talk about this with her first?

283
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,880
In case she doesn't want to live there,

284
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,600
we won't have to buy
anything more than we need.

285
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,040
Why would we not need it?

286
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,320
If she doesn't want to move there,

287
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,160
she'll visit her grandchild sometimes.

288
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,000
Let me go with you tomorrow, okay?

289
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
I'd better go by myself first.

290
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,160
Well,

291
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,120
I thought I'd go to plead with her

292
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,360
to move there with her grandchild.

293
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,680
I love you.

294
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,960
What now?

295
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,600
It's like Bussara is cleaning things up.

296
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,560
She played some clips.

297
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,400
She deleted some and saved some.

298
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,280
And she ordered Sak to do something.

299
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,640
What I was asking

300
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,360
is about your pregnancy.

301
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,480
What will you do? Will you keep the child?

302
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,760
Mom.

303
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,280
If you're trying to
send your mother-in-law to jail

304
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,600
while pregnant,

305
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,640
Phatchai would feel worse.

306
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,400
I've thought about this.

307
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,360
I'll gather all the evidence that I have

308
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,440
and send it to someone else.

309
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,120
That means everything Bussara did

310
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,640
will be exposed by someone else.

311
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,120
Like who?

312
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,440
Some uncorrupted police.

313
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,760
- I believe I can find one.
- Ou Yi.

314
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
There has to be some good police.

315
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,360
We just need to have
all the evidence in place.

316
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,400
Phatchai is looking for
a house in England.

317
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,680
I'll convince him to fly there.

318
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,360
During his leave,

319
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,400
we just need someone
to get into Bussara's house

320
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,720
and collect all the evidence.

321
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,560
Phoo might be able to help.

322
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,560
- How long do you need?
- One month.

323
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,520
I'll also tell Phatchai
to do some work there.

324
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,280
His client contacted him the other day,

325
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,720
and he seemed interested.

326
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,280
When everything goes as expected,

327
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,280
will you just move on
and act like you're not involved?

328
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,000
Yes.

329
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,080
And you'll hide it from him forever,

330
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,360
about who you really are?

331
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,960
Yes.

332
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,440
If this lie

333
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,960
can make it less painful for him,

334
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,120
I'll go with it.

335
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,200
Mom.

336
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,000
I love him.

337
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,200
He's a good man.

338
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,560
He'll be a good father.

339
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,000
And I won't abort my child.

340
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,840
I want a child of my own,

341
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,720
and I want that child
to have a good father.

342
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,560
Revenge

343
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,960
doesn't allow anyone
to have all the things they want.

344
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,480
If you want to quit,

345
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,080
do it right now.

346
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,000
Go have a good life.

347
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,480
If your mother were still alive,

348
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,800
she would say the same thing.

349
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,080
But I didn't do it just for her alone.

350
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,560
I'm doing this so no one
will have to suffer the same fate.

351
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,800
I think my mother
isn't the only corpse in that house.

352
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,440
I want to end
this vicious cycle once and for all.

353
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,920
Now we have a chance

354
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,680
and some evidence.

355
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,280
I know it's risky, but it has to be done.

356
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,120
We just need some help.

357
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,480
Then tell Phatchai

358
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,600
to go to England as soon as possible

359
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,400
and stay there as long as possible.

360
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,280
I'll tell Chi

361
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,920
to contact our people

362
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,160
who have means to access the evidence.

363
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,520
More importantly,

364
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,560
don't let Phatchai know

365
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,160
who you are yet.

366
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,560
Thank you, Mom,

367
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,200
for understanding.

368
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,040
Phat.

369
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,920
Dear.

370
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,480
What?

371
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,240
Here.

372
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,040
Do you like it?

373
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,080
Are you buying it?

374
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,840
I'll buy it for you.

375
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,000
No.

376
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,160
You're having a family.

377
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,880
You can't go back to living in a flat

378
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,480
for a bachelor like before.

379
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,000
That's harsh.

380
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,000
I didn't want to
stick my nose in your business

381
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,160
or anything.

382
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,400
I'm just telling you

383
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,040
that I wanted to buy it for you.

384
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,640
I don't understand. Why do you have to?

385
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,360
As a gift for my grandchild.

386
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,680
At the end of the day,

387
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,160
I know you won't let me
get involved with your family.

388
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,560
But I just want to
do something nice for my son

389
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,480
and my grandchild.

390
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,040
I've picked a few in good locations.

391
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,200
But this house is the best.

392
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,840
Go take a look.

393
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,000
Nine months aren't that long.

394
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,040
My grandchild
will see the world in no time.

395
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,800
Thank you.

396
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,240
What did the doctor say?

397
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,960
She's waiting for the list
of medicines Dr. Nitikon prescribed

398
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,600
to see if they have
any effects on the baby.

399
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,560
She said you told her
to look into it thoroughly.

400
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,360
That's right.

401
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,720
Phat, why don't you tell Thicha?

402
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,800
She wants to

403
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,720
buy a house in England for us.

404
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,680
She wants us to go see which one we like.

405
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,480
I'd like to buy it
as a gift for my grandchild.

406
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,840
Phat refused at first, but I insisted

407
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,160
because It's for my grandchild.

408
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,440
Just pick which one you like.

409
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,200
For the payment, I'll handle it.

410
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,400
Thank you, Mother.

411
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,400
So, I'll handle the tickets as well.

412
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,800
But I might need to stay here for now.

413
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,600
Stay here?

414
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,200
I meant my mom's house.

415
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,240
She still has a few doctor's appointments

416
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,360
and needs to wait for the results.

417
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,760
If her condition isn't serious,

418
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,600
I'll follow Phat there.

419
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,000
Can you go alone first?

420
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,240
I can wait for you, actually.

421
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,680
- There's no need.
- Don't.

422
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,480
You need to get it done quickly

423
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,760
so Thicha can live there when she arrives.

424
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,760
That's true.

425
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,360
I also don't really want
to travel that far.

426
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,159
You can also do some work there.

427
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,400
The project your regular client
contacted you about.

428
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,560
Oh?

429
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,280
If you have a client, that's good.

430
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,000
You can do all that in one go.

431
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,760
This might be the first time

432
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,920
that you two agree on something.

433
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,199
Mother.

434
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,440
I have something to ask you.

435
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,800
I'd like Phoo to take care of me there.

436
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,280
In England?

437
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,280
Phoo couldn't handle it, perhaps.

438
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,120
I can go, Ma'am.

439
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,360
I'll try to adjust.

440
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,360
I'll learn English. I can go.

441
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,280
That's a good idea

442
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,840
because if Phoo can do it,

443
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,240
we'll have someone
to take care of the baby.

444
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,360
Well, we might have to
prepare some travel documents.

445
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,560
Phoo, do you have an alien passport?

446
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,600
No, I don't have it.

447
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,640
What?

448
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,360
Why don't you have it, Phoo?

449
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,240
How long have you worked here?

450
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,360
She has it. Why wouldn't she?

451
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,760
I'm the one who handles all the documents.

452
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,480
She doesn't know what she's saying.

453
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,080
You two finish this.
I'm not hungry anymore.

454
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,680
Phoo.

455
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,280
Bring the tea set to my office.

456
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,520
- What's wrong, Cha?
- I'm okay.

457
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,400
- Cha!
- I'm fine.

458
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,280
Earlier,

459
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,080
when did I allow you to speak?

460
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,680
I'm sorry, Ms. Buss.

461
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,320
I got carried away.

462
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,760
Take off your shirt.

463
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,960
Ms. Buss, I won't do it again.

464
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,600
I said take off your shirt!

465
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,280
Take it all off.

466
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,040
Don't make any noise,
not even the slightest.

467
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,800
Don't you ever talk to anyone
about the permit again.

468
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,800
If my son wasn't here,

469
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,320
you'd be six feet under, you stupid bitch!

470
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,200
Hey, Phoo.

471
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,640
What's wrong?

472
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,200
What is it?

473
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,400
I spilled the tea.

474
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,440
Let me get the towel to wipe it.

475
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,160
Phat.

476
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,280
Could you go walk in the garden with me?

477
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,360
- Tell me when you find a house you like.
- Yes.

478
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,800
- I'll go now.
- Yeah.

479
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,960
Uncle Chi will come to pick you up, right?

480
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,400
Yeah. Call me when you arrive.

481
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,160
Take care of yourself.

482
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,960
- Please prepare the documents for Phoo.
- I won't let her go.

483
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,360
Phoo must be here with me.

484
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,200
Phoo must go with me.

485
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,920
Otherwise,

486
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,760
Phatchai will see
the medical certificate for my allergy.

487
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,240
Please let me know when it's done.

488
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,520
I'll come pick her up.

489
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,080
Mathee.

490
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,080
I need your help.

491
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,120
Of course.

492
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,320
- Any rewards for my efforts?
- Yes.

493
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,360
If you can really help,

494
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,280
I'll send the girl you want so much

495
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,680
right to your door.

496
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,040
Ms. Buss was calling Mathee, Ma'am.

497
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,880
She asked him to help with something

498
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,080
but didn't say it out loud.

499
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,360
She'll send me to Mathee.

500
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,280
When?

501
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,680
I don't know.

502
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,560
Calm down and do as we planned.

503
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,400
I'll find a way to get you
out of that house as soon as possible.

504
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,320
Anything urgent,
call Uncle Chi, as I told you.

505
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,480
Delete these messages after you read them.

506
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,880
Phoo said Bussara asked Mathee
to do something for her

507
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,520
and she'll send Phoo to him.

508
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,840
We now have some of our people
in Worot and that contractor's circles.

509
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,680
We still have no one
who can get close to Mathee.

510
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,360
That jerk is being careful.

511
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,280
How?

512
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,800
His subordinates are all Thai,
no foreigners at all.

513
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,440
Not even the maids.

514
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,000
He handpicks everyone himself.

515
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,880
We need to get it done
before Phatchai comes back.

516
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,320
The location is good.

517
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,400
It's convenient, but…

518
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,840
If we stay as a whole family,

519
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,320
the size just isn't working.

520
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,240
Our current apartment

521
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,800
is even bigger.

522
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,560
But we still have
a few places on our list.

523
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,600
I'll be ready in time. Don't worry.

524
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,400
Right. Okay. Talk to you later.

525
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,800
Phat.

526
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,840
When will you come back to live here?

527
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,680
If her mom recovers a bit, I think
I'll be here in two months.

528
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,280
Are you still seeing the doctor now?

529
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,360
I…

530
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,680
For the first few days in Thailand,

531
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,960
I was a bit down.

532
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,440
But when I was able to

533
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,600
talk openly with Mom,

534
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,280
I felt better.

535
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,000
I'm thinking about
seeing the doctor tomorrow

536
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,800
to see if I can stop taking the meds.

537
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,840
Does Thicha know about this?

538
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,320
I felt that I don't show any symptoms
when I'm with her.

539
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,800
So I didn't want to tell her.

540
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,960
If taking less meds
can make you feel better,

541
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,200
then no one has to know, right?

542
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,640
Good point.

543
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,480
I've gotten better because of you, Book.

544
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,440
- Cheers, mate.
- Uhhuh.

545
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,760
I feel that I hate this world less,

546
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,120
hate Mom less,

547
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,120
hate myself less.

548
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,920
You do interior design for…

549
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Arthur.

550
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,400
Arthur.

551
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,640
Hello.

552
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,920
How are you?

553
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,320
I met Arthur here too.

554
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,080
He's with his friend Bob,
who's an interior designer.

555
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,240
I might run into him again.
Anything you'd like me to tell him?

556
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,480
I plan to release
the sound clip I got first.

557
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,920
This clip is quite intense.
If they can make everyone forget,

558
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,400
they must be even more powerful.

559
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,480
There's nowhere left for you to run now.

560
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,520
Fuck!

561
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,840
Ms. Buss wants
a background check for two people.

562
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,000
NIWARIN, THICHA INSAREE

563
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,200
- Mr. Mathee sent these gifts for Ms. Buss.
- Can you open it, Phoo?

564
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,800
If it's opened, I'm as good as dead.

565
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,600
