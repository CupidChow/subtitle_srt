1
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,119
I'll see you there then.

2
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,440
Oh, Good Morning, Mr. Phatchai.

3
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,400
Good Morning.

4
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,400
Let me order quickly.

5
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,040
Are you working nearby? Or…

6
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Did you come to wait for me?

7
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,440
I'm here for you.

8
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,000
And I've been waiting every day.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,120
I saw that you're usually here
in your running outfit every morning,

10
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,840
so I’ve been waiting every day.

11
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,680
I'm so tired lately.

12
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,680
The morning alarm couldn't wake me up.

13
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,840
Do you live nearby?

14
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,040
Yes.

15
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,400
My flat is five minutes from here.

16
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,640
I have to get going. Nice to see you.

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,360
Wait.

18
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,480
Can I have your number?

19
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,680
I may be able to give you
a wake-up call tomorrow.

20
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,720
Because

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,120
if you stop running
for a few days, it will be unhealthy.

22
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,880
Also,

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,880
my clients might need
an interior designer.

24
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,680
So I'll recommend you.

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
And…

26
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,920
- I’d like to invite you to dinner.
- Okay.

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,360
That one is the most interesting.

28
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,560
I don't like going out on
on Friday nights.

29
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,760
I don't know why.
You can try to figure out

30
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,840
what day I might want to go.

31
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,520
Okay.

32
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,880
I'll call you then.

33
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,280
This is much easier than I thought.

34
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,520
Yes. Understood.

35
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,840
Yes. I'll be careful.

36
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,000
Niwai lives by the river.

37
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,800
People around that area
might know her as "Niwarin"

38
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,040
or just "Warin."

39
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,160
Remember this address.

40
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,040
If something happens one day,

41
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,440
you have to go there.

42
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,720
She will help you

43
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,960
because she understands

44
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,760
how escaping poverty

45
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,560
and ending up in hell feels like.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
- Who's that?
- What the hell?

47
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,120
- Son of a bitch!
- Damn you!

48
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,400
Get him!

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,040
Who do you think you are?

50
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,280
- Get him!
- Run!

51
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,640
- Screw you!
- Run!

52
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
You want to be a hero?

53
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,960
- Are you happy now?
- Run!

54
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,720
Run!

55
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,640
Let go of me!

56
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,760
Run!

57
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,040
Run!

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,480
Niwai lost her brother

59
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,560
and fought for survival for years.

60
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,320
Yi!

61
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
Yi!

62
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,360
Yi!

63
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,800
Tell her who you are.

64
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,320
I'm sure

65
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,040
Niwai will help you.

66
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,240
Yi!

67
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,280
You should stop her.

68
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,240
I think there are better ways
than giving herself to a man.

69
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,880
What ways?

70
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,080
Call the police?

71
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,120
Tell them that her mom was killed
by respected public figures?

72
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,360
Who would listen to us?

73
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,120
Even after Yi became Thicha,

74
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,000
she's still not safe around the police.

75
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,080
Yi has…

76
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,360
assumed the identity of a dead person.

77
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,520
She was around the same age as her.

78
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,560
She was sick and passed away in her home.

79
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,680
The parents didn't declare her death,

80
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,360
and we went to get her ID card.

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,880
But they were happy

82
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,520
that their daugther

83
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,600
made them hundreds of thousands.

84
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,040
We'll approach through the son.

85
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,720
It might sounds stupid,

86
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,600
but it’s the only way

87
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,240
to get into Bussara's house.

88
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,680
Yi will have to give herself.

89
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,120
Here. This is the highlight of this place.

90
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,320
Volcano Chicken.

91
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,440
It's so good, especially the sauce.

92
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,040
If I eat it alone,

93
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,440
I can never finish it.
I have them pack it for takeaway.

94
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,400
Then,

95
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,080
when I heat it up at home,
it's still good.

96
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,840
Does that mean you eat alone all the time?

97
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,600
You’re the first one
I’ve brought to this place.

98
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
What about other places?

99
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,520
At the other places,

100
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,400
I also eat alone. I'm sort of a

101
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,880
solo eater.

102
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,160
Oh!

103
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,480
Are you okay?

104
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,320
Alright. Would you like to come
to my flat to get changed or…

105
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,480
Yeah. I'm okay with that.

106
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,640
But can you tell them
to send the food to your place?

107
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,560
I'd like to eat before heading home.

108
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,560
I'm sick of the leftovers at my place.

109
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,520
Okay. Let me tell them first.

110
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Right.

111
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,800
Wait a moment. I have some clean shirts.

112
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,680
I'll go get it.

113
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,280
Just a shirt will be fine.

114
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,760
My skirt is still good.

115
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,280
Hey. I forgot

116
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,240
that we'll be eating.

117
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,360
I'll do fine with a comfy T-shirt.

118
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,360
I'm a messy eater.

119
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,280
This can get messy. I don't mind.

120
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,040
Please.

121
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,640
Let today be the day
only my shirt got messy.

122
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,840
I'll go find it then. Just wait here.

123
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Uh, the food must be here.

124
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,360
I'll go get it.
You can keep looking for the shirt.

125
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,600
- Be right back.
- Okay.

126
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,320
This won't work.

127
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,280
What did you ask the receptionist about?

128
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,840
Well.

129
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,720
I just asked if

130
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,000
that employee would be fined or let go.

131
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,840
And what did she say?

132
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Sha said

133
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
the employee
might be fined and then fired.

134
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,520
So, I paid the fine for her.

135
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,600
But whether she'll be allowed to stay
or not, I can't do anything about that.

136
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,360
It's their business, isn't it?

137
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,480
That's all I could do.

138
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,880
It was good enough

139
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,840
for a first date.

140
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,840
You impressed me.

141
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,560
I think I'd like to be one
who talks to the janitor

142
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,840
the same way I would talk to the CEO.

143
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,000
I think it’s important to show respect.

144
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,520
It's hard to find someone
who thinks like that,

145
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,960
especially when you’re rich

146
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,360
and come from a very respected family.

147
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,320
Do you know me that well?

148
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,000
Your last name is well known.

149
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,960
It's my mom.
So weird that she is calling me now.

150
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,520
God, I didn’t realize it was this late.

151
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,840
I should get going.

152
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,640
- Let me walk you home.
- It's okay.

153
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,600
I'll be fine. I'll tell you when I'm home.

154
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,240
Today

155
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,520
was a lot of fun.

156
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,440
So delicious, and so messy.

157
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,080
Thank you.

158
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,040
Right. Be safe.

159
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,840
My son didn't pick up my call.

160
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,960
Is that girl still in his room?

161
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,960
She has left.

162
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,680
Is this the first time

163
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,360
he’s brought a date to his room?

164
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,160
Yes.

165
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,120
Keep an eye on him.

166
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,440
If it's the same girl next time,

167
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,120
take her picture and send it to me.

168
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,240
Let me see what she looks like.

169
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Yes, Ma'am.

170
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,080
Yes, Ms. Buss.

171
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,840
Mr. Methi will be here tomorrow.

172
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,000
Prepare food for four to five people.

173
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,360
Get everything done before six o'clock.

174
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes, Ma'am.

175
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,200
Phu!

176
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Wanni!

177
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,840
Tomorrow, that pervert
will be at Ms. Buss’s house again.

178
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,880
Phu, will you be alright this time?

179
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,040
Can you bring me to work for
your employer? Did you ask her?

180
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,240
You can cut my pay by half.

181
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,600
Do you want to talk to her?

182
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,320
She's waiting right there.

183
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,680
We must hurry. Sak's about to pick me up.

184
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,120
I can't afford another worker.

185
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,240
Madam.

186
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,520
Could you find me a new job?

187
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,360
It can be any house.

188
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,720
I can't continue working for my employer.

189
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,160
Who's your employer?

190
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,760
What's the name?

191
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,240
Bussara, Ma'am.

192
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,240
Bussara

193
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,080
Thanakitcharoenphon.

194
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,360
Thanakitcharoenphon?

195
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,800
Thank you everyone.

196
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,720
SHARING LOVE FOR THE ORPHANAGE

197
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,120
When I see these
healthy and happy children,

198
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,880
I feel so blessed.

199
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,200
This might be a small step,

200
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,720
but I promise

201
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,160
that the Bussara Group

202
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,760
will continue to develop home projects

203
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,040
with kindness,
while providing more opportunities.

204
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,440
The famous children's foundation owner?

205
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,400
Phu.

206
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,440
There's nothing I can do.

207
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,760
No.

208
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,600
Don't take her to the hospital.

209
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,000
Just let her give birth in the woods.

210
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,560
Hey! Be quiet! Why do you have to whine?

211
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,880
Ma’am, I don’t think
she can give birth by herself.

212
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,920
Then who's the stupid one
who brought a pregnant woman?

213
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,680
Next time, check carefully.

214
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
There are tons of those

215
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,640
who were born and grew up here.

216
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,600
They also paid for one person.

217
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,160
But…

218
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,600
Leave her there.

219
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,640
If she's so damn weak, let her die
and be reborn elsewhere. What a nuisance!

220
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
You! Are you going or not?

221
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,000
Then get in the truck!

222
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,920
Hurry up!

223
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,560
- No!
- What the hell are you looking at?

224
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
No!

225
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,640
No!

226
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,160
Wait!

227
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
Wait!

228
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,160
Wait for me!

229
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,440
I promise

230
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,280
that the Bussara Group
will continue to develop home projects

231
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,640
with kindness, while providing
more opportunities.

232
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,600
Personally, I believe that

233
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,240
everyone deserves the opportunity…

234
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,240
BUSSARA GROUP LAUNCHED
LOVE FOR ORPHANAGE PROJECT

235
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,680
and equality…

236
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,200
Did our brothers and sisters
mostly come through her?

237
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,440
Almost all of them, Ma'am.

238
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,960
She can smuggle a lot of us in one go.

239
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,080
It was fast and we never
got stopped by the police.

240
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,280
But they have no permits.

241
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,840
No one is investigating her.

242
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,680
She has strong allies.

243
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,400
Yes.

244
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,960
The checkpoint officers and
document clerks. They're all her people.

245
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,200
Once we've entered, no one knows
where any of us are sent.

246
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,560
There’s still a lot we can’t find out.

247
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,240
What Yi is doing

248
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,320
will help us a lot.

249
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,640
If we can gather the evidence

250
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,000
and bring charges against them.

251
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,520
When do you think she can come back?

252
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,120
I don't know

253
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,040
how far Yi and Bussara's son will get.

254
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,120
She just told me she'll be quick

255
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,920
and come back as soon as possible.

256
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,640
Hello there.

257
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,000
Oh, it's you.

258
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,880
What a coincidence.

259
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,120
What are you doing out here?

260
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,600
I'm meeting my friend around here.

261
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,040
What about you? Having a party?

262
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,560
Oh, yes.

263
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,440
I'm meeting my friends
at a bar nearby too.

264
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,160
Would you like to join us?
They're all my friends.

265
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,200
I'm an introvert.

266
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,480
I can't handle meeting
too many new people at once.

267
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,880
Wait.

268
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,280
Do you want to go somewhere?

269
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,320
What do you mean?

270
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,360
Well…

271
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,120
It can be anywhere you're comfortable

272
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,080
and suitable for introverts like us two.

273
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,480
Us two?

274
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,880
You too?

275
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,880
I don't believe you.
You look like a party animal.

276
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,440
Not that much. I just

277
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,560
wanna relax sometime.

278
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,240
I can't entertain people all the time.

279
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,600
I understand.

280
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,240
Sometimes, you’re not really smiling

281
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,400
as it appears on the outside.

282
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,800
What you show

283
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,240
is not who you are. I think

284
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,520
I really understand that.

285
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,200
I know a small restaurant.

286
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,880
They let you open wine,

287
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,040
and their cheese is great.

288
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,920
Okay.

289
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,920
Then, let's say that…

290
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,600
I'm the wine and you're the cheese.

291
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,120
Let's go. Which way is it?

292
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,960
Why didn't you pick up my calls?
What have you been doing?

293
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,640
Everyone must be asleep,

294
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,640
right?

295
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,640
It's almost 3 a.m. here.

296
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,960
I'll wake him up.

297
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,640
Your mom called.

298
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,080
Hello, Mom.

299
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,280
Phatchai.

300
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,240
I have to thank that girl.

301
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,920
No matter how rude she is,

302
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,560
she helped me get a hold of you.

303
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,840
See you around.

304
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,120
Phatchai!

305
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,640
Uh, Mom.

306
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,240
It's late here. I'll call you tomorrow.

307
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,680
Follow the girl
who just left Phat's apartment.

308
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,280
I want to know who she is.

309
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,920
I'm sorry for being rude.

310
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,160
I couldn't sleep,
so I went to get some air.

311
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,160
I saw that your mom called you repeatedly.

312
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,800
I figured she might have
something urgent. Tell her I'm sorry.

313
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,040
Seems like he’s taking a few medications.

314
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,880
I'll check on that.

315
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,800
I've ordered a copy of his key.

316
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,040
We'll see if it works.

317
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,240
But from looking around his place,

318
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,000
nothing seems to indicate

319
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,160
that he is Bussara's son.

320
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
Seems like

321
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,760
he doesn't care much about his mother.

322
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,920
If he doesn't seem to have
connections with Bussara,

323
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,200
then we can leave him alone.

324
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,520
Let me try a few more times.

325
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,160
I'll have to use him
to get to his mother anyway.

326
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,800
I'll tell you once I have any updates.

327
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,840
Shall we go for a walk tomorrow?

328
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,920
PHATCHAI

329
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
Okay.

330
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,240
THICHA

331
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,160
Oh. Hello.

332
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You're a drug dealer now?

333
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,840
Just kidding. What's in this?

334
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,040
Don't… say anything.

335
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,280
You only have two choices.

336
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,360
Eat it or don't.

337
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,120
What should I say if I don't want to?

338
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,520
I'm kidding!

339
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,960
Is it okay?

340
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,880
What?

341
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,120
Why can't you sugarcoat it a little bit?

342
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,480
"It's fine, it's edible,
it's alright" or something.

343
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,720
Well,

344
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,880
I hate lying.

345
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,880
Hey.

346
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,640
The taste…

347
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,880
is one thing. But it's good

348
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,920
because no one has ever done this for me.

349
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,720
I don't believe you.

350
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,000
How has no one ever cooked
for Mr. Phatchai?

351
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,240
Yeah. Sucks to be me.

352
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,760
No one ever cooked for me.

353
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,320
Not even my mom.

354
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,160
I've never done this for anyone either.

355
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,880
I don't know why I wanted to do it.

356
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,920
I

357
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,520
wasted a lot of bread.

358
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,720
It's weird.

359
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,120
This feeling, all of a sudden.

360
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,040
Hey.

361
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,920
If you have to

362
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,840
keep eating terrible

363
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,960
sandwiches every day…

364
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
- Will you…
- I'll eat it.

365
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,240
Yeah, I can eat this every day.

366
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,400
If you'll eat that every day,

367
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,920
will you jog with me every day?

368
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,720
Yeah.

369
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,520
She's Thai. Her name is Thicha Insee.

370
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,760
She's a freelance interior designer.

371
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,400
They might know each other from work.

372
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,440
She has only a one year
rental contract at her current place.

373
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,760
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

374
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,600
Let's order something then.

375
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,960
What should we get?

376
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,440
The same as yesterday?

377
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,840
Phatchai has no contacts
who are involved in Bussara’s network.

378
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,520
No one at all.

379
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
The coffee shop
gave me these beans to try out.

380
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,040
It's nice, isn't it?

381
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,400
Do you know, this is the first time

382
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,360
I think

383
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
this life doesn't need much.

384
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,000
This is the first time

385
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,280
that I want to have amnesia.

386
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,600
Why?

387
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,680
Yeah, why?

388
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,000
Do you have nightmares?

389
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,280
You also have nightmares quite often.

390
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,120
Well.

391
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,560
Someone told me that before.

392
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,920
Who?

393
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,560
Who told you that?

394
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,840
- Tell me.
- Wait.

395
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,760
Who told you that?

396
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,400
- Tell me who it was.
- Wait. Wait.

397
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,920
It was my friend.

398
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,280
My friend. Really.

399
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,800
Don't ever do it.

400
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,200
From now on, don't cross the line.

401
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,120
And I swear

402
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,040
that I'll love only you.

403
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,840
You decided to come back?

404
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,920
Yes. It's been a while.

405
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,240
And he's really not involved.

406
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,360
I'll cut him out of this equation

407
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,160
and find another way to get to Bussara.

408
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,520
Good. That will save us some time.

409
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,040
When will you be coming back?

410
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,520
In a few days.
I'll go once I have a ticket.

411
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,880
My adoptive mother is not well.

412
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,040
I need to hurry and be by her side.
I didn't have a chance to tell you.

413
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,960
I'll call you once I'm in Thailand.

414
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,280
Thicha returned to Thailand. She…

415
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,800
She won't be coming back.

416
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,480
Well…

417
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,560
What will you do?

418
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,680
What will I do?

419
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,360
What to do…

420
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,440
Well…

421
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,200
The kids practiced making sweets. Try it.

422
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,720
I heard they'll sell these
in one of our shops.

423
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,360
Is it okay?

424
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,800
It's pretty good.

425
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,960
Did you hear from him?

426
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,160
He calls me sometimes.

427
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,880
Let's say you don't know his mother.

428
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,240
What is he like?

429
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,600
He's a good man.

430
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
He's a good man, Mom.

431
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,480
What?

432
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,040
What's wrong? I'll just…

433
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,240
Get married and invite
her adoptive mother to live with us.

434
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,480
I think she's the one.

435
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,640
When you said "the one",

436
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,400
she's who you want.

437
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,400
What does your mother want?
The son of Lady Bussara

438
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,200
returns to Thailand
to propose to that one girl,

439
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,240
who his mother

440
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,880
hasn't even met?

441
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,760
Seriously?

442
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,960
Do you really think your mother

443
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,480
would allow this?

444
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,760
PHATCHAI

445
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,440
PHATCHAI

446
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,960
PHATCHAI

447
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,240
Yes?

448
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,760
Wanna get married?

449
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,720
Huh?

450
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,880
I'm talking to your toothbrush.

451
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,240
What are you saying?

452
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,920
I want to brush my teeth
with you every morning

453
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,400
and every night before bed.

454
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,480
I understand if you think it's too soon.

455
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,360
But I don't think it matters,

456
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,160
if we clicked with each other.

457
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,840
What do you say?

458
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,280
Please don't.

459
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,160
Why?

460
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,600
I'll fly to Thailand…

461
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,880
And get on one knee in front of you.

462
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,600
I'll invite your adoptive mother
to live with us here.

463
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,720
We'll find a house to live in.

464
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,560
I want you to meet my mom.

465
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,600
Let her know what's going on.

466
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,720
And after we get married,

467
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,680
we'll move back to England

468
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,000
so she can't bother us anymore.

469
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,400
I…

470
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,040
I probably can't go back
to England for some time.

471
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,000
I mean,

472
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,000
if we are to get married,

473
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,520
we might have to stay here for a while.

474
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,520
It can be anywhere.

475
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,120
It can be your house.

476
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,920
Yeah.

477
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,600
Then, I'll be there as soon as possible

478
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,560
and we'll go through
the details together, okay?

479
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,120
Great. That's the plan.

480
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,640
I love you, Cha.

481
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,560
I love you too.

482
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,280
Let me carry them for you.

483
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,680
This way, Ma'am.

484
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,160
Hey.

485
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,440
Don't be afraid.

486
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,280
The office is this way.

487
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,400
Did Mom add this part to the house?

488
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,240
Because this area used to be…

489
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,080
The yard.

490
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,920
Finally.

491
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,240
Finally,

492
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,640
my son is home.

493
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,960
My dear son is here.

494
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,400
Someone said that

495
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,920
you'll know
if you're ready to take revenge

496
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,560
when you

497
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,440
look into the eyes of your enemy

498
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,480
again.

499
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,800
Good to see you, Mother.

500
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,760
I have some gifts for you.

501
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,520
I came back to marry her.

502
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,000
I want to see for once,

503
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,560
what her gaze would look like.

504
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,040
Good Evening, Ms. Bussara.

505
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,640
I hope

506
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,680
you'll remember this day

507
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,400
for the rest of your life.

508
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,280
I warned you!

509
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,840
