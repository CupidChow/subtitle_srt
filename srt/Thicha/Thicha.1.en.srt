1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,920
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,920
CREATED SOLELY FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES,

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,920
WITH NO INTENTION TO INCITE VIOLENCE
OR DISCREDIT ANY ORGANIZATION.

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,840
STOP - SECURITY CHECK POINT

5
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,800
Whoa. Slow down. Stop right here.

6
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,120
Evening, Boss.

7
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,160
What's the cargo? Let me take a look.

8
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,200
Get up there.

9
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,920
Open them up.

10
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,440
What's in there?

11
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,200
They're all pickled vegetables, Boss.

12
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,680
Boss. I have some for you too.

13
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,600
These are yours.

14
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,200
Clear the way.

15
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,320
Thank you, Boss.

16
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,520
Go. Drive safe.

17
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,800
Yes, Boss.

18
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,880
- Mom.
- Hmm?

19
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,360
My legs hurt. I can't breath.

20
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,680
Hang in there. I'm in pain too.

21
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,000
You were curled up
in my womb for nine months.

22
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,000
You'll be fine in here.

23
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,680
You talk like I’m about to be born again.

24
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,680
Yes.

25
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,920
We're about to be born again.

26
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,480
We’ll wait here for the ride to town.

27
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,160
Don't stray too far.

28
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,360
The woods are your bathroom. Food
and drinks will be handed out once a day.

29
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,760
We'll get you there once the ride is here.

30
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,920
Next.

31
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,120
Here.

32
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,800
Hey, I heard they said
we’ve got to wait a few more days.

33
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,280
What?

34
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,640
That's not fair. We paid extra

35
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,000
because they said
they’d take us to town right away.

36
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,800
Just wait.

37
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,480
Don't make them mad.
You’ve got a daughter to take care of.

38
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,680
Yeow. Yeow.

39
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,000
Are you okay?

40
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,680
Wait here.

41
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,400
Someone is sick.

42
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,880
Do you hear me?
Someone has a stomach ache.

43
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,400
What does she want?

44
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,280
Someone has a stomach ache.

45
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,600
Do you have any medicine?
Can we see a doctor?

46
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,640
Look at me. Do I look like a tour guide?

47
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,640
Huh?

48
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,040
Do I look like the guy
who takes you to the doctor and stuff?

49
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,440
Are you just going
to let her stay sick like that?

50
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,080
We paid a lot

51
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,080
because they told us

52
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,560
they’d even help with work permits
once we got here.

53
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,240
Why are they treating us like this?

54
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,080
- Yes.
- That's right.

55
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,080
- Right?
- Yes!

56
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,360
- Yeah!
- How could you?

57
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,480
Yes!

58
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,320
This is heaven
compared to where you came from.

59
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,240
If you can’t handle it,

60
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,640
then get the hell out of here!

61
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,320
Get her legs.

62
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,080
Ma'am, Master Phatchai is ready.

63
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,880
I won’t be seeing you off at the airport.

64
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,440
In the first few months,

65
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,480
you’ll need a lot of patience.

66
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,520
It cost me a lot

67
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,440
to get you into this school.

68
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,200
Once you’ve settled in, study hard.

69
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,320
If everything goes well
and you get good grades,

70
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,960
you can visit sometime.

71
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,680
Yes, Mom.

72
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,200
My Phatchai is the best,

73
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,400
right?

74
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,280
What happened?

75
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,560
Good.

76
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,400
Get rid of whatever the problem is.

77
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,920
Someone there speaks Thai?

78
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,880
They won't shut up
if you leave them like that.

79
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,760
Let me handle this.

80
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,800
Someone is looking for
a housemaid who can speak Thai.

81
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,880
But you said we’d get jobs
once we got to town.

82
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,320
Do you want the job or not?

83
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,960
Where’s the sick woman?

84
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,920
If I were you, I wouldn't care
if someone disappeared.

85
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,320
So, do you want it or not?

86
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,240
Where will it be?

87
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,000
What about the alien ID?

88
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,520
Someone wants a housemaid
who can speak Thai.

89
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,080
It's me. I can speak Thai.

90
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,080
I can too.

91
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,120
Then let's go.

92
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,800
I'll go.

93
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
Go ahead then.

94
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,240
Let's go.

95
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,160
Follow me.

96
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,040
Bring them here and leave them to me.

97
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,200
Let them in through the back door.

98
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,720
Get out of the car.

99
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,520
Clean these two up

100
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,080
before taking them to Ms. Buss.

101
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,920
This way. Come.

102
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,880
Mom, there's a bed.

103
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,600
Never speak our language out there.

104
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,240
Where are you from?

105
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,760
Just go take a shower.
The bathroom is there.

106
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,480
Mom, I could even sleep here.

107
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,880
Take a shower,

108
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,920
and we’ll go meet our master.

109
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,960
You'll have to do your best.

110
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,640
Did you two really shower?

111
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,800
Yes.

112
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,560
Step back a little.

113
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,440
How old is your daughter,
and what are your names?

114
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,840
She's ten years old.

115
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,440
Her name is Auyi. I’m Yeow.

116
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,920
She's pretty.

117
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,800
You can speak Thai, but can you read?

118
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,720
No, Ma'am.

119
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,120
Aside from an alien passport,

120
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,000
do you want work permits as well?

121
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,440
Yes please.

122
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,120
Right? Without them, it will be a hassle.

123
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,720
You won't be able to go anywhere,

124
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,520
right?

125
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,600
Yes.

126
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,760
But it’s not cheap to get these documents.

127
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,880
Do you have money?

128
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,080
Only

129
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,560
the entrance fee for both of us

130
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,680
which cost all the money we had.

131
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,720
I'll pay for those two documents first,

132
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,400
but it will come out of your salary.

133
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,400
Yes, Ma'am.

134
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,880
Teach her everything
she needs to know, quickly.

135
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,040
Start cleaning downstairs at 3:30 a.m.

136
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,600
Wipe everything with dust cloths
before mopping three times.

137
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,360
Don't make loud noises.

138
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,520
Don't break anything.

139
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,840
Don't misplace anything.

140
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,640
Everything must be done by six o’clock

141
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,160
because Ms. Buss
comes down to exercise then.

142
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,960
Use that time to prepare breakfast.

143
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,320
The food must be ready by 8:00.

144
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Serve it and leave.
Ms. Buss doesn't want to see us.

145
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,400
And during that time,

146
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,960
don’t make a sound.

147
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,240
Never do that.

148
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,200
Mom.

149
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,400
I'm sorry.

150
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,320
Yeah.

151
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,120
Who did that?

152
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,320
It was me. It slipped.

153
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,040
Come with me.

154
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,120
Bring that too.

155
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
Wait here.

156
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,760
Ms. Buss wants to see you.

157
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,760
I'm alright.

158
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,840
Tell her to clean it.

159
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,560
Wipe it.

160
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Wipe it.

161
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,120
Take a deep breath. I'm right here.

162
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,120
We'll be fine.
Just do your best cleaning up.

163
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,680
What is it, Son?

164
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,200
At first it will be like this.

165
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,000
When all the boys are together,

166
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,480
some will show off.

167
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,000
Phatchai, you must be more patient.

168
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,480
Phatchai, you must be more patient.

169
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,600
Yes, Mom.

170
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,760
If the school doesn’t report
what they did to you,

171
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,200
your mom won’t understand.

172
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,720
No one reports it because they didn't
see you get beaten outside of school.

173
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,480
My face looks like this,
and no one saw a thing.

174
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,800
I've been here for almost two weeks,

175
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,640
and I still can’t open my eye fully.

176
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,760
You're new,

177
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,680
so they're excited about you.
It will get better.

178
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,160
Want some apples?

179
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,240
You'll feel better.

180
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,720
Can I even eat with this messed-up mouth?

181
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,120
Yeah, trust me man. It will taste great,
even with a busted mouth.

182
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,680
Just try it.

183
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,640
We were cool back in Thailand.

184
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,000
But here, we're just
second-class citizens.

185
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,720
We’re discriminated
against and threatened.

186
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,560
We have to be like ghosts to survive.

187
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,560
Don't walk up to them.
Don't make eye contact.

188
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,240
Avoid them whenever you can,

189
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,160
because they do whatever they want.

190
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,080
When will you learn?

191
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,040
Stupid!

192
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,320
Run when you can.
If not, you have to fight.

193
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,960
Those are your only choices.

194
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,240
Hey, Book!

195
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,360
FOUR YEARS LATER

196
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,200
Why does it always
have to be my workers, Methi?

197
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Can’t you just find
someone else, anywhere? Please.

198
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,160
Prepare food
for six or seven people tomorrow.

199
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,680
We’re having a party.

200
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,920
Auyi, come help your mom with that too.

201
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,520
What did Ms. Buss say?

202
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,040
She said…

203
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,880
"The mother wouldn’t agree."

204
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,360
"We'll see tomorrow."

205
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,360
That’s all I know.

206
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,200
I couldn’t catch everything,

207
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,080
but it involves that Methi.

208
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,600
You need to improve your English,

209
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,160
or we won't know

210
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,360
what we’re up against.

211
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,640
Yes.

212
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,320
I need your help.

213
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,720
There's a curry and rice shop
in the market that our people go to.

214
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,720
Give this to the shop owner.

215
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,080
Tell them to send it
to the person written here.

216
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,440
Niwai?

217
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,800
Can you read Thai?

218
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,080
Yes, I’ve been practicing for years.

219
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,560
Teach your kid as quickly as possible.

220
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,600
If something bad happens, go to Niwai.

221
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,080
What? What bad thing?

222
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,880
Hey, let's go! Traffic is going to be bad.

223
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Get in.

224
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,000
Hello, my name is Yeow.

225
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,320
I've been in Thailand for four years.

226
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,160
- What else?
- That’s it.

227
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,720
My employer is Ms. Bussara.

228
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,200
She seems nice, but she's actually not.

229
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,760
Can you send this letter?

230
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,200
Please, as soon as possible.

231
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,400
She said she’d get me a work permit,

232
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,880
but she didn't.

233
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,640
She beats me and my daughter all the time.

234
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,680
I can't go anywhere. My pay is too low.

235
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,200
Yeah.

236
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,240
I think

237
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,480
Bussara and her friends,

238
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,800
who are a lawyer,

239
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,160
a police officer, a contractor,

240
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,480
and many others,

241
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,080
are behind the agency smuggling laborers

242
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,560
and treating us like animals.

243
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,720
Yes.

244
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,520
Cheers. Cheers.

245
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,440
Cheers.

246
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,440
Cheers. Oh, yes.

247
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,480
So, about the place

248
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,360
where’s it going to be held?

249
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,800
Are there any plans?

250
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,920
Not yet.

251
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,600
There’s the beach.

252
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,960
Now, I'm so scared

253
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,160
because I feel my girl isn’t safe.

254
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,080
Want some drinks?

255
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,400
I want to run away.

256
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,000
Can you help me?

257
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,400
I’ll do anything you need.

258
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Please help us. Yeow.

259
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,160
Well, let's call it a night.

260
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,160
I have an early flight tomorrow.

261
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,040
Yes, Ma'am. I’ve got plans too.

262
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,560
Can you drive home, Mr. lawyer?

263
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,600
Huh?

264
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,240
I’m not heading home yet.

265
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,720
I think I'll stay for some refreshing tea.

266
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,840
Okay.

267
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,200
Then I'll head home.

268
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,560
- Good night, Ms. Buss.
- Good night.

269
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,400
Let Auyi prepare some hot tea
and serve it in the tea room.

270
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,440
Yes.

271
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,280
Thank you.

272
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,280
Oh, right, someone needs

273
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,600
around 50 laborers, men or women.

274
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,720
They just need to be
healthy and hardworking.

275
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,080
We’ve got two more trucks
coming in next week. I’ll handle it.

276
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,200
That will be 30,000 baht each.

277
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,800
Thirty thousand? Sure.

278
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,240
In that case, I'll ask for
a little extra as my share.

279
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,000
That one happens to be wealthy.

280
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,200
That's convenient.

281
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,800
No risks. No complications.

282
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,840
And you'll still have
some extra money in the end.

283
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,600
Say that again, Buss.

284
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,000
I risk a lot helping you these days.

285
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,760
Give Mr. Methi a massage as well.
He's got a headache.

286
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,040
My head hurts.

287
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,920
Come on.

288
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,240
Come here!

289
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,000
What is my daughter doing?

290
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,760
Nothing. She'll come out soon.

291
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,960
I said she'll be out soon.

292
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,920
Ms. Buss.

293
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,040
Please let my daughter out.

294
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,240
What did Ms. Buss tell you to do? Huh?

295
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,160
Damn you!

296
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,720
Auyi, Auyi!

297
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,280
- Don't!
- You bitch!

298
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,000
- Come here.
- Let go of her!

299
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,080
Take this!

300
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,800
Remember.

301
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,280
People like you
have no rights to say "Don't",

302
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,040
"No", "Can't", "Won't", "Shouldn't".

303
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,080
Don't you ever forget that!

304
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,720
Methi, Methi!

305
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,640
What!

306
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,000
Okay then.

307
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,000
Just send that little bitch to my house.

308
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,640
You'd be in trouble if not for me.

309
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,320
Methi!

310
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,200
Come on, Buss.

311
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,280
These ones are just

312
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,880
objects that we can send to each other.

313
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,120
Like a New Year's gift.

314
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,600
I'll be waiting at my place.
Don't forget to send it.

315
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
Don't worry.

316
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,200
Your girl will lie comfortably in bed

317
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,880
and I'll screw her
till she forgets about her mom.

318
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,600
Tell your girl to pack up.

319
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,000
No.

320
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,160
After three or four months, he'll
bring her back once he gets bored of her.

321
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,640
If you behave.

322
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,720
No!

323
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,880
Yeow!

324
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,280
No!

325
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,960
I said no! I won't let it happen!

326
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,760
Get our things.

327
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,000
Auyi.

328
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,480
Mom!

329
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,000
Mom! Mom!

330
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,320
Help me, Mom! Let me go!

331
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,760
Mom!

332
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,560
Mom!

333
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,720
Let go! Mom!

334
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,320
Mom!

335
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,600
Mom!

336
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,400
Mom!

337
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,320
Mom!

338
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,840
I'll send your girl to Methi's

339
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,400
and he'll rape her until she goes insane.

340
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Let me go!

341
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,600
Mark my words.

342
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,800
Remember it in your next life, bitch!

343
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,400
Why don't you come with me?

344
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,440
Mom!

345
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,440
Mom!

346
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,360
Stop right there!

347
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,199
Let my daughter go.

348
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,560
Go!

349
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,560
Run! Get away from here!

350
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,360
Go see Niwai!

351
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,679
Run!

352
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,040
Help!

353
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,400
Help! Auyi!

354
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,800
Stop!

355
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,040
Help! Help!

356
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,880
Mom!

357
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,719
Mom! Mom!

358
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,000
Auyi!

359
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,440
Mom!

360
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,560
Yeow!

361
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,120
Mom!

362
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,080
Mom!

363
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,200
No!

364
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,040
No!

365
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,720
Let me go!

366
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,440
Mom!

367
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,080
Mom! Let go!

368
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,240
Let go of me!

369
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,720
Mom!

370
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,200
Mom! Mom! Mom!

371
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,120
Mom.

372
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,600
Mom. Mom.

373
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,160
Mom.

374
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,000
Mom.

375
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,360
Mom.

376
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
Mom!

377
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,960
Mom.

378
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,520
Auyi…

379
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,720
Auyi…

380
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,360
You talk like I’m about to be born again.

381
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,280
Yes. We're about to be born again.

382
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,320
Auyi…

383
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,000
Mom.

384
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,600
Mom.

385
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,760
Mom!

386
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,320
Mom!

387
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,720
Mom!

388
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,280
Mom!

389
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,360
Mom.

390
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,600
Bring that little bitch up here.

391
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,480
Cover her up.
Don't let anyone see the body.

392
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,520
Send the girl to Methi.

393
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,000
Yes, Ma'am.

394
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,440
Let's go.

395
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,320
When you're done cover her up.

396
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,760
Plant a tree on top of her.

397
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,360
Yes, Ma'am.

398
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,200
Hold on to her okay?

399
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,520
Why bother? She’s probably
already freaked the hell out.

400
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,800
Hey! Where are you going?

401
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,120
What's going on back there?

402
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,520
Son of a bitch!

403
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,160
Hey! Don't jump!

404
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,000
Damn it!

405
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,760
ENGLAND

406
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,880
MANY YEARS LATER

407
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,000
Good Evening, Mr. Phatchai.

408
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,040
Good Evening,

409
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,080
Miss Ticha.

410
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,880
I didn't think

411
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,240
you would know my name.

412
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,080
I didn’t think you knew me either.

413
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,320
We get coffee at the same shop.

414
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,680
That's right. I remember now.

415
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,360
I just found out a few days ago

416
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,480
that the vacation home
I did the interior design for my client

417
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,320
was designed by you.

418
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,120
You do interior design for…

419
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,400
Arthur.

420
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,680
Arthur.

421
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,480
The client who leaves it all to me.
He has good taste.

422
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,040
And?

423
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,600
Do you like it?

424
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,080
Like what?

425
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,520
The house I designed.

426
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,360
Well…

427
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,440
It feels like a house with distances.

428
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,160
You make the space gigantic,

429
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,400
yet everything feels isolated.

430
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,080
A girl raised in tight spaces like me

431
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,160
might not be familiar with that.

432
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,280
Please excuse me. I have morning plans.

433
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,640
Glad to officially meet you.

434
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,240
Well, what did you do about it?

435
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,240
Do about what?

436
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,400
How did you decorate

437
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,720
my hollow spaces?

438
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,160
I left it like that.

439
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,680
No matter what I try to add,

440
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,160
it still feels lonely.

441
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,080
Ticha!

442
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,200
Shall we go…

443
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,560
Get coffee together sometime?

444
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,160
But we already get it from the same shop.

445
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,600
Okay.

446
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,360
I'll see you there then.

447
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,280
In this life, we're not
necessarily born just once,

448
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,480
and we don’t die just once.

449
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,960
Some people

450
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,320
are killed by
the corruption of everyday life.

451
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,160
Again and again.

452
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,160
The question is,

453
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,440
if you had a chance to be born again,

454
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,160
what would you do

455
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,600
to the people who gave you a living hell?

456
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,160
Can I have your number?

457
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,880
Is this the first time

458
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,960
he’s brought a date to his room?

459
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,880
Keep an eye on him.

460
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,720
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

461
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,440
This is much easier than I thought.

462
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,840
