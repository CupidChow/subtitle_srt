1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,720
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION,
CREATED SOLELY FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,920
WITH NO INTENTION TO INCITE VIOLENCE
OR DISCREDIT ANY ORGANIZATION.

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,760
Do you need anything, Mother?

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,280
What happened here that night?

5
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,000
This bitch is just a maid.

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,720
Stop!

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,760
You broke my stuff again!

8
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,080
Did you really not know

9
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,160
what happened?

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,640
Why don't you just say it?

11
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,040
Not just yet.

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,920
And I'd like to say

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,560
that you shouldn't let
something like this happen to Phoo again.

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,160
You and Phatchai
will leave this place in no time.

15
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,720
Why do you care about what happens here?

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,880
A girl was about to be raped.

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,000
She's just a maid.

18
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,800
A maid

19
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,040
is a human too.

20
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,080
Human.

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,760
Don't cross my line, Thicha

22
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,240
You don't know

23
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
what I'm capable of.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,920
And Phatchai also doesn’t know

25
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,880
what you’re capable of, does he?

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,919
If something happens to Phoo,

27
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,160
Phatchai will know about this.

28
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,920
We’ve arrived.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,720
We're in front of the emergency room.

30
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,920
Buss!

31
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,120
Doctor.

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,000
Help my daughter-in-law.

33
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,160
Doctor, how is Thicha doing?

34
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
She's safe now.

35
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,760
What happened to her?

36
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
She had an allergic reaction to something.

37
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,320
We need to wait
for the detailed test results.

38
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,520
But Thicha's never had allergies.

39
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,640
Not to food or medicine.

40
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,720
And…

41
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,840
How did this severe bleeding

42
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,880
even happen?

43
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,120
Actually, anyone can develop anaphylaxis.

44
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,240
There are many cases like this,

45
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,480
but the severity and symptoms
can vary widely.

46
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,160
Let’s wait for the test results.

47
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,880
It might be more than
just an allergic reaction.

48
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,120
It's strange

49
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,680
for this to happen now, of all times.

50
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,600
We’d better wait
for the results to be sure.

51
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,360
So, we can know of any other factors.

52
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,400
You should all get some rest.
You look exhausted.

53
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,360
Thank you.

54
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,040
Thank you.

55
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,200
I need to talk to you.

56
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,800
Only a bit more of that drug,
and she could’ve died!

57
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,160
Relax.

58
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,320
I didn't want her to die.

59
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,640
But she's your daughter-in-law.

60
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,840
And it was Phatchai’s wedding day.
How could you do this?

61
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,960
Did the scholarship
I gave you for medical school

62
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,720
include morality classes?

63
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,880
Or did you learn that yourself

64
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,560
when I made you director?

65
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,440
LERTJINDA UNIVERSITY

66
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,000
I solemnly pledge to dedicate my life
to the service of humanity.

67
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:01,120
The health and well-being of my patients
will be my first consideration.

68
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,240
I will respect

69
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
the autonomy and dignity of my patients.

70
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,240
I will maintain
the utmost respect for human life.

71
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,520
CHAKRAVEJ HOSPITAL

72
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,720
Phat.

73
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,160
- Are you busy?
- No.

74
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,760
I'm here to thank you personally.

75
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,640
Yesterday was overwhelming,

76
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,600
so I didn't thank you properly.

77
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,040
It's okay.

78
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,640
I understand.

79
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,360
Yesterday was the day

80
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
no one thought
something like that was going to happen.

81
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Take a seat.

82
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,960
How are you? Did you get any sleep?

83
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,040
I didn't get a wink.

84
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,560
Is there anything
we should be worried about?

85
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,760
Do you mean her allergy?

86
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
Yes.

87
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,520
Well,

88
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,760
if you ask me how severe
allergic reactions can be,

89
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,360
to be honest,

90
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,400
it could be fatal,

91
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,480
depending on where the symptoms occur.

92
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,240
In some cases,
they affect the respiratory tract,

93
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,800
soft tissues,

94
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,080
or can cause conditions
like myasthenia gravis.

95
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,080
It's all possible.

96
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,560
So, what is she allergic to?

97
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,640
This is…

98
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,200
The food menu list
from our wedding yesterday.

99
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,720
Ah. Got it.

100
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,840
Could you look into it for me?

101
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,800
I actually had her

102
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,800
do a skin test.

103
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,000
I’ll have someone send you the results.

104
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,000
Thank you.

105
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,480
One more thing.

106
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,720
Could you keep this from my mom?

107
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,000
It’s just…

108
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,480
Mom put so much effort into this wedding.

109
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
And if she finds out

110
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,600
I’m investigating,

111
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,320
it will only cause more problems.

112
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,040
So, how is it?

113
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,360
Do your mom and Thicha

114
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,520
get along well?

115
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,040
- Okay.
- Hey.

116
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,800
My mom doesn't really
get along with anyone.

117
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,880
And Thicha?

118
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,720
She's stubborn.

119
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,600
They say

120
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,960
if your mom
doesn’t get along with your wife,

121
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,240
the one who's in trouble

122
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,560
is you.

123
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,800
Well, wanna go back to England now?

124
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,880
I was planning to. If…

125
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,160
If it weren’t for

126
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,400
Thicha needing to recover,

127
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,920
I'd buy tickets right away.

128
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Cha!

129
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,960
- Thicha
- Thicha

130
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,600
Mom, are you asleep?

131
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,440
I have something to talk to you about.

132
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,560
Mom.

133
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,200
When Thicha
gets discharged from the hospital,

134
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,640
I'll take her back to London.

135
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,920
Why?

136
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,640
All of a sudden,

137
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,880
she had an allergic reaction
and started bleeding like that.

138
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,760
I don’t want her here anymore.

139
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,800
Is she allergic to Bangkok?

140
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
And,

141
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,840
what about her mother? Isn't she sick?

142
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,680
I’ll invite her
to come with us for treatment.

143
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,280
Once she recovers,

144
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,040
she can decide whether to stay in London

145
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,360
or come back here.

146
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,120
When your own mother

147
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,840
came to visit you,

148
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,440
you avoided her.

149
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,800
Thicha must be safe

150
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,040
and her mother
gets to go to doctors in London?

151
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,880
You can take care of anyone
except your own mother.

152
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,560
All this time,

153
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,440
you've been
taking care of yourself well, haven't you?

154
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,640
I thought

155
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,040
you’d gotten used to living alone,

156
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,200
just like I have.

157
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,200
No mother in this world

158
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,920
can ever get used to
their child abandoning them.

159
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,240
Then you must be patient.

160
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,280
Didn't you teach me that?

161
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,520
How are you feeling?

162
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,320
My doctor has come to a conclusion

163
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,160
that it was possibly

164
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
a mild form of strychnine poisoning.

165
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,640
But Bussara's doctor

166
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,840
claims it’s just a food allergy.

167
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,200
I didn’t think she’d be wicked enough
to poison you on her son’s wedding day.

168
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Yi,

169
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,320
let's find another way.

170
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,720
This is too dangerous.

171
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,960
We've come this far.

172
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,560
Yi.

173
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,440
Phoo is still there,

174
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,080
waiting for Mathee to rape her.

175
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,400
How many more girls

176
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,240
will have to go through this?

177
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,560
How many more

178
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,000
have to die like my mother?

179
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,680
Mom.

180
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,520
If Phatchai is around,

181
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,359
she won’t dare to do anything worse.

182
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,720
If that’s true,

183
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,960
then why did you end up here, almost dead?

184
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,960
You can't keep this up.
Don't you understand?

185
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
What makes you think that?

186
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,720
Because you love him.

187
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,720
I see it from the way you look at him.

188
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,160
I know

189
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,640
you love him.

190
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,240
Stop all this

191
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,920
and find another way.

192
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,960
Trust me.

193
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,480
Hi.

194
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,640
What are you doing, Miss Thicha?

195
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,040
This is the hospital.

196
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,360
How could you call me over to your bed?

197
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,840
I'm sorry.

198
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,680
Why do you have to apologize?

199
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,560
You didn't do anything wrong.

200
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,120
When the skin test results are out,

201
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,120
we'll know about
all the things you're allergic to.

202
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,640
We just have to be careful after this.

203
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,640
When you're fully recovered,

204
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,440
let's go back to London

205
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,600
and take your mother with us.

206
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,840
We'll see the doctors there if needed.

207
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,680
Can we talk about this later?

208
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,680
I still can’t think straight.

209
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,880
Fine.

210
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,840
But…

211
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,520
Promise me we'll talk about it
when you're out of here.

212
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,960
How are you doing, Ma'am?

213
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,920
I'm alright.

214
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,120
Ms. Buss wants to see you.

215
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,680
- If you still don't feel--
- I'm okay.

216
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
Then let's go.

217
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Meet me by the stairs tonight.

218
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,920
How are you? Still doing alright?

219
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,520
I'm alright.

220
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,360
I just didn't think I would be so weak.

221
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,120
Well, then what will you do now?

222
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,760
Phat told me you two
are going back to England right away,

223
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,400
before you have any more allergies,

224
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,880
right?

225
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,320
Yes. When Thicha is fully recovered,

226
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,920
I'll take her and her mother there.

227
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,880
That's too bad.

228
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,760
Just when I was
about to enjoy your company,

229
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
you decided to go back.

230
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,680
It will be a while before I can travel.

231
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,160
You shouldn't be too lonely.

232
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,120
I thought you wouldn't be here.

233
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,320
How can I help you, Ma’am?

234
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,040
Give me access to Ms. Buss’s office.

235
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,560
Why do you need to go in there, Ma'am?

236
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,920
There's something

237
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,800
that can protect you
from what Mathee does.

238
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,320
We're both women, Phoo.

239
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,920
If one of us
has to go through that horrible thing,

240
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,120
we must help each other.

241
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,440
I have my own way.

242
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,440
You just need to let me in that room.

243
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,320
But there's a camera in front of the room.

244
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,040
How would you get in?

245
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,840
That's why

246
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,560
I said we must help each other.

247
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Are you cooking all these things?

248
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,840
I crave so many foods.

249
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,200
Phoo didn't stop me at all.

250
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,320
Phoo.

251
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,640
If we can't eat all this,

252
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,880
then you must help us finish it.

253
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,240
Why don't we let your mom have some too?

254
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,720
No way.
She doesn't eat anything before noon.

255
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,320
Just let her know.

256
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,040
Okay.

257
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
Mom!

258
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,840
Mom!

259
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,240
She didn't have any symptoms
before swimming.

260
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,080
She didn't have breakfast,

261
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,520
just coffee.

262
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,880
Hang in there, Miss.

263
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,320
Miss. Miss!

264
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,360
I'm sorry I can't be there for her.

265
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,960
Yes.

266
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,160
Take care of your mom.

267
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,560
Mom!

268
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,520
Ma’am, please let me do it.

269
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,160
I was just about to finish.

270
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,000
Ms. Buss swims all the time.

271
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,000
She shouldn't have drowned so easily.

272
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,160
We'll have to eat all these then.

273
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,800
Ms. Buss doesn't let me
eat with employers, Ma'am.

274
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,440
You can eat it

275
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,640
because today I'm your employer.

276
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,680
I've only seen it on TikTok,

277
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,840
and just had a chance to try it today.

278
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,680
Do you like it?

279
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,320
I like it. I really want
my mom and sister to try it too.

280
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
You'll have that chance one day, Phoo.

281
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,920
Eat up.

282
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,840
So we can get to work.

283
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,960
I might need some time.

284
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,040
Just buy me as much time as you can.

285
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,600
Nothing.

286
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,560
CHAKRAVEJ HOSPITAL

287
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,720
What is it?

288
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,120
Exactly the same drug
you used on your daughter-in-law.

289
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,560
That's it!

290
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,560
That's what I wanted to say.

291
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,640
Give me the phone.

292
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,480
The amount is less than what you gave her.

293
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,600
Because if it were any more,
you would have drowned.

294
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,920
Give me the damn phone!
I'll find out when she drugged me!

295
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,240
Fine.

296
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,240
Fine.

297
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,320
I'm good at this, Thicha.

298
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,760
The drawer
next to Ms. Buss's desk is locked.

299
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,360
Do you know where the key is?

300
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,840
I don't know, Ma'am.

301
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,840
I need to get back in there.

302
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,760
You can't do that!

303
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,440
We have to wait till tomorrow.

304
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,520
If I clean it again,
Ms. Buss will be suspicious.

305
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,800
We have only today.

306
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,720
Phatchai will be back soon.

307
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,760
I…

308
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,320
I can't let him know about this.

309
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,800
I can't help you more than this.

310
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,360
I don't know what you're trying to do.

311
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,560
It’s not a joke anymore, Buss,

312
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,920
what all of you are doing.

313
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Yes.

314
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,600
What I did

315
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,360
isn’t something anyone could do.

316
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,600
It has to be someone like me,
don't you think?

317
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,040
Who is she really?

318
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,360
We're the same.

319
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,640
You used to be…

320
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,920
You don't need to know much.

321
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,760
Just know that we must help each other.

322
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,400
Find the key to that drawer.

323
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,960
Look into someone's background for me.

324
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,920
Don't spare any details.

325
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,680
Niwarin Insaree.

326
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,080
She has one adoptive daughter

327
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,440
named Thicha.

328
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,520
Find out who her real parents are.

329
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,480
Sak.

330
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,920
During my time here,

331
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,000
go and look inside the house sometimes.

332
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,800
If there's anything unusual, call me.

333
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,600
Phoo.

334
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,639
Why did the lightbulb shatter?

335
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,679
I don't know.

336
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,360
It popped all of a sudden

337
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,120
and broke into pieces.

338
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,600
Why didn't you tell me?

339
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,040
You seemed busy.

340
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,120
I can help you with everything

341
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,880
if you ask.

342
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,520
How is your mom doing?

343
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,280
The doctor said she has

344
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,720
heart muscle weakness due to stress.

345
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,640
Seriously,

346
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,680
no one in this world
could ever make her stressed

347
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,680
except me.

348
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,440
I was pretty harsh to her the other day.

349
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,920
And what did the doctor suggest?

350
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,120
He said

351
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,840
not to make her more stressed,

352
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,920
because her condition
could worsen at any time.

353
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,320
Then, how about

354
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,440
we don't worry about
going back to London for now?

355
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,600
Let's take care of our moms.

356
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,960
Is that okay?

357
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,320
Yeah.

358
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,160
If your mom is in this condition,

359
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,640
you should do your best
to take care of her.

360
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,920
I need to look after my mom too.

361
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,040
Thank you.

362
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,400
CHAKRAVEJ HOSPITAL

363
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,040
Hi, Mom.

364
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,240
How are you feeling?

365
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,080
I brought you some flowers

366
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,640
and…

367
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,720
Some macarons.

368
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,360
About what I said the other day,

369
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,320
I'm sorry.

370
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,600
Mom.

371
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,440
Don't cry!

372
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,120
The doctor said you should smile a lot.

373
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,480
It's like I'm making you cry now, right?

374
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,160
Phat.

375
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,360
Stay with me.

376
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,960
Don't go back yet.

377
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,640
I'm glad you're safe, Mother.

378
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,360
I'm glad too.

379
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,080
Should we go talk inside?

380
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,800
Being in the rain like this,

381
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,960
why don't you go take a shower, Phat?

382
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,920
Let Thicha

383
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,080
wipe my body down.

384
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,800
Sorry to bother you.

385
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,240
It's my pleasure.

386
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,600
The doctor said
I've been poisoned with strychnine.

387
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,600
What do you think I should do?

388
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,080
That's exactly what my doctor told me.

389
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,120
What do you think

390
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,760
I should do, Mother?

391
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,400
Why didn't you tell Phatchai?

392
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,120
Do you want him to leave you again?

393
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,640
What are you trying to achieve

394
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,760
from all of this, Thicha?

395
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,960
Is it money?

396
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,800
I just wanted to be a good daughter-in-law

397
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,600
and make my husband happy.

398
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,160
That would be great
if it were even possible.

399
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,800
I hope you won't run away crying someday.

400
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,440
Never, I assure you.

401
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,960
I really like you more every day.

402
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,720
You're making this fun, Thicha.

403
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,320
You’re not boring yourself.

404
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,200
I like you.

405
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,960
Is there anything wrong?

406
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,440
In the last few days,

407
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,560
you've been
dusting the ceiling really well

408
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,640
and also changed the lightbulb yourself.

409
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,040
Why didn't you ask Sak to do it?

410
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,840
I saw that Uncle Sak was busy,

411
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,320
so I did it myself.

412
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,560
When I removed the lightbulb,

413
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,320
it was so dusty inside

414
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,640
so I had to
dust the lightbulb as well, Ma'am.

415
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,560
Tomorrow,

416
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,360
prepare all of these things.

417
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,360
Yes, Ms. Buss.

418
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,520
MATHEE

419
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,120
What, Mathee?

420
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,960
Ms. Buss asked me
to bring you to the dining room.

421
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,920
Ms. Buss made some sweets for you.

422
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,160
Is this…

423
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,280
I followed the recipe from YouTube.
I don't know if it worked.

424
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,320
But you just came back from the hospital.
You should take more rest.

425
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,040
If I rest any more,
I'll turn into a vegetable.

426
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,080
I was bored! And Phoo also helped out.

427
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,240
It was fun.

428
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,720
Let's try it.

429
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,760
It's delicious!

430
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,840
I can't believe I can make it this good.

431
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,240
Yeah, I'll try it.

432
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,160
It's good.

433
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,520
I can't even remember

434
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,560
how Thai red rubies dessert tastes.

435
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,840
It tastes like that.

436
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,640
Cha, try it. It's good.

437
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,520
Cha, what's wrong!

438
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,080
Cha!

439
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,880
Cha, how are you doing?!

440
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,800
Cha!

441
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,560
Do you want me to call an ambulance?

442
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,320
Cha.

443
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,720
Are you okay?

444
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,400
Phoo!

445
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,520
When we made the dessert,

446
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,760
did you drop anything in there?

447
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,320
No, I did it as you told me, Ma'am!

448
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,480
What's wrong with you, Thicha?

449
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,520
Sorry.

450
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,320
I just felt…

451
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,840
A bit nauseous.

452
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,600
Do you want to go to the doctor?

453
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,400
Did my red rubies taste that bad?

454
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,400
Next time, I'll make it even better.

455
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,240
I wouldn't be able to eat much.

456
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,120
Everything stinks now.

457
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,480
Cha.

458
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,760
Are you pregnant?

459
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,480
Really?

460
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,320
You're going to be a grandmother.

461
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,400
I'm not familiar with the word "family."

462
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,480
I'm not used to saying

463
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,400
father, mother, or children.

464
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,960
I'm not even sure

465
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,200
if I can be a good father.

466
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,320
But I'll do my best.

467
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,200
I'll have my own little family

468
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,280
that is the happiest.

469
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,360
My daughter-in-law is pregnant.

470
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,680
Alright, then let's go ahead
with the blood draw and urine test.

471
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,640
I want to clear up
the fertilizer under the tree.

472
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,720
Do you remember where everything is?

473
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,080
I think my mother
isn't the only corpse in that house.

474
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,480
I want to end
this vicious cycle once and for all.

475
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,840
Revenge

476
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,600
doesn't allow anyone
to have all the things they want.

477
