  ​

3
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,900
   

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,070
     

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,000
♫  My everything, it grows within me  ♫

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,730
♫  It seems they will last forever always  ♫

7
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,160
♫  Our youthful days  ♫

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,240
   

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,180
Asshole!

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,180
Is staring at people the only thing you know how to do?

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,870
Lower your eyes!

12
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,460
 Hurry up and hide before I come to find you! 

13
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,210
 Hurry up and hide before I come to find you! 

14
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,160
 Hurry up and hide before I come to find you! 

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,530
 I'm going to hide then! 

16
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,620
 Hurry up and hide before I come to find you! 

17
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,600
 I'm going to go look for you now! 

18
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,450
 Hyung, where are you? 

19
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,460
 Hyung! 

20
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,540
 Hyung, where are you? Hyung! 

21
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,490
 Hyung? Hurry up and come out! 

22
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,940
 Hyung, where are you? 

23
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,860
 You really won't come out? 

24
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,480
 Hyung! 

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,230
 Hyung? 

26
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,520
 Hyung? 

27
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,810
 Hyung! 

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,700
 Hyung... 

29
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,090
 Hyung? 

30
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,690
 Hyung? 

31
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,340
 Hyung... 

32
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,940
 Hyung... 

33
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,150
Goodness, why is he coming home so late?

34
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,690
   

35
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,130
Huh?

36
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,800
   

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,520
   
   

38
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,100
Wait...

39
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,670
   

40
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,920
Joon Hee!

41
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,440
Inside.

42
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,170
That way.

43
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,200
   

44
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,260
   

45
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,000
Hey, hey, hey, Dr. Go, Dr. Go!

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,420
You scared me!

47
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,020
Why didn't you go home yet, Ahn Soon Tak.

48
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,260
I just got a call from the detective agency.

49
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,590
- Did they find him? 
 - Well—

50
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,840
You know how you can't even get a single digit wrong on the resident ID number?

51
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,560
Gosh, I feel so betrayed since we can't find him, no matter how much we try.

52
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,930
How could he hide so well?

53
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,890
   
 I can't go today. 

54
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,830
 You waited for me. Right? 

55
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,730
 I know everything. 

56
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,070
They said they could find anyone as long as they weren't dead.

57
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,840
There's no way he's dead. Right?

58
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,390
   

59
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,880
Did you get beat up by a junior high schooler?

60
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,570
Move your face.

61
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,030
So why aren't you telling me!

62
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,820
I mean, junior high schoolers nowadays are bigger than you. Right?

63
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:33,100
Hey, but how badly were you beaten that you had to get a CT scan?

64
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,780
Why is he like this?

65
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,410
What's wrong with the inside of a kid who got beaten up by a thug?

66
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,010
I did abdomen sonography just in case, and it came out like this.

67
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,170
His Creatinine levels are 6 mg/dL. 
  (Normal levels are between 0.50~1.4 mg/dL) 

68
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,370
And as you can see, his kidneys have atrophied and are malformed.

69
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,470
It's progressed quite a bit.

70
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,770
I mean, could he have held in this type of pain?

71
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,380
Why would he hold it in? Even after seeing his brother die?

72
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,030
Must you say everything you think out loud?

73
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,060
I'm saying it because I'm frustrated!

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,610
Gosh...

75
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,160
Did his grandma come as well?

76
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,950
Ma'am...

77
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,350
Did you get beat up by one or two junior high schoolers?

78
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,390
You little, gosh!

79
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,020
- Gosh, damn it. 
 - Oh, did you fight like this?

80
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,990
- Then I think you would have won. 
 - Excuse me!

81
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,840
Could you send him away so I can get some rest?

82
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,530
No, no, we're doing perfectly fine here.

83
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,960
Thank you.

84
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,310
What's with you? You need rest, so stay still.

85
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,910
Go away while I tell you nicely.

86
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,310
I should be by your side.

87
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,930
Rest, rest. I will protect you by your side.

88
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,770
- It's okay. 
 - Just go.

89
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:08,170
Ma'am, Joon Hee has chronic renal failure.

90
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,210
In the early stages, there are no clear symptoms

91
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,940
and the kidneys slowly lose their capacity to function.

92
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,180
Even when his kidneys lose 70% of functionality, there are no symptoms.

93
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,800
Since the probability of it being hereditary is low, Joon Hee probably didn't know, either.

94
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,160
No. He was in pain.

95
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,410
It turns out he had been taking pills on his own.

96
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,800
While we put him on dialysis,

97
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,470
we will put him on the waitlist for a brain-dead patient donor.

98
00:07:52,420 --> 00:08:00,190
Ma'am, the situation is way better on all fronts compared to Joon Young's case.

99
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,080
Don't worry.

100
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,090
 What's the answer to this one? 

101
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,150
 Don't ask me about that. 

102
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,230
 Come on, tell me. 

103
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,600
   

104
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,550
What are you saying, Mom?

105
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,030
Let's go up to the patient's ward and talk.

106
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,930
So why is he going up to the patient's ward?

107
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,130
Calm down, Go Yoo!

108
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,650
Gosh...

109
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,310
I knew it.

110
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,670
You study like a hard laborer. How could your body stand it?

111
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,990
I'm not the only one.

112
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,990
You idiot! You have no excuses.

113
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,270
We're all screwed.

114
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,600
Stand up and walk.

115
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,040
Are you already acting like a patient?

116
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:35,760
Joon Hee is very sick, so he won't be able to come to school for the time being.

117
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,200
Everyone should send him a text of encouragement.

118
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,900
 Yes. 

119
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,390
Soon Tak, you should let everyone know his phone number.

120
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,320
Okay...

121
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,540
Did Go Yoo go on training, or did he go home early?

122
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,010
Training...

123
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,010
That punk. He didn't even let me know... Study hard.

124
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,100
 Goodbye. 

125
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,190
 Didn't you say you were going to ask me something? 

126
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,360
 I know that one. 

127
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,280
Yeah?

128
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,900
Could you give these gym clothes back to Go Yoo?

129
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,580
I'm going to the hospital today.

130
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,080
Do you want to go with me?

131
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,870
Is that funny?

132
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,710
Go Yoo is there.

133
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,000
No.

134
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,760
Then I'll give it to him.

135
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,460
Yeah.

136
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,120
Is Go Joon Hee very sick?

137
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,600
   

138
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,490
Aren't you tired?

139
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,860
I'm okay.

140
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,240
- What about you? 
 - Why would I be tired?

141
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,510
I explained everything. Stop giving me the eye and leave.

142
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,820
I'm not giving you the eye, but I feel like your plan is too casual.

143
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,770
We have a tragic history!

144
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,530
There isn't anyone who can give him a kidney.

145
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,330
Unless we do a transplant from a living donor,

146
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,580
we can keep him on dialysis while waiting for a brain-dead patient donor.

147
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,120
Gosh!

148
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,860
Soon Tak, are you sick? Your face is pale!

149
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,270
It looks like he put on makeup.

150
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,690
Yeah. I put on some color lotion.

151
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,650
It boosts my 80% confidence by 100%.

152
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,070
S-So you had 80% confidence, I see...

153
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,370
Oh, right. This...

154
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,200
Here. Han So Yeon told me to give this to you.

155
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,760
What?

156
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,460
The gym clothes...

157
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,420
Gosh, I should've gotten it from her directly!

158
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,040
Gosh! What a waste!

159
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,240
Well, it looked like she wanted to give it to you in person, too.

160
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,490
Is my So Yeon doing well?

161
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,800
Oh! And she seemed to worry a lot about Joon Hee.

162
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,000
She asked if he was very sick and seemed to want to come to the hospital, getting all teary.

163
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,000
It's a lie. Don't believe him. Han So Yeon wouldn't be getting all teary.

164
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,120
Hey, why would it be a lie? That's possible.

165
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,240
You should go back to school.

166
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,420
Why leave school early to visit him in the hospital?

167
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,120
Geez...

168
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,870
He hasn't come to school since the day you beat him up.

169
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,620
It's real.

170
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,350
- Fuck! Did I beat him up to kill him? 
 - Shit...

171
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,020
Gosh...

172
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,270
But why is it so quiet?

173
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,270
Why is Pretty Girl here?

174
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,650
Everyone I like is in this class.

175
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,420
If you drink that, you'll die.

176
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,850
I know you can't drink that. I know that much.

177
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,110
I was just joking.

178
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,620
Then why are you salivating?

179
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,410
Soju is 20% ethanol in concentration, while that is over 70%.

180
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,490
You are starting to show off again.

181
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,600
Even that is diluted for use. 100% ethanol passes through cell membranes and—

182
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,730
We just won't drink it!

183
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,440
Do you know why they say you become a dog when you get drunk?

184
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,470
- Ethyl alcohol, CH3CH2OH... 
 - Goodness.

185
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,760
Gosh, you're amazing. Just amazing.

186
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,240
Soon Tak, you take care of this.

187
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,530
- Hey! Hey, Go Yoo! Hear me out! 
 - Even if I'm curious, I don't want to hear it.

188
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,720
Take us with you!

189
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,420
What a crazy bastard!

190
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,140
It's because the 3D molecular model of alcohol looks like a dog.

191
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,970
- You should know why you become a dog! 
 - That crazy punk!

192
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,650
Soon Tak, let's catch that dog!

193
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,310
Hey! Stop following me!

194
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,930
Crazy bastards!

195
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,770
Where are you going?

196
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,720
- Hey, Go Yoo! 
 - Hurry up!

197
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Gosh, stop following me!

198
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,670
Crazy bastards!

199
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,600
Come over here!

200
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,650
Hey!

201
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,670
- Are you tired? 
 - Yeah.

202
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,060
So stop showing off so much. That drains a lot of energy.

203
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,370
 Here. 

204
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,510
 What is it? 

205
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,950
 It's your younger sibling. 

206
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,760
 You should have bought two. 

207
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,410
 It will be lonely by itself. 

208
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,410
 If I brought two, they'd ostracize you. 

209
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,030
 You... 

210
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,230
 That's right. 

211
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,760
 If there were two, they would be paired up. 

212
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,800
 It would make me wonder why I'm not paired up. 

213
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,800
 Dunk. 

214
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,100
 I name it Dunk. 

215
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,490
 Dunk? Why would you name my younger sibling? 

216
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,480
 I'm going to name it Tackle! 

217
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,520
 Tackle. 

218
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,150
 Tackle. 

219
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,560
Dunk...

220
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,580
Answer me.

221
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,090
Joon Hee. Joon Hee!

222
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,670
Joon Hee! Joon Hee! Joon Hee...

223
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,520
Hello, please come! Hurry up!

224
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,130
Joon Hee. Joon Hee!

225
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,000
Madam Mo, let's get something to eat together.

226
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,400
No. I'll eat later.

227
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,300
Grandma, don't worry. I'll give Joon Hee my kidney.

228
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,840
Wait...

229
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,240
What are you talking about?

230
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,400
You don't have the right to say no, Mom. If you tell me to choose now, I will choose.

231
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,300
Joon Hee comes before you, Mom.

232
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,940
The dialysis isn't effective for Joon Hee! Then transplant is the answer.

233
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,750
You said he has to wait 7 or 8 years for a brain-dead patient donor!

234
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,800
Everyone waits without guarantees, too!

235
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,920
I can't wait! I feel like I'll die during that time!

236
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,970
You still can't. You are an athlete—

237
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,620
I'll live even if I don't do sports, but Joon Hee can't.

238
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,620
I'm done talking. You can't.

239
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,890
No need to talk further. It's my body.

240
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,670
You did nothing for me to grow up to this point.

241
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,540
- Don't be unreasonable! 
 - I'm not. I thought about it for a long time.

242
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,820
Even if Joon Young were still alive,

243
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,100
I would have still given him my kidney.

244
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:04,510
   
 (Korean blood sausages) 

245
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,080
Don't worry and eat.

246
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,620
Joon Hee and I are not expecting anything of Go Yoo.

247
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,440
You know how we feel, right?

248
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,260
Of course.

249
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,870
If I have to put both of them on operating tables,

250
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,240
I won't be able to endure it.

251
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,640
Yes...

252
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,800
I'm sorry, Ma'am...

253
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,610
There is no need...

254
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,420
for you to feel sorry toward Go Yoo.

255
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:08,930
A parent should show her child how she lives.

256
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,800
I'm grateful to you, Ma'am.

257
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,040
You've pretty much raised my Yoo.

258
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:25,990
If I didn't have Go Yoo, I don't know if Joon Hee and I would have survived.

259
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,390
After Joon Young died like that,

260
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:33,740
and Joon Young's mother and father died in a car accident.

261
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,970
There was no sound of anyone living at our home,

262
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,160
even though Joon Hee and I were there.

263
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,990
After all that, he shut his mouth and wouldn't do anything.

264
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,850
   

265
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,450
After he lost his mom, dad, and brother,

266
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,750
I wondered if he would be able to live sane.

267
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:22,070
I just kept thinking whether I should die as well,

268
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,180
taking Joon Hee with me...

269
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,110
 Hello? 

270
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,710
 Hello? Is anyone home? 

271
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,750
 Hello? 

272
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,140
 Oh? There's someone home today. 

273
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,420
 Where were you? 

274
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,640
 Is Joon Hee home? 

275
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,970
 Is there food as well? 

276
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,690
 I guess Hyung isn't lonely anymore. 

277
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,990
 He said he was scared to die, 

278
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,640
 but now that Auntie and Uncle went to be with him, 

279
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,040
 he won't be scared anymore. 

280
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,060
 Although you must be sad... 

281
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,800
I was a bit surprised that a kid could think like that,

282
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,790
and I was a bit comforted to think

283
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,040
Joon Young might feel that way.

284
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,280
 Thank you for the food. 

285
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,440
 - It's good. 
 - Eat up. 

286
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,090
 Okay. 

287
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,270
 I'm sorry to come so late at night. 

288
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,550
 He's sleeping inside. 

289
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,930
 Just let him sleep here for the night. 

290
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,370
 Oh, okay. Thank you. I'll pick him up tomorrow then— 

291
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,300
 Go Yoo... 

292
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:38,470
 What do you think about letting me raise Go Yoo with Joon Hee? 

293
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,020
 Excuse me? 

294
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,990
I felt like my heart was full

295
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,030
because I had two moons there.

296
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:21,200
And I also felt hot because I had two suns.

297
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:28,470
Those two boys were my energy.

298
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,180
If I didn't have Go Yoo, I don't know

299
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,360
what would have happened to Joon Hee and me.

300
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,700
Whenever he talks and jokes around, it's impossible not to laugh.

301
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,920
He's pretty silly, my Yoo.

302
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,040
Don't be too sad at what Go Yoo said.

303
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,440
Although he's acting so immature right now,

304
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,120
there will come a moment he will understand his mom as a human being.

305
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:08,040
When that happens, don't feel bad about receiving your child's love...

306
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,730
and accept it with a smile.

307
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,770
Yes, Ma'am.

308
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,770
   

309
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,810
You know it's dangerous to become a donor. Right?

310
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,930
Yeah. I looked it up.

311
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:43,430
I looked up a case of an athlete donor, too.

312
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,440
They were healthy!

313
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,120
From now, I will explain the side effects.

314
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:58,120
When you suddenly have only one kidney, you may end up having acute renal failure.

315
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,010
You could get diabetes, high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis, and heart disease.

316
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:05,150
And your pleura, spleen, and intestines may be damaged during the surgery.

317
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,080
Y-You're really trying to scare me brutally.

318
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,700
You still want to do it?

319
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,520
I should.

320
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,280
For me, these are possibilities, but Joon Hee is actually in that situation.

321
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:25,530
Even if you want to give it to him, you can't if you're not a match.

322
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,200
Then I can't do much about that.

323
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,320
Gosh, he refuses to lose a single argument.

324
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,190
I'll refuse.

325
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,320
Why should I take his?

326
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,150
Why wouldn't you?

327
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,250
I told them no.

328
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,290
Why didn't I know that you were sick?

329
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:56,440
I haven't told you, so how could you know?

330
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,290
How could you tell me that you were sick?

331
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:07,090
Who would you tell that you were having a hard time?

332
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,600
 They said they could find anyone as long as they weren't dead. 

333
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,370
 There's no way he's dead. Right? 

334
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,500
   

335
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,950
   

336
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,100
   

337
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,040
You haven't changed your mind one bit?

338
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,720
Yeah. Not at all.

339
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,270
Cross-matching results...

340
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,200
Negative.

341
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,910
What is it?

342
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,680
   

343
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,560
The surgery is possible!

344
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,150
Hey! How can this compatibility rate be possible?

345
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,850
- Even brothers wouldn't have such a high rate! 
 - I know...

346
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,290
No, you can't! I'll never allow it!

347
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,980
- Unbelievable... 
 - We're good now!

348
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,270
We're saved!

349
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,980
Mom, thanks!

350
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:04,640
 Your pleura, spleen, and intestines may be damaged during the surgery. 

351
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,550
Gosh, she should have told me positive things instead!

352
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,670
Gosh! Seriously!

353
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,310
Where is it?

354
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,460
Huh?

355
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,260
Please change my pants!

356
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,350
They're short for me, too.

357
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,180
Hey.

358
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,900
Have you ever seen anyone who looks this good in a patient gown? Hey, look.

359
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:42,110
Come on, take a look at me. Take a look.

360
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,190
Really, take a look. You won't regret it. Take a look.

361
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,550
Thanks.

362
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,020
Sure.

363
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,980
All right, you guys should stop fooling around.

364
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,470
Please take deep breaths slowly.

365
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,680
   

366
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,210
   

367
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,160
Oh, goodness.

368
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,750
Goodness...

369
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,380
   

370
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,610
Who is it?

371
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,240
Give him epinephrine! The defibrillator, the defibrillator!

372
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,240
Give him a blood transfusion! Blood!

373
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,830
Code Blue, Code Blue! Room 1.

374
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,350
   

375
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,390
   

376
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,490
Gosh, it's so long...

377
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,980
Hey!

378
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,860
Joon Hee, could you translate this for us?

379
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,450
Oh, right. Joon Hee isn't here...

380
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,110
Okay, then. Han So Yeon.

381
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:41,860
"If there's a season for fate, we wish we were on our way to spring."

382
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:47,470
 If there's a season for fate, we wish we were on our way to spring. 

383
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,680
 "If the seasons follow the rain, 

384
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,300
 If the seasons follow the rain, 

385
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:03,940
 ...it shouldn't be a rainy and cold winter, a rainy and snowy winter." 

386
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,390
 ...it shouldn't be a rainy and cold winter, 

387
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,600
 a rainy and snowy winter. 

388
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:24,840
 "On our way to the warm spring, when it rains, and flowers bloom, 

389
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,360
 when it rains, and sun shines..." 

390
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,060
 On our way to the warm spring, 

391
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:38,270
 when it rains and flowers bloom, when it rains and sun shines. 

392
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,960
Go Joon Hee?

393
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:13,840
 "Although it's not splendid for now, for a while..." 

394
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,000
 Although it's not splendid for now, for a while... 

395
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,800
 "If spring comes, 

396
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,650
 if spring comes to us." 

397
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,480
 If spring comes, 

398
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,500
 if spring comes to us. 

399
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:08,160
I can't stand that annoying skinny bitch anymore.

400
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,570
Bring her over.

401
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,420
Okay.

402
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,100
Hey, Han So Yeon. You should come with us.

403
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,670
- Let go. 
 - I don't want to.

404
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,070
Damn it.

405
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,950
I'll go by myself. Where is it?

406
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,670
- Do it. 
 - I won't.

407
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,310
- Do it! 
 - I won't!

408
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,960
Damn it, take it off!

409
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,770
- I won't take it off. 
 - Why won't you take it off!

410
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,000
Where do you think you're going? I should just poke your eyes out!

411
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,450
 We should just poke your eyes out!
