Han So Yeon.

7
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,990
I just saw the wrong thing, right?

8
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,969
Can I look in your bag?

9
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:25,359
(Joon Young loves Jun Hee.)

10
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:29,489
Hey.

11
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,359
Are you seriously...

12
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,640
- Actually, I... - You thief.

13
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,780
(Joon Young loves Jun Hee.)

14
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,450
Am I misreading the situation?

15
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,620
No.

16
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,060
- Where did you... - Where did I steal it from?

17
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,700
I don't know where I stole it from.

(Year 2023)

20
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,979
Hey, did you see So Yeon's article?

21
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,419
Do you want a sandwich?

22
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:06,990
Oh, this has peanut sauce in it.

23
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,460
Send me some papers on PMS-related kleptomania...

24
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,030
or impulse control disorder if you have any.

25
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,099
What?

26
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:16,169
Okay.

27

(Year 2006)

28
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:24,110
Did Ko You come to school?

29
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,979
I guess he skipped class with Han So Yeon.

30
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,280
Hey, you're here. Where's Ko You?

31
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,810
I hear she transferred schools a lot.

32
00:03:58,409 --> 00:03:59,840
Then how did Han So Yeon buy it?

33
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,080
(Joon Young loves Jun Hee.)

34
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,520
You thief.

35
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,209
Ko You. Did you lose a match?

36
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,209
Did you lose?

37
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,779
No.

38
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,050
He must've fought with Han So Yeon.

39
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,509
Hi, Dunk.

40
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,779
Gosh.

41
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,290
Fine. You can have it.

42
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,360
That's not the only photo I have of her.

43
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:41,750
Did you fight with So Yeon?

44
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:46,180
Why?

45
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,230
Give this to Ms. Mo.

46
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,000
Hey.

(Joon Young loves Jun Hee.)

48
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,310
- Where did you find it? - I just found it.

49
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,470
Just found it where?

50
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,379
I don't know. Just give it to Ms. Mo.

51

(Joon Young loves Jun Hee.)

(Joon Young loves Jun Hee.)

53
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,230
Hey.

54
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,370
Are you seriously...

55
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,009
- Gosh. I'm sorry. - Oh, dear.

56
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,750
Gosh, she should be careful.

57
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,379
My goodness.

58
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,550
- Why? - Do your friends tease you...

59
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,949
for being left-handed?

60
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:26,980
No.

61
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,589
I'm just trying to use both hands.

62
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,060
It's good for your brain.

63
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,399
- I see. - Oh, right.

64
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:44,069
Wait.

65
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:46,839
Where did you find this?

66
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:49,839
Ko You must've gone looking for it at the café you go to.

67
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,779
Gosh, how did he find this?

68
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,149
You must've had a hard time.

69
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,279
I couldn't find it anywhere, no matter how hard I tried.

70
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:01,620
My goodness.

71
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,009
Han So Yeon.

72
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,779
Do your friends tease you for being left-handed?

73
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,350
Ms. Mo?

74
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:04,250
Stop it. I was just copying you.

75
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,950
It's super awkward. Don't do it!

76

(Eyesight, fear of birds)

77
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:24,500

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,000
basketball, Son Ye Jin, Ko You.

(Aller-check)

I want banana-flavoured milk.

81
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,250
- Banana-flavoured milk? - No, strawberry-flavoured milk.

82
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,200
- Hey, so what happened with her? - Come on.

83
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,340
Hey. You guys stay here.

84
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:41,149
- What? - Hey, where are you going?

85
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,379
You remember me, don't you?

86
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,950
I hear we transferred around the same time.

87
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,990
Isn't that a coincidence?

88
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:56,490
Miss?

89
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,799
What's this?

90
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:02,700
Why? Is she yours?

91
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,039
Is he yours or not?

92
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,639
Let's go.

93
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,460
Hey, you...

94
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,860
Answer me!

95
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,330
Hey, Jeon Sang Kyu. Don't get into trouble again.

96
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,470
Okay.

97
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:39,299
Gosh, you make a cute couple.

98
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,940
Hey. Call me after you break up with him.

99
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,480
(Regular checkups)

100
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,220
Do you go around lying to people these days?

101
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,149
I heard you've been saying that our son is the top student in class.

102
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,320
Oh, that? I meant Jun Hee.

103
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,429
Oh, Jun Hee.

104
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,830
Drink this.

105
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,730
- Doesn't this belong to someone? - I guess it found its owner.

106
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:16,870
Rumours are spreading that we're going out. Did you know?

107
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,379
Who here doesn't know that we're married?

108
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,580
Who talked such nonsense...

109
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,179
Was it Nurse Kim?

110
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,179
No.

111
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:35,889
It was me.

112
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,940
My gosh.

113
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,240
What's wrong with me? Why is my heart fluttering?

114
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,350
What is your secret?

115
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,820
You said I had to know others' secrets to understand them.

116
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
I steal.

117
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:12,299
That was my secret.

118
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,669
Can you understand it?

119
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,899
Why do you do it?

120
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:21,610
If you can't understand it, just leave.

121
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,610
Who'd understand it?

122
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,210
What, then? Do you want me to apologize?

123
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,690
You steal things before your period.

124
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,500
It's an impulse control disorder...

125
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:46,600
caused by premenstrual syndrome.

126
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,370
(Year 2023)

127
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,139
When I heard you became a psychiatrist,

128
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,870
I was so happy.

129
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:00,679
You were one of the people I wanted...

130
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:02,509
to be understood by.

131
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,220
Perhaps...

132
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,389
I thought you might...

133
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,659
already know about it.

134
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,460
It's a psychiatric disorder,

135
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:20,529
which can be cured.

136
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,230
Have you sought treatment?

137
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,269
Yes.

138
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,740
It gets better when I'm undergoing treatment.

139
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:27,970
Then like now,

140
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,940
it comes back.

141
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,779
Right now,

142
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,549
it's comforting to know...

143
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,220
that there is at least one person who understands me.

144
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:50,429
It's...

145
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,860
comforting?

146
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:55,899
Yes.

147
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:00,169
It is comforting...

148
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:02,769
indeed.

149
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,480
I can stay at your place for a little longer, right?

150
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,820
I have nowhere to go.

151
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,789
The reporters are everywhere.

152
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,889
My place? Well, that's...

153
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,029
Pick up some hair treatment after work tomorrow.

154
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,559
There's none in the bathroom.

155
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:24,799
What?

156
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,169
Fine.

157
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,690
(Yeonga)

158
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,519
(Year 2006)

159
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,730
Ms. Mo!

160
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,990
Hi.

161
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,250
So Yeon!

162
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,690
Yes.

163
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,289
Can you close up instead of me today?

164
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,590
No, I have to hurry home.

165
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,600
I'm sorry.

166
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
Grandma.

167
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,039
Yes?

168
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,440
Would you be happy if I were more like You?

169
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,470
You mean, Ko You?

170
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:46,480
Why are you asking such a question?

171
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,850
Why?

172
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,750
Do you think I favour You?

173
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:53,149
No, it's not that.

174
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,190
I know you like us both equally, Ms. Mo.

175
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,190
You sounded like You just now.

176
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,830
And that made you smile?

177
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:12,970
Grandma.

178
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,809
Go ahead.

179
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,970
- See you in a bit. - Okay.

180
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:18,480
- All right. - Get going.

181

182
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,200
Hello.

183
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,009
(New)

184
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,369
So Yeon.

185
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Excuse me!

186
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So Yeon.

187
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,640
Mind your own business.

188
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,990
You're not going to...

189
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,690
ask me anything?

190
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,099
Even if you asked me something, I wouldn't know what to say.

191
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:27,069
In this world, there are many things that can't be explained in words.

192
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,910
Did You...

193
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,049
see it too?

194
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,380
Yes.

195
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,599
Jun Hee is not picking up.

196
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,400
Where did he go?

197
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:58,769
Gosh.

198
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:05,109
What happened?

199
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,680
You let Ms. Mo go home alone. Where have you been?

200
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,279
Oh, I had to do something quickly...

201
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,279
What did you have to do?

202
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,650
You didn't even pick up.

203
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,079
That's right.

204
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:15,690
I just went for a walk.

205
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,519
I'm hungry.

206
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,829
This guy keeps saying he's hungry.

207
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,130
I have to stop by the bookstore.

208
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,200
Pick a place. I'll meet you there.

209
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,299
Sure. Be quick, okay?

210
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,339
What shall we eat? Shall we have toast again?

211
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:35,210
Toast, again? Come on.

212
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,210
Did You...

213
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:45,819
see it too?

214
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:49,849
Yes.

215
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,470
Hey.

216
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:11,910
Stop looking at me like that!

217
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,279
Is that all you can do?

218
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:16,410
- Come on. - You've got no money?

219
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,029
Smile a little, okay?

220
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:37,099
Think of us as your friends.

221
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:38,970
Pluck up some courage.

222
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:46,779
Have you lost your mind?

223
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:47,779
Yes.

224
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,180
I've lost my mind.

(Americano, Refreshing Beverages)

226
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,750
I steal.

227
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,119
That was my secret.

228
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:56,089
Can you understand it?

229
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,819
How could I understand that?

230
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,289
What? I can have one more?

231
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,859
- Sure, go for it. - You're so nice to me these days.

232
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,359
Jun Hee said he'd be quick.

233
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,069
(Toast)

234
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,069
He's not here yet.

235
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,210
You shouldn't have crossed the line.

236
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,789
(Toast)

237
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:36,890
What's taking him so long?

238
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,369
Hey, watch. This is the last one.

239
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:57,150
Hey, it hurts!

240
00:22:58,849 --> 00:22:59,849
Hey!

241
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,289
Biting counts as cheating.

242
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:05,619
Bring it on.

243
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,460
Are you high or something?

244
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,549
