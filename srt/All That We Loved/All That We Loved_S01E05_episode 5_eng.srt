They say you can't keep secrets in your heart because they are too hot.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,320
They say you have to tell someone for sure.

11
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,800
So, if you don't have anyone to tell, come to me.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,260
I will keep it a secret for you.

00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,610
Go Yoo, the security man came!

14
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,390
Geez, why would he yell out my name!

15

Let's hurry up and go!

Hurry! Hurry! We'll be caught

00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,740
- You guys go first! 
 - Stop right there!

Let's go.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,690
- Are you okay? Let's hurry! 
 - Yeah...

20
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,680
Hey, punks! Stop right there!

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,620

I think you have a phone call.

Yeah.

31
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,480
   

32
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,870
Yeah.

33
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,570
Okay.

34
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,450
Let's go out.

35
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,160
- Are you hungry again? 
 - Yeah.

36
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,810
Oh, Joon Hee!

37
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,980
   

38
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,500
   

39
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,280
You're here?

40
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,970
You must have been busy today.

41
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,130
Are you done for the day?

42
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,720
Yeah.

43
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,090
Can you be with me today?

44
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,520
Let's go to my house.

45
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,130
   

46
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,740
What's wrong with your glasses? Did they break?

47
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,480
No. I just took them off.

48
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,030
I will go home after I take So Yeon home.

49
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,830
Let's go.

50
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,850
You're not hurt anywhere?

51
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,770
You looked good with So Yeon when you walked over here earlier.

52
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,810
She looks good with Go Yoo, too.

53
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,440
 I will go home after I take So Yeon home. 

54
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,950
 Let's go. 

55
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,350
Since when were you close with Joon Hee?

56
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,770
Since elementary school.

57
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,720
We lived together until junior high school.

58
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,550
Really? Are you guys relatives?

59
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,910
Well, not really.

60
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,820
It didn't seem like you guys were just friends.

61
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,660
You guys look really good together.

62
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,680
You guys are very different but are also very similar if you look closer.

63
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,040
 What is it? 

64
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,670
 Let's go. 

65
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,710
We're here.

66
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,260
You live here, I see.

67
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,980
Yeah.

68
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,730
Thanks for today.

69
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,200
Yeah.

70
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,320
Strange...

71
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,240
Are you drunk?

72
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,710
Am I really drunk? I can see well even without my glasses.

73
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,470
Give them to me.

74
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,700
Gosh! So dizzy!

75
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,920
Your glasses are perfectly fine.

76
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,390
Two.

77
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,960
Three.

78
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,710
Then, how about this?

79
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,980
Geez. Seriously.

80
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,910
Come on, let's try it once!

81
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,670
 What does this say? 

82
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,460
 Then, for the last time, what does this say? 

83
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,480
 I told you I'm done with this. Just go home. 

84
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,970
 I'm not going anywhere. 

85
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,780
 I told you, I'm done! Just go home. 

86
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,230
You have something to say. Right?

87
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,100
Do you like Han So Yeon, too?

88
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,260
I think I'm going to feel different in the morning from the way I feel now.

89
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,080
We've never liked the same person before.

90
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,610
So Yeon is really...

91
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,510
What are you talking about?

92
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,090
I'm not interested in Han So Yeon.

93
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,900
She's not even my type.

94
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,570
Are you going to sleep over or just go home?

95
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,920
I'll sleep over.

96
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,640
You'll let me, right?

97
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,590
Geez...

98
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,740
I should make Madam Mo some coffee in the morning.

99
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,700
Just get rid of the whites.

100
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,720
And just add the yolk, splash!

101
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,770
Okay! Finished!

102
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,460
Wow! Madam Mo, how are you so pretty in the morning?

103
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,960
- Did you sleep well? 
 - Yeah.

104
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,870
I feel more comfortable here than in my own house.

105
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,170
How is it?

106
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,050
It's good!

107
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,370
Oh? Where is your necklace? Did you lose it?

108
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,110
It ran away somewhere.

109
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,650
When? You should have told me.

110
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,960
- That's important to you, isn't it? 
 - It's all right.

111
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,960
Gosh, you must have been upset.

112
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,050
That was the necklace that Joon Hee's mother used to wear.

113
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,690
Gosh!

114
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,170
I slept so well.

115
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,910
Go Joon Hee should eat three meals a day like me

116
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,970
and exercise more instead of just studying all day.

117
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,840
Madam Mo!

118
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,440
Give me some food, too!

119
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,560
What? "Madam Mo"?

120
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,790
Our Madam Mo is so pretty from the morning.

121
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,370
"Madam Mo"?

122
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,780
Stop it. I just tried imitating you.

123
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,610
Hey, it's so awkward! Don't do it!

124
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,340
Did you put on contact lenses?

125
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,860
Just wear glasses! You're ugly either way!

126
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,410
Get your faces away from me, you two!

127
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,530
- Don't you guys have anything else to focus on? 
  - Nope! 

128
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,660
 - Just once, just once!  
 - Gosh, darn it!

129
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,280
I give up on dieting. I just can't restrain myself!

130
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,030
Girls, let's go to the convenience store.

131
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,010
- I'll get the corn dog! 
 - Convenience store?

132
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,900
 Corn dog! 

133
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,840
- Going to the convenience store? 
 - Yeah.

134
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,710
You're going to the convenience store?

135
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,240
Yeah.

136
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,570
What? What? What are you doing here?

137
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,610
- Hey, why are you here? 
 - Ow, that hurts!

138
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,510
Oh, Han So Yeon!

139
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,310
Hurry up. The corn dog is mine.

140
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,300
Hurry up!

141
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,270
It's mine!

142
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,990
   

143
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,730
Excuse me...

144
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,710
Wow.

145
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,880
Your house is so nice!

146
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,880
Modern interior design!

147
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,170
Wow, the night view is so pretty, too.

148
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,920
This is why I came to see you.

149
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,870
As expected, my predictions were correct.

150
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,570
Although you're living in the city, you have no interest in the world.

151
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,600
Do you want something to drink?

152
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:54,880
I'm in a pretty crappy mood today, so how about a drink?

153
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,800
The base is what's important.

154
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,570
It's different when you pour alcohol into coffee or the other way around.

155
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:05,170
For a day like today, you pour coffee into alcohol.

156
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,770
A day when I want to get really drunk.

157
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,750
Aren't people the same?

158
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,880
The ending is decided by the base of the person.

159
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,230
Whether you go from love to friendship,

160
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,220
or from friendship to love...

161
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,720
If you go from friendship to love, that's a happy ending,

162
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,880
but if you go from love to friendship,

163
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,090
it's a sad ending.

164
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,620
Gosh, it's sad.

165
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,830
What do you really want to say?

166
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,060
You can tell me now...

167
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,820
Your secret.

168
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,800
I enjoyed the food.

169
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,540
    
 Will you be able to get in?

170
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,490
Go Yoo, thanks!

171
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,430
Hey, hey, hey, let's hurry up and go.

172
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,300
Thanks a lot!

173
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,820
- Oh, a pigeon? 
 - Just leave it alone, Soon Tak.

174
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,090
Just leave it alone. It will leave soon.

175
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,470
- Gosh, it's no big deal! 
 - Soon Tak! Just let it be!

176
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,270
I can just chase it away like this! Shoo!

177
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,170
Hey, why are you running?

178
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Why is Go Joon Hee running?

179
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,010
So, you're afraid of birds?

180
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,470
You found out.

181
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,670
Is that your secret?

182
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,760
It's not really a secret...

183
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,730
since Soon Tak and Joon Hee know about it.

184
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,730
But is Joon Hee afraid of birds, too?

185
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,520
He isn't!

186
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,960
Maybe that pigeon was unusually large?

187
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,820
Why don't you have money?

188
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,050
Do you have anything you're scared of?

189
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,450
I do. It's gym time.

190
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,990
My scores for gym practicum are crappy,

191
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,700
but only my scores for basketball came out high.

192
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,460
By chance, could you teach me about sports?

193
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,950
Yeah.

194
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,260
That's right!

195
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,710
♫  Everything in that moment, the two of us  ♫

196
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,840
♫  Shining so brilliantly  ♫

197
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:44,760
♫  Our shining days, you and me, and the cloudless skies  ♫

198
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,400
♫  Even now, after time has passed  ♫

199
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,430
♫  You fly into my memories  ♫

200
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,540
♫  You make me smile, you make me smile again  ♫

201
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,430
♫  You always do that to me  ♫

202
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:09,800
♫  Sometimes I'm tired and lose my way  ♫

203
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,620
♫  But whenever I turn my head and look  ♫

204
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,750
♫  I can feel you in those moments  ♫

205
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,790
♫  All that I loved, my everything  ♫

206
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,460
♫  It grows within me  ♫

207
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,110
♫  It seems they will last forever always  ♫

208
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:37,720
♫  Our youthful days, someday  ♫

209
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,060
Hurry up! Hurry!

210
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,100
Come! Hurry! Hurry!

211
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,060
♫  So we don't lose each other and stay together until the end of this road  ♫

212
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,490
- Let's go! 
   - Let's go! 

213
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,230
♫  All that I loved, my everything  ♫

214
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,690
♫  You are there in that day  ♫

215
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,540
♫  All that I loved, my everything  ♫

216
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,490
Footwork.

217
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,990
Watch the ball to the end!

218
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,070
Put more strength into your wrist!

219
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,660
Nice! That was good!

220
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,870
Oh! So Yeon did a trick shot!

221
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,210
- Trick... 
 - Trick Shot?

222
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,700
Yeah, trick shot! Trick shot!

223
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,820
Oh! Both of you are good.

224
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,460
Okay, you did well.

225
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,370
That's right!  My goodness!

226
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,080
♫  Someday  ♫

227
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,690
   

228
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,460
- Your kidney is functioning well. Everything's good. 
 - Yes.

229
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,030
Your creatinine levels are good, and your BUN levels are stable as well,

230
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,130
so you won't have to come to the hospital often.

231
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,300
You're not experiencing any discomfort or anything off, right?

232
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,210
Why? Are you experiencing some discomfort?

233
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,740
I...

234
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,350
I'm a lefty, but I use my right hand,

235
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,630
and my eyesight suddenly became good,

236
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,160
and breakfast is tasty, even though I don't usually eat it.

237
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,470
Really? That's so good!

238
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,750
Oh... well...

239
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,110
Yes, it's good.

240
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,990
That's a relief. That's such good news.

241
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,930
I'll be going to the restroom for a bit.

242
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,330
The parfait you ordered is here.

243
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:26,330
 They say you can't keep secrets in your heart because they are too hot. 

244
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,940
 They say you have to tell someone for sure. 

245
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,850
 So, if you don't have anyone to tell, come to me. 

246
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,100
 I will keep it a secret for you. 

247
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,260
- Welcome. 
 - Hello.

248
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,280
Have you seen a necklace on the floor here?

249
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,320
No. I have not.

250
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,420
I see. Thank you.

251
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,600
Hello. Have you seen a rose-shaped necklace on the floor here?

252
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,440
No, I don't think so.

253
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,830
I see. Thank you.

254
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,710
- Welcome. 
 - Hello.

255
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,540
- Have you seen a necklace on the floor here? 
 - No, I haven't.

256
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,320
- Oh... Okay, thank you. 
 - Goodbye.

257
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,420
Geez! I won't have him do it!

258
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,640
What's the point of being good at studying?

259
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,140
He will always be in a place like this living my fate.

260
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,740
My son is a basketball prodigy!

261
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,400
He literally flies around!

262
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,640
You don't have the proper form.

263
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,060
Joon Hee!

264
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,010
Hey, if you came all the way here, you should at least say hello to me!

265
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,220
Come here for a moment.

266
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,360
Say hello. This is my son.

267
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,880
Hello.

268
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,450
Goodness, he's handsome!

269
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,470
He's tall and handsome.

270
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,450
- He's the top student in his school! 
 - Top in his school...

271
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,590
Didn't he just say he played basketball?

272
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,710
   

273
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,930
- Move to the music room. 
 - Move.

274
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,460
Go Yoo probably won't come. Right?

275
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,340
Probably not.

276
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,410
Hey, Go Yoo!

277
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,180
Did you win the match?

278
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,430
Did you win or lose? Let's have a talk.

279
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,090
Hey! Come here for a bit!

280
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,970
Han So Yeon.

281
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,710
 Should I tell you my secret? 

282
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,860
   

283
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,810
This is my secret.

284
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,910
My secret that only you didn't know.

285
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,140
 Top Actress Han So Yeon is involved in an unbelievable theft case 

286
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,400
 and has made headlines all over the celebrity news. 

287

 Han So Yeon is claiming that the employee mistakenly forgot to scan the item. 

288
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,880
 The stolen item was an expensive wallet worth 800,000 won.
