2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:15,960
  ​

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,890
   

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,090
     

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,350
♫  My everything  ♫

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,830
♫  It grows within me  ♫

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,780
♫  It seems they will last forever always  ♫

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,710
♫  Our youthful days, someday  ♫

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,100
   

10
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,500
 Eighteen. 

11
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,820
 Those days, we were growing. 

12
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,950
Please change my pants!

13
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,940
They're short for me, too.

14
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,510
Hey.

15
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,020
Have you ever seen anyone who looks this good in a patient gown? Hey, look.

16
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,210
Come on, take a look at me. Take a look.

17
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,440
 We acted like we were all that... 

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,500
 We were very interested in the opposite sex... 

19
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,000
 and were a bit reckless. 

20
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,760
Go Joon Hee, you look so ugly when I look at you from below.

21
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,810
Moron.

22
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,530
Are you cold?

23
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,600
What are you saying?

24
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,730
Thanks.

25
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,560
Sure.

26
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,930
 We had no worries and fear. 

27
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,360
 And we kept laughing for no good reason. 

28
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,640
All right, you guys should stop fooling around.

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,180
Please take deep breaths slowly.

30
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,620
   

31
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,070
Who is it?

32
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,670
Give him epinephrine! The defibrillator! The defibrillator!

33
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,320
Give him a blood transfusion! Blood!

34
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,210
 And... those days, 

35
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,450
 what we were able to do best was love. 

36
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:08,000
   

37
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,010
   

38
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:28,690
   

39
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,270
   

40
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,260
   

41
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,880
   

42
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:28,330
   

43
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,100
   

44
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,300
   

45
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,750
- Keep going like that! 
 - Shoot!

46
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,730
Good shot! Nice!

47
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,170
   

48
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,830
- You have a game today, right? 
 - Yeah.

49
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,030
Damn it!

50
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,110
Hey, what are you doing!

51
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,420
Let's play with some sportsmanship.

52
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,340
Bullshit.

53
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,330
Where are we right now?

54
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,620
This is a place where we exercise.

55
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,830
Then you shouldn't cause harm to others.

56
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,880
You're not going to answer me?

57
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,750
We're sorry! We'll go around you next time so we don't bother you!

58
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,970
- You don't have a mouth? 
 - Did I bump into you?

59
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,550
- You bumped into me! 
 - What did you say?

60
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,310
You?

61
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,930
Hey!

62
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,320
Hurry up and start running!

63
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,770
I'll see you again.

64
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,200
 It's okay. It's okay. 

65
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,020
   

66
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,830
Joon Hee!

67
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,970
Fucking asshole.

68
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,220
Let's talk.

69
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,190
   

70
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,210
I heard if we mess with you, a guy named Go Yoo will come.

71
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,320
Why are you being so rude? Is it because you think he's got your back?

72
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,280
But too bad. I heard he's really busy running around today.

73
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,950
   

74
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,510
It turns out you guys are pretty famous.

75
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,570
Why didn't I know?

76
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,460
About these two annoying bastards.

77
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,930
You've done a lot of research in such a short period of time.

78
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,430
Wow.

79
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,580
I thought you couldn't speak because you didn't have a mouth.

80
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,600
You speak perfectly fine.

81
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,790
And you've got a good voice, too.

82
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,650
Since you suddenly complimented me, I'll compliment you, too.

83
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,170
Okay.

84
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,350
- You'll probably win even if you fight Go Yoo. 
 - Why?

85
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,300
Do I look stronger than him?

86
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,290
No.

87
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,820
He's not good at arguments.

88
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,590
He must be a great bodyguard.

89
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,890
Seeing how rude you're acting.

90
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,810
 I think we should call the teacher. 

91
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,320
Are you okay?

92
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,950
 Someone should go and get the teacher. 

93
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,580
 Geez! 

94
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,800
Wow.

95
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,880
It was true. You must be Go Yoo.

96
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,650
Who's this asshole?

97
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,720
- He's a senior, Jeon— 
 - You little shit.

98
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,280
So did you come to introduce yourself?

99
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,710
This is about to get entertaining.

100
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,670
Hey, if I insult you, does he fight for you, too?

101
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,580
Why are you curious about so many things?

102
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,530
- Is it because you transferred over here? 
 - Yeah.

103
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,130
It's quite interesting.

104
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,930
What kind of relationship do you two have? Are you guys dating?

105
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,210
It's a secret.

106
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,830
Also, if you're done introducing yourself, could get the hell out?

107
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,120
Hey, you sons of bitches.

108
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,460
You guys should be respectful.

109
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,040
Also, I'm your senior, you bastard!

110
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,420
Fight me.

111
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,430
He just got beat.

112
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,110
Hurry up and fight me!

113
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,410
Moron.

114
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,210
Soon Tak, how was I? Wasn't I really—

115
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,310
- Hyeok Soo, hold this. 
 - These guys!

116
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,270
What the hell are you doing!

117
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,360
The class bell rang a while ago! What took you so long?

118
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,050
- Teacher. 
 - What?

119
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,200
Why is he having them do endurance training for punishment? He's just making them stronger.

120
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,250
That bastard, gosh!

121
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,740
- You're already done? 
 - Yeah.

122
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,780
Right, it's your birthday today!

123
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,550
What about my birthday?

124
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,100
I guess we'll get together and eat seaweed soup!

125
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,900
Geez.

126
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,860
Why would you write three pages for a letter of apology?

127
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,650
Hey! Go away!

128
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,860
Go away!

129
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,980
- Bird, go away! 
 - Goodness... what an idiot.

130
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,290
No, I'll go instead.

131
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,570
Why would a guy who isn't even afraid of ghosts be afraid of birds?

132
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,970
Take me with you!

133
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,780
Guys, take me with you!

134
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,030
   

135
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,110
   

136
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,730
Wow, I had 725 visitors today!

137
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,930
I don't even post any photos,

138
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,340
so what are they coming to see?

139
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,980
Hey, this popular older brother prepared a gift for you.

140
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,960
You've never seen the new 5,000 won bill, right?

141
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,480
- Leave it over there. 
 - Excuse me?

142
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,390
This is the new bill.

143
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,720
Money is money.

144
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,440
- Why would you laminate it? So childish. 
 - Gosh, this guy!

145
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,900
Don't take it, then!

146
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,100
I'll just give it to Madam Mo.

147
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,150
 - Gosh!  
 - Madam Mo must be here.

148
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,790
Why did you buy so much? It must be heavy!

149
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,990
All you needed was seaweed.

150
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,430
You must be hungry.

151
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,060
I'll make food real quick.

152
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,330
Give him only a little bit of food.

153
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,830
Why?

154
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,940
Did the coach say he's gotten fat?

155
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,280
That's not it.

156
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,180
He got into another fight at school today.

157
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,220
Gosh, it's really true!

158
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,000
Why did you get into a fight?

159
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,220
I told you not to get into fights! Why won't you listen to your grandma!

160
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,510
It hurts!

161
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,930
- You need to get hit. 
 - It hurts!

162
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,140
- It hurts, it hurts. 
 - Goodness.

163
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,340
Goodness.

164
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,770
♪  Happy birthday to y—  ♪

165
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,510
Gosh, this guy! Seriously.

166
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,910
- Geez. 
 - Eat up.

167
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,840
- Thank you for the food. 
 - Me, too.

168
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,880
Just eat it without cutting it into pieces.

169
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,940
It's weird when I eat seaweed soup that's been chopped up.

170
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,690
It lacks texture.

171
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,640
Yeah, that's right.

172
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,370
- Gosh, seriously! 
 - Geez!

173
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,960
Be normal and eat with your right hand! It's so annoying!

174
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,530
For me, this is normal.

175
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,920
Joon Hee, just move over a bit to this side and eat.

176
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,690
Grandma.

177
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,140
- It's good, right? 
 - Yeah.

178
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,810
Huh? Don't pack it! I'm not going to give it to them.

179
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,740
They don't even care about whether their son is eating or attending school well.

180
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,150
Why would I give them something tasty like this?

181
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,470
You've sacrificed a lot

182
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,270
so that they could do great things.

183
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,880
If it weren't for You's mom,

184
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,740
my Joon Young would have gone to heaven much sooner.

185
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,680
I'm not going, so don't pack it.

186
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,390
She added a lot of beef.

187
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,420
- It's good. 
 - Yeah.

188
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,170
But why didn't she cut up the seaweed stem before she made the soup?

189
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,040
So that you will live as stringent and long as the seaweed stem.

190
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,730
Did you eat?

191
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,940
Do you even care about whether I ate or not?

192
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,280
- I ate. 
 - Good job.

193
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,250
- Here, take a look. 
 - What is it?

194
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,520
One of my patients fully recovered after six years and was finally discharged last year.

195
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,360
They visited me yesterday and told me to give it to my son.

196
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,350
If it was money, I wouldn't have accepted it,

197
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,720
but I wanted to accept this since I thought you might like it.

198
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,370
- You're going to cause trouble someday. 
 - Shut up and eat.

199
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,600
Are you crazy?

200
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,240
Your son is a basketball player, not a soccer player!

201
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,810
I know that! Basketball players watch soccer, too!

202
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,190
They don't like soccer?

203
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,370
Your son likes Thierry Henry!

204
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,830
That's why I accepted it!

205
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,110
Why are you both saying "Your son"?

206
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,590
Neither of you says, "My son."

207
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,150
Got it. I like the gift.

208
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,660
But why aren't you getting divorced after saying you would?

209
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,950
We don't even have time to take care of our son,

210
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,900
so where can we find time to go to court?

211
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,840
I'll go by myself and submit the paper.

212
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,460
Did you get even taller?

213
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,960
Yeah.

214
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,360
Thanks for coming.

215
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,770
My son...

216
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,860
My son, Go Yoo.

217
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,880
I'm sorry.

218
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,550
"My son"?

219
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,580
How bothersome was I after you gave birth to me that you would name me Yoo?

220
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,460
What's wrong with the name Yoo? I named you after much consideration.

221
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,400
- Isn't it a pretty name? 
 - No.

222
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,280
And what's wrong with your lip?

223
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,540
It's nothing.

224
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,440
 Code Blue, Code Blue, Emergency Room. 

225
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,230
 Code Blue, Code Blue, Emergency Room. 

226
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,170
   
 (Beeper code for "Emergency, emergency") 

227
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,480
You should go back.

228
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,380
Joon Hee and Grandma is doing well, right?

229
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,300
Tell them I said hello.

230
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,120
   

231
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,660
 Go Yoo! Go Yoo! 

232
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,350
 Gosh, he's hiding again. 

233
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,070
 Go Yoo! Gosh. 

234
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,210
 You couldn't find him yet? 

235
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,000
 Why would he hide? This isn't the first time, goodness. 

236
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,180
 Please give me a call if you find him 

237
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,630
 and please take him home safely. 

238
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,620
 Ma'am, let's talk outside for a moment. 

239
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,670
 Joon Young, please wait here for a bit. 

240
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,390
 - Okay. 
 - Wait here for a bit. 

241
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,620
 - Who are you? 
 - I'm Go Yoo. 

242
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,330
 - How old are you? 
 - I'm eight years old. 

243
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,290
 You're the same age as my younger brother. 

244
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,710
 My younger brother is Go Joon Hee. 

245
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,010
   

246
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,440
   

247
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,600
- Should I get a cut like that? 
 - Soon Tak!

248
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,180
Well, you should be more cautious when it comes to haircuts.

249
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,820
Right, Boss?

250
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,900
I mean, I can do it for you,

251
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,160
but don't say you got it done at my shop.

252
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,010
Go Yoo, you can't do it since you're an athlete.

253
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,010
Oh, you should try it. I think it would look good on you!

254
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,530
He would never do it. He doesn't go to hair salons.

255
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,360
He usually goes to a barber.

256
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,450
Go Joon Hee, what's gotten into you that you're reading a magazine?

257
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,960
Just because.

258
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,980
A reading addiction.

259
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,630
Reading addiction, gosh.

260
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,310
You both have the same last name and are good-looking.

261
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,210
- Are the two of you brothers? 
 - No.

262
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,800
We only share the same last name. We're different in everything else.

263
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,390
Oh, right! Did you hear the news about the new transfer student?

264
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,230
I heard she's absolutely crazy!

265
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,420
Why? Is she a lunatic?

266
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,810
No. She's supposedly really pretty.

267
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,600
Oh, she's here, she's here!

268
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,410
I'll take your order.

269
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:23,070
Soon Tak, don't believe such rumors.

270
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,470
Only listen to and eat things that come from confirmed sources.

271
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,220
We've been fooled by such rumors so many times!

272
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,030
- You're eating what you picked up here, huh? 
 - Yeah.

273
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,740
Geez! Give it! Give it!

274
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,420
Geez.

275
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,120
Wow, Hyori!

276
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,090
   

277
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,430
- Gosh, hey! You can't! 
 - Wait, wait! I'll just look! I'll just look!

278
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,930
Joon Hee, calm down.

279
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,270
Wait a sec.

280
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:58,060
Hey, I'm a regular at this salon! You go to the barber!

281
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,830
You like Lee Hyori and Son Ye Jin, I see.

282
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,120
You can tear out their photos and take them.

283
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,270
- Boss, shouldn't he wash his hair now? 
 - Yeah, we should shampoo his hair.

284
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,030
- Let's go to shampoo your hair. 
 - R-Right now?

285
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:10,190
Go. I'll think of a good method while you get your hair washed. Go.

286
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,250
Let go, and go. Hurry up and go.

287
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,880
Gosh...

288
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,680
All right. Now I need the wisdom of Solomon.

289
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,060
Hey, you guys should buy your own. Hey, which one?

290
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,100
- I'll take a caramel frappe. 
 - One caramel frappe and...

291
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,590
Oh. She's pretty.

292
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,920
Please give us two caramel frappes.

293
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,810
It's 10,800 won.

294
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,190
No honorifics?

295
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,710
All right, since you're pretty.

296
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,180
- One is yours. 
 - Next customer.

297
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,750
Could you give us one red bean shaved ice?

298
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,060
One serving that's closer to three servings.

299
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,450
What the... You tore it out, right?

300
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,560
Yeah... Soon Tak, run!

301
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,320
Goodbye!

302
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,290
Hey.

303
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,140
Soon Tak, hurry up!

304
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,150
I'll come back next time.

305
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,580
Soon Tak, hurry up!

306
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,700
Hey, Go Yoo!

307
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,590
Hey, hurry up and run.

308
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,720
H-He went that way.

309
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,440
What's this? Are you giving up?

310
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,380
What's wrong?

311
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,480
If this is all an act, you're dead.

312
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,550
Are you okay?

313
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,090
 Those symptoms are called Generalized Anxiety Disorder. 

314
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,290
   
 Hello. 

315
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,430
   

316
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,200
 It's labeled "Generalized" for being ordinary, 

317
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,090
   
 and called Generalized Anxiety Syndrome or Disorder. 

318
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:30,290
 It refers to excessive worrying during ordinary life, 

319
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,640
 such as worrying about their child getting into a car accident, 

320
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,870
 or about collapsing due to a heart attack, 

321
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,100
 or about a fire breaking out in their home. 

322
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,930
 They assume the worst possible scenario and suffer from worrying about it. 

323
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,790
   

324
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,790
It appears to pertain to you as well, sir.

325
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,720
- Are you feeling okay? 
 - Yeah.

326
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,950
    
 How much trouble do they cause that they exercise more than the athletes?

327
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,090
Geez!

328
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,100
I'll hold it in. Let's go.

329
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,580
   

330
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:25,480
Why are you in your brother's room? Aren't you running late?

331
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,450
- I'm going. 
 - Hurry up and come out.

332
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,870
I'm sure we sent out a notice telling you to come to school on time.

333
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:43,250
Your teacher started class, so wait here.

334
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,920
Okay.

335
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,150
   

336
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,680
Are you in pain?

337
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,430
No.

338
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,960
You have a fever.

339
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,780
No, I'm fine.

340
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,940
Teacher, he's sick.

341
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,730
Him, him.

342
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,340
You're sick?

343
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,310
I think he should hurry over to the nurse.

344
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,180
I like this place the best.

345
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,760
This is nice.

346
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,250
How about this method?

347
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,570
You get three days, and I get three days.

348
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,650
There are seven days in a week.

349
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,000
Oh? The nurse isn't here.

350
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,570
I'll lie here for a bit. You should go back to class.

351
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,230
Why are you so mean? Why are you so cruel to me?

352
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,330
You know how much I want to cut class.

353
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,040
Move over. Let's lie down together.

354
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,270
Let's lie down together.

355
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,290
Are you seriously upset with me?

356
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,090
Is that the only copy of Lee Hyori's photo in the world?

357
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,600
Who says I'm upset?

358
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,360
I told you to just keep it.

359
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,550
Keeping it for myself makes me feel a bit guilty.

360
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,320
Since I have a conscience.

361
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,020
I remember you ran off with it.

362
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,280
What?

363
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,880
You see, you see! You're totally mad about it.

364
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,180
Gosh, are you an elementary schooler?

365
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,060
- Gosh, you— 
 - Gosh, you're so bothersome!

366
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,350
- Go Yoo, you're so bothersome. 
 - Don't lie.

367
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,140
You like me the best.

368
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,710
Let's make a bet.

369
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:21,420
I'll toss a coin. If I win, you shut your mouth for a day.

370
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,520
If you win, don't feel bad and just keep the photo.

371
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,320
Well, it's already mine, but...

372
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,350
Okay! Heads or tails?

373
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,010
Heads.

374
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,800
Since it's my coin, it should listen to me.

375
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,130
Who are you?

376
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:39,430
♫  If you ask me why  ♫

377
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:46,270
♫  It takes a lot to say  ♫

378
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:50,020
♫  'Cause our love is hard to explain  ♫

379
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,980
♫  But if it helps, just know  ♫

380
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,320
♫  You're my home  ♫

381
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,070
♫  Our days are getting by  ♫

382
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,080
 She looks so pure. 

383
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,650
♫  Full of memories  ♫

384
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,690
 She's sexy. 

385
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:14,050
♫  You've been traveling in my heart  ♫

386
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:17,910
♫  Everywhere I go  ♫

387
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:21,440
♫  You've been here  ♫

388
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,870
♫  See your eyes  ♫

389
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:29,910
♫  Shining so bright  ♫

390
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,510
Is it heads or tails?

391
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,350
   

392
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,110
   

393
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:45,390
♫  You're my moonlight, love  ♫

394
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,160
It's heads.

395
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,950
Go Yoo, you should shut your mouth.

396
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,860
   
 Actress Han So Yeon has come back for the first time in two years 

397
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,620
   
 with the emotional melodrama, "You Are My Every Season." 

398
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,320
 Han So Yeon, who plays the female lead Cha Soo Hyeon, 

399
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,230
   
 put on a masterful acting performance that triggered emotions 

400
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,430
   
 and managed a successful comeback. 

401
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,400
-  Han So Yeon's comeback...  
 - Say hello.

402
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,480
Her name is Han So Yeon, and she transferred to our school today.

403
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,540
   

404
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,070
All right, all right! Quiet, quiet!

405
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,860
I think Joon Hee might need to watch out.

406
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,450
So Yeon has never missed the top spot in her previous school.

407
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,780
Come on, Teacher. Why pit them against each other? She just got here.

408
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,760
   

409
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,870
I'm sorry, but the center is closed for the day.

410
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,660
I see.

411
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,350
Who are you?

412
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,630
Scared, aren't you?

413
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,430
It's me.

414
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,310
Han So Yeon.

415
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,350
It's been a while.

416
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,010
 He's won two. 

417
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,400
Soon Tak, I admit you were right about the rumors.

418
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,830
    
 - What do you mean? 
 - The rumors about the transfer student.

419
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,810
I told you! She's pretty, right?

420
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,890
She looks like Son Ye Jin, damn it.

421
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,550
No. Not at all.

422
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,730
More like Lee Hyori?

423
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,720
No, she looks like Jeon Ji Hyeon.

424
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,340
- Stop him! I must stop him! 
 - Okay!

425
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,460
Okay!

426
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,440
Stop him!

427
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,440
Okay, okay! Let's go, let's go!

428
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,510
Marche, get the ball and pass! Okay!

429
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,830
He's got it, he's got it! Let's go!

430
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,970
Stop him, stop him!

431
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:43,370
Okay!

432
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,930
All right, take it off.

433
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,080
Hurry up and take it off.

434
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,400
Are you happy?

435
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,910
I lost because Soon Tak started talking to me in the middle.

436
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,860
When did Soon Tak do that?

437
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,330
You seem to be in a good mood, too.

438
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,290
I keep thinking about the transfer student.

439
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,600
I've never seen someone so pretty like her. She's not your type, right?

440
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,310
Why do you think that?

441
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,840
She looks so pure. She's exactly my type.

442
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,160
Gosh, seriously!

443
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:31,300
Yeah, Mom. Did Brother come?

444
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,090
- Geez. 
 - Brother?

445
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,140
   

446
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,580
Brother!

447
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:53,990
