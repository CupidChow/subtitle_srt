They say secrets...

7
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,409
are too hot to be held in your heart.

8
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,250
You have to share them with someone.

9
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,990
So...

10
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,759
just come to me if you have no one to share them with.

11
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:53,159
They'll become my secrets.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
You! The security guard is here!

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,700
That fool. Why is he calling my name?

14
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,299
- Wait up! - Let's go.

15
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:06,140
- Run! - Hey, what's with you?

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,969
- Gosh. - Come on, quick!

17
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,510
- What is going on? - Gosh, what should we do?

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,939
- Hurry! - The security guard is here.

19
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:13,549
- Get out of here, guys. - You punks!

20
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:14,680
Stop!

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,719
Let's go.

22
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,019
- Are you all right? - Okay.

23
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:21,090
Come on.

24
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,290
You punks! Stop right there.

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,689
- Hey, let's go this way. - This way?

26
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:27,730
Yes.

27
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,569
So Yeon.

28
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,849
You must be getting a call.

29
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,419
Right.

30
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:05,319
(Ko You)

31
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:09,289
Yes?

32
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:14,699
Got it.

33
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,680
Let's go.

34
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,129
- Are you hungry again? - Yes.

35
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,930
Jun Hee.

(Year 2023)

38
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,759
You're here.

39
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,600
You must've been busy today.

40
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,000
Are you done for the day?

41
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Yes.

42
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,970
Could you keep me company today?

43
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,649
Let's go to my place.

44
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:20,019
(Year 2006)

45
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,860
What's wrong? Did you crack your glasses?

46
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,699
No, I just took them off.

47
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,129
I'll take So Yeon home and head home.

48
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:31,699
- Let's go. - Sure.

49
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:32,939
Were you injured anywhere?

50
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,480
You and So Yeon looked good together while walking over here,

51
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:42,810
but I can say the same thing about her and You.

52
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:58,560
I'll take So Yeon home and head home.

53
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,970
- Let's go. - Sure.

54
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,699
Were you injured anywhere?

55
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,410
How long have you and Jun Hee been friends?

56
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,740
Since elementary school.

57
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,480
We lived together up until we graduated middle school.

58
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,810
Really?

59
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,579
Are you related?

60
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,779
No, it's not like that.

61
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,050
I see.

62
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,560
You don't seem like ordinary friends,

63
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,430
but you two are great together.

64
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,930
You're very different...

65
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:32,600
but are similar in a few ways.

66
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:50,449
What is it?

67
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:53,990
Let's go.

68
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,730
This is me.

69
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,410
Right. So this is where you live.

70
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,110
Yes.

71
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,579
Thanks for today.

72
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,680
Right.

73
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,589
Are you drunk?

74
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:39,259
Am I?

75
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,170
I can see just fine without my glasses.

76
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,769
Give me those.

77
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,939
Gosh, that's dizzy.

78
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,040
The glasses are just fine.

79
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,920
That's two.

80
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,290
Three.

81
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,149
How about now?

82
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,160
Gosh.

83
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,160
- Come on. Let's try it. - What?

84
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:12,129
Can you read this?

85
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,970
Humour me one last time. Can you read it?

86
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,800
Forget it. Go home already.

87
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,839
Where would I go?

88
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,769
I won't do it, so go home.

89
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,350
I bet you have something to say.

90
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,090
Do you also like Han So Yeon?

91
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,200
It's just that...

92
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,129
I'll probably feel differently about this tomorrow.

93
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,970
We have never liked the same woman before,

94
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,070
but So Yeon...

95
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,980
You're talking nonsense.

96
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,049
I'm not interested in her.

97
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,950
She's not my type.

98
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,820
Anyway, are you going to stay the night or not?

99
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:13,289
I'm staying the night.

100
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,929
You'll let me, right?

101
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,659
Unbelievable.

102
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:29,769
I should make Ms. Mo a cup of coffee tomorrow.

103
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,149
Separate the egg white...

104
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,690
and just add in the yolk.

105
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,259
Plop.

106
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,960
Okay, it's ready.

107
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:26,500
Ms. Mo, you're stunning even in the morning.

108
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,799
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

109
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,870
I feel more at home here than back at home.

110
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,980
- How is it? - It's good.

111
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,820
Where's your necklace?

112
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,950
Did you lose it?

113
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,950
It ran off.

114
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,259
When?

115
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,559
You should've told me. Isn't it of value?

116
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,759
It's all right.

117
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:00,899
You must be upset.

118
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:03,730
That necklace belonged to Jun Hee's mom.

119
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:44,809
Gosh.

120
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,179
I slept like a baby.

121
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,860
Jun Hee should eat his meals like clockwork just like me...

122
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,870
and exercise between all that studying.

123
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,899
Ms. Mo.

124
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,539
I'd like breakfast as well.

125
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:19,580
What?

126
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,110
"Ms. Mo?"

127
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,649
Ms. Mo, you're stunning even in the morning.

128
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,019
"Ms. Mo?"

129
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:35,490
Stop it.

130
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,159
I was mimicking you.

131
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,830
It was awkward like crazy, so don't do it again!

132
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,629
Are you wearing contacts?

133
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,700
Just put your glasses on. You look ugly either way.

134
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,299
Get out of my face, will you?

135
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,440
Don't you have anything else to focus on?

136
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
- No. - No.

137
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,039
- Just this once. - Come on.

138
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,379
- Just this one time. - Darn it!

139
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,809
I'm done with the weight-loss plan.

140
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,779
I can't take it anymore.

141
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,779
Girls, let's go to the cafeteria.

142
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,480
I want a corn dog!

143
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,690
- The cafeteria? - Corn dog.

144
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,889
Yes. Corn dog!

145
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,860
- Are you off to the cafeteria? - Yes.

146
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,139
You're actually coming?

147
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:20,700
Yes.

148
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,509
- What the... - The cafeteria.

149
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:30,850
You punk.

150
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,620
- The cafeteria! - What are you doing?

151
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,980
We're coming too.

152
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:37,590
Stop that.

153
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,620
- Hey! - Seriously?

154
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,529
Han So Yeon?

155
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,330
Hurry up, then.

156
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,799
- The corn dog is mine. - Hurry.

157
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,870
Hurry, guys.

158
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,470
Catch me if you can!

159
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,070
Run for it!

160
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,879
(Year 2023)

161
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,750
I apologize for the intrusion.

162
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,220
Your place is incredible!

163
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,460
I'm loving the modern vibe.

164
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,960
The nightscape is beautiful.

165
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,440
This is exactly why I came to you.

166
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,909
My hunch has been right all along.

167
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,480
You're a city boy who doesn't care about worldly things.

168
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:41,620
Can I get you a beverage?

169
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,460
I feel gloomy today.

170
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,289
What do you say to a drink?

171
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,700
What matters is the base.

172
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:56,500
Whether you pour a drink into coffee or coffee into a drink...

173
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,269
But on a day like today,

174
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,070
you should pour a drink into coffee.

175
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,110
It's for when you want to get wasted.

176
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:10,980
It's the same with love.

177
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,690
How it ends is decided according to its base.

178
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:18,159
Whether it turns from love to friendship...

179
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:20,360
or friendship to love.

180
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:24,230
If it turns from friendship to love, you can call it a happy ending.

181
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,500
But the other way around...

182
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,169
is a sad ending.

183
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,600
How sad.

184
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,980
What do you really want to say?

185
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,120
Now tell me...

186
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,019
what your secret is.

187
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,289
Thanks for the food.

188
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,590
- We came out late. - It might make a sound.

189
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,960
- What do I do then? - Hey.

190
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,960
- I'm grateful every day. - What are you saying?

191
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,860
- Hey. - Goodness.

192
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,370
- I'm grateful every day. - What are you saying?

193
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,039
Oh, the pigeon?

194
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,309
Just leave it be.

195
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,980
Leave it be. It will go away soon.

196
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:18,549
- What... - Stop.

197
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,919
- Leave it be. - We can just chase it away.

198
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:22,450
Go away.

199
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,159
Why are you running?

200
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Darn it. Why are you running?

201
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,070
Are you afraid of birds?

202
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,740
I guess...

203
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:46,580
Is that your secret?

204
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,549
I wouldn't call it a secret.

205
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:51,850
Soon Tak and Jun Hee know about it.

206
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,659
Is Jun Hee afraid of birds too?

207
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
No.

208
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,299
It's probably because that pigeon was unusually big.

209
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,910
Give me what you have.

210
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,980
- You jerk. - You always have no money.

211
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:28,150
Why don't you have money?

212
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,940
Aren't you afraid of anything?

213
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,009
I am afraid of PE classes.

214

215
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,849
but it came out well only for basketball.

216
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,690
Could you teach me any sports?

217
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:05,660
Sure.

218
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:12,359
