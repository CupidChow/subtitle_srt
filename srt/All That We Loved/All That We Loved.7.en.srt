00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:39,079
Smile a little, okay?

7
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:41,179
Think of us as your friends.

8
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,079
Pluck up some courage.

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
Have you lost your mind?

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
Yes.

11
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,689
I've lost my mind.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
I steal.

13
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:00,570
That was my secret.

14
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,530
Can you understand it?

15
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,099
How could I understand that?

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,409
If you're going to lose it, do so nicely.

17
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,829
You prick.

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,939
Are you pleased you got beaten up?

19
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,780
I got in a few punches too.

20
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,849
Unbelievable.

21
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,780
You must be so proud of yourself that you fought back.

22
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,090
Aren't you a fast runner?

23
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:30,960
So run when you meet punks like him...

24
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,460
rather than letting your pride take over.

25
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,430
I threw the first punch.

26
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,060
- What? - I went after him.

27
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,900
You've lost it for sure.

28
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,830
I'm not always there to protect you...

29
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,229
which makes it reckless.

30
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,639
I met So Yeon earlier.

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,710
She had my grandma's necklace.

32
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,680
Didn't she tell you that she had stolen it?

33
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,689
She said found it...

34
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,960
and that you were mistaken.

35
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,689
She told me she had stolen it.

36
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:10,030
I also saw her stealing Yoon Jung's mp3,

37
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,560
and I discovered the necklace...

38
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,830
when I opened her bag to check.

39
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,030
- Am I still mistaken? - You're wrong about the necklace.

40
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,139
And you believe that?

41
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,169
If you had seen for yourself...

42
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,409
I did.

43
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,439
And you're still taking her side?

44
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,039
There seemed to be a story behind it.

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,050
I found her crying.

46
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,590
Not everyone commits crimes when they're sad.

47
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,590
Anyway, stop talking about her with me.

48
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,360
This is none of your business.

00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:55,169
(Year 2023)

51
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:56,569
If it's painful to talk about,

52
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,539
you can put it off until later.

53
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,680
No, I want to tell you.

54
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,280
I've always regretted it.

55
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:09,050
If I had told you guys back then,

56
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,729
things would've been much different for us.

57
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,230
You two understanding it should've come last.

58
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,470
But judging by the look on your face,

59
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:30,240
you'll be understanding no matter what I say.

60
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,660
When I was 16,

61
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,970
three days before my period,

62
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,199
I stole my friend's bracelet.

63
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,709
I saw it all the time...

64
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,740
and never did I want it for myself.

65
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:08,779
But one day,

66
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,019
my heart thumped at the sight of it,

67
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,319
and I got the urge to steal it.

68
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,660
Did anything like that happen during your previous periods?

69
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,129
That was the first time I stole something,

70
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,699
but the urges were there.

71
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,069
But the urges...

72
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,470
grew uncontrollable.

73
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,410
And they grew stronger.

74
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,629
Are you asleep?

Do you know what cellular memory is?

77
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,810
I'd rather not hear English in the middle of the night.

78
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:09,240
Can we just go to sleep?

79
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:25,060
Hey, that sauce has peanut in it!

80
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,220
What?

81
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,360
- Oh, no! - Where's the medicine?

82
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,160
- Oh, dear. - Darn it.

83
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,759
(For allergies)

84
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,170
Goodness.

85
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,250
Ms. Mo, try this.

86
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,699
This is as good as You's.

87
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:40,699
Really?

88
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,399
I can outdo him if I put my mind to it.

Guys!

93
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,970
You're louder than any other class in the school.

94
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,569
- Sir! - My gosh.

95
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,540
- Hush. - Got it.

96
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,569
- Sure. - All right.

97
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,750
Thanks for yesterday.

98
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:39,220
Right. Thanks for this.

99
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,389
How did Han So Yeon get it?

100
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,159
Don't drink it.

101
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,899
What do you mean?

102
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:19,659
Just don't drink it.

103
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:21,500
Then I'll drink it instead.

104
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,450
Mom, what can you tell me about cellular memory?

105
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,559
Cellular memory?

106
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,929
It's a phenomenon...

107
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:50,330
that presents itself with organ recipients like Jun Hee.

108
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,230
It means that cells have the capacity to remember.

109
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:55,029
Organ recipients acquire...

110
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,539
personality traits of their donors, as well as habits,

111
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,600
preferences, memories, and even their taste in romantic interests.

112
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,809
Some instances were reported abroad.

113
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,080
Are you drunk?

114
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,779
I can see just fine without my glasses.

115
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,389
Ms. Mo.

116
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,629
Is Jun Hee afraid of birds too?

117
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,580
- I got in a few punches too. - Unbelievable.

118
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,009
I threw the first punch.

119
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,220
There was a heart recipient...

120
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,929
who fell in love with the donor's girlfriend.

121
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:02,429
Thanks for yesterday.

122
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,769
Right. Thanks for this.

123
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,980
Have any of your patients experienced that?

124
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,480
No, and it's something...

125
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,909
I find it hard to believe as a doctor.

126
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:19,950
It must be a psychological effect of organ transplants.

127
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:22,389
Do you know what cellular memory is?

128
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,940
- Where are you headed? - Right.

129
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,110
To see You.

130
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,970
He sounded off on the phone.

131
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,139
Right.

132
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:48,309
CPCR, code blue. ICU.

133
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,350

- It's an emergency. - ICU.

136
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,990
CPCR, code blue.

137
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:59,289
- Let me handle it. - Would you?

138
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:10,370
I can't make it either.

139
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,379
Yes, I'll be there soon.

140
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,379
So Yeon.

141
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,549
Let's go out.

142
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,070
Jun Hee.

143
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:21,409
What are you doing?

144
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,580
I saw her by chance.

145
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,950
And I helped her as she was having it hard.

146
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,250
Having what hard? Stealing?

147
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,490
She didn't steal anything.

148
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,289
And there's certainly a reason behind that.

149
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:37,590
Yes, of course.

150
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,090
But that reason can't justify her behaviour,

151
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,389
so she wouldn't tell us.

152
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,960
Can't you know that much?

153
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,799
Or maybe you didn't seem ready to hear it.

154
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,360
Are you defending her?

155
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,269
I mean, you shouldn't defend her for this.

156
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,870
Snap out of it.

157
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:54,240
Are you being like this to her...

158
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,210
because of the cellular memory?

159
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
No.

160
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,419
It started when I saw her for the first time at the infirmary.

161
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,159
It was the same as you.

162
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,659
Now we're just friends.

163
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:26,740
Not everyone around us should be perfect.

164
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,039
But at least...

165
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,440
if anyone can put us in danger,

166
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,580
we cannot be friends with them.

167
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,909
Stop however you feel about her.

168
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,710
Even if it's hard, stop.

169
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,519
I'm not meddling with your business here.

170
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,750
Whether I become friends or whatever with her, it's up to me.

171
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,720
So stay out of my business.

172
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:49,860
What? My wallet.

173
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,600
I shouldn't lose my wallet.

174
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:55,230
- Look for it. - Gosh.

175
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,169
- Isn't it over there? - No, it's not.

176
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,240
Search carefully.

177
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,299
- Maybe it's deeper inside. - Keep looking.

178
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,740
- It's strange. - It must be somewhere.

179
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,240
I doubt it's stolen.

180
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,039
Search carefully.

181
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,710
- Check there. - Could anyone have stolen it?

182
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,080
- No way. - I doubt it.

183
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,620
Did Han So Yeon steal it?

184
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,220
- Maybe it's her. - It can't be stolen.

185
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,259
Didn't you go to Yeonga Middle School?

186
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,840
I found it!

187
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,769
- Are you kidding me? - Come on.

188
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,610
- What on earth? - You startled us.

189
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,909
It was here.

190
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:43,149
- What the... - You're too sloppy.

191
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,990
You brats would still be happy even if I gave you...

192
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,389
doenjang sauce mixed with faeces, wouldn't you?

193
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,960
Your friendly homeroom teacher went for his training today, right?

194
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,299
- Yes. - Yes.

195
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,070
Unfortunately, I'll hand you your reports for the finals.

196
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,639
Before that, I'm going to call those who placed 1st to 5th.

197
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,269
Ko Jun Hee, Han So Yeon,

198
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:13,179
Choi Yoon Jung, Kim Young Rae,

199
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,379
and Jeong Eun Joo. Come up front.

200
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,659
All right.

201
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:28,090
They're the ace students of this class. Give them a hand.

202
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,360
Good job.

203
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,340
Now I'm going to call those who placed 28th to last.

204
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:42,440
Once your name is called, go stand at the back.

205
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,539
Choi Kyu Sik, Jeong Joon Beom,

206
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:48,210
Kang Jin Hee, Kim Jae Hee, Ko You.

207
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:55,090
Sir, You had to miss a day of the finals due to the game.

208
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,759
You brat, studying comes first for students, not sports.

209
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,259
Go stand at the back!

210
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:06,400
Good job slacking off.

211
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,630
Give them a hand too.

212
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,500
All right. You brats at the back...

213
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:14,740
and front, look at each other's faces.

214
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,170
Take a good look at each other now.

215
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,250
You guys will never cross paths once you graduate.

216
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:25,079
And those of you seated, make a wise decision...

217
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,980
whether to study hard...

218
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,619
and join those in the front...

219
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,920
or join those punks at the back.

220
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,789
Think carefully as you look back and forth.

221
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,730
Make a wise decision, got it?

222
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,970
Got it?

223
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,299
- Yes. - Yes.

224
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,690
I used to be stuck in my studio apartment all the time.

225
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,589
So it's really nice to be out here.

226
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,319
Why aren't you eating?

227
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,529
You said you liked drumsticks.

228
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,630
Eat up.

229
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,029
It's good that you at least have an appetite.

230
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:18,970
Didn't you leave work yet...

231
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,009
Han So Yeon?

232
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,940
Hey, So Yeon.

233
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,349
Oh, my.

234
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,480
Soon Tak?

235
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:35,089
Hey, I didn't recognize you. You lost so much weight.

236
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:39,819
Hold on. Are you a doctor here too?

237
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,460
Yes.

238
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,029
You're still pretty.

239
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:46,599
It's good to see you.

240
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,940
Is he out of his mind?

241
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,269
(Year 2006)

242
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,809
- Soon Tak. - You!

243
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,319
Who told you to study?

244
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,819
We have a quiz today.

245
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,849
As if you've ever studied for it.

246
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,589
Did you eat?

247
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,559
She's like that.

248
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:22,970
Isn't it crazy?

249
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:24,369
- Hey. - The thief is here.

250
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,640
- The thief is here. - The thief.

251
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,039
- Goodness. - Can you believe it?

252
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,940
- She's... - Isn't she so creepy?

253
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,779
What a thief.

254
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:35,180
I mean, she said so.

255
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,309
Goodness.

256
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,819
- Where are you going? - To the gym to practice.

257
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:44,019
Good luck.

258
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,259
We have to memorize up to here, right?

259
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,569
Yes, here.

260
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:03,369
What's wrong?

261
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:05,410
Let go of me.

262
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,990
She's so proud for a thief.

263
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,089
- Who's a thief? - Han So Yeon.

264
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,960
Didn't you hear the rumour?

265
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,859
Did anyone see her steal something?

266
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,029
No, I just heard it.

267
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,509
But as far as I know, You doesn't talk to her because of it.

268
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,339
Weren't you aware of it too?

269
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,500
(Hara High School)

270
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:10,039
What? Are you here to get me?

271
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:13,380
- What? - Did you tell the others?

272
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,509
- Tell them what? - About So Yeon.

273
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:20,079
What about her?

274
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,119
There's a rumour about her.

275
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,529
Did you spread it?

276
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,900
Why can't you say it clearly?

277
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,500
Did it spread in the school that she stole stuff?

278
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,400
Why? Did she get caught stealing something again?

279
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,240
Are you insane?

280
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,539
Snap out of it.

281
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:42,970
She isn't important enough for us to bicker like this.

282
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,740
Do you only care about what you think?

283
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,680
Then tell me what you think clearly.

284
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,980
You said you'd choose friendship.

285
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,450
Is this what you call choosing friendship?

286
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,750
Why can't you say that you like So Yeon?

287
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,019
I'm not mistaken about her stealing habit.

288
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:58,220
That's a fact.

289
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,390
Will you go out with her even when everyone finds out?

290
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:08,299
- What's going on? - I think they're fighting.

291
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,529
And...

292
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,599
a fact isn't a rumour.

293
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,640
It's just that the truth got revealed.

294
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,910
Why can't you say anything?

295
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,089
All you can do is staring, isn't it?

296
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,019
All you can do is staring, isn't it?

297
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:45,970
Let's stop.

298
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,640
Jun Hee, what are you doing?

299
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:54,779
Gosh.

300
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,619
Hey, you're a PE major. Go stop them.

301
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,259
This is enough! Stop!

302
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,960
Come to your senses, Ko Jun Hee.

303
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,359
- Hey. - Stop them.

304
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:13,930
- Go get the teacher. - Stop it.

305
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,930
Hurry and stop them.

306
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,480
