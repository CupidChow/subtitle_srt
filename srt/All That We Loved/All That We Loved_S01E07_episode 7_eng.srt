1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,860
   

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:16,010
  ​

3
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,810
   

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,950
     

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,900
♫  My everything, it grows within me  ♫

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:36,950
♫  It seems they will last forever always, our youthful days  ♫

7
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,000
   

8
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,220
Straighten your shoulders. Okay?

9
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,140
As if we're friends. With some courage.

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,570
- Are you crazy? 
 - Yeah, I'm crazy.

11
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,440
 Theft. That was my secret. 

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,430
 Can you understand me? 

13
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,870
How can I understand that?

14
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,740
If you're going to go crazy, do it nicely.

15
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,200
Hey!

16
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,840
This bastard!

17
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,380
Are you happy even though you got beat up?

18
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,670
- It's not like I only got hit. 
 - Gosh.

19
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,500
You must be so happy that you didn't only get hit.

20
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,360
Hey, aren't you good at running?

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,040
If you meet a bastard like him, just run instead of being so stubborn.

22
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,980
I hit him first.

23
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,500
- What? 
 - I followed that bastard first.

24
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,740
This guy is crazy.

25
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,140
Hey, it's not like I'm with you all the time. Why would you be so rash?

26
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,510
I met So Yeon earlier.

27
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,550
Supposedly, So Yeon had Grandma's necklace.

28
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,050
She didn't say she had it because she stole it?

29
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,150
She says she found the necklace on the floor.

30
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,660
She said you misunderstood that one.

31
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,790
She clearly said she stole it.

32
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,090
I saw her steal Yoon Jeong's mp3 player with my own eyes

33
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,980
and when I opened her bag to confirm it, the necklace was there, too!

34
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,870
- Am I still misunderstanding this? 
 - She says not the necklace.

35
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,700
Do you actually believe that?

36
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,910
- It's because you didn't see it for yourself— 
 - I saw it, too.

37
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,540
And you're still taking her side?

38
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,910
It seemed like she had a reason. She was crying.

39
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,230
Not everyone commits a crime when they are sad.

40
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,340
Don't talk to me about her. You shouldn't get involved in this.

41
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,550
   

42
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,210
   

43
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,300
If it's difficult for you to tell me, you can tell me later.

44
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,960
No. I want to tell you.

45
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,070
I always regretted it.

46
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,020
If I had told you guys then,

47
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,600
things would be different for us now.

48
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,370
Whether you guys understood me or not should've come later.

49
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,660
But seeing your face right now,

50
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,330
it looks like you would understand me no matter what I say.

51
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,660
When I was 16,

52
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,950
I think around four days before my period. I stole my friend's bracelet.

53
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,800
It was a bracelet that I'd seen all the time,

54
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,750
and I had never wanted it.

55
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,520
But one day,

56
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,900
my heart started racing when I saw it,

57
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,230
and I got this impulse to steal it.

58
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,800
You haven't had that experience for previous periods?

59
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,430
That was my first time stealing,

60
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,740
but I did have those impulses.

61
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,080
But as time passed,

62
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,640
the impulse became more uncontrollable...

63
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,530
and felt stronger.

64
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,480
Are you sleeping?

65
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,520
   

66
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,070
Do you know about cellular memory?

67
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,220
Why are you bringing up English terms in the middle of the night? Let's just sleep.

68
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,230
 - Hey, that sauce contains peanuts!  
  - What did you say? 

69
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,400
 - Oh, no! 
 - Where's my medicine? 

70
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,640
 - Gosh, seriously... 
 - Oh, no! Oh, no! 

71
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,520
   

72
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,200
Madam Mo, try drinking this.

73
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,800
 You made it just as good as Go Yoo does! 

74
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,320
 Really? If I try, I can do better than Go Yoo. 

75
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,350
   

76
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,330
What's this?

77
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,750
Hey!

78
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,000
Our class is the noisiest!

79
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,600
Geez!

80
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,190
 Okay! 

81
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,680
Thank you for yesterday.

82
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,190
Yeah. Thanks.

83
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,480
 How did Han So Yeon manage to buy it? 

84
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,030
Don't drink it.

85
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,280
- Why are you being like that? 
 - Just don't drink it.

86
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,310
Then I'll drink it.

87
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,280
 Mom, what's cellular memory? 

88
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,390
 Cellular memory? 

89
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,220
 It's a symptom that arises in patients with organ transplants like Joon Hee. 

90
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,080
 It is also called cellular memory theory, 

91
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,590
 where the organ donor's personality, tendencies, preferences, memories 

92
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,210
 and even ideal types are transferred to the organ recipient. 

93
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,890
 There were cases of it abroad. 

94
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,960
 - Are you drunk? 
 - I can see well even without my glasses. 

95
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,160
 Madam Mo! 

96
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,750
 But is Joon Hee afraid of birds, too? 

97
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,650
 - It's not like I only got hit. 
 - Gosh. 

98
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,950
 I hit him first. 

99
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,830
 There was a case where someone received a heart transplant and fell in love with the donor's girlfriend. 

100
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,300
 Thank you for yesterday. 

101
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,860
 Yeah. Thanks. 

102
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,370
 Did any of your patients experience that, Mom? 

103
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,320
 No. Even I have a hard time believing this as a doctor. 

104
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,660
 Don't you think it may be a post-surgery psychological symptom? 

105
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,580
 Do you know about cellular memory? 

106
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,200
- Where are you going? 
 - I'm going to Go Yoo.

107
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,110
I talked to him earlier on the phone, and he sounded a bit down.

108
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,520
Okay.

109
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,790
 Code Blue. 

110
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,450
   
 Code Blue. 

111
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,500
 - Code Blue.  
 - I'm called into the ER.

112
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,420
 Code Blue. 

113
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,760
- I'll go. 
 - Will you, please?

114
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,600
Gosh!

115
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,380
I can't go, either.

116
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,150
Yeah, I'll be there soon.

117
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,110
So Yeon.

118
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,320
Let's leave.

119
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,210
Go Joon Hee,

120
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,350
what are you doing right now?

121
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,540
I met So Yeon by coincidence,

122
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,210
- she seemed to be struggling, so I helped her. 
 - Struggling over what?

123
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,910
- Was she having trouble stealing? 
 - She didn't steal anything!

124
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,540
- Also, she definitely had a reason. 
 - Of course, she would!

125
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,810
But she's not telling us because that reason can't cover this up.

126
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,800
- You can't see that? 
 - Not that you're not ready to listen?

127
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,540
Whose side are you taking? Is this something to take sides?

128
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,900
Wake up!

129
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,740
Are you doing this for So Yeon

130
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,000
because of cellular memory?

131
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,760
No.

132
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,080
It was from the moment I first saw her at the nurse's office.

133
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,970
Just like you.

134
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,470
Right now, we're friends.

135
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,690
I'm not saying there should only be perfect people around us.

136
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:35,110
But still, if someone could put us in danger,

137
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,010
we can't even be friends.

138
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,530
Whatever feelings you have for her, give them up.

139
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:43,000
- Even if you can't, do it. 
 - I am not doing this to get involved in your business.

140
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,940
Whether we are friends or anything else, that's my business.

141
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,550
So don't get involved in what I do, either.

142
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,200
Oh! My wallet!

143
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,020
Gosh, I can't afford to lose my wallet!

144
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,060
 Try looking carefully. You sure it's not inside? 

145
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,200
- It's not here! 
  - Try looking carefully. 

146
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,040
 - Try looking carefully. 
 - You sure it's not inside? 

147
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,840
 - No way someone would have stolen it. 
 - Look for it carefully. 

148
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,680
 - You sure nobody stole it? 
 - No way someone would have stolen it. 

149
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,050
 - Hey, maybe it's Han So Yeon? 
 - It looks like Han So Yeon did it. 

150
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,230
 Didn't you attend Yeonga Junior High? 

151
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,250
Oh! I found it!

152
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,940
 - Gosh, come on! 
 - I told you. 

153
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,630
 I knew it would be like that. 

154
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,060
- Gosh, it was here. 
  - You scared me! 

155
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,490
Are you guys still in a good mood, even with all the crappy things going on?

156
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,080
You know your nice homeroom teacher went to training. Right?

157
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,640
 Yes. 

158
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,040
It's unfortunate, but I will give out your final exam grades.

159
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,790
The names I will call out right now are the 1st to 5th-place students.

160
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:18,570
Go Joon Hee, Han So Yeon, Choi Yoon Jeong, Kim Yong Rae, and Jeong Eun Joo.

161
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,390
Come up to the front.

162
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,120
All right.

163
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,000
They're the aces of this class. A round of applause.

164
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,970
Great work.

165
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,450
The names I will call out now are punks ranking from last place to 28th place.

166
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,260
When I call out your name, stand at the back of the classroom.

167
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:53,180
Choi Gyu Shik, Jeong Joon Beom, Kang Jin Hee, Kim Jae Yi, and Go Yoo.

168
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:59,510
Teacher, but Yoo missed a day of exams because of a match.

169
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,710
Hey, you bastard.

170
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,180
For a student, studying comes first, not sports.

171
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,920
Go and stand in the back!

172
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,350
All right. You guys also worked hard at playing.

173
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,780
Give them a round of applause, too.

174
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,070
All right.

175
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:19,860
You guys in the front and the back, take a look at each other's faces.

176
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,310
Get a good look.

177
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,650
When you guys go out into society, your paths will not cross.

178
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,050
Also, you guys who are seated, judge for yourselves

179
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,580
whether you will work hard for the rest of the time and meet the guys in the front in life,

180
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,370
or meet the guys in the back.

181
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,550
Consider well after looking at the front and the back.

182
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,960
Judge well. You got that?

183
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,140
- You got that? 
  - Yes. 

184
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,980
    
 It's so nice to come out here after being stuck in the apartment.

185
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,450
But why aren't you eating? You said you liked drumsticks.

186
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,850
You enjoy it. It's a relief that you have an appetite, at least.

187
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,860
You still haven't gone home yet—

188
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,990
Han So Yeon?

189
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,550
Wow. Hey, So Yeon.

190
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,310
Oh, my!

191
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,540
Are you Soon Tak?

192
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:40,250
Hey, I almost didn't recognize you! You lost so much weight!

193
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,100
What's this...

194
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,330
Are you also a psychiatrist here?

195
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,500
Yeah.

196
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,960
Wow... you're still pretty.

197
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,510
Wow, it's so nice to see you.

198
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,370
Is he crazy? 
    

199
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,520
Ahn Soon Tak!

200
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,600
Oh, Go Yoo!

201
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,430
Who told you to study?

202
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,820
We have a quiz today.

203
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,660
When did you start preparing for quizzes?

204
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,440
Did you eat?

205
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,710
- It's amazing, right? 
 - Hey, it's the thief.

206
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,840
- The thief is here. 
  - It's the thief. 

207
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,940
 - There she is.  
 - Isn't it too scary?

208
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,670
 I'm saying that's what I heard. 

209
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,790
- Go Yoo, where are you going? 
 - To the gym for practice.

210
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,820
Okay, have a good practice.

211
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,430
- I just have to memorize up to here, right? 
 - Yeah, up to there.

212
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,330
What's wrong?

213
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,120
Let me go.

214
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,630
She's so confident for someone who steals!

215
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,700
- Who? Who's the thief? 
 - Han So Yeon!

216
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,910
You guys haven't heard the rumors?

217
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,690
Did anyone actually see So Yeon steal?

218
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:36,000
I mean, I just heard it somewhere, too.

219
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,790
But I heard that's why Go Yoo isn't talking to her anymore after finding out about it.

220
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,200
Didn't you guys know that, too?

221
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,010
Huh? What's this?

222
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,570
Did you come to pick me up?

223
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,430
- What is it? 
 - Did you tell the guys?

224
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,500
- Tell them what? 
 - About So Yeon!

225
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,790
What about So Yeon?

226
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,350
Rumors have spread about So Yeon. Did you start it?

227
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,250
Why can't you talk about it properly?

228
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,530
Did rumors about So Yeon stealing spread in school?

229
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,000
Why? Did she get caught while stealing something?

230
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,530
Are you crazy? Wake up!

231
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,960
She's not so important that we have to be like this!

232
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,770
Are only your thoughts important?

233
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,760
Then tell me exactly what your thoughts are.

234
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,470
You said it was friendship. Is this really friendship?

235
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,780
Why can't you say you like So Yeon?

236
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,880
I'm not mistaken about how So Yeon steals. That's a fact.

237
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,090
Even when people find out, will you take that on and go out with her?

238
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,400
- What's going on? 
 - I guess they're fighting.

239
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,460
Also, you don't call it a rumor when it's a fact.

240
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,420
It means the truth came to light.

241
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,720
Why can't you say anything when you were talking just fine?

242
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,000
All you know how to do is stare, right?

243
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,030
 Is staring at people the only thing you know how to do? 

244
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,770
Forget it.

245
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,600
Joon Hee! Joon Hee, what are you doing?

246
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,590
 Hey, you're an athlete. Break them up! 

247
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,530
Hey, you guys! Stop it!

248
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,140
Stop it!

249
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,730
Wake up! Wake up, Go Joon Hee!

250
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,240
Gosh, stop it!

251
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,560
 - Goodness! 
 - Break them up! 

252
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:32,280
  ​

253
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,350
♫  The wind rattles my window  ♫

254
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,020
   

255
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:45,050
♫  Above my room that is as tall as me  ♫

256
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:54,970
♫  The starlight beautifully fills it up  ♫

257
00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:00,770
♫  The countless stars  ♫

258
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:07,830
♫  Comfort me when I'm tired  ♫

259
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:17,990
♫  And wipe away the tears that fill me inside  ♫
