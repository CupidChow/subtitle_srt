I have to fish for compliments...

332
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,490
All right. Add soju...

333
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,530
up to here.

334
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,100
Finished!

335
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,360
- Would you like a cup?
- No.

336
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,660
All right, don't drink it then.

337
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,980
Yeah, that's good.

338
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,010
But...

339
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,360
how did you end up living so boringly?

340
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,760
Me?

341
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,480
I'm having fun right now.

342
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,000
It's fun?

343
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,940
Yeah.

344
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,530
It looks really boring...

345
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,870
Do you...

346
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,570
by chance, have presbyopia?

347
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,210
I mean... your glasses...

348
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,320
What's with the glasses?

349
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,630
[Year 2006]
- Do I have to explain what glasses are?

350
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,430
No, I thought you put on a disguise to avoid me.

351
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,860
That's funny.

352
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,290
Hey, should we leave this guy and take him instead?

353
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,990
Never mind.

354
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:05,330
This guy seems to have more money than him.

355
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,950
- Beggar bastard.
- I'll see you next time.

356
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,020
Hey, tell him to fuck off.

357
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,540
Fuck off!

358
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,980
Fuck off.

359
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Fuck off!

360
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,570
Geez!

361
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,440
The next class is P.E.

362
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,500
I know.

363
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,640
I just forgot my gym clothes.

364
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,380
Oh, could you tell the teacher for me?

365
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,360
Yeah.

366
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,210
This is mine. Do you want to wear it?

367
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,950
I washed it clean.

368
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,020
What about you?

369
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,290
I have a separate training suit.

370
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,460
Is it too big for you?

371
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,660
I'll do it for you. Let me take a look.

372
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,440
Why?

373
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,540
It's nothing.

374
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,540
Thanks.

375
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,730
Yeah.

376
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,290
Where's Go You and Han So Yeon?

377
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,800
Gosh, Go You, that punk is always late!

378
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,900
They're coming over there.

379
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,980
<i>Whoa. What's this?</i>

380
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,990
[Go You]
All right, all right! Quiet, quiet.

381
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,470
Why were you late?

382
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,100
Go and take a seat.

383
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,450
Gosh, seriously. I really wanted to avoid basketball class.

384
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:22,350
It's kind of like having Americans in the class and teaching them English.

385
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,990
It would be better for Go You to demonstrate than me, right?

386
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,260
<i>Yes!</i>

387
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,410
Don't misunderstand, though.

388
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,460
It's not because I can't dunk.

389
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,280
Go You, show us an example.

390
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,520
Here.

391
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,880
He's good.

392
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,270
Wow, he's so cool.

393
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,100
He's no joke!

394
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,830
So cool!

395
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,900
He's so cool!

396
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,940
All right, all right. You, go around and help the rest of the class.

397
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,540
Teacher! You're trying to cut class again, aren't you?

398
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,410
Joon Hee, try taking a shot.

399
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,850
You need to extend your arm all the way.

400
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,210
Extend your arm all the way.

401
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,300
Focus, focus.

402
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,530
Okay, one more time. One more time.

403
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,530
Watch the ball to the end.

404
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,130
Push it forward.

405
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,860
Go Joon Hee is so bad!

406
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,050
Focus, focus.

407
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,100
- Extend your arm all the way and push-
- Watch, just watch!

408
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,910
Okay. Try it.

409
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,660
Geez! Who cares if you're only good at English?

410
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,560
Your athletic abilities are this bad!

411
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,980
This is the last time.

412
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,900
Watch the ball all the way and push forward with your arms.

413
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,450
Watch.

414
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,500
You have to extend your arm all the way.

415
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,690
Focus and think this is the final shot.

416
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,400
Did you see it?

417
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,410
Guys, Go Joon Hee just made a shot!

418

Guys, guys! Go Joon Hee just made a basket!

Hey, did you see it?

00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,960
What's this!

00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,830
- You did well, so eat one.
- How was it?

422
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,270
Why are you here like this by yourself?

423
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,860
I'll teach you. Look. Follow after me.

424
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,100
Your left hand is just there for support, and you hold it with your right hand.

425
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,680
Like this. That's right.

426
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,730
And then, try pushing it with your right hand.

427
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,200
You've got potential.

428
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,770
Try it again.

Gosh!

Did you see it? Did you see how it went through?

435
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,050
You want to try it one more time?

436
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,290
Wow!

This is it, So Yeon! This is basketball!

Just stay on the ground.
