1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,130
   

2
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,970
   

3
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,070
     

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,000
♫  My everything, it grows within me  ♫

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,530
♫  It seems they will last forever always  ♫

6
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,380
♫  Our youthful days  ♫

7
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,070
   

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,460
Han So Yeon.

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:55,060
  ​

10
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,080
I saw it wrong just now. Right?

11
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,880
Can I check your bag?

12
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,570
   

13
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,130
Hey.

14
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,340
Seriously...

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,500
- Actually, I... 
 - You thief!

16
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,230
   

17
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,740
Am I misunderstanding this?

18
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,310
No.

19
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,110
- Where did you... 
 - Where did I steal this?

20
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,740
I don't know where I stole it.

21
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:51,670
   

22
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,000
    
 Hey, did you see the article about So Yeon?

23
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,340
You want to eat a sandwich?

24
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,030
Oh, this has peanut sauce in it.

25
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,180
If you have any papers on menstrual theft or pathological impulse disorder, send them to me.

26
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,790
What?

27
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,730
Oh, okay.

28
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,900
   

29
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,310
Go Yoo came to school.

30
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,310
I guess he and Han So Yeon cut classes together.

31
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,150
Wait, I guess not? What about Go Yoo?

32
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,790
 Oh, I heard she transferred schools often. 

33
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,890
 How did Han So Yeon manage to buy it? 

34
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,700
   

35
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,400
 You thief! 

36
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,290
Go Yoo, did you lose the match?

37
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,690
Did you lose?

38
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,440
No.

39
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,080
It's clear he fought with Han So Yeon.

40
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,680
Hi, Dunk.

41
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,630
All right. You can have it.

42
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,650
Is that the only copy of Lee Hyori's photo in the world?

43
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,770
Did you fight with So Yeon?

44
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,870
Why?

45
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,270
Give this to Madam Mo.

46
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,390
- Where did you find it? 
 - I just found it.

47
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,740
Where did you just find it?

48
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,490
I don't know. Just give it to Madam Mo.

49
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,270
   

50
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,900
 Hey. 

51
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,320
 Seriously... 

52
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,720
 - Gosh. Goodness. 
 - I'm sorry! 

53
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,030
 Gosh, she should be more careful. 

54
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,290
 Goodness. 

55
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,970
- What's wrong? 
 - Are your friends bullying you for being a lefty?

56
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,600
No.

57
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,990
I'm just trying out using both hands.

58
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,750
I heard it's good for your brain.

59
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,270
I see.

60
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Oh, my!

61
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,910
Where did you find this?

62
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,920
I guess Go Yoo went to all the cafes you visit, Grandma.

63
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,840
Goodness! How did he manage to find this?

64
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,330
Yoo must have gone through so much trouble.

65
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,010
I couldn't find it even though I looked everywhere for it.

66
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,480
Gosh, my goodness.

67
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,730
 Han So Yeon. 

68
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,070
 Are your friends bullying you for being a lefty? 

69
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,680
 Madam Mo? 

70
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,940
 Stop it. I just tried imitating you. 

71
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,050
 Gosh, it's so awkward! Don't do it! 

72
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,630
 Righty, eyesight, ornithophobia, 

73
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,210
 basketball, Son Ye Jin = Go Yoo! 

74
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,220
   

75
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,990
Let's get banana milk.

76
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,880
- Banana milk? 
 - Let's get strawberry milk.

77
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,310
- So, how did things go with her? 
 - What do you think?

78
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,470
Hey, you guys stay here for a bit.

79
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,140
What? Hey! Where are you going?

80
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,190
You remember me. Right?

81
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,200
I heard we transferred here around the same time.

82
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,940
Isn't that a fated connection?

83
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,840
Junior? Junior?

84
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,570
What are you doing?

85
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,710
Why? Is she yours?

86
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,330
Is she yours or not?

87
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,370
Let's go.

88
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,910
Hey, you little...

89
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,690
- Answer me! 
 - Hey, Jeon Sang Gyu!

90
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,530
Don't cause any more trouble!

91
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,870
Yes.

92
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,800
Gosh, you guys look good together!

93
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,030
Hey, call me when you break up with him!

94
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,960
Are you going around lying to people?

95
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,220
I heard you say our son is the top student in his school.

96
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:06,320
- Oh, Joon Hee?  
 - Oh, Joon Hee?

97
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,380
Drink this.

98
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,840
- Isn't this coffee for someone? 
 - It's come to the right person.

99
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,160
Do you know there are rumors about us dating?

100
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,630
Are there people who don't know we're married?

101
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,040
Who would spread such rumors—

102
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,680
- Did Nurse Kim say that? 
 - No.

103
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,600
I did.

104
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,100
What the... Why am I getting fluttery over this?

105
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,380
What is your secret?

106
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,000
You said I can only understand someone if I know their secret.

107
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,190
Theft.

108
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,720
That was my secret.

109
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,130
Can you understand me?

110
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,030
What is your reason?

111
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,000
If you can't just understand it, then leave.

112
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,780
Could someone just understand that?

113
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:35,320
Do you want me to say sorry or something?

114
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,750
 It's menstrual theft. 

115
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,600
A pathological impulse control disorder due to premenstrual syndrome.

116
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,430
   

117
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,790
When I heard that you became a psychiatrist,

118
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,920
I was so happy...

119
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,560
since you were one of the people I wanted to have understand me.

120
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,230
Perhaps...

121
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,370
I thought you may...

122
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,590
know about it.

123
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,640
It's an illness.

124
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,260
And it's treatable.

125
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,300
Have you tried getting treatments?

126
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,220
Yeah.

127
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,800
When I get treatments, it gets better for a bit,

128
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,310
and gets worse like this again.

129
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,750
Right now, I feel comforted...

130
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,680
that I was understood...

131
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,290
by at least just one person.

132
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,430
It is comforting?

133
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,440
Yeah.

134
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,870
It is comforting...

135
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,650
quite a lot.

136
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,520
I can stay at your house for a bit longer. Right?

137
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,170
I don't have a place to go.

138
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,770
Reporters are everywhere outside.

139
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,100
Oh, my house... i-i-it's here.

140
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,560
On your way home tomorrow, buy me some hair treatment.

141
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,650
You're missing that here.

142
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,490
All right...

143
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,680
   

144
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,580
   

145
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,500
Madam Mo!

146
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,810
So Yeon!

147
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,040
Yes?

148
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,500
Could you close the shop for me in my place?

149
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,610
No. Unni, I need to go home early today.

150
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,400
I'm sorry.

151
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,380
- Grandma. 
 - Yeah?

152
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,450
Do you think it would be better if I became more like Go Yoo?

153
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,350
Go Yoo?

154
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,010
Why would you ask such a question? Why?

155
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,170
Does it seem like your grandma likes Go Yoo more?

156
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,250
That's not it.

157
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,260
Our Madam Mo likes us both equally.

158
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,520
You talked just like Go Yoo right now.

159
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,020
You're laughing since I talked like Go Yoo!

160
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,040
Grandma, go on ahead.

161
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,640
I'll be home soon.

162
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,820
- All right. Yeah. 
 - Okay.

163
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,230
Welcome.

164
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,090
So Yeon!

165
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,640
Hey!

166
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,790
So Yeon.

167
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,600
Don't get involved.

168
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,630
You're not going to ask me anything?

169
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,090
I don't know how to explain things even if you asked me.

170
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,140
There are many things in this world you can't explain with words.

171
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,750
Did Go Yoo see it, too?

172
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,910
Yeah.

173
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,610
Joon Hee isn't picking up.

174
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,520
Gosh, where did he go?

175
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,340
What happened?

176
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,790
Where did you go after sending Madam Mo home by herself?

177
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,640
- Oh. I just... 
 - You just what?

178
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,090
You didn't even pick up.

179
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,780
I just went for a walk.

180
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,780
I'm hungry.

181
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,900
He's been saying he's hungry since a while back.

182
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,710
I'll drop by a bookstore. You guys, go ahead.

183
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,340
Okay. Come quickly!

184
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,900
What should we eat? Should we eat toast?

185
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,060
Why is it toast again?

186
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,600
 Did Go Yoo see it, too? 

187
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,290
 Yeah. 

188
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,280
 Is staring at people the only thing you know how to do? 

189
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,500
 Why don't you have money? 

190
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,220
Straighten your shoulders. Okay?

191
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,980
As if we're friends.

192
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,880
With some courage.

193
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,040
- Are you crazy? 
 - Yeah, I'm crazy.

194
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,130
 Theft. That was my secret. 

195
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,060
 Can you understand me for it? 

196
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,510
How can I understand that?

197
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,630
Are you telling me to eat another one?

198
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,230
- Yeah. Eat. 
 - Why are you so nice these days?

199
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,390
Joon Hee said he would come soon.

200
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,680
He's not here yet.

201
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,530
If you're going to go crazy, do it nicely.

202
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,150
Why isn't he coming?

203
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,460
Hey! This is the last time.

204
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,330
Hey! Isn't biting cheating?

205
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
Come in.

206
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,470
Did you do drugs today?

207
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:28,960

♫  If you ask me why  ♫

209
