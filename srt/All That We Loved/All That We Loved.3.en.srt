Soon Tak, why are you still at the office?

Could...

57
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:55,930
he be dead?

Move your face.

61
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,120
Why won't you tell me, then?

00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:19,019
Well,

63
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,939

taller than you these days.

But...

65
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:27,970

for them to order a CT scan.

What is this?

67
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,279
Why is his abdomen like this when
he was just roughed up by thugs?

68
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,680
I ordered abdomen sonography just in case.

69
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,839
His creatinine level is six.

70
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,680
And as you can see, he has kidney atrophy,

71
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,461
- and its shape is a mess.
- It has seriously progressed.

73
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,529
Is the pain even tolerable?

74
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,336
Why would he tolerate the pain
when he saw how his brother died?

Ma'am,

93
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,129
I'm afraid Jun Hee has
chronic renal failure.

94
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,769
During the early stages,
the symptoms aren't clear.

95
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,040
Also, the kidney only
gradually loses its function.

96
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,910
Even when it operates at 30 percent,

97
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:15,859
the patient wouldn't see any symptoms.

98
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,789
The chances of it being hereditary are low,

99
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,680
so I doubt Jun Hee knew.

100
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,350
No, he was in pain.

101
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:25,449
He's been self-medicating.

102
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,290
Goodness.

103
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,560
We'll have him on dialysis...

104
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:37,800
and wait for a brain-dead patient.

105
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,370
Ma'am.

106
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,680
His situation...

107
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,110
is all-round better than Joon Young's,

108
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,120
so don't worry.

109
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,660
- Is that so?
- So what should we have for lunch?

110
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,459
I was just about to ask that.

Mom, what are you saying?

116
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,939
That we should talk after
he's moved to a room.

117
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,839
Exactly. Why would he need a hospital room?

118
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,169
You, calm down.

119
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:29,840
I knew it.

120
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:32,849
Your body couldn't handle all
the excessive studying you did.

121
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,908
I'm not the only one who studies hard.

122
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:38,049
Darn it! You've lost the right
to make excuses like that.

is quite sick...

128
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:30,971
and will be absent from

129
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,909
Text him some words of encouragement.

130
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,809
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

131

132
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Sure.

133
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,548
Is You off training, or
did he leave school early?

He's off training.

Have a good day, then.

00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,019
- You too.
- Have a good one.

138

Then I'll give him this.

152
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:35,929
Sure.

153
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:39,139

00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,480
You look pale.

171
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,120
I think he has makeup on.

172
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,889
Yes, I applied color lotion.

173
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,619
It elevates your confidence from 80 to 100.

174
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,989
I see your confidence was already at 80.

175
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,429
That reminds me. This...

176
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,229
Here. Han So Yeon asked
that I deliver this to you.

177
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,269
What?

178
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,870
My gym clothes.

179
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,640
I should've received this in person.

180
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,470
What a bummer.

181
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,179
It seemed as though she wanted
to give you them in person too.

182
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,610
Is my So Yeon doing well?

183
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:35,590
Also, she seemed concerned about Jun Hee.

184
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,989
She asked how serious it was...

185
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,189
and hoped to visit you in the hospital.

186
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,029
I even saw a glimpse of tears.

187
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,099
Don't believe his lies.

188
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,700
Han So Yeon isn't one to shed tears.

189
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,898
Who says it's a lie?

190
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:52,970
It's highly possible.

191
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,940
Head back to school.

192
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,416
Why are you skipping class
to visit him at the hospital?

193
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,610
Darn it.

194
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:05,778
He hasn't been in school
since you roughed him up.

195
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:06,779
I see you're right.

196
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,819
But it's not like I kicked him that badly.

197
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Darn.

198
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,789
Unbelievable.

199
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,330
Why is it this quiet, though?

200
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,076
Hold on. What is that pretty
little thing doing here?

201
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,970
Those I'm fond of are all in this class.

202
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,440
You'll die if you drink that.

203
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,808
I'm well aware that it's not
something I should drink.

204
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:33,209
I said it for no reason.

205
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,679
Then why was your mouth watering?

206
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,950
Soju has 20 percent ethanol...

207
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,750
while that has over 70 percent.

208
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:44,518
Make way for Mr. Smarty–pants.

209
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,159
And that should be diluted with water.

210
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,589
Pure ethanol can permeate the membrane...

211
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,689
We can just stick to not drinking it.

212
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,459
Do you know why drunks become dogs?

213
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,199
Ethanol which is CH3CH2OH...

214
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
What the...

215
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,539
Okay, you're impressive.

216
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:01,049
Soon Tak, I'll leave him to you.

217
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,569
- Hey.
- I'd rather die than hear that.

218
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,878
- You!
- I'd never...

219
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,408
Hear me out. Hey.

220
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:07,509
- Wait for me.
- Hey.

221
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,049
That psycho.

222
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:10,549
Unbelievable.

223
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,119
The molecular structure of
alcohol looks like a dog, you see.

224
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,619
You should know why you turn into a dog!

225
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,720
You psycho!

226
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,519
Soon Tak, let's hunt the dog.

227
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,620
Come on!

228
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,249
- Hey.
- Stop following me, darn it.

229
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,590
- Get back here.
- You psycho.

230
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,459
Where are you going? Hear me out some more.

231
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,460
- Come on.
- Forget it.

232
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:55,489
- What's with you?
- Speed up.

233
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,689
- You!
- Ko You!

234
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,558
- Stop following me.
- Hear me out.

235
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,360
- Wait.
- Stop right there.

236
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,928
- Get him.
- You, come on.

237
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:03,570
- Get the dog.
- Let's go.

238
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,269
- Come on.
- Woof!

239
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,549
- Are you tired?
- Yes.

240
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,320
Then, stop being Mr. Smarty-pants.

241
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,049
That can be exhausting, you know.

242
00:16:58,919 --> 00:16:59,960
There.

243
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:03,490
- What is it?
- Your little brother.

244
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,460
You should've gotten two of them.

245
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,239
Why force him to be alone and lonely?

246
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,069
They would've ostracized you, then.

247
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,369
Why you...

248
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,069
He's right.

249
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,140
If there were two of them, they'd
team up and become a couple.

250
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,539
But why is it...

251
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,880
that I don't have a partner of my own?

252
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,279
Dunk.

253
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,089
I gave him that name. It's Dunk.

254
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,190
Hey, Dunk.

255
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:33,619
Why would you name my little brother?

256
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,089
I'm calling it Tackle.

257
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,500
Hey, Tackle.

258
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,269
Tackle.

259
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,650
Dunk.

260
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,619
Answer me, will you?

261
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:09,690
Jun Hee...

262
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:13,359
Jun Hee!

263
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,670
Jun Hee...

264
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:19,700
Someone come here quickly.

265
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,140
Jun Hee!

266
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,750
Ms. Mo, let's grab a bite to eat.

267
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,589
I'm fine. Maybe later.

268
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,720
Ms. Mo, don't worry.

269
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,480
I'm going to donate my kidney for him.

270
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,200
What on earth are you saying?

271
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:50,798
You have no right to oppose.

272
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,719
If I must make the choice
right now, I'll do so.

273
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,339
I choose Jun Hee over you.

274
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:06,848
Dialysis isn't working for Jun
Hee, so he needs a new kidney.

275
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,749
Waiting for a brain-dead
patient will take 7 to 8 years.

276
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,788
It is the case for all other patients.

277
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:13,319
I can't wait, though.
The wait will kill me.

278
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,929
I still can't allow it.

279
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,989
You're an athlete and...

280
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,490
I can live while not being one,

281
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,900
but Jun Hee can't.

282
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:22,528
I won't say more. You can't do it.

283
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,099
You don't need to since it's my body.

284
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,670
It's not that you even raised me.

285
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,139
- Stop being stubborn.
- I'm not.

286
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,545
I thought about this for a long time.

287
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,710
Even if Joon Young were alive,

288
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:36,880
I would still donate.

289
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,050
(Examination Room 1,
Specialist Kang Eun Hye)

290
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,470
(Gopchang Stew, Sundae Soup)

291
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,349
Don't worry and eat up.

292
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,720
Jun Hee and I want nothing from You.

293
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,589
You know that I mean it, right?

294
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,930
Of course.

295
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,559
I can't stand watching the two of them...

296
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:30,400
on the operating table.

297
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,170
Right.

298
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,940
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,619
There's no need...

300
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,630
to feel sorry for You.

301
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,329
Living your life...

302
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,130
is part of what you should show your child.

303
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,680
Thank you...

304
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,539
for raising You.

305
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:19,119
Jun Hee and I probably
wouldn't have survived...

306
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,150
without You.

307
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:24,220
Joon Young died in vain,

308
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,759
and his parents died in an accident.

309
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,529
There was no sound of life...

310
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,170
even when Jun Hee and I were home.

311
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,799
We kept our mouths shut...

312
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:43,109
and did nothing at all.

313
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:51,819
(Year 1996)

314
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,230
I doubted...

315
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,700
he could stay sane...

316
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,970
after losing his parents and brother.

317
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,069
I kept wondering...

318
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,380
if I should follow them with him.

319
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,309
Excuse me.

320
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:28,150
Isn't anyone there?

321
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,890
Excuse me.

322
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:37,759
You're home today.

323
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:39,630
Where did you go?

324
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,700
Is Jun Hee home?

325
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,099
Do you have food too?

326
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,279
Your brother wouldn't be lonely anymore.

327
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:57,349
He said he was afraid of dying,

328
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:02,190
but now that he's with
them, he wouldn't be scared.

329
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,289
Although, it'd be a little sad...

330
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,130
for you.

331
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,440
I was surprised by how thoughtful he was...

332
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,109
for a kid.

333
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,349
Then I was comforted to think...

334
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,220
it could be true for Joon Young.

335
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:42,130
Thank you for the food.

336
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,429
It's good.

337
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,000
- Eat up.
- Okay.

338
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,930
I'm sorry to bother you at night.

339
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,960
He's asleep inside.

340
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,569
Why don't you let him sleep here tonight?

341
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,939
Oh, thank you.

342
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,338
Then I'll come pick him up...

343
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,640
Why don't I...

344
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,569
raise You...

345
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,539
with Jun Hee?

346
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:36,680
Pardon?

347
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:05,279
I felt compacted...

348
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,140
with two moons.

349
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:14,220
Then I felt hot...

350
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,349
with two suns.

351
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,829
The two of them are my energy.

352
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,170
I can't imagine what would've happened...

353
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,869
to me and Jun Hee without You.

354
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:37,509
When he gets cheeky and playful,

355
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,809
it's hard not to smile.

356
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:44,549
He's whimsical, isn't he?

357
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,549
Don't be so disappointed
about what he says.

358
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:51,490
He's immature right now,

359
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,230
but he'll understand his mom at one point.

360
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,299
Then you should take your
child's love with a smile...

361
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,799
without feeling sorry.

362
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,009

(Byeolmi Sundae House)

364
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:33,329
You know it's dangerous
to be a donor, right?

365
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,929
Yes, I looked it up a little.

366
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,569
I read about a case of an athlete donor.

367
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,599
He seemed healthy!

368
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,240
I'll explain the possible side effects.

369
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,078
If you suddenly lose one of your kidneys,

370
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:53,220
you could suffer from
chronic renal failure.

371
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,489
You could have diabetes,
blood pressure issues,

372
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,966
arteriosclerosis, and heart problems.

373
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,059
During the surgery, your pleura,
spleen, or bowels may be damaged.

374
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,230
You're frightening me here.

375
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:06,099
Are you still up for it?

376
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,869
I am.

377
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,269
It's a possibility for me,

378
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,590
but Jun Hee is in that
very situation right now.

379
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,940
Even if you want to donate,

380
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,608
you can't if the suitability turns out low.

381
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:22,910
Then I'll have to give in.

382
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:25,549
You talk back to every word I say.

383
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,319
I won't do it.

384
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,589
Why would I take yours?

385
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,759
Why would you not?

386
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,299
I already tried to stop him.

387
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,240
I can't believe I wasn't
aware of your illness.

388
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:52,380
I kept it from you, so
how would you have known?

389
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:55,509
I know you couldn't possibly
tell me you were sick.

390
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,150
You wouldn't tell anyone about it.

391
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,609
They said they could find
anyone unless they're dead.

392
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,149
He...

393

can't be dead, can he?

How can it come out this high?

408
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,749
Suitability would not be
this high even for brothers.

409
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,750
Exactly.

410

Don't do it. Not a chance.

411

- This makes no sense.
- Thank goodness.
