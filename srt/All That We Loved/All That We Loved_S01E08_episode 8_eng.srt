1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,100
   

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:16,960
  ​

3
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,870
   

4
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,970
     

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
♫  My everything, it grows within me  ♫

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,200
♫  It seems they will last forever always, our youthful days  ♫

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,970
   

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,650
Joon Hee! Joon Hee, what are you doing?

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,740
 Hey, you're an athlete. Break them up! 

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,050
Hey, you guys! Stop it! Stop it!

11
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,780
Wake up! Wake up, Go Joon Hee!

12
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,190
Gosh, stop it! Goodness!

13
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,100
 Break them up! 

14
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,460
What are you guys doing!

15
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,160
Gosh, these guys!

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,810
Go Yoo! Go Joon Hee! Break it up, you two!

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,020
Goodness.

18
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,840
I see. You cannot make it?

19
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,120
Yes, Joon Hee's grandmother has just arrived.

20
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,950
Hello.

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,420
These guys got into a pretty serious fight.

22
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,150
Gosh...

23
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,250
Grandmother, please sit over here.

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,630
Yoo, come here. Come and sit next to Grandma.

25
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,810
He refuses to write a letter of apology

26
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,890
and they shut their mouths up when I asked them why they fought.

27
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,370
So I had no choice but to give you a call.

28
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,860
Joon Hee is my grandson, but Yoo is also my grandson.

29
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,290
You know that, right?

30
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,490
Yes, I know.

31
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:37,740
I will reprimand them properly so these two won't ever fight again.

32
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,810
I'm sorry, Teacher.

33
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:56,240
   

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,990
Yes, please release an article about my retirement.

35
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,120
Without a press conference.

36
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,210
    
 I'm really sorry.

37
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,310
I guess you still like flowers.

38
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,370
It's not that I liked them.

39
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,300
The person I loved liked them.

40
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,380
- Your boss? 
 - Yeah.

41
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,310
You should...

42
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,050
 You should... 

43
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,500
love.

44
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,160
 love. 

45
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,380
   

46
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,900
I'll go home today. I'm a bit tired.

47
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,620
I told you I'd make you something tasty!

48
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,440
Tomorrow. Please make it for me tomorrow.

49
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,540
Let's eat it tomorrow.

50
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,780
I left my flowers with someone. I'll come home after I finish selling them.

51
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,960
Go home first.

52
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,470
Okay.

53
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,480
You should love.

54
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,010
You should love.

55
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,910
No, it's all right.

56
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,460
I see.

57
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,340
You should love.

58
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,640
Even if it's because of cellular memory, I won't excuse you.

59
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,450
Gosh!

60
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,660
Should I just study, too?

61
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,200
 Brother! Where are you? 

62
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,050
 Are you really not going to come out? 

63
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,410
 Brother...  Brother? 

64
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,660
 Brother. 

65
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,160
 Brother! 

66
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,050
 Brother... 

67
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,310
 Brother? 

68
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,160
 Brother? 

69
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,300
Grandma?

70
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,770
Gosh, seriously!

71
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,420
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

72
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,700
Why isn't she picking up?

73
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,150
Joon Hee isn't sick or anything. Right?

74
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,770
He's not even picking up his calls.

75
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,270
   

76
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,000
Go Yoo!

77
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,990
Bring your bag. I've called a taxi for you.

78
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,600
 Yoo, come here. Come and sit next to Grandma. 

79
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,640
 I'll go home today. 

80
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,370
 I told you I'd make you something tasty! 

81
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,180
 Tomorrow. Please make it for me tomorrow. 

82
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,960
 Let's eat it tomorrow. 

83
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,090
   

84
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,250
 I left my flowers with someone. I'll come home after I finish selling them. 

85
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,360
 Go home first. 

86
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,870
 Okay. 

87
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,550
Let's not cry.

88
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,600
I feel like Madam Mo will leave us if we cry.

89
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,460
Yeah.

90
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,320
I won't cry.

91
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,080
What is it?

92
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,180
I'm sorry.

93
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,770
None of that is important right now.

94
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,840
Yeah.

95
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,130
   

96
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,660
The surgery for Grandma just finished.

97
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,500
Did it go well?

98
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,840
There was a brain hemorrhage. Because she was found late,

99
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,450
we'll only know what will happen once she wakes up.

100
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,630
Until Grandma wakes up, we should cheer up and wait for her.

101
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,440
Aren't you guys going to eat?

102
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,530
Guys, you know that you each only have one kidney. Right?

103
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:17,900
If you skip meals like this, something bad could happen to you.

104
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,170
You go ahead and eat.

105
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,050
- You go ahead. 
 - You two should just eat together.

106
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,830
I'll watch over Grandmother.

107
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,810
Geez, these guys...

108
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:52,310
I mean, how did you manage to raise two such frustrating kids?

109
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,770
They've only grown in height. They're still just kids.

110
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,800
Ma'am, you have to wake up. Okay?

111
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,250
Aren't you guys going to sleep?

112
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,790
How can she rest when she feels the pressure of you two?

113
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,990
Gosh, so burdensome! My gosh!

114
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,810
How nice would it be if this was a dream?

115
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,980
The nightmare that you often have...

116
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,760
- I dreamed it, too. 
  - Brother? 

117
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,110
The dream about you and your brother playing hide-and-seek.

118
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,650
Cellular memory is ridiculous.

119
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,250
How can you even have my dreams?

120
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,850
I wish... you won't have them anymore if I have a dream like that.

121
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,240
When Brother comes out in my dream, rather than being scared,

122
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,970
I wonder if he has something to tell me.

123
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,170
That's what I think.

124
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,900
You were closer to my brother than I was. Right?

125
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,130
Because you cried more than I did at his funeral,

126
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,860
everyone thought you were his younger brother.

127
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,400
You must know how I feel a bit now.

128
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,640
How scary the pigeons that randomly appear are.

129
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,730
How I worry about whether this food has peanuts or not—

130
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,970
Wait a second!

131
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,850
Your eyes got better because of me!

132
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,770
What is that thing... Lasik!

133
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,070
You know how expensive that is. Right?

134
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,620
I'm going to sleep.

135
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,640
You'll pretend to go to sleep because I start talking about money?

136
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,010
When you earn money later, pay me back for it all!

137
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,260
Pay me back for it all with interest!

138
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,010
Okay.

139
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,670
I'll pay you back for it all.

140
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,310
Madam Mo, you heard it, too. Right? Go Joon Hee says he will pay it all back.

141
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,890
Let's buy something tasty with that.

142
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,560
You better keep your promise!

143
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,490
You'd better pay me back.

144
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,780
We can't keep this up.

145
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:22,770
You guys don't even wash, eat, or go to school!

146
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,230
It's a waiting game for Grandma.

147
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,270
Take turns caring for Grandma and go to school.

148
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,450
If you don't listen to me, I'll ban you from coming here.

149
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,300
- Okay... 
 - Okay.

150
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:10,610
Teacher, I have something to tell you.

151
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,180
 - Hello.  
 - Hello.

152
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,640
You came to school.

153
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,020
Yeah.

154
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,410
I heard about your grandmother.

155
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,610
I heard from Soon Tak, too.

156
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,550
You're going to drop out of school.

157
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,390
Yeah. Things turned out like that.

158
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,460
I'm also thinking about studying abroad.

159
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,910
It's not like I'm leaving tomorrow.

160
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,480
I was grateful.

161
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,050
Madam Mo.

162
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,850
You're just sleeping right now. Right?

163
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,190
I'm going to assume that. Okay?

164
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,400
Madam Mo, you know about love. Right?

165
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,450
I think you are a master at love, Madam Mo.

166
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,940
How are you so good at loving?

167
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,800
You're so cool.

168
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,100
For me, love was so hard.

169
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,010
But, Madam Mo,

170
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:59,810
loving you, at least... was so easy.

171
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,270
So... thank you.

172
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,580
Thank you so much.

173
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,730
   

174
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,730
Yeah...

175
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,090
Hello?

176
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,540
Joon Hee...

177
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,480
Joon Hee!

178
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,100
Joon Hee...

179
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,140
What do we do...

180
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,980
Joon Hee, sell your house and come live with us.

181
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,070
You can stay with us until you go to college and find your own place... or longer.

182
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,350
Yes...

183
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,840
   

184
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,860
Oh! This necklace...

185
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,930
    
 This necklace is the same one from back then. Right?

186
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,530
Yeah.

187
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,930
I remember it.

188
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,830
It breaks my heart.

189
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,780
Since it seems precious to you, I'll put it down carefully.

190
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,790
Could you make me that coffee, too?

191
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,160
The coffee with the egg yolk...

192
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,880
I heard you were good at making that.

193
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,720
- How do you know about that? 
 - He told me about it.

194
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,550
Your best friend.

195
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,150
Thank you.

196
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,810
Welcome.

197
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:32,110
   

198
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,480
How much is it?

199
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,430
Go Yoo.

200
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,830
I didn't.

201
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,900
It wasn't what you thought just now.

202
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,810
I know. I wasn't looking at you thinking that, either.

203
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,550
I mean it.

204
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,490
Yeah.

205
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,360
Thanks.

206
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:36,360
    
 Gosh. I forgot to buy a hair treatment again!

207
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,200
I bought that last time.

208
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,160
Really? Why didn't I see it?

209
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,990
You should have told me if you had bought it!

210
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,580
You really don't express yourself.

211
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,030
I've wanted to hold it for a long time.

212
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,630
Your hand.

213
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,090
I'm good.

214
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm happy with this.

215
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,560
Mom says she prepared a room for you.

216
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,920
Yeah. I'll move my stuff in next week. 
    

217
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,960
Why does it annoy me to see him study?

218
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,660
Hey, I'm going to bother him so he can't study.

219
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,040
Ahn Soon Tak!

220
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Ahn Soon Tak!

221
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,180
- Why? What is it? What is it? 
 - Geez!

222
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,990
- Who told you to study? 
 - Come on!

223
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,640
- Hey! 
 - Come on!

224
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,770
   

225
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,640
 Haven't you heard from Joon Hee yet? 

226
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,800
 I think Grandma would've given you the necklace if she had left a will. 

227
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,840
 I'm going on a trip. 

228
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,280
 I'm sorry I left without telling you, but I believe you would understand. 

229
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,420
 Take care. 

230
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,450
 I'll be the only one having the nightmare from now on. 

231
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,330
   

232
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,240
He was the one who told me to go to you.

233
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:14,480
He knew about my feelings a bit.

234
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,520
Did you call Soon Tak?

235
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,140
Yeah.

236
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,710
There he is.

237
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,200
Go Yoo.

238
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,250
Go Yoo!

239

282
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:50,750
 When we were 18, we believed in love 

283
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,550
 and had not gotten hurt from love. 

284
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,980
 Our love was not false but pure. 

285
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,440
 We were passionate and had ambitions. 

286
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,520
 We didn't try to use love as a tool to change our future back then. 

287
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,700
 Although it was most beneficial to study a lot, 

288
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,010
   
 we were best at being in love.

 Action! 

294
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,710
   

295
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,740
 So pretty! Okay, ready! 

296
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,610
One second.

297
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,460
You get three days, and I get three days.

298
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,040
Oh, right! I needed to close the door, but I forgot.

299
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,210
Oh, I caught it!

300
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:53,540
Gosh, I hate you.

301
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,380
Physical Impulse Dynamic Disorder?

302
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,950
- Is it me? 
 - Oh, it's me! Sorry.

303
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,570
You're not s—

304
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,360
I'll go again.

305
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,410
Why?

306
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,710
 Ready! 

307
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,330
You should love! I'll sell it ch— Wait a second.

308
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,740
What?

309
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,250
Why are you laughing?

310
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,340
It's so hot!

311
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,020
It was really hot.

312
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,800
How is it? I told you to look! Why aren't you—

313
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,480
   

314
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,740
 Cut! Okay. 

315
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,290
 Great work, everyone!
