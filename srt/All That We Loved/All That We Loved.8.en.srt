- What's going on? - Why are they fighting?

8
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:47,890
Hey, you should stop them.

9
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,189
Guys, stop!

10
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,859
Come to your senses, Ko Jun Hee!

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,729
- Go get the teacher. - Oh, gosh.

- Stop them. - You do it.

00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,760
I see. So you can't come?

20
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,870
Yes, Jun Hee's grandma just arrived.

25
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,310
Ma'am, please have a seat.

26
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,500
You. Come here. Come sit next to me.

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,699
They refuse to write apology letters.

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,310
And neither one will say why they got into a fight.

29
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:18,979
So I had no choice but to call you.

Yes, I do.

33
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,319
I'll teach them a harsh lesson...

34
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,789

Did the surgery go well?

If you guys keep skipping meals like this,

122
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,759
bad things could happen.

123

142
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,980
You said you played hide-and-seek with Joon Young in the dream.

143

Cellular memory is no joke.

You even have the same dream now?

145
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,289
Nightmares like that...

146
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,889
I hope you can stop having them because I took them from you.

147
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,230
I'm not really scared when I see him in my dreams.

148
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:30,370
Rather, I wonder, "Does he want to say something to me?"

149
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,100
I really wonder about that.

150
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,870
You were closer to Joon Young than I was.

151
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,480
At his funeral, you cried way more than I did,

152
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,779
so everyone thought you were his brother.

153
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,990
Now, you must understand how I feel.

154
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,559
These thoughts that pop up in your head. They're scary.

Okay.

I'll be sure to pay you back.

- Let's go. - Gosh.

173
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,679
I'm so sleepy.

174
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:54,990
Gosh, what's with him today?

175
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,339
This is not good.

176
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,200
You haven't showered.

177
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:16,009
You're not eating,

178
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:17,710
and you even missed school!

179
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,910
She'll be here for a while.

180
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,809
You two should take turns to look after her.

181
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,250
And go to school.

182
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,420
Listen to me, or you'll be banned from entering the hospital.

183
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,420
- Okay. - Okay.

184
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,490
Sir,

185
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:05,460
I have something to tell you.

186
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:12,059
- Hello, sir. - Hi, kids.

187
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,400
(Dream instead of drink! Hope instead of smoke!)

188
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,309
- You came to school. - Yes.

189
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:28,309
I heard about your grandma.

190
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:32,680
I heard from Soon Tak too.

191
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,619
You're dropping out of school.

192
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,319
Yes, that's how it ended up.

193
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,289
I'm considering studying abroad too.

194
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,970
I'm not going right away,

195
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:53,670
but thanks for everything.

196
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,220
Ms. Mo.

197
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,750
You're just sleeping now, right?

198
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,220
I'm going to believe that.

199
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,329
Ms. Mo, you know what love is, don't you?

200
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,099
I think you're the ultimate boss...

201
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,799
for knowing what love is.

202
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:30,539
How do you know about love so well?

203
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,039
You're awesome.

204
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,779
For me,

205
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,250
loving someone is so hard.

206
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,160
But Ms. Mo,

207
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,259
loving you...

208
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:54,970
was the easiest thing in the world.

209
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,109
So, I want to thank you.

210
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,609
Thank you so much.

211
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,589
(Ko You)

212
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:04,099
Hey.

213
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,339
Hello?

214
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:13,640
Jun Hee.

215
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:19,519
Jun Hee!

216
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,160
Jun Hee.

217
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,099
What do we do?

218
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,630
Jun Hee. Let's clear this place out. You should come to live with us.

219
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:21,769
You can stay with us until you move out for college.

220
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,210
Or you could stay longer.

221
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,849
Okay.

222
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,750
(Joon Young loves Jun Hee.)

223
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,720
Hey, this necklace...

224
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:44,359
This necklace is the one from back then, right?

225
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:45,900
Yes.

226
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:48,970
I remember.

227
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:53,900
It makes my heart ache.

228
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,710
It seems precious to you. I should be careful.

229
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:07,279
Can you make me a cup of that coffee?

230
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,789
The one with an egg yolk on top.

231
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:11,490
I heard you were good at making that.

232
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:15,160
- How do you know that? - He told me about it.

233
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:16,589
Your best friend.

234
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:21,230
Thank you.

235
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:23,299
Welcome.

236
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:28,000
(Year 2006)

237
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,450
How much is it?

238
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,799
Ko You.

239
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,500
It wasn't me.

240
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,309
I didn't do that just now.

241
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,609
I know. That wasn't why I was looking at you.

242
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:10,779
I mean it.

243
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,920
Okay.

244
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:16,619
Thanks.

245
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,470
(Year 2023)

246
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,299
Gosh, I forgot to buy a hair treatment again.

247
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:34,869
I bought some last time.

248
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:37,470
Really? Why didn't I see it?

249
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,109
You should've told me if you bought some.

250
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,480
You're really terrible at expressing yourself.

251
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:10,009
I've wanted to do this for a while.

252
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,740
I mean, holding your hand.

253
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,319
Good.

254
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,920
I'm good with this now.

255
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:40,970
Mom said she cleaned up your room.

256
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,740
Okay. I'll move my stuff in next week.

257
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,579
Why am I so bothered that he's studying?

258
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,849
Hey, I have to go distract him so he can't study.

259
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:53,880
An Soon Tak!

260
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:01,559
An Soon Tak!

261
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:05,059
- What? What is it? - Hey, why you...

262
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:07,359
- You cannot study. - Hey, give it back!

263
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,400
- Hey, you little... - Stop!

264
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,710
(A month later)

265
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,380
You haven't heard from Jun Hee yet?

266
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,920
If Grandma got to leave her last words,

267
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:06,789
she would've given the necklace to you.

268
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,759
I'm going on a trip.

269
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,460
Sorry for leaving without saying goodbye.

270
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:13,930
But I trust that you'll understand.

271
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,400
Take care of yourself.

272
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,240
From now on, I'll be the only one having that nightmare.

273
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:00,240
(Year 2023)

274
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,150
He was the one who told me to go see you.

275
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:06,849
He knew...

276
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,490
about my feelings.

277
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,289
Did you call Soon Tak?

278
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
Yes.

279
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,700
There he is.

280
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,450
Ko You.

281
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,519
Ko You.

282
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,210
What?

283
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,680
I'm telling you.

284
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:19,049
It's amazing.

285
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,420
Soon Tak! Hurry up.

286
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,420
Okay.

287
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,519
He's always so slow.

288
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,839
Who are you?

289
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:28,990
Much love to you.

290
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:15,869
- What? - Hey, guys.

291
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:21,970
Guys, stop!

292
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,710
- Get it together. - Stop!

293
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,309
Get it together, Ko Jun Hee!

294
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,309
(Operating Center)

295
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,859
At age 18,

296
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,859
we believed in love...

297
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,559
and had never been wounded by love.

298
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,400
We were honest about love.

299
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,740
We were innocent, passionate, and ambitious.

300
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:56,470
We never used love as a tool...

301
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:59,740
or tried to change our future.

302
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,750
We were supposed to spend most of our time studying,

303
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,180
but the thing we were best at...

304
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,950
was love.

305
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,869
(All That We Loved)

306
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:24,869
Action!

(Behind the Scenes)

308
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:28,369
Hey, what was that?

309
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,369
How pretty. Okay, go for it!

310
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,679
- Hold on. - Why?

311
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,039
We'll take three days each.

312
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:36,980
Oh, I forgot to close the door.

313
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,219
Oh, I caught it.

314
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,559
Gosh, I hate you.

315
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,760
"Impulsive dynamic disorder?"

316
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,159
- Was it me? - Oh, it was me.

317
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,030
Sorry.

318
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,030
Right now...

319
00:34:58,369 --> 00:34:59,500
- Relax. - I'll try that again.

320
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,980
- Yes! - All right, ready...

321
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:07,610
- Ready... - Hey!

322
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,909
Much love to you. I'll give you... Sorry, I'll do it again.

323
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,150
What?

324
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:19,019
Why are you laughing?

325
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:21,889
Why are you cracking up?

326
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,059
Hold on. All right.

327
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,400
It's hot!

328
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
We'll try that again.

329
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,969
- We'll do it again. - It was really hot.

330
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,269
What do you think? Hey, look at me. Why aren't you...

331
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:33,940
(Hoping everything we loved would last forever)

332
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,940
Yes.

333
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,610
Cut! Okay!

334
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,269
- That's a wrap! - Good work, everyone!

335
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,579
Well done!
