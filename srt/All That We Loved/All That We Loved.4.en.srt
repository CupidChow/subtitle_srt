00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:43,773
Hey, Letter Addict.

7
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:46,914
Why are you late?

8
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:51,654
I dropped by the hospital. You?

9
00:00:51,813 --> 00:00:53,752
I just got back from off-season training.

10
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,393
Don't you know the return date of
the guy who gave you a new life?

11
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,124
You ungrateful thing.

12
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:01,594
Did you have breakfast?

13
00:01:03,493 --> 00:01:05,593
How many times must I tell you to?

14
00:01:05,594 --> 00:01:07,833
Your body's no longer just yours.

15
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:11,433
I made the huge decision to give
you a fresh, healthy kidney...

16
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:13,604
I ate. I ate lots.

17
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,503
Good. Well done.

18
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,173
Take your time. Okay?

19
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:23,714
There's someone I have to see.

20
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:30,393
Hi.

21
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,464
Long time no see, Ko You.

22
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,502
- Hi, Ko You.
- It's been a while.

23
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:43,573
- How have you been?
- You're back.

24
00:01:43,574 --> 00:01:44,934
- It's Ko You.
- Hey.

25
00:01:57,214 --> 00:01:58,783
- Do it.
- No.

26
00:01:58,884 --> 00:01:59,884
Do it.

27
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,024
- I won't.
- Take it off, darn it.

28
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:04,053
- I won't.
- Why not?

29
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,563
What a loser.

30
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:13,192
Take it off while I'm being nice.

31
00:02:13,193 --> 00:02:15,062
- I won't.
- Why not?

32
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:17,173
What must we do to make you take it off?

33
00:02:17,174 --> 00:02:18,732
You're so stubborn.

34
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:20,803
You got on my nerves since
you transferred here.

35
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:21,844
Exactly.

36
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:26,442
Why refuse when a tweak will
make your uniform prettier?

37
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:28,883
Who says that's a prettier look?

38
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,684
The public does.

39
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:33,853
What do you say, girls?

40
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,683
She'll look killer.

41
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:38,692
She'll look totally awesome.

42
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,692
See? The majority wants...

43
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,924
a prettier look so why refuse?

44
00:02:44,793 --> 00:02:47,063
You're not leaving.
We're asking for a favor!

45
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:49,632
Why do I need you to like me?

46
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:52,732
Should I poke your eyes with sewing pins?

47
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,144
- Should I?
- Should I?

48
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,994
Why is the door so stiff?

49
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:26,633
Han So Yeon.

50
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:29,144
It's good to see you.

51
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:43,322
Sim Jung Eun, what are you doing here?

52
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:46,654
We offered to adjust this thin
girl's uniform and she refused.

53
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:49,123
What should I do with you?

54
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:51,894
What should I do with you all?

55
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,704
Let's go. You must've been scared.

56
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:15,054
Hey. Where are you going?

57
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:17,253
We don't give up!

58
00:04:17,254 --> 00:04:18,324
- We don't!
- We don't!

Yes.

65
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:48,453
I knew it, so I made a 3pm appointment.

66
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:52,194
(I knew it, so I made a 3pm appointment.)

67
00:04:55,464 --> 00:04:58,194
What's the name of the 3pm patient?

68
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:00,803
It's Han So Yeon.

69
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:03,064
Thanks.

70
00:05:07,704 --> 00:05:09,004
Let's go for a walk.

71
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,214
Hey, awesome news.

72
00:05:16,814 --> 00:05:19,313
I found soju in the fridge. It's crazy.

Did you alter your uniforms too?

77
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:42,404
They follow you around until you give in.

78
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:47,283
But they have skill. Give
them clothes that need sewing.

79
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:51,853
You smile to yourself too.

80
00:05:52,214 --> 00:05:54,324
If something's funny, laugh out loud.

81
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:56,223
Why are you both like this?

82
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:05,033
Are you okay now?

83
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:09,064
Yes, I'm fine.

84
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:11,433
I'm glad to hear that.

85
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:14,444
Did you make some friends?

86
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:17,844

87

Oh, we have PE today.

88
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:26,214
Do you have a gym uniform?
You can borrow mine.

89
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:28,884
- I washed it with wool shampoo...
- It's an indoor class today.

Oh, is it?

91
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:33,754
I'm jealous.

92
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:40,834
You smile a lot but you don't laugh.

93
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:45,473
Are you like him? Do you not want
to acknowledge cheerful people?

94
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:48,472
I'm not like that.

95
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:51,074
- I'm not like that either.
- Then you're just grumpy.

96
00:07:01,524 --> 00:07:02,884
He's here.

97
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:09,064
They look so happy.

98
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:11,564
- He's jealous.
- Don't.

99
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,064
Darn you.

100
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:18,803
Wait.

101
00:07:19,603 --> 00:07:22,144
What's wrong? I brought two
rice balls to make lots.

102
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:29,144
That's not the issue.

103
00:07:31,254 --> 00:07:32,514
Yours contains brown rice.

104
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:34,824
That's not right.

105
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:38,024
Mom...

106
00:07:40,254 --> 00:07:42,594
How about we make brown
rice makgeolli this time?

107
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:45,334
It's not ideal.

108
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:50,032
- Soon Tak, stay out this time.
- Hi.

109
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:51,593
- Long time no see.

Hello.

111

We'll begin, then.

112
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:13,954
We meet Sunday, 8pm. You can bring...

113
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:16,253
a plus one.

114
00:09:16,353 --> 00:09:17,824
- Okay!
- Okay.

115
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:20,222
Who should I bring?

116
00:09:20,223 --> 00:09:21,263
Gosh.

117
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,034
What should we do? I'm bored.

118
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:34,574
Me.

119
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:37,414
You'll take me, won't you?

120
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:40,044
I have someone I want to bring.

121
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:42,613
You rat.

123
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:49,383
Will you take me?

124
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:52,054
You will, won't you?

125
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:14,784
Then you're just grumpy.

Grandma?

130
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:09,063
Ko You said it's ten, lights out.

131
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:10,804
No electricity for you.

132
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,873
Ko You, that idiot.

133
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:10,964
Ko You, why won't you shoot?

134
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,393
What?

135
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:14,204
Sorry.

136
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:20,204
You're frustrating, you know that?

137
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,803
Get a grip.

138
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:24,243
It's not my condition that's...

139
00:13:30,373 --> 00:13:31,613
What's all this?

140
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:34,513
I messed up the order.

141
00:13:36,513 --> 00:13:37,513
Goodness.

142
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:44,954
Why are you grinning?

143
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:46,623
It's nothing.

144
00:13:49,723 --> 00:13:53,564
Do you know what it's like to
recharge the feeling of yearning?

145
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,034
I feel the same about food.

146
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,503
I keep thinking of stuff I want to eat.

147
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:03,344
Yes, it's something like that.

148
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:06,074
You see the person, but you get recharged.

149
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:09,013
- And you miss them again.
- I know that feeling.

150
00:14:15,353 --> 00:14:16,584
- Drink some water.
- Okay.

151
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:26,763
I've been thinking about
what to do in the future.

152
00:14:28,064 --> 00:14:30,164
Do you know what a personal channel is?

153
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:32,834
You film, edit, and upload your own videos.

154
00:14:34,204 --> 00:14:36,444
- What will you film?
- Me.

155
00:14:36,473 --> 00:14:37,772
- You?
- You?

156
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:38,814
Yes.

157
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:42,683
My mom says I eat in a way
that makes everyone hungry.

158
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:45,153
Just watching me eat makes
her feel full, she says.

159
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,983
So I'll film myself eat and upload that.

160
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:51,653
Are you insane?

161
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:53,324
You can't say that.

162
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:55,622
Be serious when one discusses their dreams.

163
00:14:55,623 --> 00:14:57,963
How can I be serious about nonsense?

164
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,164
Who'd watch that?

165
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,263
What's your IQ?

166
00:15:02,664 --> 00:15:04,934
- I think it's 132.
- You're a quasi-genius.

167
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:07,743
Soon Tak, study hard.

168
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:10,579
With your IQ, you'll get good grades
just by using books as a pillow.

169
00:15:10,603 --> 00:15:12,372
Yes, make him study.

170
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:15,543
Don't use the life I gave for yourself.
Make use of it.

171
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:18,353
- I should just...
- You're so selfish.

172
00:15:23,353 --> 00:15:24,954
Look out for my grandma.

173
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,324
Where are you off to?

174
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:28,063
To the rooftop.

175
00:15:28,064 --> 00:15:29,424
I might just jump.

176
00:15:33,393 --> 00:15:34,603
Jun Hee.

(Three Dollars Per Stem)

178
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:20,013
- Let's go!
- Shall I go first?

179
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:22,784
Hey, stop. Stay where you are.

(Year 2023)

181
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:19,673
Go away. Go!

182
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:23,504
Are you still afraid of pigeons?

183
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:29,213
A psychiatrist who suffers
from ornithophobia.

184
00:17:33,014 --> 00:17:34,113
How funny.

185
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:41,524
It's so nice to be out.

186
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:47,603
I bet you put in alcohol again.

187
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:49,703
No!

188
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:52,903
Come on. It's not like I
drink alcohol every day.

189
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,974
We've met five times,

190
00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:58,574
and you put in alcohol every time.

191
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:00,274
Oh, right.

192
00:18:01,344 --> 00:18:02,344
Did I?

193
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:04,814
I'm nuts.

194
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:41,853
Flowers. Buy flowers. Much love to you.

195

- Would you like some flowers?

198
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:48,922
- Much love to you. Forever love...
- Three dollars a stem!

199
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:50,922
- Much love to you.
- Buy flowers. Much love to you.

200
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,163
I'll give you a discount, okay?

201
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:56,064
What?

202
00:18:57,974 --> 00:18:58,974
Buy flowers.

203
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:00,433
Much love to you.

204
00:19:05,074 --> 00:19:06,074
Where are you going?

205
00:19:06,075 --> 00:19:07,744
Oh, I have a shift.

206
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:09,284
What are you doing here?

207
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:10,984
I'm working too.

208
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:12,584
Thank you.

209
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:13,613
- Hey.
- Yes?

210
00:19:13,614 --> 00:19:14,622
Three dollars.

211
00:19:14,623 --> 00:19:16,883
(Three Dollars Per Stem)

212
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:18,693
You're selling flowers.

213
00:19:19,254 --> 00:19:20,254
Can I get one too?

214
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:22,994
Here, just take one.

215
00:19:24,193 --> 00:19:25,193
Is this your business?

216
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:28,004
No. Our boss is someone else.

217
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:30,103
Then you shouldn't do this.

218
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:32,333
How much is it? I want three stems.

219
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:34,873
Come on. I didn't stop you to sell flowers.
It's nine dollars.

220
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:42,213
By any chance, are you free this Sunday?

221
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,514
Sunday?

222
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,952
(Three Dollars Per Stem)

223
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:47,254
This Sunday? My makgeolli...

224
00:19:47,484 --> 00:19:50,023
My friends and I will hang out that day.
You should come too.

225
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:51,892
Jun Hee and a few others from
school will be there too.

226
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:54,353
Oh, I might have to work that day.

227
00:19:54,863 --> 00:19:55,863
I see.

228
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:57,963
I'll think about it.

229
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,064
Okay.

230
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:05,703
My makgeolli...

231
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:16,084
Much love to you.

232
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:19,484
Yes.

233
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:20,984
Thanks.

234
00:20:21,183 --> 00:20:22,183
I should thank you.

235
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:24,054
- I'm off.
- Bye.

236

(Hara Kids, to the World)

238
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:42,673
No answer?

239
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:47,113
No.

240
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:48,914
I wonder if Han So Yeon
is really coming too.

241
00:20:50,713 --> 00:20:51,784
What?

242
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:54,824
What's going on? I've
never seen this locked.

243
00:20:56,324 --> 00:20:57,683
Are they already inside?

244
00:20:57,953 --> 00:20:59,453
What's wrong? Is it locked?

245
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:07,893
My gosh. Han So Yeon really is here.

246
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:13,534
Oh, no. The security guard is here.

247
00:21:17,004 --> 00:21:18,873
Are the walls very high?

248
00:21:22,484 --> 00:21:23,484
I'm leaving.

249
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:26,452
Come on. How could we climb over the wall?

250
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,054
We'd never do such a thing.

251
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:40,893
You go ahead.

252
00:22:39,254 --> 00:22:40,324
You're good.

253
00:22:41,663 --> 00:22:43,663
All right. It's your turn, Soon Tak.

254
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:55,044
- Where's You?
- He can't come. He's busy.

255
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,044
Then why did you call me?

256
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,405
I can't finish all this by myself.

257
00:23:02,544 --> 00:23:03,713
Have you no friends?

258
00:23:05,913 --> 00:23:07,053
Are you provoking me again?

259
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:08,054
No.

260
00:23:08,324 --> 00:23:09,683
Let's eat. Yes, let's dig in.

261
00:23:12,054 --> 00:23:13,294
All right, let's eat.

262
00:23:23,863 --> 00:23:24,873
Use it.

263
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:28,942
It's hand cream. We have
to wash hands all the time,

264
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:29,943
so your hands are dry.

265
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:32,373
No, you can use it. My hands are soft.

266
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,243
Soft? As if.

267
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:37,943
They look all dry and cracked,
like a steel loofah...

268
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:44,923
Come on. Try it.

269
00:23:46,554 --> 00:23:47,554
Here.

270
00:23:49,224 --> 00:23:50,564
Darn you.

271
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:54,094
Hey, why are you putting
hand cream on my face?

272
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,064
Sorry, I'm sorry.

273
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:58,804
Gosh, seriously!

274
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:02,744
Doctor...

275
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,613
Oh, my. This is huge.

276
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:11,953
- Nurse Kim.
- I didn't see anything.

277
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:14,212
- Good luck.
- No.

278
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:15,560
- Don't get the wrong idea.
- Good luck!

279
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:16,584
No, wait!

280
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:17,683
I'm rooting for you!

281
00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:18,794
Nurse Kim!

282
00:24:22,324 --> 00:24:23,363
Darn you...

283
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:25,663
Oh, it's very nice.

284
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:28,193
Your skin is already glowing.

285
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,334
You look pretty.

286
00:24:30,963 --> 00:24:32,074
You little...

287
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:35,673
We'll have so much fun.

288
00:24:37,673 --> 00:24:39,613
Is he going to take a shower today?

289
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:41,044
Of course, he is.

290
00:24:42,284 --> 00:24:43,284
Let's go.

291
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:44,613
Come on. Hurry.

292
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:47,314
- Oh, you guys are here.
- Hi.

293
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:48,382
Hi!

294
00:24:48,383 --> 00:24:49,783
- Come on in.
- Hurry up, guys.

295
00:24:49,784 --> 00:24:50,852
- Oh, my.
- Come on, quick.

296
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:52,653
It'll be fun. Let's sit here.

297
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:00,162
- Finally, everyone's here.
- Let's get started.

298
00:25:00,163 --> 00:25:01,933
- Gosh.
- Let's do this.

299
00:25:02,963 --> 00:25:04,563
- Oh.
- I can't wait.

300
00:25:04,564 --> 00:25:05,574
Are we starting now?

301
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,073
- Oh, my.
- Come on. Hurry!

302
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:11,074
- My gosh.
- Nice!

303
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:12,074
- Hurry.
- My gosh.

304
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,112
Come on. Hurry.

305
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:14,574
- I can smell it.
- This is so cool.

306
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:16,083
Is this how it's supposed to smell?

307
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:17,084
Oh, my.

308
00:25:17,084 --> 00:25:18,804
- Look at that.
- I can't wait to taste it.

309
00:25:38,264 --> 00:25:40,203
It looks delicious.

310
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,373
- What happened?
- Silly you.

311
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:45,143
Look at that.

312
00:26:01,963 --> 00:26:02,963
Me?

313
00:26:03,264 --> 00:26:04,423
Okay! Yes.

314
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:06,633
Okay.

- Who did you come with?

323

My boyfriend.

00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:26,943
"'Is there anything else you'd
like to say to your children?'"

335
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,882
"With a smile on his
face, the Lord said..."

336
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:31,983
Do you want to get some air?

337
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,514
"'Remember my presence.'"

338
00:27:35,383 --> 00:27:37,953
"'Always and everywhere.'"

339
00:27:43,794 --> 00:27:45,393
Is school fun for you?

340
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:48,264
Is it fun for you?

341
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:52,933
No, it's not fun. Right. School's no fun.

342
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:55,603
But today, I'm having fun.

343
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,213
What's your zodiac sign?

344
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:06,024
Most people ask for your blood type.

345
00:28:07,484 --> 00:28:10,623
Blood is not something I believe in.
I'd rather believe in the universe.

346
00:28:24,064 --> 00:28:26,144
The sky is pitch-black
today, without a single star.

347
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:30,774
I'm a Cancer. You?

348
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:32,974
I'm a Leo.

349
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:40,284
I don't believe your zodiac sign or
blood type reveals much about you.

350
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,153
The secrets that the person has.

351
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:46,944
That's what you need to understand
to really get to know the person.

352
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:49,963
What's your secret?

353
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,564
I knew you wouldn't tell me.

354
00:28:57,004 --> 00:28:58,764
I guess you'll tell me
once we become close.

355
00:29:01,004 --> 00:29:04,304
They say secrets are too hot
to be held in your heart.

356
00:29:05,074 --> 00:29:07,173
You have to share them with someone.

357
00:29:08,274 --> 00:29:11,514
So just come to me if you have
no one to share them with.

358
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:13,913
They'll become my secrets.

359
00:29:28,064 --> 00:29:30,462
You! The security guard is here!

360
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:32,433
That fool. Why is he calling my name?

361
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:34,233
- Wait up!
- Let's go.

362
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:35,544
- Run!
- Hey, what's with you?

363
00:29:36,373 --> 00:29:37,973
- Gosh.
- Come on, quick!

364
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:39,973
- What is going on?
- Gosh, what should we do?

365
00:29:39,974 --> 00:29:42,083
- Hurry!
- The security guard is here.

366
00:29:42,084 --> 00:29:44,413
- Get out of here, guys.
- You punks! Stop!

367
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:46,153
- Quick!
- Hey, come on!

368
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:47,554
Let's go.

369
00:29:48,784 --> 00:29:50,383
- Are you all right? Come on.
- Okay.

370
00:29:52,353 --> 00:29:54,123
You punks! Stop right there.

371
00:29:54,824 --> 00:29:55,824
This way.

372
00:29:55,825 --> 00:29:57,393
I can't believe this.

373
00:29:57,794 --> 00:29:59,063
Come on. Quick!

374
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:00,594
Hey! You little...

375
00:30:04,264 --> 00:30:07,003
Hey! Get back here. Come here, you jerk.

376
00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:08,202
- Hang in there.
- Okay.

377
00:30:08,203 --> 00:30:09,402
Hey, let's go this way.

378
00:30:09,403 --> 00:30:10,403
- This way?
- Yes.

379
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:18,412
Hey, wait up!

380
00:30:18,413 --> 00:30:20,182
- Hey.
- Hurry up!

381
00:30:20,183 --> 00:30:21,612
Hey, come on!

382
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,584
- Come on.
- What about the makgeolli though?

383
00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:20,814
Are you okay now?

384
00:31:22,643 --> 00:31:24,183
Yes, I'm fine.

385
00:31:25,314 --> 00:31:26,383
I'm glad to hear that.

386
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,064
So Yeon.

387
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:21,974
