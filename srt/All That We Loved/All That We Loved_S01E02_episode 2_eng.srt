10
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,510
Brother! Brother!

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,200
♫  You are there  ♫

12

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,570
Huh?

21
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,810
Brother?

22
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,890
What's going on?

23
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,610
Joon Hee.

24
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,820
Sorry.

25
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,410
I mistook you for someone I know.

26
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,020
I see.

27
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,590
This is cool.

28
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,660
Do you live near here?

29
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,070
- Why? 
 - It's neat how we met coincidentally like this...

30
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,200
You think the weirdest things to be neat...

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,210
Did I do something wrong?

32
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:13,650
   

33
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,570
Would he have read all of these books? There are so many...

34
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,040
    
 You also received a lot of awards.

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,500
   

36
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,030
New Intellectual Award?

37
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,700
You're quite avant-garde.

38
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,110
You know that I'm an actress, right?

39
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,840
Yeah.

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,400
- Come over this way. 
 - Wait. How many do you have?

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,580
One, two, three, four, five!

42
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,880
I think you got more awards than I have!

43
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,140
This is just for interior decoration, right?

44
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,020
Drip? Mix?

45
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,950
Just drink it.

46
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,650
Do you have soju?

47
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,420
Shall we add a bit of soju to this?

48
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,550
Come on, coffee liquor! Don't you know?

49
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,500
- I don't drink alcohol. 
 - I see...

50
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,640
You're glad to see me, right?

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,440
Should I say, I'm glad to see you... I mean, I'm just...

52
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,380
My mind is in disarray.

53
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,720
A psychiatrist says his mind is in disarray.

54
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,660
I thought you would be really happy to see me.

55
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,590
But you're not unhappy to see me, right?

56
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,220
Yeah.

57
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,870
But what's up all of a sudden?

58
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,270
I came to see my friend. What reason would I need?

59
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,200
I just came.

60
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,000
Honestly, I did think twice about coming.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,200
But seeing you makes me think I shouldn't have.

62
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,970
I should have come sooner.

63
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,300
Has it been 16 years since we've seen each other?

64
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,270
- Yeah. 
 - Do you have a girlfriend?

65
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,630
I will be friendly with you from now,

66
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,070
so it'd be awkward if a girlfriend shows up and starts getting jealous.

67
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,350
If you suddenly say you have a girlfriend and you're getting married soon...

68
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,620
W-Wait a sec. You're not married, right?

69
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,440
No.

70
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,860
But do you get lots of patients at your office?

71
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,410
Should I promote it on my SNS?

72
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,310
 Are there any other rumors about the transfer student? 

73
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,930
    
 Like she's pretty, but she's got a terrible personality?

74
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,330
    
 There weren't any rumors like that.

75
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,290
Oh, I heard she transferred schools often.

76
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,710
- Why? 
 - I don't know.

77
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,900
Hey.

78
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,790
Didn't you attend Yeonga Junior High?

79
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,200
- No. 
 - Really?

80
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,370
Oh, I transferred too,

81
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,220
but I saw how you transferred schools a week later.

82
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,220
Come on, it is you, Han So Yeon.

83
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,390
If you're so sure, why did you ask to confirm it?

84
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,740
I mean, I was just happy to see you.

85
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,110
I told you I never attended Yeonga Junior High.

86
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,420
Could you leave now?

87
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,710
Oh, okay. Sorry.

88
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,140
 Hi. 

89
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,000
- Should I change the music? 
 - No.

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,550
- Joon Hee, you must be so happy to do something consistently. 
 -  What are you talking about?

91
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,490
You study when you're bored. You study when you're in a good mood.

92
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,920
You study when you're annoyed. And you study when you're stressed.

93
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,060
Do you want to drink alcohol?

94
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,690
Yeah!

95
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,650
Forget it.

96
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,710
The pyramids were built while they drank beer,

97
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,850
and the Duomo was built while drinking wine.

98
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,340
So I want to study while drinking beer!

99
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,270
I am somewhat getting thirsty, I suppose.

100
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,760
Should we go to Gopchang Alley?

101
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,750
They shut down after they were cracked down.

102
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,200
Gosh.

103
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,920
All of our heavens have closed!

104
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,480
They've all closed.

105
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,310
We can go there!

106
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,100
Follow me.

107
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,900
   

108
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,590
   

109
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,000
- Enjoy the food. 
 - Thank you.

110
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,080
Our informant! Great job!

111
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,970
All right. This is our new heaven.

112
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,190
New heaven!  Why don't you say heaven in English?

113
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,220
You think I don't know what heaven is in English?

114
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,030
Listen carefully.

115
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,320
New Heav—. Happy?

116
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,930
Guys, let's hurry up and drink! Cheers, cheers, cheers.

117
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,060
Hello, boss.

118
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,160
What brings you here?

119
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,720
There were lots of incidents, so we were doing a round.

120
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,620
Do you have any issues?

121
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,690
Nothing at all?

122
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,560
Please give us a call here if anything comes up.

123
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,520
Give us a call right away.

124
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,230
   

125
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,690
    
 Hurry up.

126
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,100
    
 Run!

127
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,530
Gosh!

128
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,560
- Gosh. 
 - Why, why!

129
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,770
My beer!

130
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,450
What is it? Did you lose something?

131
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,910
My watch.

132
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,160
I think it fell here.

133
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,020
What is it?

134
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,100
Let's go.

135
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,420
Let's go.

136
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,350
   

137
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,200
- Ma'am. 
 - Yes?

138
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,430
What do we do...

139
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,830
The director's inauguration was canceled today.

140
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,210
The atmosphere is not good right now.

141
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,060
Gosh, really?

142
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,520
Oh, no, on such a good day...

143
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,470
What do we do with all these flowers...

144
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,190
Don't worry. I can sell them all.

145
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,970
Don't worry.

146
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,960
   

147
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,140
Informant, you're sure about this place. Right?

148
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,820
Yeah. I heard that Gyu Jin bought it from here last week.

149
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,900
The owner is old and only checks to see if we have an ID because her eyes are bad.

150
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,160
Ma'am, between the 1,000 won bills, no,

151
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,180
there's a 10,000 won bill stuck between them. Not this one,

152
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,230
but give me four 1,000 won bills in change.

153
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,880
Four, four.

154
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,170
Did you borrow an ID?

155
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,830
Okay.

156
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,090
For soju, you got one, two, three.

157
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,020
And beer, you got one, two, three, four, five, six.

158
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,590
It was 23,600 won.

159
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,740
Oh, okay.

160
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,080
Give me your ID.

161
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,060
Oh, okay.

162
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,050
   

163
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,760
It's fake. Just put them back.

164
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,800
I-It's real, though...

165
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,850
 Okay. 

166
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,800
   

167
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,620
Soon Tak, breathe.

168
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,160
The part-timer here is our age.

169
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,570
She just sells alcohol without asking for ID.

170
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,990
She must be really cool about it.

171
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,770
Is it because she understands how we feel?

172
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,130
It's like watching a beer commercial.

173
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,580
Commercial, my foot.

174
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,110
This place is for sure.

175
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,330
Let's go, gentlemen.

176
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,630
   

177
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,290
What are you doing?

178
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,780
Please ring us up.

179
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,640
Aren't you Go Yoo of Hara High?

180
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,310
And you are Go Joon Hee.

181
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,590
That's right. Could you sell us some beer?

182
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,480
Dad!

183
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,320
How did Han So Yeon manage to buy it?

184
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,000
Is she friends with the convenience store part-timer?

185
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,200
I think she works part-time at a cafe, so when does she take time to study?

186
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,710
She must be really smart.

187
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,520
She works part-time and still is the top student in school.

188
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,890
In any case, she's not my type.

189
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,420
 Come on, it is you, Han So Yeon. 

190
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,590
 If you're so sure, why did you ask to confirm it? 

191
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,760
She's rude.

192
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:04,090
Well, most people like chicken legs. Go Yoo does, too.

193
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:08,680
Then, if we breed a six-legged chicken through genetic modification,

194
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,500
would you eat it?

195
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,470
That would be a monster, not a chicken!

196
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,000
He likes chicken breast, so would you make one with six breasts—

197
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,620
Let's just stop with Soon Tak.

198
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,450
Yeah, okay.

199
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,300
Hey, let's play a game.

200
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,410
 You should love 

201
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,450
- No, thank you. 
 - Oh, okay.

202
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,560
You should love.

203
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,020
I see, okay.

204
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,930
- You should love. 
 - I'm not buying.

205
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,730
Speak in English for the next 20 minutes.

206
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,160
How's that a game? That's punishment!

207
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,000
You said we can each pick a game we like. Why? Aren't you confident?

208
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,160
Me? No problem.

209
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,720
- I can do it.  
 - Whoa!

210
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,970
You're good.

211
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,380
Me, too!

212
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,140
Okay! Start!

213
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,390
   

214
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,280
   

215
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,060
   

216
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,710
   

217
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,970
   

218
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,200
You look book?

219
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,330
Why?

220
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,900
Don't eat it! It's peanut sauce!

221
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,790
- What? 
 - That's peanut sauce!

222
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,470
Peanut!

223
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,890
Sauce?

224
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,100
- This? 
 - Yes!

225
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,110
Yes! This is sauce!

226
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,570
- You eat? 
 - No!

227
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,400
Hey!

228
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,420
Hey, that's a sauce that contains peanuts!

229
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,850
Go Joon Hee lost.

230
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,040
What did you say?

231
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,750
Peanuts?

232
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,980
   

233
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,020
Gosh! It's peanuts. It's peanuts...

234
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,090
What do we do!

235
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,210
- Oh, no! 
 - Where's my medicine?

236
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,120
- Gosh, seriously... 
 - Oh, no! Oh, no!

237
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,060
- I left one last time. 
 - Oh, no! No!

238
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,200
Gosh...

239
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,500
You can't find it? Where is it?

240
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,200
You should leave it where it's clearly visible.

241
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,090
- Oh, oh, no! 
 - Who cares about the game? You couldn't just say it?

242
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,810
What do we do!

243
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,080
- You couldn't even understand "peanut"?  
 - If you just said "peanut," I'd get it.

244
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,210
You spoke way too much and fast—

245
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,350
Should I call 911? 911?

246
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,730
 Eyes turning yellow doesn't always mean hepatitis. 

247
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,050
 No, it's not. 

248
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,490
Yeah.

249
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,480
What? The poop is black?

250
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,680
They didn't eat anything like blueberries?

251
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,930
Wait...

252
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,000
I'll call you back.

253
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,980
Gosh...

254
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,520
What are you looking at?

255
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,670
Go home and take a look at the kid.

256
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,960
Aren't you even worried about how the kid is doing?

257
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,550
Why don't you go and take a look instead?

258
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,180
I didn't see it.

259
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,410
I blocked it before her.

260
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,320
You should pay housing fees to the hospital.

261
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,630
Gosh, seriously!

262
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,090
- What about Soon Tak? 
 - He just left.

263
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,010
Are you okay?

264
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,180
Yeah, I get better fast when I take medicine.

265
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,620
Hey, we really grew up a lot.

266
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,680
So cute...

267
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,010
- Who was? 
 - I was.

268
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,070
   

269
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,470
 Are you Go Joon Hee? 

270
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,170
 - I'm not. 
 - What do you mean you're not? 

271
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,970
 It's you, right? 

272
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:49,360
   

273
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,430
 Quickly! 

274
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,450
 Go Joon Hee! 

275
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,130
 My younger brother, Go Joon Hee! I missed you. 

276
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,080
   

277
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,440
   

278
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,000
   

279
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,950
 You should love. 

280
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,430
 You should love. 

281
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,890
 Thank you. 

282
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,310
Gosh.

283
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,230
- What about Yoo? 
 - He went home a little bit ago.

284
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,770
- What about dinner? 
 - I ate with the guys.

285
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,500
What about you, Grandma?

286
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,840
You're a bit red.

287
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,440
Oh, I guess because I walked a bit.

288
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,020
Grandma, give that to me.

289
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,130
 - Hello. 
 - Oh, hey. 

290
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,660
 Hello. 

291
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,680
Joon Hee.

292
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,180
Whoa!

293
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,440
It appears Madam Mo wasn't very successful with her business.

294
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,910
Oh, flowers! Set it up prettily.

295
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,850
The flowers are already pretty. Why tell us to set it up prettily?

296
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,470
You think I'm your friend, punk?

297
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,300
Hey, come in!

298
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,490
Here.

299
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,210
What's this?

300
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,640
Gosh, they're withered.

301
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,550
Give them some attention, and they'll come alive.

302
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,780
- Just like people. 
 - Did you bring it?

303
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,680
Okay, geez. No need to show off.

304
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,250
Hey.

305
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,940
Joon Hee.

306
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,170
You look good with your glasses.

307
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,710
Okay.

308
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,810
Did you always wear glasses?

309
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,850
   

310
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,050
I'm back dressed prettily!

311
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,880
Surprise!

312
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,260
Look!

313
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,740
Coffee Liquor.

314
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,650
I'll drink by myself.

315
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,370
The employee benefits are great!

316
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,490
They even have a coffee machine.

317
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,860
I was about to erase my makeup after the shoot,

318
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,440
but then I suddenly thought of you.

319
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,620
I was a bit mad that you weren't happy to see me then.

320
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,400
So, I thought I would show up next time dressed up really prettily and surprise you.

321
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,130
So, how do I look?

322
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,180
I'm pretty today, right?

323
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,730
Yeah.

324
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,400
I have to fish for compliments...

325
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,530
All right. Add soju...

326
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,570
up to here.

327
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,040
Finished!

328
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,600
- Would you like a cup? 
 - No.

329
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,700
All right, don't drink it then.

330
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,020
Yeah, that's good.

331
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:03,400
But... how did you end up living so boringly?

332
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,800
Me?

333
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,520
I'm having fun right now.

334
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,940
It's fun?

335
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,880
Yeah.

336
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,670
It looks really boring...

337
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,010
Do you...

338
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,610
by chance, have presbyopia?

339
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,250
I mean... your glasses...

340
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,360
What's with the glasses?

341
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,570
    
 - Do I have to explain what glasses are?

342
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,470
No, I thought you put on a disguise to avoid me.

343
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,800
That's funny.

344
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,330
Hey, should we leave this guy and take him instead?

345
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,030
Never mind.

346
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,370
This guy seems to have more money than him.

347
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,990
- Beggar bastard. 
 - I'll see you next time.

348
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,960
Hey, tell him go away.

349
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,480
Go away!

350
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,320
"Go away!"

351
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Go away!

352
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,610
Geez!

353
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,480
The next class is P.E.

354
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,640
I know. I just forgot my gym clothes.

355
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,420
Oh, could you tell the teacher for me?

356
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,400
Yeah.

357
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,250
This is mine. Do you want to wear them?

358
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,890
I washed it clean.

359
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,060
What about you?

360
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,330
I have a separate training suit.

361
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,500
Is it too big for you?

362
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,700
I'll do it for you. Let me take a look.

363
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,480
Why?

364
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,580
It's nothing.

365
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,580
Thanks.

366
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,670
Yeah.

367
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,330
Where's Go Yoo and Han So Yeon?

368
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,840
Gosh, Go Yoo, that punk is always late!

369
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,940
They're coming over there.

370
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,920
 Whoa. What's this? 

371
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,030
    
 All right, all right! Quiet, quiet.

372
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,410
Why were you late?

373
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,140
Go and take a seat.

374
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,490
Gosh, seriously. I really wanted to avoid basketball class.

375
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:20,290
It's kind of like having Americans in the class and teaching them English.

376
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,030
It would be better for Go Yoo to demonstrate than me, right?

377
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,300
 Yes! 

378
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,450
Don't misunderstand, though.

379
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,500
It's not because I can't dunk.

380
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,320
Go Yoo, show us an example.

381
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,560
Here.

382
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,920
He's good.

383
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,310
Wow, he's so cool.

384
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,140
He's no joke!

385
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,970
So cool!

386
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,840
He's so cool!

387
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,880
All right, all right. Yoo, go around and help the rest of the class.

388
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,580
Teacher! You're trying to cut class again, aren't you?

389
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,450
Joon Hee, try taking a shot.

390
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,990
You need to extend your arm all the way.

391
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,250
Extend your arm all the way.

392
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,340
Focus, focus.

393
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,570
Okay, one more time. One more time.

394
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,570
Watch the ball to the end.

395
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,270
Push it forward.

396
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,900
Go Joon Hee is so bad!

397
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,090
Focus, focus.

398
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,040
- Extend your arm all the way and push— 
 - Watch, just watch!

399
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,050
Okay. Try it.

400
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,600
Geez! Who cares if you're only good at English?

401
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Your athletic abilities are this bad!

402
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,920
This is the last time.

403
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,040
Watch the ball all the way and push forward with your arms.

404
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,490
Watch.

405
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,440
You have to extend your arm all the way.

406
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,730
Focus and think this is the final shot.

407
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,340
Did you see it?

408
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,350
Guys, Go Joon Hee just made a shot!

409
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:30,060
Guys, guys! Go Joon Hee just made a basket!

410
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,170
Hey, did you see it?

411
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,100
What's this!

412
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,870
- You did well, and eat one. 
 - How was it?

413
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,210
Why are you here like this by yourself?

414
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,200
I'll teach you. Look. Follow after me.

415
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,040
Your left hand is just there for support, and you hold it with your right hand.

416
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,620
Like this. That's right.

417
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,770
And then, try pushing it with your right hand.

418
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,140
You've got potential.

419
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,710
Try it again.

420
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,650
Wow, amazing.

421
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,070
Hey, look at her pants.

422
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,610
Gosh, that's just way too much.

423
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,510
What a joke. Do you want to die?

424
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,280
Gosh!

425
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,330
Did you see it? Did you see how it went through?

426
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,090
You want to try it one more time?

427
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,330
Wow!

428
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:31,480
This is it, So Yeon! This is basketball!

429
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,000
Want to try again? Try it one more time. Amazing.

430
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,690
Hey, you guys, don't call me later.

431
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,880
Damn it.

432
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,850
Hey, I hit you.

433
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,040
So is that bastard coming?

434
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,390
Gosh, hey!

435
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,830
Your friend isn't coming.

436
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,470
What are you looking at?

437
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,310
Don't try to get up.

438
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,370
Just stay on the ground.

439
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,950
You can't go home today anyway.

440
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,720
Gosh!

441
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,250
Damn it.

442
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,950
Lower your eyes, you bastard!

443
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:29,480
The way you look at people is the problem.

444
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,750
Lower your eyes!

445
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,560
You, good for nothing bastard!

446
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,790
Just because you think your friend's got your back!

447
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,530
You are worse than bastards

448
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:49,660
who look down on others, asshole!

449
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:14,930
  ​

450
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,630
   

451
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:29,100
♫  Above my room that is as tall as me  ♫

452
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:39,000
♫  The starlight beautifully fills it up  ♫

453
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:51,900
♫  The countless stars comfort me when I'm tired  ♫

454
00:36:51,900 --> 00:37:01,730
♫  And wipe away the tears that fill me inside  ♫
