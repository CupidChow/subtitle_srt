Hey, Reading Addict!

10
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,560
Why are you late?

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,750
I stopped by the hospital. What about you?

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,730
I came back from training camp.

13
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,090
Don't you know the day your brother, who gifted you new life, is back?

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,270
What an ungrateful bastard. Geez.

15
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,450
Did you eat breakfast?

16
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,560
How many times do I have to say you must eat breakfast?

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,100
Your body is not just your own now!

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,460
After much consideration, I gave you my sacred and healthy kidney—

19
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,460
I ate. A lot.

20
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,970
Yeah. Good job.

21
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,020
Hey. You come at your own pace.

22
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,630
There is someone I want to see.

23
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,720
Hey.

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,320
Hey, Go Yoo! Long time no see!

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,070
Let's hurry up and go.

26
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,360
Hey, Go Yoo! It's been a while!

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,860
Hi, Go Yoo!

28
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,030
Hi!

29
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,030
Wow, it's been so long.

30
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,870
- Do it. 
 - I won't.

31
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,550
- Do it! 
 - I won't!

32
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,210
Damn it, take it off!

33
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,960
- I won't take it off. 
 - Why won't you take it off!

34
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,320
 What a sight. 

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,190
 Hey, take it off while I tell you nicely. 

36
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,060
 - I won't take it off. 
 - Why won't you take it off! 

37
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,160
 Hey! What will make you take it off? 

38
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,620
 You're really stubborn! 

39
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,880
 You were annoying from the moment you came to our school. 

40
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,850
 I know, right? 

41
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,410
It would look prettier if you shortened your skirt just a little bit. Why won't you do it?

42
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,400
By whose standards would it look prettier?

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,840
The standards of the public!

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,970
Girls, what do you think?

45
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,620
It would look so much prettier.

46
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,570
- It would look so much nicer! 
 - You see?

47
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,860
We, the majority, want you to look prettier. So why won't you do it?

48
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,980
Where are you going? We are making a request of you!

49
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,590
Why do I have to conform to your standards?

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,680
Darn it, I should just poke your eyes out!

51
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,960
 We should just poke your eyes out! 

52
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,240

I was trying to shorten this skinny girl's skirt, but she refuses!

60
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,070

 Are you only free at night? 

74
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,230
 Yeah. 

75
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,080
 I knew you'd be like that, so I set up an appointment for 3:00 p.m. 

76
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,210
   

77
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,850

78
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,040
 The appointment is for Ms. Han So Yeon. 

79
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,770
Okay.

80
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,880
 Let's go on a stroll during the day. 

81
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,370
Hey, amazing! I found soju in the refrigerator.

82
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,010
Gosh, maybe one of our nurses is an alcoholic.

83
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,970
Wow...

84
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,820
Right?

85
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,960
   

86
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,820
Did you guys also get your uniforms tailored?

87
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,300
They follow you around until you do.

88
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,860
But they are quite skilled.

89
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,310
If you have anything that needs tailoring, give it to them.

90
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,130
You also have a tendency to hide your laughter.

91
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,860
If it's funny, just laugh out loud!

92
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,080
Why do you both do that?

93
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,820
Are you okay now?

94
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,210
Yeah. I'm okay.

95
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,030
That's a relief.

96
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,210
Did you get closer to our classmates?

97
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,620
Who are you friends with in school?

98
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,760
Right. Oh, we have gym today!

99
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,250
Did you bring your gym clothes? If you didn't, I'll let you borrow mine.

100
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,700
I washed it with a good-smelling detergent—

101
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,480
Today's gym class is theory-based.

102
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,430
Oh, really?

103
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,620
You guys must be happy.

104
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,320
You laugh easily, but you don't know how to laugh out loud.

105
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,320
You're not like him, who doesn't want to acknowledge someone funny. Right?

106
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,420
No, I'm not like that.

107
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,130
- I'm not like that, either. 
 - I guess you just have a lot of anger, then.

108
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,900
He came back to school.

109
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,380
Happy, aren't you?

110
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,900
- Sang Gyu is jealous. 
 - Shit, dude!

111
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,650
Geez!

112
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,490
Wait!

113
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,030
Why? I brought two clumps so I could drink a lot.

114
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,130
That's not a problem,

115
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,610
but there's brown rice mixed with it.

116
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,520
This won't work.

117
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,850
Mom...

118
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,400
How about some brown rice wine this time?

119
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,030
It's a bit ambiguous.

120
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,620
Soon Tak, stay out!

121
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,180
- You're here? 
 - It's been a while.

122
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,350
You're here?

123
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,200
Wow...

124
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,340
All right, we'll start now.

125
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,890
We will meet on Sunday at 7:00 p.m.

126
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,370
Each person can bring one other person with them.

127
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,970
- Okay! Okay! 
 - Okay!

128
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,400
What should we do, guys?

129
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,890
I'm so bored.

130
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,930
Me...

131
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,350
Me!

132
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,840
You will take me with you. Right?

133
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,510
I already have someone I want to take with me.

134
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,190
Really?

135
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,510
Joon Hee!

136
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,310
You will take me with you. Right?

137
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,120
Right? You will take me with you. Right?

138
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,480
 I guess you just have a lot of anger, then. 

139
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,990
   

140
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,220
Yeah, Go Yoo?

141
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,110
Grandma?

142
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,050
Go Yoo says to turn off your lights since it's 10:00 p.m.

143
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,760
He says not to provide you with electricity.

144
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,280
Gosh, Go Yoo!

145
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,400
Go Yoo, why aren't you shooting?

146
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,070
Excuse me?

147
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,780
Oh, it's nothing.

148
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,640
Gosh, you're frustrating me! Wake up!

149
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,100
Hey, Coach, it's not because of my condition...

150
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,420
What is all this?

151
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,460
I put in the wrong order.

152
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,120
Geez...

153
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,250
Why are you smiling?

154
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,160
Oh, no, it's nothing.

155
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:58,780
Have you guys ever felt like your desire to see someone was recharged?

156
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,300
Yeah, it's similar to how I want to eat.

157
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,190
I keep having the desire to eat.

158
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,470
Yeah, it's similar to that!

159
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,200
So, even if I just saw her, I'm filled with the desire to see her again.

160
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,110
Yeah, I know that feeling!

161
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,400
- Drink some water. 
 - Yeah.

162
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,060
I've been thinking about what I should do in the future.

163
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,230
Do you guys know about personal broadcasting channels?

164
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,130
I would film, edit, and post videos by myself.

165
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,460
- What would you film? 
 - Me.

166
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,760
- You? 
 - You?

167
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,120
Yeah.

168
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,550
My mom says I eat so well.

169
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,510
She says just watching me eat makes her feel full.

170
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:54,290
So, I would film myself eating and post it!

171
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,030
Are you crazy?

172
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,020
Come on, don't say that.

173
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,630
Be serious when he's talking about his dream.

174
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,960
I would listen if he's making sense.

175
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,030
Who would watch that?

176
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,720
What's your IQ?

177
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,910
- Probably 132. 
 - You're a semi-genius!

178
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,230
Soon Tak, you should study.

179
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,470
With your brain, you'll be good even if you use books as a pillow.

180
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,370
Yeah, make him study.

181
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,410
Don't live the new life I gave you only for yourself. Make it worthwhile!

182
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,600
I should just!

183
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,250
Geez, that bastard, seriously...

184
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,280
Take care of Grandma.

185
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,570
Where are you going?

186
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,040
To the rooftop to die. I should just fall off and die.

187
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,570
Joon Hee!

188
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,100
Let's go!

189
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,680
Hey, stop right there. Hey, hey, hey!

190
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,370
   

191
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,750
Shoo, shoo!

192
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,520
Go away!

193
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,610
Are you still afraid of pigeons?

194
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,260
A psychiatrist who has ornithophobia...

195
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,960
That's so funny.

196
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,630
Gosh, it's so nice to come outside.

197
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,670
You added alcohol to that again, right?

198
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,020
No!

199
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,290
Goodness, do you think I always drink alcohol?

200
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,990
I have met you five times so far,

201
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,540
and you added alcohol to it all five times.

202
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,680
D-Did I?

203
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,650
I'm so ridiculous.

204
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,030
Buy flowers, buy flowers! Buy flowers! You should love!

205
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,010
- Oh, buy flowers! You should love! 
 - You should love!

206
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,310
You're busy, I see. 
    

207
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,620
- Buy flowers! 
 - Want to buy flowers? You should love.

208
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,920
A flower for 3,000 won!

209
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,860
- You should love. 
 - Buy flowers. You should love.

210
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,940
I'll sell them cheap, please?

211
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,200
Buy flowers! You should love.

212
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,220
- Where are you going? 
 - To my part-time job.

213
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,880
What are you doing here?

214
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,610
Working a part-time job, too.

215
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,250
Thank you! Soon Tak.

216
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,130
- Yeah? 
 - 3,000 won.

217
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,210
It's a part-time job selling flowers.

218
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,340
Can you give me one, too?

219
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,120
Here. You can just have it.

220
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,700
Are you the owner?

221
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,730
No. We have a separate boss.

222
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,440
Then you can't do that.

223
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,330
How much is it? I want to buy three.

224
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,820
Geez, I didn't stop you to sell flowers, but it's 9,000 won.

225
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,440
By chance, do you have time on Sunday?

226
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,050
Sunday—

227
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,360
Sunday... Makgeolli...

228
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,050
I'll hang out with some friends. You should come.

229
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,850
Joon Hee and other school friends will be there, too.

230
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,800
Oh, I might have to work a shift for my part-time job.

231
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,470
I see...

232
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,970
I'll think about it.

233
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,390
Okay.

234
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,710
Makgeolli...

235
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,040
You should love.

236
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,080
Yeah... Thanks.

237
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,480
I'm the thankful one!

238
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,990
- I'll be going. 
 - Bye!

239
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,600
   

240
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,310
He's not picking up?

241
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,050
No.

242
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,690
Is he really coming with Han So Yeon today?

243
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,300
What's this? This has never been locked before...

244
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,880
Did the guys go in already?

245
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,400
Why? Is it locked?

246
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,830
Amazing. Han So Yeon came!

247
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,710
Gosh, there's a security guy.

248
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,800
Are the walls of our school tall?

249
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,430
I'm going to go home.

250
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,970
Gosh, how could we jump the wall? We don't do things like that.

251
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,900
Hurry up and go up!

252
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,250
All right.

253
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,540
You're good!

254
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,530
All right. Next is Soon Tak!

255
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,260
Geez! Gosh!

256
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,060
- What about Go Yoo? 
 - He says he can't come. He's busy.

257
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,310
- Why did you call me over, then? 
 - I can't eat all this by myself.

258
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,750
You don't even have any friends...

259
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,340
- Pick a fight with me again? 
 - No.

260
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,620
Let's eat. Let's eat.

261
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,260
All right, let's eat.

262
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,550
Use this.

263
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,840
It's hand cream. We always scrub so your hands are rough.

264
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,840
Forget it. You use it. My hands are soft.

265
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,000
What do you mean? I can tell your hands are cracked and look like an iron scrubber.

266
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,690
Don't be like that, and try it.

267
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,200
Here, here.

268
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,060
Gosh...

269
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,610
Why the hell are you putting hand cream on my face!

270
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,990
Sorry, sorry.

271
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,300
Gosh!

272
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,200
Doctor—

273
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,390
Goodness... Amazing.

274
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,550
Nurse Kim.

275
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,760
I didn't see anything.

276
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,210
- Fighting. 
 - No, no!

277
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,570
- It's not like that! 
 - Fighting!

278
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,820
- It's not— 
 - I'm rooting for you two!

279
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,630
Nurse Kim!

280
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,300
Darn it...

281
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,670
Wow, this is nice.

282
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,220
Your face already looks so shiny...

283
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,930
You look pretty.

284
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,140
Gosh, dang it.

285
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,540
It's going to be so much fun.

286
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,820
Kim Yong Rae wouldn't recite a poem today. Right?

287
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,640
Why wouldn't he?

288
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,620
Let's go. Let's hurry up and go.

289
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,290
 - Oh, you're here? 
 - Hi! Hurry up! 

290
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,630
 - Come. 
 - Hurry up, hurry up! 

291
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,080
- Wow. 
 - Looks fun. Right?

292
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,590
Come.

293
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,650
 Looks good! 

294
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,400
 Are we starting now? 

295
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,080
 Hurry, hurry, hurry! 

296
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,010
 Hurry up! 

297
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,900
 You smell that? Amazing. 

298
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,630
 - I can't wait! 
 - Gosh... 

299
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,830
That looks so good...

300
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,130
Me?

301
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,280
Okay! Nice!

302
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,430
Okay. Okay!

303
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:22,170
I asked, "What is the most amazing thing about human beings?"

304
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,210
God answered,

305
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:28,720
"How they rush to become an adult saying that their youth is boring,

306
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,980
and then wanting to go back to their youth when they've grown up."

307
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,800
Losing their health in order to earn money,

308
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,040
- And then spending money... 
 - What are you looking at?

309
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,420
- to regain their health. 
 - Who did you come with?

310
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,840
- My boyfriend! 
 - Worrying about the future...

311
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,100
- you had a boyfriend? 
 - and forgetting about the present.

312
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:58,130
So they are neither able to live in the present or the future.

313
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,900
How they live as though they would never die,

314
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:07,670
and then dying meaninglessly as though they'd never really lived."

315
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,390
God took my hand.

316
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,530
Silence overtook us for a moment.

317
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,740
Then I humbly said,

318
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,720
"Thank you for granting me your time.

319
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,930
Is there anything else you would like to tell your children?"

320
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,800
God smiled and said,

321
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,020
Should we step out for a moment?

322
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,360
"That they would remember that I am here.

323
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,980
Always in every way possible."

324
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,260
How is school? Is it fun?

325
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,110
Is school fun for you?

326
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:58,300
It's not fun. Right, how could school be fun?

327
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,520
Today was fun for me.

328
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,200
What is your astrological sign?

329
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,480
Don't people usually ask about blood types?

330
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,670
I don't believe in blood. I would rather believe in the universe.

331
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,810
It's pitch dark tonight without any stars.

332
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,720
I'm a Cancer. What about you?

333
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,830
I'm a Leo.

334
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:45,470
I don't think you can know someone by their blood type or astrological sign.

335
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:51,580
I think you need to understand the person's secrets to truly know someone.

336
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,980
What is your secret?

337
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,970
I knew you wouldn't tell me.

338
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,200
You will probably tell me when we get closer.

339
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:09,050
They say you can't keep secrets in your heart because they are too hot.

340
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,240
They say you have to tell someone for sure.

341
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,700
So, if you don't have anyone to tell, come to me.

342
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,850
I will keep it a secret for you.

343
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,470
Go Yoo, the security guy came!

344
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,080
Geez, why would he yell out my name!

345
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,960
Let's hurry up and go!

346
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,880
Hurry! Hurry!

347
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,160
Oh, no, hurry! Security!

348
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,290
- You guys go first! 
 - Stop right there!

349
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,900
Let's go.

350
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,890
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah...

351
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,530
Let's hurry!

352
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,760
Hey, punks! Stop right there!

353
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,090
This way! This way!

354
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,660
I'm screwed!

355
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,990
Yeah! We're!

356
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,350
Gosh, these guys!

357
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,660
You guys come over here! Come!

358
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,680
- Come over here! 
 - Hold on for a little longer!

359
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,110
- This way, this way. 
 - This way?

360
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,860
Gosh, it's raining...

361
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,150
It's raining!

362
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,870
Hey, you!

363
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,620
Did you guys bring the makgeolli?

364
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,720
 Are you okay now? 

365
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,250
 Yeah, I'm okay. 

366
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,050
 That's a relief. 

367
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:40,850
♫  The starlight beautifully fills it up  ♫

368
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,830
So Yeon.

369
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:56,900
♫  The countless stars comfort me when I'm tired  ♫

370
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:06,910
♫  And wipe away the tears that fill me inside  ♫

371
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:10,860
♫  Although I'm in much pain  ♫

372
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:18,380
♫  You hug me tight, patting my back  ♫

373
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:24,140
♫  And comforting me, saying good night  ♫

374
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,550
   

375
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:34,670
♫  Even when I hurt so much that I can't walk  ♫

376
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:40,160
♫  Even when tears blind me  ♫

377
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:49,450
♫  I want to smile even when I'm in front of the one I love but cannot have  ♫

378
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:57,550
♫  Even if it's temporary, our happy memories  ♫

379
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:03,010
♫  I will keep them in my heart  ♫

380
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:07,130
♫  The countless stars that fill my eyes  ♫
