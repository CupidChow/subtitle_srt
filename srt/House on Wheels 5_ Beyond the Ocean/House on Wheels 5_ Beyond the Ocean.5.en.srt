1
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:32,566
That was a long day.

2
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,837
(After a day in Otaru)

3
00:00:35,237 --> 00:00:37,776
(Current time: 8pm)

4
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:40,347
- Let's sleep, Hee Won.
- Okay.

5
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:45,847
(The members fall asleep a bit earlier than usual.)

6
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:49,786
(A dark night without a single star)

7
00:00:49,787 --> 00:00:56,027
(Current time)

8
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,867
(The house suddenly lights up.)

9
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:02,767
(Na Ra?)

10
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:07,607
(What is she doing at 2 in the morning?)

11
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:09,707
(Scratching her head)

12
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:13,577
(She grabs something.)

13
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:16,317
(Neat)

14
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:19,716
(She folded the bedding and put on a hat?)

15
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:22,217
(TMI: She didn't wash her hair.)

16
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:27,057
(Poking her head out)

17
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:30,927
(Grunting)

18
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:32,327
What?

19
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:35,737
(Hee Won is getting up!)

20
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,467
- Hee Won.
- Yes.

21
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:40,007
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

22
00:01:41,377 --> 00:01:44,977
(Zipping)

23
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:47,877
(As if they all promised, Dong Il got up too.)

24
00:01:48,247 --> 00:01:50,377
Na Ra, why did you get up so early?

25
00:01:50,617 --> 00:01:52,486
- You woke up around 2am.
- Yes.

26
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,017
I know everything.

27
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:57,086
- Were you looking?
- I was.

28
00:01:57,087 --> 00:01:58,557
(Embarrassed)

29
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:00,227
Let's go, Dong Il.

30
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:02,357
(Bumping his head)

31
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:05,696
Okay.

32
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:06,827
(Current time: 4:05am)

33
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,796
We are off.

34
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:09,996
(Where are they headed...)

35
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:14,137
(at this time of day while they're still so sleepy?)

36
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:19,206
(Sapporo)

37
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:20,346
(Yoichi, Otaru, Sapporo)

38
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:23,217
(About 1 hour away from Yoichi, our front yard)

39
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:29,717
(The central city of Hokkaido)

40
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:34,557
(A place where all tourists who come to Hokkaido stop by)

41
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:37,767
(The gate to Hokkaido)

42
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:41,767
(It's famous for the Sapporo Snow Festival, held every winter.)

43
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:45,236
(You can even taste beer named after the city!)

44
00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:48,177
(That's all true, )

45
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:53,147
(but it's too early in the morning for that.)

46
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:58,917
(What are they going to do in Sapporo at this time of day?)

47
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:01,316
(Current time: 5:05am)

48
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:03,857
(Empty)

49
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:06,627
(There are no cars on the roads...)

50
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:11,996
(and no people on the streets.)

51
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:13,627
Good work driving all this way.

52
00:03:14,797 --> 00:03:16,036
We're almost there.

53
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:17,237
(They're almost at their destination.)

54
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:19,166
(But)

55
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:21,607
(Driving by)

56
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:26,206
(We start to see more cars.)

57
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:30,177
(We start to see more cars.)

58
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:33,247
They use interesting carts to transport things here.

59
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,917
- Where?
- Up there.

60
00:03:37,257 --> 00:03:39,287
- Yakult...
- Yakult.

61
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:42,657
(A place where you can see blue Yakult carts driving by)

62
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,566
From 6am to 6:08am?

63
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:48,137
They only hold the auction for exactly eight minutes.

64
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:49,696
- I see.
- Yes.

65
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,437
(An auction?)

66
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:55,837
(What is this mysterious place?)

67
00:03:57,137 --> 00:04:00,947
(The place that opens up the earliest in Sapporo)

68
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:04,747
(Sapporo tuna auction site)

69
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:07,986
(Among the many fish in the Hokkaido ocean, )

70
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:10,387
(the best is tuna!)

71
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:13,387
(Consuming 80 percent of the world's tuna supply, )

72
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,927
(Japan has a special love for tuna.)

73
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:19,867
(Because they consume large amounts at impressive rates, )

74
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:26,437
(top-tier tuna is supplied every day.)

75
00:04:26,907 --> 00:04:29,277
(That's why every morning, )

76
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:34,177
(tuna auctions are held all over Japan.)

77
00:04:34,877 --> 00:04:36,746
(There was even a tuna sold for 3.4 million dollars in 2019.)

78
00:04:36,747 --> 00:04:40,247
It was sold for 3.47 million dollars.

79
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:43,317
(All fish from the three oceans surrounding Hokkaido come here.)

80
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:47,387
(At this Sapporo tuna auction site, )

81
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:50,226
(tourists can come to watch the tuna auction!)

82
00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:52,467
(Focused)

83
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:56,037
We're going there so we can buy...

84
00:04:56,937 --> 00:05:00,067
the tuna sold at the auction and cook it for our guests.

85
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,307
So our guests today will get to eat tuna.

86
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:05,207
High-quality tuna.

87
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:07,546
Okay. Let's go.

88
00:05:07,547 --> 00:05:10,417
(Let's go get some tuna!)

89
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:14,247
(Current time: 5:40am)

90
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,956
I made a reservation in my name.

91
00:05:16,957 --> 00:05:20,427
Apparently, you have to make a reservation to watch the auction.

92
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:24,997
(Anyone can make a reservation to watch the auction!)

93
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:29,697
I'm Sung Dong Il.

94
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,436
- Mr. Sung.
- Yes, Sung.

95
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:32,467
Thank you.

96
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:36,336
(After receiving their entry passes)

97
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,276
- Floor 3?
- Floor 3.

98
00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:39,306
Floor 3.

99
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:41,217
(They head to the auction on the 3rd floor.)

100
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:45,346
So there's a system to let people tour the place.

101
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:46,547
You're right.

102
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:47,817
That's so cool.

103
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:50,316
They told us to follow the blue arrow, right?

104
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,826
- From here, the blue one.
- The blue one.

105
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:52,857
- This one.
- Yes.

106
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:57,626
(Seafood, Produce)

107
00:05:57,627 --> 00:05:59,467
- Right?
- This is so cool.

108
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:02,697
I guess the different colored lines lead to different areas.

109
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:05,807
Do we watch from above?

110
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,937
- I think we watch from above.
- I see.

111
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:10,737
(I see!)

112
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:17,117
We can see everything from here.

113
00:06:18,787 --> 00:06:19,986
I guess we watch from here.

114
00:06:19,987 --> 00:06:21,117
(People are already working busily from dawn.)

115
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:25,287
Early morning markets are always so full of energy.

116
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,296
Everything must be so fresh, right?

117
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:29,297
Yes.

118
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:32,796
I think they have rarer, more expensive things over here.

119
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:34,697
- We're here now.
- I see.

120
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:38,336
The tuna is over there.

121
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:39,567
(The tuna we want to buy is over here!)

122
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:43,337
(The auction hasn't taken place, so they're not open yet.)

123
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,746
(Oh, my!)

124
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:48,677
(What caught Na Ra's eye before the tuna auction?)

125
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:50,576
That's so cool. They drive like this.

126
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,017
(They drive like this!)

127
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:55,517
(With a large load in the back of the car)

128
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:59,686
This car looks small, but it can carry a lot.

129
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:01,026
(The three-wheelers transport goods quickly and efficiently.)

130
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:03,156
- Everything is so organized.
- Yes.

131
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,097
- They're lining them up there.
- Right.

132
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,766
(There are so many goods that they need cars for transport, )

133
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:10,036
(but it's still so organized.)

134
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:14,367
I think there is a very organized system.

135
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,047
(Perfectly lined up!)

136
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:20,307
They’re doing it now.

137
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,887
(In one part of the market, it's already happening.)

138
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:32,227
(Auction of tuna and other seafoods)

139
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:35,057
(A lively atmosphere)

140
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:37,657
(They were enjoying the auction.)

141
00:07:38,897 --> 00:07:39,897
(Surprised!)

142
00:07:39,898 --> 00:07:41,467
What? The tuna is here.

143
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:43,067
Here.

144
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,966
The most expensive...

145
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,406
(They head to the tuna area that became noisy.)

146
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:47,567
- Let's go over there.
- Oh, my.

147
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,007
- The tuna...
- The tuna is here.

148
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:53,206
(The tuna auction began exactly at 6am.)

149
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:54,406
They're so big.

150
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,417
(The tuna are so big.)

151
00:07:57,547 --> 00:08:00,287
(Display stands full of tuna!)

152
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:06,887
(Huge tuna awaits the auction.)

153
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:15,997
(The boxes are almost the size of caskets.)

154
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:19,337
(These are small and cute.)

155
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,807
(Petite and cute)

156
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:29,777
(They display the tail meat to show off the quality.)

157
00:08:30,347 --> 00:08:32,186
(Focused)

158
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:34,387
They probably caught those with fishing poles.

159
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:37,687
Near Sapporo, with fishing poles.

160
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,426
They're not frozen.

161
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:40,827
(Raw tuna that were caught in nearby oceans!)

162
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:43,026
(Right then)

163
00:08:43,027 --> 00:08:45,366
These right there... Here they go.

164
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,797
(The tuna auction finally begins!)

165
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:53,637
(One person announces the start through a speaker.)

166
00:08:56,177 --> 00:08:57,977
(Shouting)

167
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:04,447
That means they're starting.

168
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:07,746
(Shouting)

169
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,757
I think that's to get people excited.

170
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,587
- His voice is so loud.
- It really is.

171
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:17,597
(He almost reached vocal transcendence.)

172
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:20,866
(Auctioneer: Green badges)

173
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:22,296
The auctioneers sell the tuna,

174
00:09:22,297 --> 00:09:24,766
and the wholesalers buy them.

175
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:27,607
(Wholesalers: Numbers on hats)

176
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:29,236
(Shouting)

177
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:32,607
(The auction begins.)

178
00:09:33,577 --> 00:09:36,247
(After checking the tuna, )

179
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,347
(the wholesalers work quickly.)

180
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:44,387
(Who will take this tuna?)

181
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,927
(After careful thought, )

182
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:54,027
(they propose prices for only the auctioneers to see.)

183
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:59,266
They write the prices on paper, on a board, and show them.

184
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:02,107
(How will the auction end?)

185
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:05,177
(Focused)

186
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:22,327
(It goes to bidder 970!)

187
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,727
When it's sold, the assistant standing by...

188
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,636
labels it with a piece of paper.

189
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:30,297
(Labeling it with the bidder and price!)

190
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,336
- It was sold.
- Oh, my.

191
00:10:32,337 --> 00:10:33,737
If they put the paper on it, it means it was sold.

192
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:35,906
This is so cool.

193
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:36,907
(Exciting)

194
00:10:37,577 --> 00:10:39,306
(Round 2 begins with fierce competition!)

195
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:42,217
(The winner of round 1)

196
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:54,856
(I won this time.)

197
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:57,097
(I was so close...)

198
00:10:58,097 --> 00:10:59,967
Look at them making the bids. It looks like they're joking.

199
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:02,867
The three of them remind me...

200
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:04,337
- of Sobangcha.
- Oh, Sobangcha.

201
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:10,136
(Cooling down the heated competition...)

202
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,607
(is Japanese Sobangcha.)

203
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:16,777
(They're tied!)

204
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,917
(What happens when they offer the same price?)

205
00:11:22,017 --> 00:11:24,617
(Rock, paper, scissors)

206
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:27,856
Then he gets it. Isn't that so funny?

207
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:28,857
(Light-hearted)

208
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:30,496
They're all close.

209
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:31,566
(Who won rock, paper, scissors?)

210
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,097
(I won.)

211
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,567
(That's how the tuna gets sold.)

212
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:40,407
- Is he cutting that open?
- Yes, with a knife.

213
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:42,636
- They're removing the bone.
- Oh, my.

214
00:11:42,637 --> 00:11:45,907
They do this every day. They can do it quickly and neatly.

215
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:47,946
(Auction, approximately 10 dollars per 1kg)

216
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:49,416
(Wholesale)

217
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,746
(Restaurant)

218
00:11:50,747 --> 00:11:53,486
(Consumer)

219
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:54,916
(Approximately 176 dollars per 1kg)

220
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:57,657
(After this process, )

221
00:11:58,957 --> 00:12:03,957
(the tuna comes to our tables.)

222
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:06,327
(Dumbstruck)

223
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,397
(The auction ended so fast.)

224
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:12,167
We have to buy the fresh stuff as soon as it's available,

225
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:13,406
so let's go.

226
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:15,107
(Let's go to buy fresh tuna!)

227
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,806
(The auction site here...)

228
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:22,847
(is not open to tourists!)

229
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,316
(Auction site, Market)

230
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:27,487
(The market nearby...)

231
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:32,927
(has high prices because it targets tourists.)

232
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,997
(But between those two places...)

233
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:39,726
(is a morning market...)

234
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:45,567
(that sells the auctioned off fish to vendors.)

235
00:12:46,137 --> 00:12:48,577
(Tourists can also buy fish here!)

236
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:52,707
(They sell at very low, morning auction prices.)

237
00:12:53,377 --> 00:12:54,407
Check your phone.

238
00:12:56,517 --> 00:12:59,817
(How do we go to the morning market?)

239
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:04,457
(They search the location of the morning market.)

240
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:05,827
You're Korean, right?

241
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:10,096
- Oh, yes. Hello.
- Hello.

242
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:11,596
- Hello.
- Are you Korean?

243
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:12,627
Oh, Mr. Sung Dong Il.

244
00:13:12,997 --> 00:13:14,726
- Yes.
- Hello.

245
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,897
(They look at him with suspicion.)

246
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:20,437
(Who are you?)

247
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:23,307
(Wait, look...)

248
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:26,377
(He's wearing a wholesaler hat?)

249
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,646
- Yes.
- Hello.

250
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:29,846
I work here.

251
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:31,317
- I see. Are you Korean?
- Are you Korean?

252
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,216
- You're Korean.
- Hello.

253
00:13:35,217 --> 00:13:37,016
- Hello.
- Why are you here?

254
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:39,226
- Are you an auctioneer?
- Yes.

255
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:40,587
We saw the tuna auction.

256
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:43,497
I'm not in seafood. I'm on the produce side.

257
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:45,526
I don't know much about that.

258
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:46,796
(He seems to work on the produce side.)

259
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:47,827
- So...
- Yes?

260
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:51,067
Did you use to live in Korea? Or were you born here?

261
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,507
I was in Korea...

262
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,007
until I was 26.

263
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:56,607
Why did you come here?

264
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:57,676
(An interrogation?)

265
00:13:57,677 --> 00:13:59,177
Right... Why did I come here?

266
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:01,277
I came to meet a Japanese woman.

267
00:14:01,677 --> 00:14:04,017
You came for love.

268
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,216
Are you still happy together?

269
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:08,017
Yes, we're living happily. We have kids too.

270
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:10,017
It's so nice to meet you.

271
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:14,657
So, we want to buy some tuna.

272
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:16,857
- Where should we go?
- Is it this way?

273
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:19,297
Not a whole tuna. A place where we can buy pieces.

274
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:20,497
You can't...

275
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,397
buy that here. You have to go outside.

276
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:25,337
- Really?
- Can you tell us where?

277
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:28,977
It's hard to explain. Can I take you there?

278
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:30,207
- Together?
- Yes.

279
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:31,976
- Yes.
- Can we walk there?

280
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:33,776
- We can walk there. Let's go.
- Okay.

281
00:14:33,777 --> 00:14:35,247
(Brightening up)

282
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:37,016
(Oh, my.)

283
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:39,487
You've been here for a while.

284
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,116
Where do we go?

285
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:43,586
- They sell tuna in there.
- Here?

286
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:44,657
- Oh, really? I see.
- I see.

287
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:48,356
(This is Sapporo morning market.)

288
00:14:48,357 --> 00:14:51,127
This is a retail market for the fish they buy there.

289
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,837
(Opening hours: 5am to 11am)

290
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:59,267
(There are tourists here!)

291
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:00,766
Tuna.

292
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:04,677
(The auction price is still on the tuna!)

293
00:15:04,877 --> 00:15:08,077
We want steaks for six people...

294
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:10,677
and some pieces for sashimi...

295
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:12,786
enough for six people.

296
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,416
- Sashimi...
- A lot of sashimi.

297
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:16,086
The belly is good for sashimi.

298
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:17,386
- Oh, this part.
- O-toro.

299
00:15:17,387 --> 00:15:18,587
Oh, o-toro. Yes.

300
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,127
(Give us a lot of sashimi.)

301
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,957
(Yes, I'll give you a generous amount.)

302
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,266
(It's time to break apart this tuna.)

303
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:28,326
This is so cool.

304
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,397
(It's time to break apart this tuna.)

305
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:32,436
Did he get this from this morning's auction?

306
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:33,637
(Fresh 30kg tuna)

307
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,177
(Thirty minutes ago at the auction site, )

308
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,206
(the store owner himself won it!)

309
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:42,116
Oh, my. The elasticity is like my skin. It's totally...

310
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:43,177
I'm jealous.

311
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,547
- It must be very expensive.
- Right.

312
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:51,017
(Skilled)

313
00:15:55,657 --> 00:15:58,567
(His knife runs though it with ease.)

314
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:00,826
(I have to record this!)

315
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,497
Yes. Record that.

316
00:16:02,897 --> 00:16:04,696
It's currently 6:40am.

317
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,666
We got here a while ago.

318
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,606
We cut our sleep short to come here early in the morning.

319
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:10,207
We came to the fish market at dawn.

320
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:12,677
- This tuna was caught today.
- Yes.

321
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:14,577
This experienced vendor...

322
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:17,046
is cutting it up for us.

323
00:16:17,047 --> 00:16:19,117
(He's cutting it up for us!)

324
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:20,647
Oh, my.

325
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:25,357
(After easily cutting up the tuna, )

326
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:29,927
(he picks up a large, long sword.)

327
00:16:30,397 --> 00:16:32,067
- That sword...
- Oh, my...

328
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:33,967
- It's basically a sword.
- Basically.

329
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:37,837
(Cutting the tuna with a long sword)

330
00:16:38,737 --> 00:16:42,677
(Cutting straight through the middle)

331
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:46,107
- Steak, right?
- Okay.

332
00:16:46,747 --> 00:16:48,047
- Like this.
- Okay.

333
00:16:49,817 --> 00:16:54,187
(For steak: tuna back loin)

334
00:16:55,817 --> 00:16:59,056
(It's the best part of the tuna back.)

335
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:01,827
(With low fat content, it's perfect for steak!)

336
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:04,427
Steak. Big size.

337
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:06,027
Big size?

338
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:08,027
(Laughing)

339
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:11,537
So...

340
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:13,467
- Number one sushi...
- Okay.

341
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,277
- The tastiest?
- It is.

342
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:20,376
(This part has white fat, unlike the other part.)

343
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:21,446
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

344
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:23,447
This is the part that I like. Come look.

345
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:26,747
Come here, Na Ra. This is the tastiest part of tuna.

346
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:29,416
- Toro.
- Yes, toro.

347
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:30,417
Yes.

348
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,417
(Premium fatty tuna belly is like marbled beef ribeye.)

349
00:17:32,227 --> 00:17:34,386
From this end to that end,

350
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,297
- there's a gradation of fat.
- Yes.

351
00:17:39,897 --> 00:17:42,096
This part right here.

352
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:43,636
(It has an even marbling of fat.)

353
00:17:43,637 --> 00:17:44,897
In tuna,

354
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:47,306
that's the best part.

355
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:49,977
(Melt-in-your-mouth texture)

356
00:17:51,177 --> 00:17:54,607
(It's used in omakase as a top-tier ingredient.)

357
00:17:55,077 --> 00:17:56,147
Oh, my.

358
00:17:57,647 --> 00:18:01,547
(The pink tuna belly is tender and easy to slice.)

359
00:18:02,187 --> 00:18:04,017
Oh, my. I'm salivating.

360
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:09,926
On TV shows... With a spoon...

361
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:12,167
Yes. Number one.

362
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:15,026
(TV show? Number one?)

363
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,836
I've only seen this on Japanese YouTube videos.

364
00:18:17,837 --> 00:18:19,906
- You scrape it off and eat it?
- You scrape it off and eat it.

365
00:18:19,907 --> 00:18:21,107
(You scrape it off and eat it?)

366
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,937
- This?
- Yes.

367
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:25,577
This is the real thing.

368
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:30,647
(Scraping between the bones)

369
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:38,187
(This is the tuna rib.)

370
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:41,126
He's really scraping it off nicely. This is so tasty.

371
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:43,857
(A lean but deep flavor with meat and fat)

372
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:49,437
(A secret treat of tuna sashimi)

373
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:51,836
(I can't believe I'm eating this!)

374
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:52,837
There's a lot.

375
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:57,176
You could make a whole sashimi rice bowl.

376
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,237
You definitely could.

377
00:18:58,607 --> 00:19:00,307
Number one. Thank you.

378
00:19:02,077 --> 00:19:05,116
(In Japan, )

379
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:09,817
(videos about this part are very popular, )

380
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:13,827
(making this a well-loved part.)

381
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:16,597
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

382
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:22,897
(We couldn't have tried this if we didn't come here.)

383
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:26,766
Come here. Let's eat it while it's fresh. Sung Jin.

384
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:27,767
(They already learned each other's names.)

385
00:19:28,307 --> 00:19:29,376
Eat a lot.

386
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,937
(Giving a bite to Sung Jin, who helped them out.)

387
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,506
(Thank you for bringing us here.)

388
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,546
Try some.

389
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:38,216
I suggest this part, the part you said you liked. Try it.

390
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:40,147
You too, Na Ra. Try this part.

391
00:19:41,587 --> 00:19:44,317
Try this part. This is really...

392
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,027
something only VIPs eat...

393
00:19:46,387 --> 00:19:47,757
It's so tender.

394
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:51,227
(It was worth coming here at the crack of dawn!)

395
00:19:51,797 --> 00:19:54,467
- How much does this cost?
- Let's see.

396
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:56,366
It must be quite a lot.

397
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:57,767
(So, how much is the total?)

398
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,907
Oh, it's still... Okay.

399
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:06,006
The total is 16,100 yen.

400
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:07,747
- That'd be 161 dollars.
- Yes.

401
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:10,217
- Isn't that cheap?
- It's really cheap.

402
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:12,087
That's very cheap, right?

403
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,647
I thought he forgot another zero.

404
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,487
That's an absurd price.

405
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:18,057
It took me by surprise.

406
00:20:18,357 --> 00:20:20,787
(Then...)

407
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:22,657
Do you like tuna?

408
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:25,967
- I do.
- You do? Which part of the tuna?

409
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:29,167
- The loin.
- Can we get three portions of it?

410
00:20:30,037 --> 00:20:34,007
I'd like to give 2 of the 3 as a gift as a token of gratitude.

411
00:20:34,637 --> 00:20:36,637
Does your wife like a particular seafood?

412
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,077
My children love this one.

413
00:20:40,977 --> 00:20:43,516
Your children love this?

414
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:46,117
- They love it?
- Yes, his children.

415
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:49,356
This should be wrapped separately from the tuna.

416
00:20:49,357 --> 00:20:51,786
(I'm receiving too much.)

417
00:20:51,787 --> 00:20:54,087
(Thinking hard)

418
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,127
Are you done with your purchase here?

419
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:57,356
Yes, we are.

420
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,197
- We're done here.
- Yes.

421
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,166
Then...

422
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:03,436
(If you don't mind...)

423
00:21:03,437 --> 00:21:06,767
How about we prepare a meal for you at my place?

424
00:21:08,137 --> 00:21:09,137
Really?

425
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:12,846
We were once invited to a Japanese house...

426
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:16,617
for a Japanese meal and wanted to accept the offer,

427
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:19,887
but I heard Japanese people are uncomfortable about inviting others.

428
00:21:20,387 --> 00:21:21,617
That's true.

429
00:21:21,717 --> 00:21:25,487
But in Korea, we invite people to our house to hang out.

430
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:28,356
- There's the issue of privacy.
- Is that the reason?

431
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:29,727
(Worried they'd be a bother)

432
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:33,767
Let me ask my wife first.

433
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:35,866
- And I'll let you know.
- Okay.

434
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:36,867
(That's important since it's early morning.)

435
00:21:36,868 --> 00:21:38,397
- Let me call her.
- Okay.

436
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,436
(Calling his wife)

437
00:21:41,437 --> 00:21:43,206
- This is a killer part.
- It's so tender.

438
00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:44,236
- Right?
- Yes.

439
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:47,376
(Tapping his chopsticks out of nervousness)

440
00:21:47,377 --> 00:21:51,116
Honestly, I thought it'd be...

441
00:21:51,117 --> 00:21:52,387
(He's laughing?)

442
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:54,916
After seeing it being cut, I felt…

443
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:56,487
(He's done with the call.)

444
00:21:56,887 --> 00:21:59,887
- Did you call your wife?
- She's okay with it.

445
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:01,857
Okay.

446
00:22:02,427 --> 00:22:04,296
How about 8am? It'd be in a bit.

447
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:05,297
8am? What time is it right now?

448
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:06,466
- 8am?
- Let us prepare things.

449
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:07,727
- Sure.
- Okay.

450
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,237
Because it was out of the blue, his wife...

451
00:22:10,737 --> 00:22:12,337
needed time to get ready...

452
00:22:12,437 --> 00:22:15,266
and asked us to come later. He's giving us the address.

453
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,337
(Asked to come slowly as it's a sudden invitation)

454
00:22:19,077 --> 00:22:22,847
North and south. Is this how the address works?

455
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:25,177
- The address here is quite funny.
- Yes.

456
00:22:25,617 --> 00:22:26,617
It's easy to understand.

457
00:22:26,817 --> 00:22:27,946
Yes, you're right.

458
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,557
Okay, got it.

459
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:32,357
- We'll see you later.
- See you later.

460
00:22:32,557 --> 00:22:34,156
What if he doesn't pick up our call?

461
00:22:34,157 --> 00:22:36,997
- We have his address.
- Okay.

462
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,497
Isn't it fun, Na Ra?

463
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:40,667
- Yes, it's interesting.
- Experiencing such things.

464
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:43,567
Meeting people unexpectedly.

465
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:48,707
(Passing by the marketplace crowded with tourists)

466
00:22:49,277 --> 00:22:53,307
(Passing through the downtown commercial district)

467
00:22:53,547 --> 00:22:58,447
(Entering the residential area with no shops)

468
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:01,417
- I think we're close.
- Yes, we're here.

469
00:23:03,287 --> 00:23:05,086
(Arrived at the Japanese residential area)

470
00:23:05,087 --> 00:23:06,457
Let's get out.

471
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,827
- Is that the place?
- Is the address on the house?

472
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,367
I'm not sure. Where is...

473
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:15,737
- He's right there.
- Where?

474
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:17,466
(Noticing)

475
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,067
(Happy to see him)

476
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:21,237
We were trying to...

477
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:22,737
Welcome.

478
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,946
- Is it...
- Is this the house?

479
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,376
- Yes.
- What a nice house.

480
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:28,477
(Sung Jin's house)

481
00:23:31,317 --> 00:23:33,787
Living in a two-story house in Japan means you're wealthy, no?

482
00:23:33,887 --> 00:23:36,117
No, you can buy it with a loan.

483
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:37,916
- With a loan?
- Yes.

484
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,527
- Did you buy it with a loan?
- Yes.

485
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,596
These must be by your children.

486
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:44,127
- Cute.
- They played around yesterday.

487
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:47,726
(The yard is full of doodles.)

488
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:50,437
They drew all over the yard. My goodness.

489
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:53,806
Are your two children and your wife in the house?

490
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,807
Shall we go inside?

491
00:23:55,107 --> 00:23:57,237
We will only when you go inside first.

492
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,206
"Shall we go inside?"

493
00:23:59,207 --> 00:24:00,406
(The house owner goes inside first.)

494
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:01,676
- Go ahead first.
- Come in.

495
00:24:01,677 --> 00:24:02,946
(The members enter with excitement.)

496
00:24:02,947 --> 00:24:04,676
What a pretty house.

497
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:07,647
- Hi.
- Hi.

498
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:10,117
Your wife is good at Korean.

499
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:11,257
She's good.

500
00:24:12,657 --> 00:24:13,857
Hello.

501
00:24:15,327 --> 00:24:17,396
(Checking himself out)

502
00:24:17,397 --> 00:24:19,166
- Hi.
- Hi.

503
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,467
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

504
00:24:21,397 --> 00:24:22,397
- Gosh.
- It's a pretty house.

505
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:25,807
I know we were invited out of the blue.

506
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:29,477
We brought some Jeolla Province-style...

507
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:33,046
aged kimchi and perilla leaves from Korea...

508
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:36,047
as a gift that we thought Sung Jin would like.

509
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:37,747
- Thank you.
- Kimchi.

510
00:24:37,847 --> 00:24:39,816
- Thank you.
- Of course.

511
00:24:39,817 --> 00:24:41,247
(Passing it to the Japanese wife)

512
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:42,416
Nice to meet you.

513
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,217
- She's the eldest.
- What's your name?

514
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:45,787
- How cute.
- Your name.

515
00:24:46,227 --> 00:24:47,657
- Anna.
- Hani.

516
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:50,357
Hani. Anna.

517
00:24:51,927 --> 00:24:52,927
Cute.

518
00:24:52,928 --> 00:24:54,467
These are T-shirts.

519
00:24:55,097 --> 00:24:56,837
Wear them without fighting.

520
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:58,237
Thank you.

521
00:24:59,637 --> 00:25:02,477
Your children are so pretty.

522
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:05,947
- No, the wife is...
- It's the mother who's beautiful.

523
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,946
- She's a beauty.
- How lovely.

524
00:25:07,947 --> 00:25:09,076
(The wife dressed up in the morning.)

525
00:25:09,077 --> 00:25:11,716
(Smiling)

526
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:13,487
Let's take a seat.

527
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:14,916
Shall we?

528
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:17,117
(Breakfast made with love)

529
00:25:17,457 --> 00:25:20,456
I've always wanted to try Japanese homemade food.

530
00:25:20,457 --> 00:25:22,927
- This will be my first time.
- I see.

531
00:25:23,227 --> 00:25:24,356
Thank you so much.

532
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,097
(Expressing his appreciation again)

533
00:25:26,227 --> 00:25:28,066
- Where should we sit?
- Over here.

534
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:29,737
- This sofa.
- Okay.

535
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:32,906
Look how neat it is.

536
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:33,967
Let me get you some rice.

537
00:25:35,777 --> 00:25:38,807
Is this what you usually have for breakfast?

538
00:25:39,177 --> 00:25:42,076
Had we known in advance, we would have prepared more.

539
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:44,777
- No, I wanted an authentic meal.
- I see.

540
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,886
(Amazed)

541
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:51,386
(Staring)

542
00:25:51,387 --> 00:25:53,526
These girls are so pretty.

543
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:57,956
Your eyes. They're big.

544
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,697
(You've got really big eyes.)

545
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:01,867
Your eyes are big.

546
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:03,867
Thank you.

547
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:07,766
(Laughing)

548
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,136
- Their mom is a beauty.
- What?

549
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:12,076
- Their mom.
- She's pretty.

550
00:26:12,077 --> 00:26:13,477
There's a reason he lives in Japan.

551
00:26:14,147 --> 00:26:16,376
- A clear reason.
- Yes, a clear reason.

552
00:26:16,377 --> 00:26:19,147
(Feeling shy)

553
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:21,817
- This...
- This.

554
00:26:22,617 --> 00:26:23,657
Thank you.

555
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:25,956
(Salmon roe bought at the morning market)

556
00:26:25,957 --> 00:26:27,156
- For the children.
- Right.

557
00:26:27,157 --> 00:26:28,756
- They bought it for us.
- Cute.

558
00:26:28,757 --> 00:26:30,497
We heard your children loved it.

559
00:26:31,497 --> 00:26:32,927
He bought it for you.

560
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:34,126
Thank you.

561
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:36,566
No problem.

562
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:37,567
(Happy that they like it)

563
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:38,967
- Shall we dig in?
- Yes.

564
00:26:39,537 --> 00:26:42,237
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

565
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,037
How do I... What...

566
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:46,147
Dig in. These are...

567
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:48,576
- Pork and...
- The soup?

568
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:50,576
- Pork and...
- Miso?

569
00:26:50,577 --> 00:26:51,846
- Miso.
- I see.

570
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:53,217
(Japanese pork miso soup)

571
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:56,317
- My rice.
- Yes.

572
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:58,956
(He's a funny guy.)

573
00:26:58,957 --> 00:27:01,627
This right here is potato rice cakes.

574
00:27:02,527 --> 00:27:05,226
It's a common dish in Hokkaido...

575
00:27:05,227 --> 00:27:06,496
since potatoes are a staple.

576
00:27:06,497 --> 00:27:07,597
(Potato rice cakes made with Hokkaido potatoes)

577
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,337
And this right here...

578
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:11,497
It looks unique.

579
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:13,807
- It's fish.
- Is it pickled?

580
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:17,437
Like skate, it's pickled when many are caught in season.

581
00:27:18,277 --> 00:27:20,746
We have it throughout winter.

582
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:22,206
(A traditional Hokkaido winter dish)

583
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,247
Is it commonly... Is this octopus?

584
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:28,517
- Octopus, radish, and cucumbers.
- Cucumbers.

585
00:27:28,987 --> 00:27:30,916
Were octopuses always this cute?

586
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,487
(Octopus salad with radish and cucumber)

587
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:33,586
Thank you for the food.

588
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:35,587
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

589
00:27:35,857 --> 00:27:37,296
Thank you for the food.

590
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:39,366
- That's what you say in Japanese.
- Go ahead.

591
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,667
- I learned it.
- I know.

592
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:44,566
I'm curious. How do you eat soup...

593
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:46,506
when there's no spoon? Teach me.

594
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:48,006
You put your mouth on the bowl.

595
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:49,377
- Mouth on the bowl?
- Yes.

596
00:27:50,177 --> 00:27:53,177
I'm going to try eating it the Japanese way. Like this?

597
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:58,847
- It's good.
- It's delicious.

598
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:03,017
It's really good. I'm serious.

599
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,027
I think it's made with pureed soybeans.

600
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:08,556
Now that you say it...

601
00:28:08,557 --> 00:28:09,597
(Impressed)

602
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:11,156
This is good too.

603
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:13,026
- Thank you.
- What did you say it was?

604
00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:14,797
- That's...
- What does it taste like?

605
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:17,967
- It's pollack roe and konjac.
- Konjac?

606
00:28:18,437 --> 00:28:20,867
Konjac? It's absolutely delicious.

607
00:28:22,337 --> 00:28:24,336
What's Sung Jin's charm?

608
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:25,407
(The love story of a multicultural family)

609
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,607
He's kind.

610
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,247
- He's charming and kind?
- Yes.

611
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:32,016
How did you propose to her?

612
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:35,046
I proposed to her on the phone.

613
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,057
What?

614
00:28:36,787 --> 00:28:40,357
I had to return to Korea because my visa was declined once.

615
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:42,927
Our parents were against us.

616
00:28:43,457 --> 00:28:45,327
Were both of your parents against your relationship?

617
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:48,367
After a while...

618
00:28:49,197 --> 00:28:51,336
I guess I liked her,

619
00:28:51,337 --> 00:28:54,067
so I asked her to marry me over the phone.

620
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,766
(Mom and Dad must be dating.)

621
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,237
I proposed to her.

622
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,547
I told her to come.

623
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:01,977
- To Korea?
- Yes, come to Korea.

624
00:29:02,647 --> 00:29:03,976
But she said, "You come."

625
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:05,617
(You come to Japan.)

626
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,846
(Fierce)

627
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:07,887
"You come."

628
00:29:08,817 --> 00:29:10,617
That's how I ended up settling in Japan.

629
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,957
It's like something out of a drama.

630
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:19,197
What's the current market price in this area?

631
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:21,366
(A sudden market price question)

632
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:23,866
To buy a house like this, you'd need about 500,000 dollars.

633
00:29:23,867 --> 00:29:25,737
- A house this big right now?
- Yes.

634
00:29:26,937 --> 00:29:29,237
Did you take out a 300,000 dollar loan?

635
00:29:30,107 --> 00:29:31,376
No, I took out a 500,000 dollar loan.

636
00:29:31,377 --> 00:29:32,377
- A full loan?
- Yes.

637
00:29:33,507 --> 00:29:35,377
We bought it without a single penny.

638
00:29:35,477 --> 00:29:36,817
It's possible in Japan.

639
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:38,177
How much do you pay each month?

640
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,617
We pay about 1,000 dollars.

641
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:41,187
- About 1000 dollars?
- Yes.

642
00:29:41,287 --> 00:29:43,556
We'll be paying it off for 35 years.

643
00:29:43,557 --> 00:29:44,557
For 35 years?

644
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,426
If we were to rent,

645
00:29:47,427 --> 00:29:49,726
it'd be about 800 to 900 dollars a month.

646
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:51,057
Yes, exactly.

647
00:29:51,797 --> 00:29:54,296
- The house is so pretty.
- Thank you.

648
00:29:54,297 --> 00:29:56,466
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

649
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:59,907
Since we came unplanned,

650
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,006
we couldn't prepare any gifts.

651
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:04,406
Either way, these are for the children.

652
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:05,636
(Generously giving K-pocket money)

653
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,176
Use this to buy toys.

654
00:30:07,177 --> 00:30:08,707
(Generously giving K-pocket money)

655
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,516
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

656
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,577
(Thank you.)

657
00:30:12,987 --> 00:30:14,617
Make sure to grow up healthy.

658
00:30:15,317 --> 00:30:17,456
- Healthy, okay?
- Leave already.

659
00:30:17,457 --> 00:30:19,217
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

660
00:30:19,727 --> 00:30:21,386
(Getting emotional from bittersweet feelings)

661
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:23,757
Good. Stay healthy, okay?

662
00:30:25,227 --> 00:30:29,266
I feel like I'm leaving my younger brother...

663
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:31,237
after visiting him in Japan right now.

664
00:30:32,937 --> 00:30:34,937
You've gotten quite close in such a short time.

665
00:30:36,207 --> 00:30:37,337
We'll see you again.

666
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,747
- Call me.
- I will.

667
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:42,677
- Bye.
- Bye.

668
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:44,447
Bye.

669
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:46,786
- I have mixed feelings.
- We're off.

670
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:48,846
This is why we shouldn't let people treat us.

671
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,716
I feel weird because we owe them.

672
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:52,787
Head inside.

673
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:55,027
How strange.

674
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:57,026
- Go inside now.
- Bye.

675
00:30:57,027 --> 00:30:58,596
(Go inside now!)

676
00:30:58,597 --> 00:30:59,726
- Please go inside.
- Okay.

677
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:00,766
- Visit us again.
- Okay.

678
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:02,126
He's on the verge of tears.

679
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:03,966
(Sung Jin)

680
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:06,836
(Bye!)

681
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:08,037
The girl is so cute.

682
00:31:10,507 --> 00:31:13,647
- The whole family is full of love.
- Right?

683
00:31:14,177 --> 00:31:15,376
We shouldn't have let them treat us.

684
00:31:15,377 --> 00:31:17,417
I'm getting emotional.

685
00:31:18,747 --> 00:31:20,786
(With our new family members)

686
00:31:20,787 --> 00:31:21,947
What a nice experience.

687
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:26,087
This trip isn't bad. It has its own charms.

688
00:31:27,627 --> 00:31:28,657
It's nice.

689
00:31:28,927 --> 00:31:32,557
(Leaving behind a long-lasting friendship)

690
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:37,097
Are we going to the airport from here?

691
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:39,936
- No, the campsite.
- No.

692
00:31:39,937 --> 00:31:41,966
- We're heading to the campsite.
- Are they coming on their own?

693
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,477
Yes, from the airport.

694
00:31:43,577 --> 00:31:47,147
(Someone is coming to the campsite?)

695
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:51,077
To think they'd come right away...

696
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:52,786
- after being invited.
- Right?

697
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:54,386
(Na Ra invited today's guests!)

698
00:31:54,387 --> 00:31:55,387
Really.

699
00:31:56,187 --> 00:31:57,487
We need to treat them well.

700
00:31:57,987 --> 00:32:00,556
Shouldn't we prepare a heartwarming feast?

701
00:32:00,557 --> 00:32:01,826
We definitely should.

702
00:32:01,827 --> 00:32:04,896
What we got today is already heartwarming.

703
00:32:04,897 --> 00:32:06,296
- Yes.
- Of course.

704
00:32:06,297 --> 00:32:08,467
- We got fresh tuna.
- We went there early this morning.

705
00:32:08,697 --> 00:32:10,466
- We barely got any sleep.
- We lost sleep.

706
00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:11,997
Does this make any sense?

707
00:32:12,437 --> 00:32:13,507
I know, right?

708
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:16,407
- Let's treat them the best we can.
- Yes, the best.

709
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,337
It's definitely cooler here.

710
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:22,106
- It's refreshing.
- You're right.

711
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,817
- It's cool outside.
- Right?

712
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:25,617
What was it again?

713
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:30,586
Inviting us must've put a lot of pressure on her.

714
00:32:30,587 --> 00:32:31,887
Why? What did she say?

715
00:32:32,157 --> 00:32:34,127
"Are you on your way?"

716
00:32:34,727 --> 00:32:36,397
"The weather is such and such."

717
00:32:37,097 --> 00:32:38,926
She's such a warm-hearted person.

718
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:40,097
(Na Ra took great care of the guests.)

719
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:43,196
She should be sending that to her husband.

720
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:45,467
- Husband?
- Because I'm her ex-husband?

721
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:48,436
I guess our memories weren't beautiful.

722
00:32:48,437 --> 00:32:50,807
(Na Ra's ex-husband?)

723
00:32:51,077 --> 00:32:53,407
(Today's guests are...)

724
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:57,716
(Ji Seung Hyun and Kim Jun Han.)

725
00:32:57,717 --> 00:33:00,786
(Ji Seung Hyun and Kim Jun Han, Na Ra's "Good Partner")

726
00:33:00,787 --> 00:33:04,217
(Hey, Jjanggu. Didn't you get hit?)

727
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,257
I did, right here.

728
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:09,997
(Taking care of his juniors in "Wish")

729
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:14,627
(The righteous high schooler Seung Hyun...)

730
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:19,136
(Goryeo...)

731
00:33:19,137 --> 00:33:21,937
(will forever remember us!)

732
00:33:22,307 --> 00:33:24,137
(Respect)

733
00:33:24,677 --> 00:33:29,446
(He turned over a new leaf and saved the country.)

734
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:30,746
I texted you.

735
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:32,076
(But he abandoned his family again?)

736
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,117
(He was brought up wrong.)

737
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:37,917
(The birth of the nation's adulterer in "Good Partner")

738
00:33:38,257 --> 00:33:41,027
(Actor Ji Seung Hyun, the immersion magnet)

739
00:33:42,427 --> 00:33:45,627
(In the drama "Hospital Playlist,")

740
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:48,366
(the ever-so-friendly Dr. Ahn Chi Hong...)

741
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:49,797
(Feeling proud)

742
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,837
(I actually have feelings for you.)

743
00:33:54,437 --> 00:33:55,636
For quite a while now.

744
00:33:55,637 --> 00:33:57,077
(Surprised)

745
00:33:57,737 --> 00:34:00,777
(He had an ardent crush on Dr. Chae Song Hwa.)

746
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:06,487
(But then, he switched his crush to Na Ra in a flash.)

747
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:09,147
(Heart fluttering)

748
00:34:09,787 --> 00:34:12,257
(Actor Kim Jun Han, the lovely crush master)

749
00:34:12,557 --> 00:34:15,957
(Despite their busy schedules, they joined "House on Wheels.")

750
00:34:16,357 --> 00:34:20,597
(Welcome, Na Ra's "Good Partner.")

751
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:25,667
(Our House will be more lively today.)

752
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:29,136
- We should go to Don Quijote.
- Yes?

753
00:34:29,137 --> 00:34:33,206
As you know, Na Ra likes sweet snacks.

754
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:34,776
- She sure does.
- Right?

755
00:34:34,777 --> 00:34:36,947
How about we get some gummies...

756
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:39,886
- and snacks...
- I'm in.

757
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:41,546
To share with everyone at night?

758
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:45,116
Sure. Aren't there things we could grill over the campfire?

759
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,486
- Of course.
- Like...

760
00:34:46,487 --> 00:34:48,357
- Marshmallows.
- Yes, marshmallows.

761
00:34:48,827 --> 00:34:50,527
Will they be willing to meet us?

762
00:34:51,027 --> 00:34:52,756
(The thought of welcoming the guests...)

763
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,426
(is making the members happy.)

764
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,436
(Sapporo)

765
00:34:56,437 --> 00:34:59,197
(The front yard where everyone will gather...)

766
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:04,977
(If Sapporo and Otaru are the face of Hokkaido's winter, )

767
00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:11,017
(the face of Hokkaido's summer is...)

768
00:35:13,587 --> 00:35:19,017
(Furano and Biei.)

769
00:35:19,927 --> 00:35:24,027
(The dream of those visiting Hokkaido in the summer...)

770
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:29,597
(and the picture-perfect spot chosen by Japanese locals)

771
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:33,767
(Patchwork Road, a mosaic of colors)

772
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:38,436
(Harvested from the fertile land...)

773
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:42,807
(are abundant products.)

774
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:47,547
(And made at the picturesque farm...)

775
00:35:48,117 --> 00:35:51,987
(are rich dairy products.)

776
00:35:52,757 --> 00:35:55,127
(Surrounded by these, )

777
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,127
(how will our front yard look?)

778
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,536
Now that we're here, you end up gazing at the scenery, right?

779
00:36:05,537 --> 00:36:06,607
Yes.

780
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:08,467
Nice.

781
00:36:08,837 --> 00:36:10,736
Wait. Isn't that the campsite?

782
00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:12,777
I think so. Wait, that's...

783
00:36:14,577 --> 00:36:16,846
- How pretty.
- We're here.

784
00:36:16,847 --> 00:36:18,977
- Are we?
- Yes, by the sharp tree.

785
00:36:23,887 --> 00:36:26,357
This place has a vibe, doesn't it?

786
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:30,296
Right? It's small and cute.

787
00:36:30,297 --> 00:36:32,026
- It's giving off a campsite vibe.
- Yes.

788
00:36:32,027 --> 00:36:34,027
- It's like an actual campsite.
- Right?

789
00:36:34,497 --> 00:36:36,067
- We're here.
- Stop.

790
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:37,696
All good.

791
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:40,707
(The breeze traveling between the birch trees)

792
00:36:44,307 --> 00:36:48,547
(Today's peaceful front yard)

793
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:52,047
(Current time: 3pm)

794
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,887
(Cooking as soon as they arrive)

795
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:59,217
(Walking)

796
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:02,157
From behind, she looks like a runaway high schooler.

797
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:06,467
(I'm off to school.)

798
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:10,197
(She has to wash the rice first.)

799
00:37:11,337 --> 00:37:12,937
How much will do?

800
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:17,677
(There are a whopping 2 guests of Na Ra's today.)

801
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:20,677
(Pouring rice)

802
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:25,147
(Will this do?)

803
00:37:26,147 --> 00:37:27,916
(Being prudent)

804
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:29,587
(Realizing)

805
00:37:30,217 --> 00:37:31,357
A bit more.

806
00:37:33,727 --> 00:37:37,057
(Pouring more)

807
00:37:37,657 --> 00:37:40,367
(Let's see.)

808
00:37:40,797 --> 00:37:43,497
(It's not enough yet.)

809
00:37:44,037 --> 00:37:45,196
Is that too much?

810
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:46,507
(Laughing)

811
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:53,207
(After examining carefully...)

812
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:54,747
That should do.

813
00:37:56,277 --> 00:38:01,646
(It's enough for the guests and the members!)

814
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:05,557
(Enough?)

815
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:08,357
- Is it this one? It is, right?
- Yes.

816
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:09,656
Cook.

817
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:10,796
(While letting the abundant rice cook)

818
00:38:10,797 --> 00:38:12,096
(The two who will eat the food)

819
00:38:12,097 --> 00:38:13,966
She likes sweet things, so sweet snacks it is.

820
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:15,997
- It's for Na Ra.
- Okay.

821
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:18,267
- Sweets.
- She loves sweets.

822
00:38:18,637 --> 00:38:20,207
Sweet chocolate.

823
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,767
What will Na Ra like?

824
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:26,337
Will Na Ra like it?

825
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:27,807
I'm sure she will.

826
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:29,677
- This and the end?
- It's...

827
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:32,716
Is this sweet enough?

828
00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:34,217
If it's 72 percent, it's not sweet, is it?

829
00:38:36,387 --> 00:38:38,216
- What about 95?
- It tastes like graphite.

830
00:38:38,217 --> 00:38:39,416
If we buy one...

831
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:40,657
(A taste that'll get them scolded)

832
00:38:41,227 --> 00:38:43,996
(Suddenly, it occurs to them.)

833
00:38:43,997 --> 00:38:45,557
Will the guys like it?

834
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:49,397
What's the use of buying them?

835
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:52,997
- Won't they say, "You have them?" - "You have them."

836
00:38:54,037 --> 00:38:57,306
Sweets have been secured, so let's go meet them.

837
00:38:57,307 --> 00:38:59,137
(As long as Na Ra likes them)

838
00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:00,746
(Current time: 4:42pm)

839
00:39:00,747 --> 00:39:02,846
We're almost done prepping...

840
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:03,917
- inside.
- Okay.

841
00:39:04,417 --> 00:39:07,547
(The guests will soon arrive!)

842
00:39:07,987 --> 00:39:11,117
(Staring at the road)

843
00:39:11,387 --> 00:39:12,757
They're here. Isn't that the car?

844
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:15,457
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

845
00:39:15,557 --> 00:39:17,056
I think it's that white car.

846
00:39:17,057 --> 00:39:18,596
- Which one?
- The one at the entrance.

847
00:39:18,597 --> 00:39:20,927
(One car is parked at the entrance.)

848
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:23,026
(Got caught spraying mosquito repellent...)

849
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,497
(after pulling over)

850
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:28,007
(Laughing)

851
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:29,836
Did they stop there?

852
00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:32,537
Let's act like we didn't know and be surprised.

853
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:34,307
- Pretend like we've been waiting.
- How about...

854
00:39:34,308 --> 00:39:35,346
we wait for them elsewhere?

855
00:39:35,347 --> 00:39:36,717
Elsewhere? Shall we?

856
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:38,177
If we can.

857
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,016
Na Ra, stop what you're doing and come outside.

858
00:39:41,017 --> 00:39:42,116
Okay.

859
00:39:42,117 --> 00:39:43,147
(And with that...)

860
00:39:43,987 --> 00:39:45,416
- Sit, Na Ra.
- Okay.

861
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:46,957
Act like we're hanging out.

862
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:49,556
- Where are they coming from?
- The left.

863
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:51,156
- Left?
- Don't stare at them.

864
00:39:51,157 --> 00:39:54,197
But trying hard not to look at them...

865
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:55,896
makes it more awkward.

866
00:39:55,897 --> 00:39:58,467
Let's pretend that we've been waiting for them.

867
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:00,567
Like for two hours.

868
00:40:00,907 --> 00:40:02,437
- Good, look at your phone.
- Yes.

869
00:40:02,537 --> 00:40:04,977
Let's pretend that we've been waiting for them.

870
00:40:06,177 --> 00:40:08,446
- Where are you going, Hee Won?
- I'm going to the restroom.

871
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,947
What if they get here before you come back?

872
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:12,377
- It's okay. Tell them I'm gone.
- Can't you hold it?

873
00:40:13,347 --> 00:40:16,247
(A very natural setting)

874
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:19,317
- That pretty house... I'm nervous.
- I'm nervous.

875
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:22,187
I think it's that pretty house.

876
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:24,457
As I go in,

877
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:27,497
I thought about saying "How are you doing?"

878
00:40:28,197 --> 00:40:30,136
It was an idea that I had.

879
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:31,137
(They also prepared a surprise.)

880
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,537
If I say, "How are you doing?"

881
00:40:35,237 --> 00:40:37,137
she would say, "Don't do things like that."

882
00:40:37,637 --> 00:40:40,477
(Na Ra's response is predictable.)

883
00:40:40,977 --> 00:40:42,907
(Unlike what they expect)

884
00:40:43,177 --> 00:40:45,577
(They're invisible.)

885
00:40:47,317 --> 00:40:48,817
(Turning away)

886
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:52,357
(They're sincere about those things more than anyone.)

887
00:40:52,857 --> 00:40:55,657
They probably can't see me until they get very close.

888
00:40:56,457 --> 00:40:58,397
They're coming. Pretend like you don't see them.

889
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,596
- The two of them are walking over.
- I'm not looking that way.

890
00:41:00,597 --> 00:41:01,627
I know.

891
00:41:02,097 --> 00:41:04,466
- Hee Won, your neck looks stiff.
- What's wrong?

892
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:06,266
(You look so natural.)

893
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:07,666
Gosh, this side is more comfortable.

894
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:10,007
(He also selects the perfect seat.)

895
00:41:10,707 --> 00:41:15,147
(His outstanding performance gives them the chills.)

896
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:17,117
Is that Na Ra? No, right?

897
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:20,317
- Is she there?
- In the middle...

898
00:41:20,887 --> 00:41:22,546
I think it's Na Ra in the middle.

899
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:23,617
- Is she there?
- Yes.

900
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:26,887
I'll pretend like I fell asleep while waiting.

901
00:41:27,557 --> 00:41:28,986
Should I look at my phone?

902
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,196
Just fall asleep. Don't worry about it.

903
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:35,997
(They're strict about keeping their character.)

904
00:41:36,397 --> 00:41:37,996
(They're the same.)

905
00:41:37,997 --> 00:41:38,997
Hide.

906
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:40,837
(Hide until the end.)

907
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:43,266
(Perfectly concealed, the two of them get very close.)

908
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,407
I'll say it once you give me a sign.

909
00:41:45,977 --> 00:41:48,007
This is...

910
00:41:48,477 --> 00:41:49,507
Na Ra.

911
00:41:50,517 --> 00:41:52,347
- Are you doing well?
- Are you doing well?

912
00:41:53,487 --> 00:41:55,346
- Jun Han!
- Hello, Dong Il.

913
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:57,217
It must have been so hard for you.

914
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:59,516
Can you take a peek and see how close they got?

915
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,687
Na Ra.

916
00:42:01,757 --> 00:42:03,557
(Did someone call me?)

917
00:42:05,127 --> 00:42:07,697
(Crashing)

918
00:42:08,127 --> 00:42:11,266
(Acting passionately)

919
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,707
- Hey.
- Have you been well?

920
00:42:14,307 --> 00:42:16,437
(Suddenly feeling embarrassed)

921
00:42:16,707 --> 00:42:18,236
(My goodness)

922
00:42:18,237 --> 00:42:21,076
- Have you been well?
- My gosh.

923
00:42:21,077 --> 00:42:23,477
- Oh, my.
- Wasn't that amazing?

924
00:42:23,777 --> 00:42:24,846
It's been a long time.

925
00:42:24,847 --> 00:42:26,947
- Nice to meet you.
- I'll take it for you.

926
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:28,986
- Hello, Hee Won.
- Hello.

927
00:42:28,987 --> 00:42:31,186
- Hello.
- You traveled far to get here.

928
00:42:31,187 --> 00:42:32,286
Do you see my goosebumps?

929
00:42:32,287 --> 00:42:34,686
- It must've been hard for them.
- Goodness.

930
00:42:34,687 --> 00:42:37,096
- Gosh, it's a lot.
- Actually...

931
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:40,267
- Why don't you say hello to me?
- Hello, Hee Won.

932
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:43,026
- Hello. Thank you so much.
- Hello, I'm Kim Jun Han.

933
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,496
- The pleasure is mine.
- Seriously.

934
00:42:44,497 --> 00:42:45,967
- Thank you for inviting us.
- You traveled far.

935
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,266
(Both of you have come a long way.)

936
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:50,277
- My goodness.
- You came a long way.

937
00:42:50,377 --> 00:42:51,436
I didn't get a chance to call you.

938
00:42:51,437 --> 00:42:52,937
Wait, we don't have any chairs.

939
00:42:53,777 --> 00:42:56,306
- I'll bring you chairs. Sit down.
- The chairs are in the back.

940
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,016
- Have a seat here first.
- Okay.

941
00:42:58,017 --> 00:42:59,947
(Awkward)

942
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:01,487
I don't mind standing.

943
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:05,717
- I'll take it.
- No, guests should just relax.

944
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:07,857
Gosh, you guys...

945
00:43:08,157 --> 00:43:10,526
- We know each other, but...
- Yes.

946
00:43:10,527 --> 00:43:12,926
- Seung Hyun, sit next to Na Ra.
- Okay.

947
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:14,297
- Sit comfortably.
- Make yourself at home.

948
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:20,736
(She's already snooping around the presents.)

949
00:43:20,737 --> 00:43:23,307
(Exclaiming)

950
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:25,407
I bought some snacks for you.

951
00:43:26,007 --> 00:43:27,077
Thank you.

952
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:29,177
Give me your bag.

953
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:30,576
Wait, you...

954
00:43:30,577 --> 00:43:32,676
By the way...

955
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:33,747
(After wandering in confusion, they finally sit down.)

956
00:43:33,787 --> 00:43:35,347
- Yes, Dong Il.
- What is your name?

957
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:37,186
My name is Kim Jun Han.

958
00:43:37,187 --> 00:43:38,857
- Jun Han? It's nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

959
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:40,326
"What's your name?"

960
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,887
(International House on Wheels)

961
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,897
Now that we're abroad, his English improved a lot.

962
00:43:46,497 --> 00:43:48,196
- "What's your name?" - "What's your name?"

963
00:43:48,197 --> 00:43:51,037
In case you want to munch on something, Jun Han...

964
00:43:51,897 --> 00:43:54,907
He said that you might not like them.

965
00:43:55,107 --> 00:43:57,177
It's nothing big.

966
00:43:57,807 --> 00:43:58,837
Did you bring chips?

967
00:43:59,977 --> 00:44:01,247
We bought some snacks.

968
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:03,176
Japanese snacks?

969
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:04,247
- Yes.
- We bought them here.

970
00:44:04,377 --> 00:44:06,017
I'm tired of Japanese snacks.

971
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:11,086
- That's what I thought.
- Yes, but we couldn't help it.

972
00:44:11,087 --> 00:44:12,156
Brownie.

973
00:44:12,157 --> 00:44:13,387
(I'm not tired of them.)

974
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:15,686
(Holding jelly in one hand)

975
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:17,227
Isn't this so cute?

976
00:44:17,797 --> 00:44:19,356
- Is this pudding?
- No.

977
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:21,996
- It's a chocolate snack.
- Is it where you dip the snack?

978
00:44:21,997 --> 00:44:25,037
- It's so cute.
- Right, so we bought five of them.

979
00:44:25,237 --> 00:44:26,536
We can have one each.

980
00:44:26,537 --> 00:44:28,037
(They bought exactly what Na Ra loves.)

981
00:44:28,637 --> 00:44:30,736
(She's happy to arrange the snacks.)

982
00:44:30,737 --> 00:44:33,777
When was the last time you ate? Aren't you hungry?

983
00:44:33,977 --> 00:44:35,747
We had lunch on the plane.

984
00:44:36,577 --> 00:44:38,476
- You ate on the plane?
- Yes.

985
00:44:38,477 --> 00:44:40,386
- In-flight meal?
- Did you get meals on the plane?

986
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:42,817
- They took an early morning plane.
- It was at 11am.

987
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:47,827
(She tries to open a bag of jelly quietly.)

988
00:44:48,157 --> 00:44:49,426
So that's what we did.

989
00:44:49,427 --> 00:44:50,456
(No one noticed her.)

990
00:44:50,457 --> 00:44:52,827
To greet you, we woke up at...

991
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:56,527
(Using her front tooth skills)

992
00:44:56,767 --> 00:45:00,097
To greet you, we woke up at 3am.

993
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:02,307
I'm serious.

994
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:03,606
- At 3am...
- Why?

995
00:45:03,607 --> 00:45:06,507
- I have a video to prove it.
- Show them the proof.

996
00:45:06,777 --> 00:45:09,146
I asked Na Ra to film it to show it to you.

997
00:45:09,147 --> 00:45:11,916
- Let's eat these as desserts.
- For you...

998
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:12,946
Okay.

999
00:45:12,947 --> 00:45:14,117
We went to an auction.

1000
00:45:14,187 --> 00:45:17,417
(Packing)

1001
00:45:17,617 --> 00:45:19,686
- Take a look at the screen.
- This was the auction.

1002
00:45:19,687 --> 00:45:21,086
- Enlarge the screen.
- A seafood market.

1003
00:45:21,087 --> 00:45:22,357
(Rustling)

1004
00:45:23,527 --> 00:45:25,657
- Show them how it was cut.
- Watch.

1005
00:45:26,397 --> 00:45:29,366
(Please leave at least one...)

1006
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:30,597
This is the auction.

1007
00:45:30,997 --> 00:45:32,436
- What's this?
- It's tuna.

1008
00:45:32,437 --> 00:45:33,496
- It's tuna.
- Is it this big?

1009
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:36,366
Take a look at the tuna. We filmed it.

1010
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:37,877
(Glancing)

1011
00:45:38,337 --> 00:45:41,807
(Hee Won picked up everything without leaving a thing.)

1012
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:45,247
("Eat snacks after your meal" by Dad Hee Won)

1013
00:45:45,717 --> 00:45:47,847
- It was this morning.
- At 3am?

1014
00:45:48,047 --> 00:45:49,446
So we could buy it.

1015
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:50,486
(Glancing)

1016
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:51,656
(Disheartened)

1017
00:45:51,657 --> 00:45:54,357
- Thank you.
- This is what Hee Won said.

1018
00:45:54,657 --> 00:45:57,626
- You must like Na Ra a lot.
- Right.

1019
00:45:57,627 --> 00:45:59,227
You were willing to come this far.

1020
00:46:01,127 --> 00:46:02,926
(Thankful)

1021
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:06,537
When I said that there will be Dong Il, Hee Won, and Na Ra,

1022
00:46:06,637 --> 00:46:09,407
- they said, "Father, please go." - Who said that?

1023
00:46:10,237 --> 00:46:11,707
- My children.
- How old are they?

1024
00:46:12,037 --> 00:46:13,847
- Your children?
- How old are they?

1025
00:46:13,877 --> 00:46:15,776
How old is the one who said, "Father, please go?"

1026
00:46:15,777 --> 00:46:17,116
She's in seventh grade.

1027
00:46:17,117 --> 00:46:18,117
Yes, that's right.

1028
00:46:18,577 --> 00:46:20,287
Actually, my youngest daughter played...

1029
00:46:21,047 --> 00:46:22,517
the daughter between me and Na Ra...

1030
00:46:23,087 --> 00:46:24,716
- in the photos.
- That's right.

1031
00:46:24,717 --> 00:46:26,756
- Did she appear in the drama?
- Only in the photos.

1032
00:46:26,757 --> 00:46:28,326
In a way, she appeared in the drama.

1033
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,026
- So they feel a sense of closeness.
- Right.

1034
00:46:30,027 --> 00:46:31,027
So she told me...

1035
00:46:31,357 --> 00:46:33,556
- to go and meet her fake mom.
- Fake mom?

1036
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,067
(She told me to go and meet her fake mom.)

1037
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,097
Jun Han, do you have children?

1038
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:41,667
- He...
- Is he married?

1039
00:46:41,837 --> 00:46:42,906
- He...
- Is he married?

1040
00:46:42,907 --> 00:46:45,237
- I don't know yet.
- You don't have any yet.

1041
00:46:45,977 --> 00:46:49,077
(He still responded to the question.)

1042
00:46:49,477 --> 00:46:50,617
You don't have any yet.

1043
00:46:52,247 --> 00:46:53,786
- No.
- Are you married?

1044
00:46:53,787 --> 00:46:55,246
No, I'm not.

1045
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:57,517
I'm not married yet, so I don't know how many children I'll have.

1046
00:46:57,687 --> 00:46:59,317
I'm someone who talks carelessly.

1047
00:47:00,957 --> 00:47:02,026
Don't mind me.

1048
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,086
(I'm someone who answers well.)

1049
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:04,157
I caught it.

1050
00:47:05,457 --> 00:47:08,067
(The two of them click so well.)

1051
00:47:08,527 --> 00:47:10,436
- Shall I make some quickly?
- Come in.

1052
00:47:10,437 --> 00:47:12,037
(Shall I make some coffee quickly?)

1053
00:47:12,237 --> 00:47:13,267
All right.

1054
00:47:13,467 --> 00:47:14,567
- Hee Won, you should get up.
- What?

1055
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:17,676
- Help us.
- But they have to sit down.

1056
00:47:17,677 --> 00:47:18,736
You should get up now.

1057
00:47:18,737 --> 00:47:19,807
(I have to sit down so they can sit.)

1058
00:47:20,177 --> 00:47:22,277
- Hee Won...
- Stay seated.

1059
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,447
(Estimating the amount of water with her face)

1060
00:47:28,117 --> 00:47:29,987
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1061
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:31,416
I'll take them.

1062
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:32,887
(Here's some coffee.)

1063
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:36,527
Cheers. Gosh, this is charming.

1064
00:47:36,927 --> 00:47:38,497
This is my first time camping.

1065
00:47:38,997 --> 00:47:40,197
- Is it your first time?
- Yes.

1066
00:47:40,497 --> 00:47:41,967
So you've never slept in a tent?

1067
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,037
When I was a child,

1068
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:46,437
I went camping with my parents by the stream.

1069
00:47:46,937 --> 00:47:49,767
- So you've done it?
- It's my first time since then.

1070
00:47:50,637 --> 00:47:52,307
Jun Han, how old are you?

1071
00:47:52,377 --> 00:47:55,376
I'm 43 years old.

1072
00:47:55,377 --> 00:47:58,177
- Forty-three?
- You look young for your age.

1073
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,617
I was born early in 1978, so we're similar in age.

1074
00:48:02,317 --> 00:48:04,957
I was born early in 1978, so we're similar in age.

1075
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,016
- Early in 1978?
- What about you, Seung Hyun?

1076
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:09,286
Aren't you ignoring him...

1077
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:10,726
- completely?
- In 1878?

1078
00:48:10,727 --> 00:48:12,427
- He was born in 1878.
- Will you ignore him like that?

1079
00:48:12,697 --> 00:48:15,126
- Aren't you ignoring him?
- In 1878?

1080
00:48:15,127 --> 00:48:16,627
- He was born in 1878.
- Will you ignore him like that?

1081
00:48:16,867 --> 00:48:18,336
- We're two years apart.
- I was born early in 1978,

1082
00:48:18,337 --> 00:48:19,797
so we're similar in age.

1083
00:48:20,037 --> 00:48:21,106
Early in 1978?

1084
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:24,777
(He's responding to everything.)

1085
00:48:25,577 --> 00:48:27,506
I'm the same age as Na Ra. I was born in 1981.

1086
00:48:27,507 --> 00:48:28,706
Yes, we're the same age.

1087
00:48:28,707 --> 00:48:30,177
- That's what she told us.
- Yes.

1088
00:48:31,147 --> 00:48:34,017
It was fun working with her in "Good Partner."

1089
00:48:34,147 --> 00:48:35,547
Yes, it was comfortable.

1090
00:48:35,887 --> 00:48:39,257
I used to listen to many of Na Ra's songs.

1091
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:41,187
When we were waiting on set,

1092
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:45,096
I played "I'm A Woman Too" on purpose to recall the past.

1093
00:48:45,097 --> 00:48:46,556
- I played the drums in the back.
- He played the drums in the back.

1094
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:48,397
You played the drums back then.

1095
00:48:49,267 --> 00:48:51,196
- Do you play the drums?
- Yes.

1096
00:48:51,197 --> 00:48:52,636
I used to be a musician.

1097
00:48:52,637 --> 00:48:54,636
- Yes, I heard that.
- When I was a musician,

1098
00:48:54,637 --> 00:48:56,136
- we were at the same agency.
- Right.

1099
00:48:56,137 --> 00:48:58,376
- I was a trainee.
- Is that so?

1100
00:48:58,377 --> 00:49:00,877
When she sang "I'm A Woman Too" on air,

1101
00:49:01,447 --> 00:49:03,476
- in the back... Yes.
- Did you play the drums?

1102
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:06,377
(Jun Han is the drummer behind Na Ra.)

1103
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:09,287
(Intrigued)

1104
00:49:09,587 --> 00:49:12,357
- Then they met in the drama.
- We met.

1105
00:49:12,657 --> 00:49:15,556
After how many years? After ten years?

1106
00:49:15,557 --> 00:49:16,627
I didn't recognize him.

1107
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:18,997
Are you still working as a singer?

1108
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,097
No, as a singer...

1109
00:49:21,297 --> 00:49:22,397
Do you earn more as an actor?

1110
00:49:24,937 --> 00:49:26,196
- A little more.
- Really?

1111
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:27,237
Yes.

1112
00:49:27,437 --> 00:49:30,437
(Jun Han really responds to everything.)

1113
00:49:30,937 --> 00:49:32,506
(Speaking of which...)

1114
00:49:32,507 --> 00:49:35,206
- I'll give you a tour of the house.
- Okay.

1115
00:49:35,207 --> 00:49:36,846
First... Take a look.

1116
00:49:36,847 --> 00:49:38,547
(Suddenly, she got excited.)

1117
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:42,347
Look at this. I'll brag about it. It's storage.

1118
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:43,787
- This?
- Yes.

1119
00:49:44,257 --> 00:49:46,086
- Look, it's very spacious.
- Gosh.

1120
00:49:46,087 --> 00:49:47,187
All these chairs fit in here.

1121
00:49:48,627 --> 00:49:50,256
Do you keep water and everything in there?

1122
00:49:50,257 --> 00:49:52,427
That side opens by lifting the floor.

1123
00:49:52,797 --> 00:49:54,767
(In awe)

1124
00:49:55,097 --> 00:49:57,396
The layout is quite efficient.

1125
00:49:57,397 --> 00:49:58,667
(Laughing)

1126
00:49:59,397 --> 00:50:01,937
Isn't it pretty? It's so pretty.

1127
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:03,737
- It's cute.
- Yes.

1128
00:50:04,477 --> 00:50:06,607
- Excuse me.
- Please come in.

1129
00:50:08,307 --> 00:50:09,947
- It looks so delicious.
- This is House on Wheels.

1130
00:50:11,817 --> 00:50:14,117
- This looks delicious.
- Doesn't the door look cute?

1131
00:50:15,087 --> 00:50:16,947
- Doesn't it feel like a cafe?
- It's cute.

1132
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,886
- Right, you can serve from here.
- A small cafe.

1133
00:50:18,887 --> 00:50:19,887
- It suits...
- Yes.

1134
00:50:19,888 --> 00:50:22,026
- You can serve from here.
- It suits you well, Na Ra.

1135
00:50:22,027 --> 00:50:23,957
Inside here...

1136
00:50:24,797 --> 00:50:26,696
(She's too busy bragging that she can't hear anything.)

1137
00:50:26,697 --> 00:50:29,027
- It's where plates are stored.
- This is also pretty.

1138
00:50:30,067 --> 00:50:31,667
- I heard that it's eco-friendly.
- That's amazing.

1139
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:33,236
Eco-friendly? How so?

1140
00:50:33,237 --> 00:50:34,666
- That's what they told me.
- Do you mean the plates?

1141
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:35,767
Yes, and...

1142
00:50:36,137 --> 00:50:37,876
(Her throat is sore from bragging.)

1143
00:50:37,877 --> 00:50:40,506
These are glass walls.

1144
00:50:40,507 --> 00:50:42,047
You can close them when you go to sleep.

1145
00:50:43,547 --> 00:50:45,346
When you sit here and look outside,

1146
00:50:45,347 --> 00:50:48,946
you can get a wide view of the outside.

1147
00:50:48,947 --> 00:50:50,387
- This is nice.
- Isn't it great?

1148
00:50:50,687 --> 00:50:54,387
(A view of a birch forest through the glass wall)

1149
00:50:54,587 --> 00:50:56,986
- Is this...
- Are you interested in buying one?

1150
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:57,997
Isn't it nice?

1151
00:50:58,227 --> 00:50:59,327
It's nice, but...

1152
00:51:01,067 --> 00:51:02,067
It's good to see you.

1153
00:51:02,068 --> 00:51:03,096
(Anyway, it's good to see you.)

1154
00:51:03,097 --> 00:51:05,797
I'm so excited to see you.

1155
00:51:06,267 --> 00:51:09,036
- After such a long time...
- It's been so long.

1156
00:51:09,037 --> 00:51:13,707
(Round and round)

1157
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:15,476
It's great to see you abroad.

1158
00:51:15,477 --> 00:51:17,676
- I was saying...
- I can't believe that we meet here.

1159
00:51:17,677 --> 00:51:19,416
I couldn't join you...

1160
00:51:19,417 --> 00:51:20,946
- at the last pork belly party.
- That's true.

1161
00:51:20,947 --> 00:51:22,616
You said that it was your favorite pork belly restaurant.

1162
00:51:22,617 --> 00:51:24,857
- I really wanted to go there.
- I wish you had been there.

1163
00:51:26,357 --> 00:51:28,687
- Thank you for inviting us.
- Thank you for coming.

1164
00:51:28,787 --> 00:51:31,457
- Thank you.
- I'm happy to join you.

1165
00:51:31,957 --> 00:51:33,026
Thank you.

1166
00:51:33,027 --> 00:51:35,097
There are a lot of cameras here.

1167
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:36,427
Hello.

1168
00:51:36,428 --> 00:51:37,466
This one moves.

1169
00:51:37,467 --> 00:51:39,596
Gosh, that's fascinating.

1170
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,667
- There's one up there.
- There is another one.

1171
00:51:41,837 --> 00:51:44,537
If I snore or fart...

1172
00:51:47,547 --> 00:51:50,877
Human beings must have similar thoughts.

1173
00:51:51,177 --> 00:51:53,046
- Really?
- I also brought it up.

1174
00:51:53,047 --> 00:51:55,917
It's a natural phenomenon.

1175
00:51:56,087 --> 00:51:58,887
- Stop looking and come here.
- Okay.

1176
00:51:59,857 --> 00:52:02,357
- Do you like tuna?
- Do you like tuna?

1177
00:52:03,057 --> 00:52:04,696
- Do you both like it?
- I like it.

1178
00:52:04,697 --> 00:52:05,856
I love tuna.

1179
00:52:05,857 --> 00:52:07,867
Do you also like raw tuna?

1180
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,797
What's the finest cut of tuna?

1181
00:52:11,267 --> 00:52:13,067
- The fatty belly?
- Isn't it the fatty belly tuna?

1182
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,737
It sounds like I'm bragging, but shall we show them what we bought?

1183
00:52:18,937 --> 00:52:20,207
- What you bought?
- We bought them ourselves.

1184
00:52:21,577 --> 00:52:26,017
(Strangely, the three owners are excited.)

1185
00:52:26,077 --> 00:52:27,787
- Could you come here for a minute?
- Sure.

1186
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,016
You must be very hungry.

1187
00:52:30,017 --> 00:52:31,017
Take a peek.

1188
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,326
Just open it.

1189
00:52:34,327 --> 00:52:35,526
(Shall I show it to them?)

1190
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,227
I'm completely serious.

1191
00:52:38,857 --> 00:52:42,397
Hokkaido is famous for its urchin roe.

1192
00:52:42,597 --> 00:52:43,727
We bought it this morning.

1193
00:52:44,597 --> 00:52:47,967
Isn't it considered a high-end dish?

1194
00:52:48,367 --> 00:52:49,437
It's high-end.

1195
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:54,447
We eat it as dessert every morning.

1196
00:52:54,947 --> 00:52:56,076
- Like pudding.
- Pudding.

1197
00:52:56,077 --> 00:52:57,247
Really?

1198
00:52:57,817 --> 00:52:59,217
This is what we want to make for you.

1199
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,716
- And a steak.
- Gosh.

1200
00:53:01,717 --> 00:53:03,017
(Fresh tuna from Hokkaido)

1201
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:04,987
Hokkaido is famous for its urchin roe.

1202
00:53:05,287 --> 00:53:06,357
We bought it this morning.

1203
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:10,487
Isn't it considered a high-end dish?

1204
00:53:10,927 --> 00:53:12,027
It's high-end.

1205
00:53:13,897 --> 00:53:16,897
We eat it as dessert every morning.

1206
00:53:17,367 --> 00:53:18,636
- Like pudding.
- Pudding.

1207
00:53:18,637 --> 00:53:19,767
Really?

1208
00:53:20,337 --> 00:53:21,737
This is what we want to make for you.

1209
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,236
- And a steak.
- Gosh.

1210
00:53:24,237 --> 00:53:26,877
(Fresh tuna from Hokkaido)

1211
00:53:27,477 --> 00:53:29,746
Gosh, this is the real deal.

1212
00:53:29,747 --> 00:53:31,647
(Extremely excited)

1213
00:53:31,977 --> 00:53:33,117
And that cut.

1214
00:53:33,217 --> 00:53:34,616
- Fatty tuna belly.
- Fatty tuna belly.

1215
00:53:34,617 --> 00:53:35,617
Gosh, this is...

1216
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:38,886
We kept them in the cooler right after they were cut.

1217
00:53:38,887 --> 00:53:40,187
(Stored in the cooler immediately after they were cut)

1218
00:53:40,287 --> 00:53:41,987
- We can make rice bowls or sushi.
- Everything.

1219
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:44,297
Hokkaido is known for its seafood.

1220
00:53:44,397 --> 00:53:46,356
We'll do our best to express our gratitude.

1221
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:47,357
(We'll treat you to a full-course meal of fresh Hokkaido tuna.)

1222
00:53:47,397 --> 00:53:48,697
- Can we help with anything?
- Can I help?

1223
00:53:48,897 --> 00:53:50,566
- Guests don't work here.
- Really?

1224
00:53:50,567 --> 00:53:52,967
- You'll chop some firewood later.
- I see.

1225
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,536
You do work that requires strength.

1226
00:53:55,537 --> 00:53:56,537
Okay.

1227
00:53:56,707 --> 00:53:58,906
(Don't worry. We prepared various activities for you.)

1228
00:53:58,907 --> 00:54:01,106
- All right, have a seat.
- Okay.

1229
00:54:01,107 --> 00:54:02,677
- Sit down and chat.
- Okay.

1230
00:54:03,147 --> 00:54:05,417
- Sit down.
- We'll be quick. Right, Hee Won?

1231
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:06,847
All right.

1232
00:54:08,147 --> 00:54:11,717
(He warms up the griddle in a hurry.)

1233
00:54:12,587 --> 00:54:14,257
Dong Il, what do we cook first?

1234
00:54:14,357 --> 00:54:16,386
The steak? We'll cook that first.

1235
00:54:16,387 --> 00:54:17,597
(Fresh tuna steak)

1236
00:54:18,357 --> 00:54:21,066
(Melt some butter which is the griddle's best friend.)

1237
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:23,827
(Adding garlic)

1238
00:54:24,537 --> 00:54:27,637
(Adding flavor with garlic to the savory butter)

1239
00:54:28,137 --> 00:54:30,507
Gosh, the blackboard... That's not what I meant.

1240
00:54:31,077 --> 00:54:33,707
- Having a griddle is...
- Griddle is amazing.

1241
00:54:33,807 --> 00:54:36,946
It was an excellent choice.

1242
00:54:36,947 --> 00:54:39,377
(Griddle is the best.)

1243
00:54:39,447 --> 00:54:41,546
Here's some tuna.

1244
00:54:41,547 --> 00:54:43,346
(Fresh tuna to go on the griddle today)

1245
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:44,387
That's really...

1246
00:54:45,357 --> 00:54:46,357
(Exclaiming)

1247
00:54:47,857 --> 00:54:49,656
- Put that underneath.
- Where?

1248
00:54:49,657 --> 00:54:51,526
Put it on one side.

1249
00:54:51,527 --> 00:54:52,597
(Even the color looks fresh.)

1250
00:54:53,427 --> 00:54:58,067
(Thick)

1251
00:54:58,267 --> 00:54:59,267
Tuna...

1252
00:54:59,737 --> 00:55:01,267
(Gulping)

1253
00:55:02,267 --> 00:55:04,777
(Getting a clear view of the rare sight)

1254
00:55:05,037 --> 00:55:06,176
I need to put it on.

1255
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,747
(Adding the tuna)

1256
00:55:10,747 --> 00:55:13,917
(Sizzling over butter that's flavored with roasted garlic)

1257
00:55:14,187 --> 00:55:15,487
Do we have the magic powder?

1258
00:55:16,017 --> 00:55:17,417
- The magic powder?
- Yes, that.

1259
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:20,457
(Yes, we have it.)

1260
00:55:23,927 --> 00:55:25,397
I'm confident about the quality of tuna.

1261
00:55:27,967 --> 00:55:29,767
Isn't this the best?

1262
00:55:29,867 --> 00:55:31,197
It'd be perfect with white wine.

1263
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:33,697
(Adding a huge chunk)

1264
00:55:35,307 --> 00:55:36,307
Hee Won, here you go.

1265
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:44,347
(Pouring a pile of garnish vegetables from the cutting board)

1266
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:48,546
(Seafood delicacies that fill the griddle)

1267
00:55:48,547 --> 00:55:50,187
(Their hearts are fluttering.)

1268
00:55:50,857 --> 00:55:54,957
(When the fresh red tuna starts to turn white)

1269
00:55:56,187 --> 00:56:00,867
(Now is the time to flip it.)

1270
00:56:10,537 --> 00:56:15,107
(When both sides get cooked and turn yellow, )

1271
00:56:16,347 --> 00:56:20,247
(make it stand to cook it evenly.)

1272
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:25,916
Gosh, look at this.

1273
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:27,387
(Lifting the chef's spirit)

1274
00:56:28,787 --> 00:56:29,826
It looks delicious.

1275
00:56:29,827 --> 00:56:33,057
(While the ultimate tuna steak sears beautifully...)

1276
00:56:33,597 --> 00:56:35,596
(The rice is cooked.)

1277
00:56:35,597 --> 00:56:38,897
(Did the rice turn out well?)

1278
00:56:41,537 --> 00:56:44,167
(Exclaiming)

1279
00:56:44,877 --> 00:56:45,907
(Exclaiming)

1280
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:47,237
What is it?

1281
00:56:47,847 --> 00:56:50,007
(What's going on?)

1282
00:56:51,517 --> 00:56:53,817
(The rice cooker is about to overflow.)

1283
00:56:54,047 --> 00:56:55,086
(Rice Cooker: Kill me.)

1284
00:56:55,087 --> 00:56:56,247
The rice looks amazing.

1285
00:56:57,187 --> 00:56:58,187
The rice...

1286
00:56:58,987 --> 00:57:00,017
- Look.
- What's wrong?

1287
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:01,927
The rice looks amazing.

1288
00:57:02,757 --> 00:57:04,297
Is the rice ready?

1289
00:57:05,157 --> 00:57:06,157
Is the rice cooked?

1290
00:57:06,158 --> 00:57:08,196
The rice is...

1291
00:57:08,197 --> 00:57:10,027
(Suddenly, Sushi King Hee Won gets anxious.)

1292
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:11,836
We made too much.

1293
00:57:11,837 --> 00:57:13,267
- Oh, my.
- Is it full?

1294
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:14,567
- Is it ready?
- Yes.

1295
00:57:15,507 --> 00:57:16,906
(It'll be fine as long as it cooked.)

1296
00:57:16,907 --> 00:57:18,806
It's still fluffy.

1297
00:57:18,807 --> 00:57:19,977
Will it be hard to put it together?

1298
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:22,346
- We're in trouble.
- Is it undercooked?

1299
00:57:22,347 --> 00:57:23,347
Yes.

1300
00:57:24,947 --> 00:57:26,716
(The rice looks undercooked even to the naked eye.)

1301
00:57:26,717 --> 00:57:27,746
We're in trouble.

1302
00:57:27,747 --> 00:57:28,946
It's very undercooked.

1303
00:57:28,947 --> 00:57:32,057
- Shall I cook it longer?
- What do we do?

1304
00:57:32,457 --> 00:57:33,457
Dong Il.

1305
00:57:34,057 --> 00:57:36,287
- My goodness.
- Yes?

1306
00:57:37,327 --> 00:57:38,957
The rice is completely undercooked.

1307
00:57:39,927 --> 00:57:40,967
Really?

1308
00:57:41,527 --> 00:57:43,066
But we have to make sushi.

1309
00:57:43,067 --> 00:57:44,126
I know.

1310
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,137
(We have to make them sushi.)

1311
00:57:45,697 --> 00:57:49,037
(I can't keep my precious guests hungry.)

1312
00:57:50,937 --> 00:57:52,077
For now...

1313
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:57,007
(Na Ra takes the matter into her own hands.)

1314
00:57:57,277 --> 00:57:58,446
(She tastes the rice inside.)

1315
00:57:58,447 --> 00:57:59,447
(Humming)

1316
00:57:59,447 --> 00:58:00,447
Hee Won.

1317
00:58:00,448 --> 00:58:01,486
(Sushi King also tastes the rice inside.)

1318
00:58:01,487 --> 00:58:02,516
The inside is cooked.

1319
00:58:02,517 --> 00:58:04,457
- It's only the rice on top.
- Right.

1320
00:58:04,757 --> 00:58:05,757
In that case...

1321
00:58:06,657 --> 00:58:08,456
(She keeps the kelp on the side.)

1322
00:58:08,457 --> 00:58:09,457
After that...

1323
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:12,357
I'll remove the undercooked rice.

1324
00:58:12,457 --> 00:58:14,766
I'll heat it again and cool down the rice underneath.

1325
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:16,097
(Heating up the rice on top and using bottom rice for sushi)

1326
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,497
(Scraping off the undercooked rice on top)

1327
00:58:18,867 --> 00:58:22,137
(She removes the undercooked rice.)

1328
00:58:24,507 --> 00:58:26,406
- Scoop up the rice underneath.
- Yes.

1329
00:58:26,407 --> 00:58:27,947
(Cooked rice inside to make sushi)

1330
00:58:28,447 --> 00:58:31,247
(She's struggling because there's so much rice.)

1331
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:35,347
We cooked too much rice.

1332
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:37,646
- That's enough.
- It won't fit.

1333
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:39,056
- That's enough.
- That's good.

1334
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,057
(They got enough rice to make sushi.)

1335
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:41,986
(She puts the undercooked rice back in the cooker.)

1336
00:58:41,987 --> 00:58:43,027
I'll heat it up.

1337
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:45,297
There's still an entire pot of rice.

1338
00:58:47,027 --> 00:58:50,097
(Sprinkling some water so that it gets cooked)

1339
00:58:51,467 --> 00:58:54,296
I will try to reheat it.

1340
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:55,837
(While waiting for the undercooked rice to be born again)

1341
00:58:56,807 --> 00:58:59,077
The sushi... Hee Won, is it ready?

1342
00:58:59,177 --> 00:59:00,737
- What?
- The rice.

1343
00:59:01,407 --> 00:59:02,547
Rice?

1344
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:04,646
Rice, well...

1345
00:59:04,647 --> 00:59:06,076
(As for sushi rice, well...)

1346
00:59:06,077 --> 00:59:08,617
(I'll make it, I guess?)

1347
00:59:09,347 --> 00:59:12,157
(With just one-time experience of making sushi, )

1348
00:59:12,817 --> 00:59:16,587
(he became Sushi King.)

1349
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:20,297
(He sets to work.)

1350
00:59:21,067 --> 00:59:22,196
(Today's top quality ingredient)

1351
00:59:22,197 --> 00:59:23,897
(Hokkaido raw tuna)

1352
00:59:24,637 --> 00:59:26,496
(The fate of raw tuna sushi...)

1353
00:59:26,497 --> 00:59:28,867
(lies in Sushi King's hands.)

1354
00:59:30,007 --> 00:59:32,976
(First, he seasons the rice with sushi powder.)

1355
00:59:32,977 --> 00:59:34,946
(Peeking)

1356
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:35,977
Hee Won.

1357
00:59:37,477 --> 00:59:39,547
- Jun Han. Here...
- Yes.

1358
00:59:39,977 --> 00:59:41,117
This powder.

1359
00:59:42,487 --> 00:59:43,846
Sprinkle it over the rice.

1360
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:45,317
(Sprinkle the sushi powder.)

1361
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:46,957
Sprinkle it.

1362
00:59:47,387 --> 00:59:50,127
That's too much. That's enough.

1363
00:59:51,197 --> 00:59:53,196
(He is quiet yet bold.)

1364
00:59:53,197 --> 00:59:54,867
(What should I do?)

1365
00:59:55,397 --> 00:59:58,666
I'll flip the rice like this.

1366
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:00,137
(To mix the boldly-added sushi powder evenly...)

1367
01:00:01,237 --> 01:00:02,736
- Hold the spoon.
- Okay.

1368
01:00:02,737 --> 01:00:05,106
(He resorts to using his hands.)

1369
01:00:05,107 --> 01:00:06,936
- It looks hot.
- It's hot.

1370
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,206
(But it can be hot.)

1371
01:00:08,207 --> 01:00:09,207
It's hot.

1372
01:00:09,977 --> 01:00:13,147
(It's freshly cooked, so it's steaming.)

1373
01:00:14,347 --> 01:00:15,686
- I don't think you should do this.
- No.

1374
01:00:15,687 --> 01:00:17,187
- I will...
- No, it's okay.

1375
01:00:17,857 --> 01:00:20,787
(Sushi King sacrifices himself.)

1376
01:00:21,257 --> 01:00:23,257
(Is he okay?)

1377
01:00:25,597 --> 01:00:26,897
It is hot.

1378
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:31,396
Just this bit.

1379
01:00:31,397 --> 01:00:33,467
- Try this using your hand.
- Okay.

1380
01:00:34,237 --> 01:00:35,336
Tell me how it is.

1381
01:00:35,337 --> 01:00:36,606
How does it taste?

1382
01:00:36,607 --> 01:00:37,876
(Is it seasoned well?)

1383
01:00:37,877 --> 01:00:40,307
Does it taste a bit sour?

1384
01:00:41,507 --> 01:00:42,947
- Is it too sour?
- No.

1385
01:00:43,147 --> 01:00:44,347
- Is it just nice?
- Yes.

1386
01:00:44,647 --> 01:00:46,347
- Why don't you try?
- Me?

1387
01:00:48,017 --> 01:00:49,747
I'll give you this much.

1388
01:00:56,087 --> 01:00:58,356
("Good Partner")

1389
01:00:58,357 --> 01:01:01,667
(The sushi strategic TF was researching for the best seasoning.)

1390
01:01:02,167 --> 01:01:03,826
(Staring quietly)

1391
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,267
- This is just nice.
- Yes.

1392
01:01:05,467 --> 01:01:08,937
(After a long research, two of them became just nice.)

1393
01:01:10,437 --> 01:01:13,207
(What are you guys doing?)

1394
01:01:14,107 --> 01:01:16,607
- Was he tasting the rice?
- He was tasting the rice.

1395
01:01:17,847 --> 01:01:19,847
(You guys look nice!)

1396
01:01:20,147 --> 01:01:21,817
Good, the rice is done.

1397
01:01:22,787 --> 01:01:25,286
- It already smells...
- It's nice.

1398
01:01:25,287 --> 01:01:27,287
(Good sushi partners successfully seasoned the sushi rice.)

1399
01:01:27,757 --> 01:01:29,827
(Dong Il who was grilling tuna steak...)

1400
01:01:30,087 --> 01:01:31,756
(closes the lid so the inside will be cooked well too.)

1401
01:01:31,757 --> 01:01:33,657
(The tuna steak is thick.)

1402
01:01:33,997 --> 01:01:35,527
I'll pass you the raw fish, Hee Won.

1403
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:37,896
- Fatty tuna belly.
- Fatty tuna belly.

1404
01:01:37,897 --> 01:01:40,436
(Raw fatty tuna belly is here.)

1405
01:01:40,437 --> 01:01:41,507
It's gleaming.

1406
01:01:42,637 --> 01:01:45,236
Ask Na Ra to pass me the sharpest knife.

1407
01:01:45,237 --> 01:01:46,276
Okay.

1408
01:01:46,277 --> 01:01:47,277
- The sharpest knife.
- Okay.

1409
01:01:49,677 --> 01:01:52,076
Na Ra, you're always ready to...

1410
01:01:52,077 --> 01:01:54,717
(Gasping in shock)

1411
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:57,816
Na Ra, you're always ready to...

1412
01:01:57,817 --> 01:01:59,557
(Ready to do what?)

1413
01:02:00,087 --> 01:02:01,386
(I'm ready for anything.)

1414
01:02:01,387 --> 01:02:02,787
Why are you holding the knife like that?

1415
01:02:03,927 --> 01:02:05,297
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1416
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:08,167
Here you go, Dong Il.

1417
01:02:10,567 --> 01:02:13,297
Dong Il, did you practice cutting raw fish too?

1418
01:02:13,497 --> 01:02:14,567
No.

1419
01:02:14,737 --> 01:02:16,507
- So you just do it?
- Yes, I just do it.

1420
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:18,877
I'm not that classy.

1421
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,677
(He slices a bit of precious raw fatty tuna belly.)

1422
01:02:24,377 --> 01:02:27,147
(Here you go, Seung Hyun.)

1423
01:02:28,317 --> 01:02:29,317
(Satisfied)

1424
01:02:29,318 --> 01:02:30,747
It melts in your mouth, doesn't it?

1425
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:32,356
It's unbelievable!

1426
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:34,517
(It's unbelievable!)

1427
01:02:35,927 --> 01:02:36,986
Right?

1428
01:02:36,987 --> 01:02:38,827
(Feeling proud)

1429
01:02:39,657 --> 01:02:41,497
The oil is...

1430
01:02:41,667 --> 01:02:43,367
(He is salivating.)

1431
01:02:44,297 --> 01:02:48,837
(The marbling is so clear like high quality beef.)

1432
01:02:53,077 --> 01:02:57,376
(I hear some appetizing sound.)

1433
01:02:57,377 --> 01:02:58,776
(Here it is.)

1434
01:02:58,777 --> 01:03:02,417
(Swallowing his saliva)

1435
01:03:04,787 --> 01:03:05,816
Thank you.

1436
01:03:05,817 --> 01:03:08,227
(It makes them feel grateful.)

1437
01:03:08,757 --> 01:03:11,927
(He's grateful just looking at it.)

1438
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:15,296
Thank you.

1439
01:03:15,297 --> 01:03:17,467
Eat it as is without any sauce.

1440
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:19,197
Chew it well.

1441
01:03:22,607 --> 01:03:23,707
Is it nice?

1442
01:03:24,607 --> 01:03:25,677
It's so delicious.

1443
01:03:27,077 --> 01:03:30,777
(You can taste the grains of raw fatty tuna belly.)

1444
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:32,977
Just eat until you drop dead.

1445
01:03:35,017 --> 01:03:37,286
(Generous amount)

1446
01:03:37,287 --> 01:03:39,087
Hee Won, it's for your sushi.

1447
01:03:39,617 --> 01:03:41,386
I'll set the things for sushi.

1448
01:03:41,387 --> 01:03:42,957
(I'll set the things for sushi then, teacher.)

1449
01:03:43,757 --> 01:03:46,856
(He carefully selects a cutting board for plating.)

1450
01:03:46,857 --> 01:03:49,667
(Let's use this! No.)

1451
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:52,096
(Okay, I choose you.)

1452
01:03:52,097 --> 01:03:53,236
Wasabi...

1453
01:03:53,237 --> 01:03:55,367
(Step Two: Plate some wasabi)

1454
01:03:55,667 --> 01:03:59,077
(Sushi King is ready.)

1455
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:01,077
(Sighing)

1456
01:04:01,107 --> 01:04:04,647
(Since it's a rare ingredient, I should do well.)

1457
01:04:05,517 --> 01:04:09,917
(The crown of Sushi King is heavy.)

1458
01:04:10,217 --> 01:04:11,456
(Don't grab it too hard.)

1459
01:04:11,457 --> 01:04:12,787
(That's a rice ball. You can't do that!)

1460
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:16,627
(The teacher's teachings that he learned the hard way...)

1461
01:04:17,457 --> 01:04:20,027
(have been ingrained deeply in his body.)

1462
01:04:20,397 --> 01:04:21,397
(Teacher, )

1463
01:04:21,398 --> 01:04:23,097
(I'll prove myself to you now.)

1464
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:25,366
Make it round.

1465
01:04:25,367 --> 01:04:27,997
(Based solely on what his hands feel)

1466
01:04:28,507 --> 01:04:31,167
(He makes the first sushi on his own.)

1467
01:04:31,777 --> 01:04:34,606
(Just like the teacher taught him)

1468
01:04:34,607 --> 01:04:35,846
Like this.

1469
01:04:35,847 --> 01:04:37,247
(Made one in an instant)

1470
01:04:38,077 --> 01:04:41,717
(The future Sushi King's firm hand movements...)

1471
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,687
(do not lose to the high quality tuna.)

1472
01:04:45,457 --> 01:04:47,887
(A shocking visual)

1473
01:04:49,357 --> 01:04:51,827
You're good at making sushi too.

1474
01:04:52,457 --> 01:04:54,057
I used to make it before.

1475
01:04:54,767 --> 01:04:55,797
Amazing.

1476
01:04:56,527 --> 01:04:57,796
Since the day before yesterday.

1477
01:04:57,797 --> 01:04:59,737
(3 days of sushi-making experience)

1478
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:01,806
You can see my expertise, right?

1479
01:05:01,807 --> 01:05:03,937
(The 3-day-old Sushi King with great expertise)

1480
01:05:05,137 --> 01:05:06,606
Try the white part.

1481
01:05:06,607 --> 01:05:07,637
Okay.

1482
01:05:09,807 --> 01:05:13,247
(He can make it fine on his own now.)

1483
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:17,347
(Treating them with care as if they're his children)

1484
01:05:17,887 --> 01:05:19,417
Na Ra, pass me...

1485
01:05:19,857 --> 01:05:21,157
- some rice.
- Yes.

1486
01:05:21,557 --> 01:05:22,757
Just a bit.

1487
01:05:22,887 --> 01:05:24,687
Okay. A handful?

1488
01:05:25,897 --> 01:05:27,396
- A fist size.
- Five fists?

1489
01:05:27,397 --> 01:05:28,426
Yes.

1490
01:05:28,427 --> 01:05:30,467
(He requests for rice using fist telepathy.)

1491
01:05:30,897 --> 01:05:33,266
(Did the reheated rice revive?)

1492
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:34,667
Please work.

1493
01:05:35,067 --> 01:05:36,106
Please.

1494
01:05:36,107 --> 01:05:37,237
(I hope it worked.)

1495
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:39,077
(She scoops the rice nervously.)

1496
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:42,006
(Did the reheated rice revive?)

1497
01:05:42,007 --> 01:05:43,307
Please work.

1498
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:44,746
Please.

1499
01:05:44,747 --> 01:05:45,917
(I hope it worked.)

1500
01:05:46,747 --> 01:05:51,557
(She scoops the rice nervously.)

1501
01:05:52,117 --> 01:05:54,617
(Let me try it.)

1502
01:05:55,527 --> 01:05:57,457
(Satisfied)

1503
01:05:58,127 --> 01:06:01,626
(Thanks to Witty Na Ra, the rice has revived!)

1504
01:06:01,627 --> 01:06:02,826
- Jun Han.
- Yes.

1505
01:06:02,827 --> 01:06:03,967
(Jun Han, here's rice!)

1506
01:06:04,567 --> 01:06:05,596
The fragrance...

1507
01:06:05,597 --> 01:06:06,766
(Rice delivery.)

1508
01:06:06,767 --> 01:06:09,237
(With the rice Na Ra cooked with much effort, )

1509
01:06:09,467 --> 01:06:11,136
(Chef Sung will cook his next dish.)

1510
01:06:11,137 --> 01:06:12,377
Raw tuna rice bowl.

1511
01:06:14,107 --> 01:06:15,776
Since we got to try it before,

1512
01:06:15,777 --> 01:06:17,877
let's give them most of it.

1513
01:06:21,787 --> 01:06:26,217
(Place lots of raw fatty tuna belly until the rice can't be seen.)

1514
01:06:28,387 --> 01:06:30,187
(Cracking the egg shell with the back of the knife!)

1515
01:06:31,457 --> 01:06:35,997
(He places a savory raw egg in the middle.)

1516
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:41,137
(Add some radish sprout, which will add the sharp taste.)

1517
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:45,077
Dong Il, would you like the kelp that was in the rice?

1518
01:06:45,307 --> 01:06:46,437
Yes, please.

1519
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:48,776
(The kelp is sliced thinly to be added as a topping!)

1520
01:06:48,777 --> 01:06:50,277
You're so good at cutting.

1521
01:06:50,907 --> 01:06:52,077
I'm just average.

1522
01:06:53,377 --> 01:06:54,716
What is this, Dong Il?

1523
01:06:54,717 --> 01:06:56,287
- It's kelp.
- Kelp, I see.

1524
01:06:57,147 --> 01:06:58,786
Adding boiled kelp...

1525
01:06:58,787 --> 01:07:01,557
adds to the texture.

1526
01:07:05,227 --> 01:07:07,056
You know that one instant ramyeon brand?

1527
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:08,057
Yes.

1528
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:10,967
Each packet has one piece of kelp.

1529
01:07:11,637 --> 01:07:13,336
- It does.
- But sometimes, you get unlucky...

1530
01:07:13,337 --> 01:07:14,767
and end up with a dud.

1531
01:07:15,467 --> 01:07:17,666
I was having a very hard day, and I got a dud.

1532
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:21,007
I felt so upset in my studio all alone.

1533
01:07:21,577 --> 01:07:22,647
I see.

1534
01:07:24,477 --> 01:07:26,717
How long did it take for you to get yourself known as an actor?

1535
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:30,316
- About 15 years?
- Were you...

1536
01:07:30,317 --> 01:07:31,686
I think I got to work properly in the last five years.

1537
01:07:31,687 --> 01:07:32,816
It's been 20 years since I became an actor.

1538
01:07:32,817 --> 01:07:34,086
Right, you talked about this and that...

1539
01:07:34,087 --> 01:07:35,687
- when we drank.
- Yes.

1540
01:07:37,027 --> 01:07:39,296
I'll eat as much kelp as I like today.

1541
01:07:39,297 --> 01:07:40,757
Eat a lot.

1542
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:45,737
(Adding lots of kelp for Seung Hyun)

1543
01:07:46,267 --> 01:07:47,997
- This isn't all we have.
- I see.

1544
01:07:48,407 --> 01:07:50,667
I'll put in everything that's good for your health.

1545
01:07:51,907 --> 01:07:53,307
- This...
- Urchin roe.

1546
01:07:53,877 --> 01:07:55,346
- Urchin roe.
- Today...

1547
01:07:55,347 --> 01:07:57,107
(He even takes out urchin roe.)

1548
01:07:57,207 --> 01:07:59,476
Let's give them tons until they get sick of it.

1549
01:07:59,477 --> 01:08:02,917
(House on Wheels' welcome food, sea urchin rice bowl!)

1550
01:08:03,617 --> 01:08:08,357
(A whole pack of urchin roe for one bowl of rice)

1551
01:08:09,187 --> 01:08:13,357
(Chef Sung's luxurious rice bowl, half-rice, half-urchin roe)

1552
01:08:14,227 --> 01:08:16,166
Did you use up urchin roe?

1553
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:18,867
(Taken back)

1554
01:08:19,397 --> 01:08:20,597
- Yes.
- Darn it.

1555
01:08:21,037 --> 01:08:22,307
Take the one here.

1556
01:08:24,907 --> 01:08:27,037
- How many do you want to make?
- Just two.

1557
01:08:27,277 --> 01:08:28,547
So they can eat...

1558
01:08:29,577 --> 01:08:30,646
Just make two each.

1559
01:08:30,647 --> 01:08:31,647
(My precious urchin roe sushi)

1560
01:08:33,247 --> 01:08:34,986
You made sushi out of it too.

1561
01:08:34,987 --> 01:08:36,847
(Sushi King Hee Won expands to urchin roe sushi too!)

1562
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:39,357
(Meanwhile, Teacher Dong Il in charge of rice bowls...)

1563
01:08:40,017 --> 01:08:42,427
(adds egg yolk, radish sprouts, and kelp toppings.)

1564
01:08:43,227 --> 01:08:48,297
(2 types of luxurious Hokkaido rice bowls)

1565
01:08:49,867 --> 01:08:52,537
(Meanwhile, thick tuna steaks are grilled well too.)

1566
01:08:53,037 --> 01:08:54,037
Bring the stone plate.

1567
01:08:54,037 --> 01:08:55,037
(Bring the stone plate for steaks!)

1568
01:08:55,337 --> 01:08:57,806
Be careful, it's hot. Hold on.

1569
01:08:57,807 --> 01:08:58,877
(Witty Na Ra had the stone plate heated in advance.)

1570
01:08:59,437 --> 01:09:00,476
Be careful.

1571
01:09:00,477 --> 01:09:01,477
(Don't burn your hand.)

1572
01:09:02,207 --> 01:09:05,247
- Don't ever touch it. Be careful.
- Okay.

1573
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:11,657
(Melt butter on the hot stone plate.)

1574
01:09:12,257 --> 01:09:13,556
Gosh, butter.

1575
01:09:13,557 --> 01:09:14,957
(On top of the butter that satisfies the five senses...)

1576
01:09:15,957 --> 01:09:17,326
(Hot and classy)

1577
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:19,357
Sit down first, you two.

1578
01:09:21,097 --> 01:09:23,167
(Grilled vegetables on the stone plate too)

1579
01:09:25,497 --> 01:09:26,866
(Vegetable juice dripping)

1580
01:09:26,867 --> 01:09:28,407
Like this.

1581
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:31,336
It's so nice.

1582
01:09:31,337 --> 01:09:32,406
(He fills up the second stone plate too.)

1583
01:09:32,407 --> 01:09:33,407
It smells so good.

1584
01:09:33,408 --> 01:09:34,837
(He fills up the second stone plate too.)

1585
01:09:35,807 --> 01:09:38,246
- This is Jun Han's.
- It looks so delicious.

1586
01:09:38,247 --> 01:09:39,676
Dong Il is like a chef.

1587
01:09:39,677 --> 01:09:41,617
How should I...

1588
01:09:42,787 --> 01:09:45,487
It's one each for you.

1589
01:09:45,787 --> 01:09:46,857
Thank you.

1590
01:09:47,757 --> 01:09:49,486
(I get to enjoy this happiness all on my own.)

1591
01:09:49,487 --> 01:09:50,556
- Eat like this.
- Okay.

1592
01:09:50,557 --> 01:09:52,197
(I get to enjoy this happiness all on my own.)

1593
01:09:52,657 --> 01:09:54,627
It won't taste good when cooled. Eat it when it's hot.

1594
01:09:56,267 --> 01:09:59,537
(Hokkaido tuna steak using tuna that was caught today morning)

1595
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:02,436
It's so oily.

1596
01:10:02,437 --> 01:10:03,737
(The highest quality, raw fatty tuna belly rice bowl)

1597
01:10:04,637 --> 01:10:05,637
- Enjoy.
- It's crazy.

1598
01:10:05,638 --> 01:10:07,577
(A whole pack of urchin roe, Hokkaido urchin roe rice bowl)

1599
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:10,806
It looks delicious.

1600
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:12,647
(Sushi King Hee Won's Hokkaido sushi set)

1601
01:10:13,517 --> 01:10:16,787
(Heaps of aged kimchi and pork belly added...)

1602
01:10:18,017 --> 01:10:19,556
It smells amazing.

1603
01:10:19,557 --> 01:10:20,757
(to cook pork aged kimchi stew)

1604
01:10:21,657 --> 01:10:25,096
(A table full of Hokkaido's best delicacies)

1605
01:10:25,097 --> 01:10:26,127
Eat up.

1606
01:10:27,357 --> 01:10:29,126
I've never been treated so well.

1607
01:10:29,127 --> 01:10:30,267
I've never treated someone so well either.

1608
01:10:31,027 --> 01:10:32,267
It's my first time too.

1609
01:10:33,037 --> 01:10:35,537
(Enjoy it as much as you can today!)

1610
01:10:35,937 --> 01:10:37,936
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1611
01:10:37,937 --> 01:10:39,236
- Thank you for the food.
- Let's eat.

1612
01:10:39,237 --> 01:10:40,277
(Let's start the feast!)

1613
01:10:40,707 --> 01:10:43,146
- You get one each. Just eat up.
- Okay.

1614
01:10:43,147 --> 01:10:44,207
You guys get one each.

1615
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:45,977
Take it slow.

1616
01:10:46,417 --> 01:10:48,316
- Make sure you finish everything.
- Thank you.

1617
01:10:48,317 --> 01:10:49,647
(They'll fill up the guests' tummies with tuna.)

1618
01:10:50,217 --> 01:10:51,247
What will Na Ra eat, then?

1619
01:10:51,857 --> 01:10:53,717
- We'll share this.
- I see.

1620
01:10:54,517 --> 01:10:56,987
- Eat up.
- Okay, thank you.

1621
01:10:57,857 --> 01:10:59,327
Na Ra should still... Here, Na Ra.

1622
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:03,827
(Wiggling)

1623
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,297
Na Ra should still... Here, Na Ra.

1624
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:11,537
- Tuna steak.
- Thank you for this.

1625
01:11:12,577 --> 01:11:13,876
It's so petite.

1626
01:11:13,877 --> 01:11:17,377
(Petite plating just for Na Ra)

1627
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:18,747
Of course.

1628
01:11:18,977 --> 01:11:21,377
Actually, you're more important than Seung Hyun.

1629
01:11:22,447 --> 01:11:23,886
He's leaving anyway.

1630
01:11:23,887 --> 01:11:25,156
- That's true.
- I agree.

1631
01:11:25,157 --> 01:11:27,557
Here. Enjoy.

1632
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:29,526
Eat the sushi and the steak.

1633
01:11:29,527 --> 01:11:30,527
(Trying the thick tuna steak first)

1634
01:11:34,527 --> 01:11:36,597
(Covering his mouth)

1635
01:11:37,397 --> 01:11:38,967
(Laughing at Jun Han)

1636
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:41,267
Jun Han is at a loss for words.

1637
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:44,267
He is impressed.

1638
01:11:45,107 --> 01:11:46,136
How is it?

1639
01:11:46,137 --> 01:11:47,477
(Impressed by the taste of tuna that fills his mouth)

1640
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,806
(Seung Hyun takes a big bite too.)

1641
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,147
(Humming)

1642
01:12:00,287 --> 01:12:01,716
It's so soft.

1643
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:02,787
(His mouth full of soft tuna)

1644
01:12:05,257 --> 01:12:06,856
The tuna steak is...

1645
01:12:06,857 --> 01:12:08,696
(The tuna steak is...)

1646
01:12:08,697 --> 01:12:10,567
The tuna steak is really...

1647
01:12:11,867 --> 01:12:13,267
It's delicious.

1648
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:16,007
Let me try the tuna steak too.

1649
01:12:17,507 --> 01:12:19,606
- It's really good.
- This.

1650
01:12:19,607 --> 01:12:20,637
(Strongly recommend)

1651
01:12:22,077 --> 01:12:23,247
It melts in your mouth.

1652
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:26,877
It's nice. The tuna tastes light.

1653
01:12:27,447 --> 01:12:28,477
It's so fresh.

1654
01:12:29,447 --> 01:12:32,616
The tuna is so thick, yet it's so fragrant.

1655
01:12:32,617 --> 01:12:33,756
- Right?
- Very clean and fragrant.

1656
01:12:33,757 --> 01:12:34,757
(The freshly-caught tuna is clean and light.)

1657
01:12:35,757 --> 01:12:37,757
- Goodness.
- It's so nice.

1658
01:12:38,127 --> 01:12:39,597
- Isn't it very light?
- Yes.

1659
01:12:41,127 --> 01:12:42,166
Is this it?

1660
01:12:42,167 --> 01:12:44,797
Do you add dark soy sauce to it?

1661
01:12:45,067 --> 01:12:47,037
Yes. It's soy sauce and...

1662
01:12:47,237 --> 01:12:49,867
And sesame oil. Add as much as you like.

1663
01:12:51,207 --> 01:12:53,436
- Mix it.
- Did you add sesame oil and stuff?

1664
01:12:53,437 --> 01:12:54,437
- Yes.
- Okay.

1665
01:12:56,347 --> 01:12:59,677
(Taking a big spoonful of half-rice half-tuna rice bowl)

1666
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:04,117
(A mouthful)

1667
01:13:05,757 --> 01:13:07,717
(How does it taste?)

1668
01:13:08,287 --> 01:13:10,427
(This is!)

1669
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:12,756
(The tuna swims in my mouth!)

1670
01:13:12,757 --> 01:13:13,757
And this...

1671
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:17,026
We bought the tuna that was caught today.

1672
01:13:17,027 --> 01:13:18,097
It's fresh.

1673
01:13:19,797 --> 01:13:24,267
(Out of the freshly caught tuna, )

1674
01:13:24,907 --> 01:13:27,806
- Fatty tuna belly.
- Look at the fats.

1675
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,147
(they got the fatty belly part, which is most fatty and rare.)

1676
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:31,946
It's so savory.

1677
01:13:31,947 --> 01:13:33,116
(The taste of the rice bowl...)

1678
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,247
(with the generous amount of fatty tuna belly)

1679
01:13:38,387 --> 01:13:42,227
(Refreshing savory flavor coils in his mouth.)

1680
01:13:43,027 --> 01:13:44,856
Dong Il, this is even tastier. I'm not even joking.

1681
01:13:44,857 --> 01:13:47,197
- Tuna rice bowl?
- Yes, tastier than the urchin roe.

1682
01:13:49,097 --> 01:13:53,867
(Fatty tuna belly rice bowl makes itself known to be legendary.)

1683
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:56,366
It's so delicious.

1684
01:13:56,367 --> 01:13:58,707
(Seung Hyun quickly takes a bite.)

1685
01:13:59,407 --> 01:14:00,677
(Humming)

1686
01:14:01,477 --> 01:14:02,747
I'm happy.

1687
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,707
Aren't you glad you came?

1688
01:14:05,147 --> 01:14:06,147
- Sorry?
- Aren't you glad you came?

1689
01:14:06,147 --> 01:14:07,147
Totally.

1690
01:14:08,447 --> 01:14:11,186
It was my first time seeing a whole tuna.

1691
01:14:11,187 --> 01:14:13,787
The fresh one, not the frozen one.

1692
01:14:14,587 --> 01:14:17,086
It was round and shiny.

1693
01:14:17,087 --> 01:14:18,696
- Yes. It was round.
- The surface of it.

1694
01:14:18,697 --> 01:14:19,797
It gleamed.

1695
01:14:20,157 --> 01:14:22,026
You cooked using fresh tuna that was caught today.

1696
01:14:22,027 --> 01:14:23,626
Yes. We got it auctioned,

1697
01:14:23,627 --> 01:14:25,867
- and they cut it raw.
- That's how you took it.

1698
01:14:26,567 --> 01:14:29,967
(The tunas that were swimming in the sea today morning...)

1699
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:35,037
(got onto our dining table in the fresh state.)

1700
01:14:35,547 --> 01:14:37,547
That's why the texture is completely different.

1701
01:14:38,817 --> 01:14:40,577
It really tastes...

1702
01:14:40,917 --> 01:14:42,687
fresh, doesn't it?

1703
01:14:43,517 --> 01:14:47,457
(Firm meat with rich grain)

1704
01:14:48,357 --> 01:14:50,987
It's top class ingredient.

1705
01:14:51,657 --> 01:14:53,497
If you don't finish it, you have to pay for the tuna.

1706
01:14:54,027 --> 01:14:55,466
(Shocked)

1707
01:14:55,467 --> 01:14:56,527
Keep that in mind.

1708
01:14:57,327 --> 01:15:00,437
We spent about 400 dollars just on tuna, didn't we?

1709
01:15:01,637 --> 01:15:03,567
It was 400 dollars just for the tail.

1710
01:15:04,307 --> 01:15:07,337
- Don't talk about money.
- I must finish the food.

1711
01:15:07,577 --> 01:15:09,106
That's how much it is for the frozen ones.

1712
01:15:09,107 --> 01:15:11,207
The ones we paid for were much more expensive.

1713
01:15:12,517 --> 01:15:13,576
(About 150 dollars)

1714
01:15:13,577 --> 01:15:16,247
(It was so cheap that we wanted to exaggerate.)

1715
01:15:16,647 --> 01:15:17,847
Don't worry about it.

1716
01:15:18,757 --> 01:15:19,817
(Choking)

1717
01:15:21,357 --> 01:15:22,427
I'm sorry.

1718
01:15:23,087 --> 01:15:24,156
You must finish everything.

1719
01:15:24,157 --> 01:15:25,657
(He is shocked by the tuna blackmail.)

1720
01:15:26,827 --> 01:15:27,856
Urchin roe rice bowl.

1721
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:29,667
(Let's calm down with savory and soft urchin roe rice bowl.)

1722
01:15:36,837 --> 01:15:40,276
It's savory. Dong Il, urchin roe rice bowl is so savory.

1723
01:15:40,277 --> 01:15:43,246
- Really?
- It blends in with rice.

1724
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:44,706
It's very savory.

1725
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:45,977
(The flavor of urchin roe seeps into rice and becomes more savory.)

1726
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:48,316
- It's delicious.
- Doesn't it melt in your mouth?

1727
01:15:48,317 --> 01:15:49,317
It melts.

1728
01:15:50,217 --> 01:15:52,486
It tastes much better than what restaurants sell.

1729
01:15:52,487 --> 01:15:54,817
Yes. He's so good.

1730
01:15:54,987 --> 01:15:56,986
(The cook himself...)

1731
01:15:56,987 --> 01:15:59,427
(is amazed.)

1732
01:16:00,257 --> 01:16:01,826
My mouth is stunned.

1733
01:16:01,827 --> 01:16:03,797
(My mouth is stunned!)

1734
01:16:04,627 --> 01:16:07,067
- Try the sushi.
- Okay.

1735
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:11,137
It's wrapped in Hee Won's love.

1736
01:16:12,407 --> 01:16:13,477
It's so delicious.

1737
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:16,177
Isn't it incredible?

1738
01:16:16,777 --> 01:16:17,847
It's good, right?

1739
01:16:19,047 --> 01:16:21,347
(His cute sushi student is complimenting himself.)

1740
01:16:21,917 --> 01:16:23,617
(Seung Hyun tries urchin roe sushi.)

1741
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:25,116
(Humming as soon as he puts it in his mouth)

1742
01:16:25,117 --> 01:16:26,186
It's good.

1743
01:16:26,187 --> 01:16:27,256
Say that after you chew.

1744
01:16:27,257 --> 01:16:29,156
(No matter how good it is, say it after you chew.)

1745
01:16:29,157 --> 01:16:32,027
This is my second one.

1746
01:16:32,897 --> 01:16:33,897
Urchin roe rice bowl.

1747
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:35,326
(2 sushi)

1748
01:16:35,327 --> 01:16:37,767
(His reaction was genuine.)

1749
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,367
Does it melt in your mouth?

1750
01:16:41,397 --> 01:16:42,467
It really does.

1751
01:16:42,867 --> 01:16:43,937
Right?

1752
01:16:44,137 --> 01:16:46,237
(Sushi King's grounded confidence)

1753
01:16:46,777 --> 01:16:49,847
- It blends in with the rice.
- Yes, it's so...

1754
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:52,006
He was confident in tuna.

1755
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,977
(Hokkaido sea's rich flavor harmonized with rice)

1756
01:16:54,547 --> 01:16:56,946
- Goodness.
- And kimchi stew is amazing.

1757
01:16:56,947 --> 01:16:58,017
(You bet!)

1758
01:16:58,087 --> 01:16:59,316
Kimchi stew...

1759
01:16:59,317 --> 01:17:03,357
(It's so delicious it makes him angry.)

1760
01:17:03,927 --> 01:17:07,757
(A bite of boiled aged kimchi and pork)

1761
01:17:08,397 --> 01:17:10,767
(Impressed)

1762
01:17:11,097 --> 01:17:12,397
Kimchi stew is amazing.

1763
01:17:12,597 --> 01:17:14,597
It tastes good with any dish.

1764
01:17:15,137 --> 01:17:16,207
(Light)

1765
01:17:16,237 --> 01:17:17,306
(Savory)

1766
01:17:17,307 --> 01:17:18,537
(Rich)

1767
01:17:19,137 --> 01:17:21,977
(In the midst of Hokkaido tuna's savory and light flavors, )

1768
01:17:22,807 --> 01:17:27,117
(pork aged kimchi stew provides hot and refreshing flavor.)

1769
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:29,286
It's so much tastier.

1770
01:17:29,287 --> 01:17:32,487
(A piece of well-fermented aged kimchi)

1771
01:17:33,257 --> 01:17:35,656
(Refreshing)

1772
01:17:35,657 --> 01:17:36,657
Aged kimchi is amazing.

1773
01:17:37,257 --> 01:17:40,327
If it weren't for aged kimchi stew,

1774
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:43,227
- it might've felt a bit empty.
- I get it.

1775
01:17:44,397 --> 01:17:46,196
- Oh, dear.
- It's so nice.

1776
01:17:46,197 --> 01:17:47,737
(The dinner was more abundant than ever.)

1777
01:17:48,097 --> 01:17:49,567
Thank you so much for the food.

1778
01:17:50,367 --> 01:17:52,277
Compared to the effort you took to come here...

1779
01:17:52,807 --> 01:17:55,506
- Thank you.
- I agree. You came so far for this.

1780
01:17:55,507 --> 01:17:56,907
Thank you so much.

1781
01:17:57,347 --> 01:17:59,017
- I could've gone farther.
- What?

1782
01:17:59,517 --> 01:18:00,716
I could've gone to a farther place.

1783
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:04,047
- Really?
- Then...

1784
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:06,817
(Too much attention gets him flustered.)

1785
01:18:07,157 --> 01:18:09,086
Do you want to stay and travel with us?

1786
01:18:09,087 --> 01:18:10,256
(The hyenas' favorite question)

1787
01:18:10,257 --> 01:18:11,656
You can stay longer.

1788
01:18:11,657 --> 01:18:13,497
(Flustered)

1789
01:18:13,827 --> 01:18:16,897
But not one person said okay and stayed.

1790
01:18:16,967 --> 01:18:17,967
They all left.

1791
01:18:19,567 --> 01:18:20,636
Doesn't matter how nice it is here.

1792
01:18:20,637 --> 01:18:21,637
(We will stay longer.)

1793
01:18:21,667 --> 01:18:22,736
Let's clean up now.

1794
01:18:22,737 --> 01:18:24,966
- Okay.
- I really enjoyed the meal.

1795
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:26,007
Goodness.

1796
01:18:27,837 --> 01:18:30,376
Now, I will scrape...

1797
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:31,406
and move these there.

1798
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:32,416
Then you can clean them with sponge and soap.

1799
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:33,577
I will wash them next to you.

1800
01:18:39,457 --> 01:18:41,217
It's cool now. This place is...

1801
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:44,257
- The weather is different, right?
- It's different.

1802
01:18:46,257 --> 01:18:49,797
(The night in Hokkaido is neither cold nor hot.)

1803
01:18:50,567 --> 01:18:53,337
I haven't come to a camp site like this, with these lights.

1804
01:18:54,537 --> 01:18:57,037
- It's nice.
- I think it's going to be fun.

1805
01:18:58,607 --> 01:19:01,307
(Na Ra is busier today.)

1806
01:19:03,477 --> 01:19:07,677
(She prepared desserts for the guests.)

1807
01:19:09,617 --> 01:19:11,846
We should put on the windbreaker.

1808
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:13,616
- It's chilly.
- Yes.

1809
01:19:13,617 --> 01:19:14,657
It gets chilly quickly.

1810
01:19:14,887 --> 01:19:16,857
- It's quite chilly here.
- Yes.

1811
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:19,997
Let's start the fire.

1812
01:19:20,727 --> 01:19:21,797
Are we making the fire?

1813
01:19:21,897 --> 01:19:24,497
Yes. Making a campfire is nice even when you're older.

1814
01:19:24,697 --> 01:19:27,766
Now... You know what a fire starter is, don't you?

1815
01:19:27,767 --> 01:19:30,066
- You need it.
- This is the fire starter.

1816
01:19:30,067 --> 01:19:31,367
I will...

1817
01:19:31,837 --> 01:19:32,907
We will use the twigs.

1818
01:19:33,777 --> 01:19:35,236
(Jun Han moves quickly.)

1819
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:37,707
We will put the fire starter in the very bottom.

1820
01:19:38,447 --> 01:19:40,877
We will use one. No, you should split it.

1821
01:19:41,047 --> 01:19:44,246
- You don't know, do you?
- I don't. It's my first time.

1822
01:19:44,247 --> 01:19:45,986
- Is it your first time?
- This is his first camping trip.

1823
01:19:45,987 --> 01:19:48,056
- Is it really?
- I will split it into six pieces.

1824
01:19:48,057 --> 01:19:50,627
Yes. Split it and turn them into twigs.

1825
01:19:50,887 --> 01:19:52,656
Arrange it into the shape of a starfish.

1826
01:19:52,657 --> 01:19:54,126
(It's his first time camping, but he listens well.)

1827
01:19:54,127 --> 01:19:55,767
Now, that one. Yes.

1828
01:19:56,067 --> 01:19:59,397
And... You put it here.

1829
01:20:00,267 --> 01:20:01,367
Here.

1830
01:20:02,537 --> 01:20:05,036
Seung Hyun must know how to do it. He's done it before.

1831
01:20:05,037 --> 01:20:06,536
This? I've done it before?

1832
01:20:06,537 --> 01:20:08,307
Yes. Wait for it.

1833
01:20:08,607 --> 01:20:10,676
(Gas leaking)

1834
01:20:10,677 --> 01:20:11,876
- Hey.
- You shouldn't be inhaling it.

1835
01:20:11,877 --> 01:20:14,077
- Hey. What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

1836
01:20:14,917 --> 01:20:16,946
- You need to get the flame.
- Right.

1837
01:20:16,947 --> 01:20:18,387
You should turn it off if you don't see the flame.

1838
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:20,056
(Embarrassed)

1839
01:20:20,057 --> 01:20:21,386
- You turn it off and on again.
- I haven't done any of it before.

1840
01:20:21,387 --> 01:20:23,526
Don't use the big logs first.

1841
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:25,557
- You use the smaller one first?
- You start with the smaller ones.

1842
01:20:26,957 --> 01:20:28,857
Build it in a pyramid shape.

1843
01:20:29,667 --> 01:20:31,027
- That big one...
- There you go.

1844
01:20:31,127 --> 01:20:32,127
Okay.

1845
01:20:32,597 --> 01:20:33,636
You need the fire starter.

1846
01:20:33,637 --> 01:20:34,767
(He carefully picks up the torch again.)

1847
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:36,767
(Watching him carefully)

1848
01:20:39,107 --> 01:20:41,137
(It's on this time.)

1849
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:43,446
- To the bottom.
- Direct it to the fire starter.

1850
01:20:43,447 --> 01:20:45,106
It's a mesh.

1851
01:20:45,107 --> 01:20:46,247
(Fire pit with a mesh bottom)

1852
01:20:46,577 --> 01:20:48,177
(Anxious)

1853
01:20:48,277 --> 01:20:50,047
(Surprised)

1854
01:20:50,417 --> 01:20:52,487
It's... Goodness. It's cool.

1855
01:20:52,587 --> 01:20:53,987
(He's good now.)

1856
01:20:54,187 --> 01:20:55,587
(Amazed)

1857
01:20:56,057 --> 01:20:57,687
Nice fire.

1858
01:20:57,787 --> 01:20:59,027
- He did it.
- That's it.

1859
01:20:59,127 --> 01:21:00,157
Yes.

1860
01:21:01,127 --> 01:21:02,127
Let's take a seat now.

1861
01:21:02,627 --> 01:21:04,527
It's really easy to start the fire.

1862
01:21:05,297 --> 01:21:06,996
(The campfire warms their house.)

1863
01:21:06,997 --> 01:21:07,997
Let's take a seat.

1864
01:21:08,297 --> 01:21:11,137
It's the first campfire of the season.

1865
01:21:11,407 --> 01:21:12,407
Right.

1866
01:21:12,408 --> 01:21:14,977
(Hokkaido night calls for a cozy fire even in summer.)

1867
01:21:16,607 --> 01:21:18,707
- It's nice to stare at the fire.
- Yes.

1868
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:26,687
(Peeking)

1869
01:21:26,887 --> 01:21:29,887
You said this was good.

1870
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,026
It was super cute.

1871
01:21:32,027 --> 01:21:35,896
How cute would it be if the five of us sat...

1872
01:21:35,897 --> 01:21:36,927
- and ate this with coffee?
- Right.

1873
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:38,366
You're supposed to dip it in something.

1874
01:21:38,367 --> 01:21:40,267
- What?
- You dip it in chocolate.

1875
01:21:41,067 --> 01:21:42,067
(It's a stick biscuit you dip in chocolate.)

1876
01:21:42,068 --> 01:21:43,636
Chocolate.

1877
01:21:43,637 --> 01:21:44,967
Perfect with coffee.

1878
01:21:45,707 --> 01:21:47,777
(Loving it)

1879
01:21:48,437 --> 01:21:49,906
It's so cute.

1880
01:21:49,907 --> 01:21:53,846
The biscuit is so tiny that it's pathetic.

1881
01:21:53,847 --> 01:21:56,187
- It's pathetic.
- It's pathetic.

1882
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:59,316
- Pathetic cuteness.
- Isn't it usually...

1883
01:21:59,317 --> 01:22:00,957
- about 2.5 times longer?
- It is.

1884
01:22:01,357 --> 01:22:04,127
(The size of the biscuit is pathetic.)

1885
01:22:06,397 --> 01:22:07,627
It's like a baby snack.

1886
01:22:08,327 --> 01:22:09,666
Pathetic cuteness.

1887
01:22:09,667 --> 01:22:10,927
(Proud)

1888
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:14,667
Dong Il, Jun Han debuted in 2017.

1889
01:22:15,907 --> 01:22:17,107
He starred in the movie "Confidential Assignment."

1890
01:22:18,107 --> 01:22:20,107
- "Confidential Assignment." - "Confidential Assignment."

1891
01:22:21,477 --> 01:22:26,077
("Confidential Assignment" was his first feature film.)

1892
01:22:27,977 --> 01:22:34,587
(Since then, he's been acting consistently.)

1893
01:22:34,687 --> 01:22:36,587
When is your favorite moment as an actor?

1894
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:41,126
I love everything about it.

1895
01:22:41,127 --> 01:22:43,467
- I love preparing for a shoot.
- Really?

1896
01:22:45,597 --> 01:22:49,567
Was there any senior actor who made you uncomfortable?

1897
01:22:49,667 --> 01:22:50,767
None.

1898
01:22:51,267 --> 01:22:53,007
It's all right. We won't tell.

1899
01:22:54,107 --> 01:22:55,947
Everyone has been great.

1900
01:22:56,707 --> 01:22:58,176
(Laughing)

1901
01:22:58,177 --> 01:22:59,377
Everyone is the same.

1902
01:22:59,747 --> 01:23:01,617
- He's giving me the eyes.
- Remember when Na Ra...

1903
01:23:02,517 --> 01:23:05,347
- I'm happy. Very happy.
- Na Ra?

1904
01:23:05,987 --> 01:23:07,287
We are a great match.

1905
01:23:08,017 --> 01:23:09,827
How are you two a great match? Tell us the details.

1906
01:23:10,857 --> 01:23:12,227
(Laughing awkwardly)

1907
01:23:12,327 --> 01:23:13,857
(Thinking hard)

1908
01:23:14,727 --> 01:23:16,866
Since the first time we met, we felt comfortable.

1909
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:18,267
Why do you keep leading his answer?

1910
01:23:19,897 --> 01:23:22,397
What's wrong? Why are you doing that?

1911
01:23:22,907 --> 01:23:25,767
But really, she's...

1912
01:23:26,307 --> 01:23:28,577
- I... Stutter.
- He's stuttering.

1913
01:23:29,547 --> 01:23:31,276
(His best friend is finding it hilarious.)

1914
01:23:31,277 --> 01:23:33,947
I guess I am a little...

1915
01:23:34,577 --> 01:23:37,347
peculiar.

1916
01:23:39,517 --> 01:23:41,357
(Laughing)

1917
01:23:41,887 --> 01:23:47,426
I think Na Ra finds me funny.

1918
01:23:47,427 --> 01:23:49,027
Jun Han would...

1919
01:23:50,127 --> 01:23:52,226
sometimes speak in a very different way.

1920
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:53,766
- I know.
- He'd do something new.

1921
01:23:53,767 --> 01:23:55,907
That's what I enjoyed working with him.

1922
01:23:57,167 --> 01:24:00,007
(This happened today.)

1923
01:24:00,677 --> 01:24:02,947
(I am not sure yet.)

1924
01:24:03,547 --> 01:24:06,177
(It's an original answer.)

1925
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:10,847
(Calm)

1926
01:24:11,487 --> 01:24:14,017
(Serious)

1927
01:24:14,257 --> 01:24:17,126
(You are original.)

1928
01:24:17,127 --> 01:24:19,087
That's what I find funny.

1929
01:24:19,697 --> 01:24:22,196
You two share the same sense of humor.

1930
01:24:22,197 --> 01:24:24,396
That's why I liked working with him.

1931
01:24:24,397 --> 01:24:25,397
(They still have great chemistry even in real life.)

1932
01:24:25,797 --> 01:24:27,197
When did you debut, Seung Hyun?

1933
01:24:27,967 --> 01:24:31,707
The first-ever drama I worked on...

1934
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:34,177
was the 2007 MBC drama "H.I.T."

1935
01:24:34,577 --> 01:24:36,646
- "H.I.T." - It was a 20-episode drama.

1936
01:24:36,647 --> 01:24:40,247
I was on Episode 19...

1937
01:24:40,847 --> 01:24:45,017
as someone saying "Detective Nam," from behind Ma Dong Seok.

1938
01:24:45,517 --> 01:24:46,816
That was my first-ever...

1939
01:24:46,817 --> 01:24:49,087
- TV experience.
- Ko Hyun Jung starred in it too.

1940
01:24:51,257 --> 01:24:53,157
What got you famous then?

1941
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:58,066
It was actually "Korea-Khitan War."

1942
01:24:58,067 --> 01:24:59,397
- I was General Yang Gyu.
- Yang what?

1943
01:25:00,467 --> 01:25:02,667
I played General Yang Gyu.

1944
01:25:03,207 --> 01:25:04,237
- A period drama?
- Yes.

1945
01:25:04,607 --> 01:25:06,276
It was a huge hit.

1946
01:25:06,277 --> 01:25:08,736
- It was a cool character.
- People worshipped him.

1947
01:25:08,737 --> 01:25:11,306
Thanks to General Yang Gyu, the viewer rating was high.

1948
01:25:11,307 --> 01:25:13,617
The episodes before his death and the episode where he dies.

1949
01:25:13,917 --> 01:25:14,947
He died in a cool way.

1950
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:17,387
He died in a really cool way.

1951
01:25:17,647 --> 01:25:18,887
How did he die?

1952
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:23,856
It's because I don't want us to go through another war.

1953
01:25:23,857 --> 01:25:29,297
(He didn't want war, but he loved his countrymen.)

1954
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:34,097
Bring it on!

1955
01:25:34,967 --> 01:25:40,277
(He sacrificed himself and won against the Khitan people.)

1956
01:25:41,037 --> 01:25:42,277
We are ten steps short.

1957
01:25:42,647 --> 01:25:47,117
(He's the forgotten hero of the Korea-Khitan War.)

1958
01:25:48,247 --> 01:25:50,386
(Reminding those who only knew General Kang Kamch'an...)

1959
01:25:50,387 --> 01:25:52,547
(of General Yang Gyu, )

1960
01:25:54,117 --> 01:26:00,797
(Seung Hyun sparked the General Yang Gyu syndrome.)

1961
01:26:01,827 --> 01:26:02,867
That's what happened.

1962
01:26:03,067 --> 01:26:05,226
People went crazy on the internet...

1963
01:26:05,227 --> 01:26:08,137
over General Yang Gyu.

1964
01:26:08,597 --> 01:26:11,106
Then suddenly... It was only a short time apart.

1965
01:26:11,107 --> 01:26:12,466
It was only a short time apart.

1966
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:14,406
"Good Partner" came out right away.

1967
01:26:14,407 --> 01:26:15,407
So...

1968
01:26:15,477 --> 01:26:17,777
All of a sudden, people hated me.

1969
01:26:18,307 --> 01:26:19,307
- So...
- Right.

1970
01:26:19,947 --> 01:26:22,476
I posted this on social media.

1971
01:26:22,477 --> 01:26:23,817
I was being cursed too much.

1972
01:26:24,187 --> 01:26:25,847
I posted General Yang Gyu's photo...

1973
01:26:26,657 --> 01:26:29,527
and said they should remember General Yang Gyu when they're upset.

1974
01:26:31,187 --> 01:26:33,227
And you put up a nationwide apology too.

1975
01:26:33,627 --> 01:26:34,726
And I put up a nationwide apology too.

1976
01:26:34,727 --> 01:26:35,856
Was it that bad?

1977
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:38,366
Yes. "Good Partner" was a huge hit.

1978
01:26:38,367 --> 01:26:39,966
He was cursed a lot because of it.

1979
01:26:39,967 --> 01:26:40,967
(It was because the drama was a huge hit.)

1980
01:26:40,968 --> 01:26:42,807
I was grateful.

1981
01:26:43,607 --> 01:26:45,067
(This is so fun.)

1982
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:47,137
Na Ra has never looked happier.

1983
01:26:48,237 --> 01:26:50,306
She's different because her friends are here.

1984
01:26:50,307 --> 01:26:52,477
(Smiling brightly)

1985
01:26:53,547 --> 01:26:57,117
(What fun things will they do with friends?)

1986
01:26:59,017 --> 01:27:01,056
(The face of summer Hokkaido)

1987
01:27:01,057 --> 01:27:04,186
(Come with us and see it.)

1988
01:27:04,187 --> 01:27:05,356
Can you see the flowers well?

1989
01:27:05,357 --> 01:27:09,027
(They will see the colorful flower hill...)

1990
01:27:09,627 --> 01:27:11,727
(and a lake with mysterious water color.)

1991
01:27:12,667 --> 01:27:14,297
(Following Dong Il, the king of walking, )

1992
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:18,107
(they will find a hidden view spot.)

1993
01:27:18,767 --> 01:27:21,007
(When it rains for the first time, )

1994
01:27:21,477 --> 01:27:22,846
(they will stay calm...)

1995
01:27:22,847 --> 01:27:24,747
(and wait for Na Ra's pasta.)

1996
01:27:25,247 --> 01:27:27,477
(Na Ra cooks for the first time for her friends.)

1997
01:27:28,217 --> 01:27:29,517
(Using two pans skillfully, )

1998
01:27:29,847 --> 01:27:31,747
(Chef Jang creates her warm debut work.)

1999
01:27:31,947 --> 01:27:33,017
It's so good.

2000
01:27:33,317 --> 01:27:35,487
(Will her food be able to satisfy the family?)

2001
01:27:35,887 --> 01:27:37,256
(After eating this, )

2002
01:27:37,257 --> 01:27:38,386
(we should reveal the 20,000-dollar...)

2003
01:27:38,387 --> 01:27:39,427
(What?)

2004
01:27:39,597 --> 01:27:40,696
(The 20,000-dollar...)

2005
01:27:40,697 --> 01:27:42,427
(What?)

2006
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:46,437
(The smell is powerful enough to overwhelm them.)

2007
01:27:47,437 --> 01:27:49,507
(It will make them go for it even before cutting.)

2008
01:27:51,407 --> 01:27:54,077
(It will mesmerize the entire family.)

2009
01:27:54,907 --> 01:27:57,107
(The biggest day ever is coming.)

2010
01:28:00,777 --> 01:28:03,017
(Sung Dong Il)

2011
01:28:03,117 --> 01:28:05,217
(Kim Hee Won, Jang Na Ra)

2012
01:28:09,457 --> 01:28:12,757
(House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean)
