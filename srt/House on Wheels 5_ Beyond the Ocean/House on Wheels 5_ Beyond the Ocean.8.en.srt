1
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,440
(Sung Dong Il)

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,980
(Kim Hee Won, Jang Na Ra)

3
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,820
(House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean)

4
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,589
(After fishing in the wilderness...)

5
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,090
(with Hye Young, Dong Il's handful daughter)

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,100
(They're expecting another guest.)

7
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,499
(Someone is crossing the dead zone without signal.)

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,740
There's no signal here, so they won't receive my call.

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,240
Hello? Yes, it's me.

10
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,080
I'm almost there.

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,480
There's no signal here.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,849
I know. The call didn't go through,

13
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,280
and I'm talking to myself.

14
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,249
The call doesn't get through.

15
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,120
(Laughing)

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,320
You got fooled. You thought that I called them.

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,699
(Without knowing anything)

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,360
- We're going to the supermarket.
- Turn right.

19
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,970
Turn right.

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,439
We'll buy marshmallows...

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,640
- And soda.
- and soda.

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,170
What else do we need?

23
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:24,680
It’s not strange despite the direction changes.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,880
But going there alone was very strange.

25
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,710
Thank you.

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,320
We'll buy marshmallows.

27
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,219
(Dancing)

28
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,660
- Suddenly, my mouth is watering.
- There's a lot of food here.

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,419
Suddenly, my mouth is watering.

30
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,790
There's a lot of bread too.

31
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,690
Oh, my gosh.

32
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,400
(At that time...)

33
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,000
(Someone from the wild heads heading to the convenience store.)

34
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,780
How much is it?

35
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:02,410
(The doorbell rings.)

36
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,179
(The doorbell rings as if someone came in.)

37
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,180
(They have no idea.)

38
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:06,280
Mint soda?

39
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,049
It would be easier to drink that mint chocolate.

40
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,220
Mint soda?

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,919
Mint soda sounds okay.

42
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,029
Should I try this one?

43
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,189
Try it.

44
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,630
- Soda.
- Soda?

45
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,760
- With soda...
- This is really...

46
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,870
- With soda...
- This is really...

47
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,340
(Stumbling out of surprise)

48
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,640
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

49
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,609
- Nice to meet you.
- Gosh.

50
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,039
It's good to see you.

51
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,880
- Mi Ran, pick a drink.
- Hello.

52
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,449
I got all the groceries already.

53
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,450
Really?

54
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,620
(In "Reply 1988," Hye Young played as Dong Il's handful daughter...)

55
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,890
(who even tamed the “cheetah lady” next door.)

56
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,890
(Now they even travel abroad together.)

57
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,699
(Real friends in reality)

58
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,730
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

59
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,900
(She became close to Dong Il and Hee Won like family.)

60
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,539
What's wrong?

61
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,370
(Ra Mi Ran, a guest for life at House on Wheels)

62
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,709
(You're here.)

63
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,710
Hello.

64
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:05,740
It's nice to meet you.

65
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,250
- Now...
- From here...

66
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,180
It takes two minutes to get here by car.

67
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,149
- Did you two come here together?
- Yes.

68
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,350
(Saying hello politely after a violent hug)

69
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Did they send you here?

70
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,559
- They're cooking.
- Right.

71
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,589
- Really?
- We came out to have fun.

72
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,660
- They're cooking?
- Yes.

73
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,130
I should make something delicious for Mi Ran.

74
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,829
- They're cooking?
- Yes.

75
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,000
- They sent us out to have fun.
- What are you going to buy?

76
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,499
- We're here to buy soda.
- Soda...

77
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,270
and marshmallows. We'll make a fire.

78
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,539
S'more?

79
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,339
(She picks it up right away.)

80
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,910
What don't we buy this instead?

81
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,709
It's delicious with potato chips.

82
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,710
(Surprised)

83
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:44,050
You know a lot about food.

84
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,249
- You know a lot about food.
- On potato chips...

85
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,920
Potato chips are over here.

86
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,749
Let's get a consomme flavor and this one too.

87
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,850
- Okay.
- Okay.

88
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,159
(Like possessed, they add another bag of potato chips.)

89
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,260
- Do you have eggs?
- We have eggs.

90
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,329
You must have side dishes too.

91
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,470
- Yes, we have a lot of things.
- Okay.

92
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,700
That should be fine.

93
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,910
- Is there anything else you'd like?
- In France...

94
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,670
Something else? No, it's okay.

95
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,039
- Bananas, then?
- Morning apples.

96
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,710
- I want to eat apples.
- Apples.

97
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,150
Here they are. Let's see.

98
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,590
- Should we have tangerines?
- No.

99
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,789
- No.
- In the morning.

100
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,820
No.

101
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,790
- Morning pineapples.
- No.

102
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,230
(Sad)

103
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,530
(Trying not to laugh)

104
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:39,840
(Ms. Cheetah is keeping her handful daughter in check.)

105
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,610
- Okay.
- Okay?

106
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,980
There are Maitake mushrooms.

107
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,249
- Hey.
- These look nice.

108
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,550
(Really wanting them)

109
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,049
- Let's get one of these.
- We can eat mushrooms with meat.

110
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,419
- Mushrooms?
- Maitake mushrooms.

111
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,689
- Okay.
- Oh, different mushrooms.

112
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,790
(Laughing)

113
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,530
Oh, driving.

114
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,300
(Shy)

115
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,469
Na Ra's...

116
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,770
Oh, are you a good driver?

117
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,809
- I'm good at following...
- Best driver.

118
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,010
(Shyly laughing)

119
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,809
I'm a bit...

120
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,279
(Getting too much praise is tough for introverts.)

121
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,710
I find it hard when using GPS.

122
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,119
We've never met before, right?

123
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,379
- Not even once, right?
- Right.

124
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,449
- Right?
- Right.

125
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:32,120
(It was quite an intense first encounter.)

126
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,589
(Excited about having a new friend)

127
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,389
(Du-du-du)

128
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,500
(Du-du-du-du)

129
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,070
Sadly, I can't back up well.

130
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,130
Just don't back up into a well.

131
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,240
(Oh, gosh)

132
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,840
(She can praise anything.)

133
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,109
- That was funny.
- Was that nice?

134
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,110
Yes.

135
00:05:51,111 --> 00:05:52,480
(She can praise anything too.)

136
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,609
(Proud)

137
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,210
It took you so long, right?

138
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,980
(Sighing)

139
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,220
You almost passed out on the way here, right?

140
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,290
I took off at 6am this morning from Seoul.

141
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,659
- Dong Il and Hee Won kept saying...
- I've been on the road...

142
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,289
for 12 hours now.

143
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,429
(It's 6pm right now.)

144
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,790
I've been on the move this whole time.

145
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,800
On the way here,

146
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,299
- I saw that supermarket.
- Right.

147
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,240
I found a specialty product of Hokkaido.

148
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,270
- You bought something.
- I bought a specialty product...

149
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,010
- from that supermarket.
- Oh, my.

150
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,139
That's nice.

151
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,639
Mostly snacks Hye Young would like.

152
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,680
I love that.

153
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,849
Na Ra loves snacks too.

154
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,779
- Really? Snacks?
- Yes, I do too.

155
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,849
(Sweet Tooth Sisters)

156
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,049
I'm glad you two met.

157
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,289
She always said to me, "Just try this one."

158
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,690
"This one is really delicious." Then, I said, "Hey, it's so sweet!"

159
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,200
- "It's too sweet." - "Mi Ran, just try a bite."

160
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,829
"No! It looks so sweet."

161
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,530
- Do you not really like sweets?
- No.

162
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,770
- I love sweets.
- I see.

163
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,969
I think she's on a higher level than me.

164
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,109
No, I can't eat too much either.

165
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,910
I just like buying them.

166
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,979
- I like looking at them.
- Right.

167
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,820
I like buying and collecting them.

168
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,620
I also like seeing others eat them.

169
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,249
- Totally.
- Like watching a baby?

170
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,320
Yes, there's a happiness in that.

171
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,919
The joy of feeding someone.

172
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,459
(That's my expertise.)

173
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,460
We're here now.

174
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,030
It's close.

175
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,899
Oh, it's a campsite.

176
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,229
- Yes.
- That's good.

177
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,830
(After chatting a bit, they're already at the front yard.)

178
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,340
Oh, my. This...

179
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,239
I think this is the best thing we've had in Japan yet.

180
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,509
- Really?
- Of course.

181
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,410
(What are they cooking?)

182
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,489
- Go get some aged kimchi.
- Okay.

183
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,620
- Aged kimchi?
- Yes.

184
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,219
(Aged kimchi, pork belly)

185
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,990
(The first dish for tonight's dinner uses pork belly and aged kimchi.)

186
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,829
I want to eat braised pork and aged kimchi.

187
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,600
(She put in the order.)

188
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,610
That's what I'm talking about.

189
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,779
That's how we should've made it before.

190
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,809
(On the nicely seared pork belly, )

191
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,850
(pour some water.)

192
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,789
I brought this aged kimchi from Gangjin.

193
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,860
(The aged kimchi from Gangjin is working hard as usual.)

194
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,760
This has to be good.

195
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,730
(By the red color, you already know it's going to be delicious.)

196
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,470
My gosh. This smells good.

197
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,070
Oh, my gosh.

198
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,240
I can already tell this is going to be delicious.

199
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,240
Seriously, I can already tell.

200
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,840
- That looks pretty good, right?
- Yes.

201
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,309
I think this is the best thing we've had in Japan yet.

202
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,310
(The aged kimchi really stimulates your appetite.)

203
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,580
- Is that the car coming in?
- Where?

204
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,690
- It must be them in the car.
- You're right. It's Mi Ran.

205
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,859
Mi Ran is here.

206
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,219
Best driver.

207
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,230
(Laughing)

208
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,329
(The car with Ra Mi Ran has come to House on Wheels!)

209
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,360
Let's go greet them.

210
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,300
Where's Mi Ran?

211
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,400
Oh, gosh.

212
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,400
Mi Ran.

213
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,839
(Throwing her leg up)

214
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,210
Oh, goodness. I'm glad you're here.

215
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,180
(Throwing her leg up)

216
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,810
Oh, goodness. I'm glad you're here.

217
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,079
Dong Il, please take her.

218
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,980
- Help me.
- He can't carry me anymore.

219
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,450
(Like when she came to House on Wheels 5 years ago)

220
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,249
He can't carry me anymore.

221
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,559
(They greet each other with a hug like last time.)

222
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,560
- Your back is too weak now.
- Mi Ran. Come here.

223
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,230
- Come here.
- I'm so glad you're here.

224
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,460
- Go here. Stand here.
- Okay.

225
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,930
- Stand here. Hee Won, come here.
- Okay.

226
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,469
- Should we get on our knees?
- Thank you for coming all this way.

227
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,110
Thank you so much, Mi Ran.

228
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,509
We asked you to come, but I feel so bad.

229
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,409
- Right. It's so far.
- Seriously.

230
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,209
- It was very far.
- Seriously.

231
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,480
It felt like going to Europe.

232
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,549
- It was so far, right?
- Thank you so much.

233
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,819
- Yes.
- Thank you.

234
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,619
- Of course. I came to see you guys.
- Right?

235
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,659
Thank you so much.

236
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,419
Who knows what would've happened to me if I didn't come?

237
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,660
(Laughing)

238
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,799
- No, seriously.
- Thank you so much.

239
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,259
Even after inviting you,

240
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,970
Hee Won and I kept talking about it for days.

241
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,930
Are you sore anywhere?

242
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,599
- Sit down.
- Sit here.

243
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,740
Sit down, Mi Ran. Let's sit down and chat.

244
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,339
- Stretch out your legs.
- Hye Young.

245
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,079
- Yes.
- Take a seat next to Mi Ran.

246
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,549
Hee Won, let them stretch out their legs on your back.

247
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,550
Okay, Dong Il.

248
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,779
Get down and let them stretch out their legs on your back.

249
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,549
There's not enough space. I'm sorry.

250
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,690
I'm serious.

251
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,019
Mi Ran. Why did you become so much lighter?

252
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,730
- What?
- Did you lose weight?

253
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,960
- Hee Won...
- It was so easy to lift you.

254
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,599
I told you I was on a diet when we were filming " Hi-FIVE."

255
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,030
- Exactly. Dong Il.
- I thought she was sick...

256
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,869
because she lost so much weight.

257
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,670
- Not that much.
- I can't lift most women...

258
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,340
- She's so light.
- Exactly.

259
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,839
When I lifted her earlier...

260
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,110
You didn't think you'd be able to, did you?

261
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,109
(While they continue to tell their happy stories...)

262
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,550
- Seriously.
- You know I... Oh, gosh!

263
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,479
- Oh, gosh!
- What is it?

264
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,249
Your fart smell just came to me.

265
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,660
Dong Il. She traveled 12 hours to come here.

266
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,389
I'll smell the fire instead.

267
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,060
(Neutralizing the fart with the smell of the fire)

268
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,799
(Dong Il ran away.)

269
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,440
Hey, her pants are stuck.

270
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,410
Her pants are stuck.

271
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,409
Why did you get your pants stuck?

272
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,979
- They just got stuck...
- Hey, Dong Il just...

273
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
(Total chaos)

274
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,110
Dong Il farted because he was startled.

275
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,420
Oh, gosh.

276
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,320
Anyway, I couldn't bring anything...

277
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,759
when I came here, so I...

278
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,419
Hey, Mi Ran. You didn't need to bring us anything.

279
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,689
- We're just happy to have you here.
- I just got...

280
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,200
some things from the supermarket.

281
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,769
Apparently, these are products you can only find in Hokkaido.

282
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,839
- Really?
- Supermarket specialty products.

283
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,600
We've had lots of those,

284
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,339
but if you brought them... Is that makgeolli?

285
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,969
- Makgeolli?
- No.

286
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,879
- Milk?
- It's yogurt liquor.

287
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,910
(This is new, right?)

288
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,610
- Yogurt liquor.
- Yogurt liquor?

289
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:04,079
- There's yogurt liquor?
- It's a specialty product here.

290
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,179
- I see.
- Nice.

291
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,680
- Milk for tomorrow morning.
- Milk.

292
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:11,249
Slightly healthy cereal. And not healthy cereal.

293
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,319
(Mi Ran's housewarming gifts)

294
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,519
Snacks for Hye Young.

295
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,729
(The gifts just keep on coming!)

296
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,429
I think this is partially cooked.

297
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,530
- We could grill that.
- This is cheese.

298
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,830
This is toast for tomorrow morning.

299
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,100
I brought just some Camembert...

300
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,110
and orange jam.

301
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,110
(Mi Ran's housewarming gifts made our house more bountiful.)

302
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,810
Let's sit. Wait. Hold on.

303
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,779
Everyone, sit down.

304
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,819
(Seeing all of the gifts made Dong Il want to hurry.)

305
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
You're hungry, right, Mi Ran? Today,

306
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,020
I'll make you every food there is in the world.

307
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,930
I'm being serious.

308
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,800
Tuna. Tuna fillet.

309
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,470
(Urchin roe they bought in Yoichi)

310
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,369
This area is famous for Wagyu.

311
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,070
We went and bought some famous Wagyu ourselves.

312
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,110
(He'll serve every delicious food they've had in Hokkaido!)

313
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,779
Oh, my. I think I can smell some delicious jjigae.

314
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,420
I brought kimchi aged for two years from Gangjin,

315
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,719
- from a place I know.
- Gangjin, South Jeolla Province?

316
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,119
Yes. I brought 40kg of it. We're surviving off of that.

317
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,690
- I see.
- Today, Hye Young said...

318
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,060
she wanted to eat braised aged kimchi.

319
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,799
(My gosh!)

320
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,060
What did you put in here? Oh, my gosh.

321
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,099
(Gasping)

322
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,170
Over here.

323
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,209
(Slurping)

324
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,340
We just have to cook it down a bit more.

325
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,610
Oh, my gosh.

326
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,719
It's so delicious.

327
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,420
(Happy)

328
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,520
- This with just rice is enough.
- Yes.

329
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,659
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

330
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,960
- Make sushi.
- Okay.

331
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,700
Mi Ran.

332
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,400
- Hee Won is great at making sushi.
- What?

333
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,870
Hee Won is.

334
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,299
- No, I'm not.
- Does he know how to do things now?

335
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,340
- Yes.
- No.

336
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,270
(Laughing)

337
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,779
There's nothing he knows how to do.

338
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,310
You're right.

339
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,349
(Hokkaido's Sushi King starts cooking.)

340
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,750
- This may be the only thing...
- You can make sushi?

341
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,790
- Gosh.
- Here's the tray.

342
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,220
Gosh, I've not expected...

343
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,589
I'd be able to see you cook in my lifetime.

344
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,289
Mi Ran, can you pass me a big dish?

345
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,430
(An unusual scene she didn't expect to see)

346
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,970
- Did the rice cook well?
- Yes, it did.

347
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,500
Here. Try a bit of it.

348
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,279
- Good, isn't it?
- It cooked perfectly for sushi.

349
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,180
- Mi Ran, look under the sink.
- Yes?

350
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,750
This much should do.

351
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:52,480
Are there wet wipes, Mi Ran?

352
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,290
- Wet wipes?
- We do have wet wipes.

353
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,890
- Where?
- Here.

354
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,359
- Thank you.
- When you store wet wipes,

355
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,989
store them like this and not like this.

356
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,060
- To keep it moist.
- To keep it moist?

357
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,100
Gosh, you've become a housekeeper.

358
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,469
I happened to see it in shorts.

359
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,569
(5 years of House on Wheels has made Hee Won a housekeeper!)

360
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,239
I never thought a day would come when Hee Won would teach...

361
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,440
how to store wet wipes.

362
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,969
(He finds it hilarious too.)

363
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,110
This...

364
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,939
(Housekeeping King starts making sushi.)

365
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,110
Hey, Hye Young.

366
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,049
- Do you need help?
- Did you take the cooking oil?

367
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,719
Yes, someone took it outside.

368
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,020
Then I can use olive oil.

369
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,790
It's because the rice sticks to the gloves.

370
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,430
To mix the rice.

371
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,790
On the hand?

372
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,730
Just a tad bit. That's enough.

373
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,840
Is olive oil normally this sticky?

374
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,039
It's oligosaccharide.

375
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,709
Oh, dear. I didn't know it was oligosaccharide.

376
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,979
Wash it off.

377
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,309
I thought it was olive oil.

378
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,880
You brought oligosaccharide.

379
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,510
Isn't oligosaccharide sweet?

380
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,549
No wonder it was sticky.

381
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,919
How about perilla oil?

382
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,220
- Yes, that works.
- Perilla oil, right?

383
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,259
(Perilla oil)

384
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,559
- Good. Yes, it should be oily.
- Right?

385
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,560
(Sushi making is back on track thanks to Hye Young's support.)

386
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,800
It's hot.

387
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
It's so hot.

388
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,230
So hot.

389
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,740
So hot.

390
00:16:20,741 --> 00:16:23,139
(Despite it, the Sushi King does his best.)

391
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,170
It's hot.

392
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,209
(Meanwhile, Dong Il is busy before the griddle.)

393
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,280
Hey, Mi Ran.

394
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,880
Mi Ran, look at the beef.

395
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,349
Oh, my gosh. Shall I try it raw?

396
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,359
Go ahead.

397
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,390
(For Mi Ran who came from afar, Dong Il prepared...)

398
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,400
(beef from Biei, the paradise of dairy farming.)

399
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,669
Is this stone? Is it a stone grill?

400
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,100
- It looks like one.
- It's actually ceramic.

401
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,699
- It's a griddle.
- A griddle?

402
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,139
I kept taking care of it...

403
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,039
- while using it.
- The griddle looks thick.

404
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,069
It's really thick.

405
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,810
It's too heavy to lift. I'm serious.

406
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,819
Gosh, didn't you visit Italy multiple times? Really, Mi Ran.

407
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,820
(Miming)

408
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,420
- Mi Ran.
- Yes?

409
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,390
You know how you guys will put CG on it?

410
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,029
(Sure thing.)

411
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,760
Before you came,

412
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,830
- Yes?
- here's what I told Na Ra,

413
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,339
"Mi Ran takes on funny roles,"

414
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,309
"but she's actually very dignified and quiet."

415
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,439
- Really?
- Yes.

416
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,739
(Dignified and quiet Mi Ran)

417
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,610
I should take back what I said.

418
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,310
- She hasn't seen me yet.
- Not yet?

419
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,920
Okay, got it.

420
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,619
(Washing the vegetables, Na Ra missed Mi Ran's true nature.)

421
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,019
- Is that the sink?
- No.

422
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,089
You will get chances to do the dishes tomorrow. Go take a seat.

423
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,329
(Na Ra returns from washing the vegetables)

424
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,160
Here are the washed vegetables.

425
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:56,970
(The fresh vegetables washed by Na Ra are ready!)

426
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,440
Like oil?

427
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,480
That's not lard.

428
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,410
(It's a broccoli.)

429
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,249
You know how you use radish before making jeon?

430
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,490
Did you turn the stove off?

431
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,119
For what?

432
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,759
- The braised kimchi. Go check.
- I turned it off.

433
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,019
- You did?
- I'll go get it.

434
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,030
(Throwing in some butter)

435
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,260
This is a super luxurious barbecue party.

436
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,529
(The buttery aroma spreads on the griddle.)

437
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,730
This is beyond my imagination.

438
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,940
- It's been a while.
- The smell of butter.

439
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,970
Oh, my gosh.

440
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:38,679
(Getting excited with the aroma of butter)

441
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,810
You're dropping everything.

442
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:47,350
(Throwing in the vegetables washed by Na Ra into the butter)

443
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,650
You must really love it, Mi Ran.

444
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,159
Mi Ran loves activities like this one.

445
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
(In bliss)

446
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,389
(An unexpected happiness brought by the griddle)

447
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,690
It's just like...

448
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,930
letting the fox guard the henhouse.

449
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,330
Like asking the fox to guard the henhouse.

450
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,630
I keep dropping them.

451
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:06,970
Is that so?

452
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:08,140
- In front.
- Yes, right here.

453
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,609
Good. It's best to be careful.

454
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,710
(Fidgeting)

455
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,380
Have some cheese, Dong Il.

456
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,379
- The one in front?
- The one we bought?

457
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,449
(Sharing snacks with the cooks)

458
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,080
Isn't it tasty and spicy?

459
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,950
- It's really good.
- Here's some cheese.

460
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,589
Try the cheese.

461
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,589
- It's my favorite, Na Ra.
- It's delicious.

462
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,620
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

463
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,389
Why didn't you cut this one?

464
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,730
(While eating the cheese from Na Ra)

465
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,829
(The vegetables are getting cooked on the hot griddle.)

466
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,770
How did you come up with the griddle?

467
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,010
Push all of it to the side.

468
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,650
Do we have it raw?

469
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,549
Let's have it as sushi. Don't eat it plain.

470
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,890
(The next teppan dish is tuna from Sapporo!)

471
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,360
- All done?
- Yes, give me a second.

472
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,690
- Tataki.
- Yes, tataki. You grill it.

473
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,000
- Tuna tataki.
- That's right.

474
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,639
(Grilling the outside of the thick tuna meat to eat as steak)

475
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
All good, right?

476
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,840
With you here, Mi Ran, I feel reassured.

477
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,779
- Hee Won, go and make sushi.
- Yes?

478
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,780
Okay.

479
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,849
- And remember our grill?
- Yes.

480
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,349
- The one we used for the meat.
- Yes.

481
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,889
Warm it up.

482
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,720
- Okay.
- Good.

483
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,830
Okay.

484
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,160
At least he understands what you say.

485
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,829
Hee Won has really matured.

486
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,070
- Exactly.
- Right?

487
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,170
He has changed.

488
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:47,070
Yes, Hee Won has changed.

489
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,779
(The Sushi King is open for business.)

490
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,110
(Wasabi)

491
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,479
Can I watch you from here?

492
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,719
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

493
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,820
Don't do a thing, Mi Ran.

494
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,619
(Mi Ran came over to watch.)

495
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,090
Isn't it one per person?

496
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,159
Hee Won, it's 222 pieces of rice, right?

497
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,559
- Even if you're my daughter.
- Oh, my gosh.

498
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,190
It's supposed to be 280.

499
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,530
What a weird shape.

500
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,099
No, the shape doesn't matter to us. It's okay.

501
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,569
- Hee Won, it looks like...
- Well done.

502
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,599
Someone dropped it.

503
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,540
- Right, like snot.
- Yes.

504
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,739
It's because there's not enough rice to make it hold its shape.

505
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,009
(The Sushi King has yet to master the visual part.)

506
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,010
Hurry up.

507
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:30,050
(It's just funny to Mi Ran.)

508
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,479
(The A-grade beef is on the griddle.)

509
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,620
I'm going to cook it with a torch.

510
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,600
(The torch is on.)

511
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,099
(With the heat from the griddle for the bottom...)

512
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,600
(and the torch for the top, )

513
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,740
(the Griddle King has conquered both the smokiness and the show.)

514
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:04,010
(Grill mine too.)

515
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,819
(2 beef sushi)

516
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,120
Gosh, the show is...

517
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,960
Why is Hee Won holding that up?

518
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,289
- To put it on there?
- To torch it.

519
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,490
No, to torch it.

520
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:17,990
The sushi?

521
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:19,929
- Yes.
- It's raw.

522
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,000
- These.
- I see.

523
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,699
- So you're smoking them.
- Yes.

524
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,000
(Torching the raw sushi)

525
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,470
Oh, no.

526
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,480
Don't worry. The inside is still raw.

527
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,249
- It'll go on top.
- Gently.

528
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,610
(A mouthwatering visual)

529
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,349
I can't... I have to stop eating.

530
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,050
It looks amazing.

531
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,090
Right?

532
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:51,459
(The beef is about to be done!)

533
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,529
- Bring the grill over.
- What?

534
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,530
The grill.

535
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,500
Place it over there.

536
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,639
(While the dishes are being done, )

537
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
All set.

538
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,309
(what are the sweet tooth sisters doing?)

539
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,510
Is there anything more you need?

540
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,550
This is the soy sauce we bought earlier.

541
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,020
I want to smell it.

542
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,020
This is that very soy sauce.

543
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,820
Urchin soy sauce. Uni soy sauce.

544
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,890
- The urchin roe must be in it.
- Yes.

545
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,890
- But it's soy sauce, right?
- Yes.

546
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,830
(Before leaving Biei, they stopped by...)

547
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:31,600
(100-year-old soy sauce brewery with over 100 varieties.)

548
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,140
(From the rare cherry blossom soy sauce...)

549
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,140
(It's the soy sauce to spread on bread.)

550
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,239
(to the good-value urchin roe soy sauce)

551
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,480
(We don't need to buy urchin roe.)

552
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,009
(After sampling them carefully)

553
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,680
(It's not a perfume.)

554
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,290
Yes, it's this one!

555
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,320
(They chose 4 soy sauces for the guests!)

556
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,829
- The color is...
- It has a rich flavor.

557
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,890
Try it.

558
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,700
If you buy one bottle...

559
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,130
This smells like vegetables.

560
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,140
- That must've been green onions.
- What is it?

561
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,700
This one is the bomb.

562
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,410
Try a bit of it.

563
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,069
- This is just urchin roe.
- That alone would be delicious...

564
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,580
enough in my opinion.

565
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,510
It's very good.

566
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,310
(How is it?)

567
00:24:17,311 --> 00:24:18,850
Isn't it good?

568
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,820
- The umami flavor is incredible.
- Amazing, right?

569
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,590
- But it's soy sauce, right?
- Yes.

570
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,220
It's more than just tasty.

571
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:27,960
It's like...

572
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,089
Let's take these outside,

573
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,530
- place them next to the dishes, - Okay.

574
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,300
- and eat them together.
- I'm in.

575
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,200
All right, let's sit.

576
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,300
- Hold on.
- "Hold on."

577
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,170
Sprinkle some sesame.

578
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,910
(Mi Ran finds the sight of Hee Won hilarious.)

579
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,179
It looks delicious.

580
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,450
(After sprinkling some sesame on top of the urchin roe...)

581
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,280
(The salmon roe is waiting.)

582
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,749
Salmon roe.

583
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,249
(Topping it with salmon roe as much as the guest wants)

584
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,889
Pour some soy sauce and it's done, right?

585
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,720
There are four types of soy sauce.

586
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,859
We bought some soy sauce that might suit your taste.

587
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,290
Try a bit of the soy sauce.

588
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,330
- These are the soy sauces?
- Yes.

589
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,499
- The soy sauces are...
- Is this soy sauce too?

590
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,329
- That was garlic or...
- It's onion soy sauce.

591
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,099
- It could be onion soy sauce.
- Onion soy sauce.

592
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,339
Urchin roe soy sauce.

593
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,110
That one is really good, Mi Ran.

594
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,569
- Is it?
- Yes.

595
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,769
(Rich flavor, urchin roe soy sauce, highly recommended by Na Ra)

596
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,180
- It smells rich.
- It must be a little salty.

597
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,010
(Exclaiming)

598
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,750
(Making sound effect)

599
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,920
Oh, my gosh.

600
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,220
Urchin roe soy sauce.

601
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,360
My mouth...

602
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,490
- It looks good.
- is watering.

603
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,589
(Making Mi Ran get up)

604
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,660
It looks delicious.

605
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,699
(The table might break.)

606
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,830
(A table of Hokkaido's delicacies)

607
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,529
(Tuna from Sapporo, urchin roe from Yoichi, wagyu from Biei)

608
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,670
These are...

609
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,910
(Teppan wagyu and vegetables, straight from the Biei farm)

610
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:54,310
(Whole tuna teppan received from Sapporo)

611
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,650
(A table of teppan dishes made with the best quality ingredients)

612
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,320
Look at this. Look at the visual of the food.

613
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,290
Unbelievable.

614
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,359
The dried seaweed...

615
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,359
- is made by Na Ra's mother.
- Yes.

616
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,389
Really?

617
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,890
(Grilled wagyu rice bowl with dried seaweed from Na Ra's mother)

618
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,100
(A spicy appetizer)

619
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,169
This might be the best dish.

620
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,699
(Even Dong Il's number 1 dish, braised aged kimchi with pork too)

621
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,140
It looks delicious.

622
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,339
- It looks delicious - Gosh.

623
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,609
(A table full of Hokkaido ingredients)

624
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,709
Try the sushi first. The beef sushi.

625
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,710
- Okay.
- Okay.

626
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,679
(Wagyu sushi smoked right before the meal with love)

627
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,549
(Warm)

628
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,320
- What's this?
- Thank you for the meal.

629
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,520
- Cheers.
- Try that one first.

630
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,689
(Eating the fist-sized sushi whole)

631
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,530
(Their cheeks are stuffed.)

632
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,799
How's the beef so tender?

633
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,200
(Mumbling)

634
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,369
- It's smoky.
- Sorry?

635
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,830
- The smokiness.
- Right.

636
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,100
I can taste it.

637
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,569
It's for you two.

638
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,699
(It's good, right?)

639
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,710
Delicious.

640
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,739
(Worked up the appetite with the welcome food)

641
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,080
- Not bad, right? Keep it there.
- Okay.

642
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,279
This has tuna and all sorts.

643
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,849
(Trying the rice bowl topped with...)

644
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,550
(urchin roe from Yoichi and salmon roe)

645
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,649
(Admiring the spoonful first)

646
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,790
It looks great.

647
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,719
(Eating a spoonful of urchin roe and salmon roe)

648
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,430
(Emptying the spoon)

649
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,160
(How is it, my handful daughter?)

650
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,630
(Putting the spoon down)

651
00:27:20,631 --> 00:27:22,470
(You're the best, Dad.)

652
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,169
- Shall we dig in?
- Go ahead.

653
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,239
- Did you pour soy sauce on it?
- Yes.

654
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,539
Make sure to pour some in.

655
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,039
(A roe party inside the mouth)

656
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,739
- It's good, right?
- Yes, absolutely.

657
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,740
Amazing, isn't it?

658
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:33,579
The saltiness of the salmon roe.

659
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,379
(The salty salmon roe that's chewy and popping)

660
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,609
The urchin roe soy sauce is incredible.

661
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,380
(The umami-rich urchin roe soy sauce really plays a role!)

662
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,449
(Mi Ran calmly makes a tower.)

663
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,759
(Egg yolk)

664
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,090
(Dried seaweed flakes)

665
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:51,629
(Even if it's a bite, she puts in a lot of effort.)

666
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,100
Take a tuna each.

667
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,030
How is it?

668
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,869
Wait.

669
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,900
The shiso.

670
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,739
(As soon as she says it, )

671
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,610
(Dong Il gets up.)

672
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,740
(I love shiso.)

673
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,680
A.M.A.

674
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,919
A man of action.

675
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,690
(A man of action)

676
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,720
Thank you.

677
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Thank you.

678
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:21,889
(Shiso looks like Korean perilla leaf.)

679
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:22,960
This is a must.

680
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,960
I'm going to make a ssam.

681
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,329
With some urchin roe.

682
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,730
(A mountain of urchin roe on a shiso ssam)

683
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,300
Unique, right?

684
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,170
- We could boil it too.
- Delicious, right?

685
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,870
It's aromatic.

686
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,410
(Cutting the stalk off)

687
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,540
(Aromatic)

688
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,050
(Is it that good?)

689
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,889
(An endless refill of salmon roe)

690
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,650
(Happy)

691
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,490
How luxurious.

692
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,489
(Dig in, Hye Young.)

693
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,660
Good job.

694
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,899
You're really digging into the kaisendon.

695
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,960
Yes.

696
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,399
(Today, she's the daughter of a rich family.)

697
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,140
(In bliss)

698
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,640
(Dad is feeling proud.)

699
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,180
It's good.

700
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,980
(Tearing a piece of kimchi)

701
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,880
(Leaving with a piece of kimchi)

702
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,550
(She's really excited.)

703
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,119
(Tearing the kimchi apart)

704
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,520
It looks good. Gosh.

705
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,890
(Wriggling her eyebrows)

706
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,590
(Eating the rice and kimchi at the same time)

707
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,569
(Hee Won tries the kimchi first out of everything.)

708
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,670
(This is what I'm talking about.)

709
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,180
(Dong Il starts with the braised kimchi as well.)

710
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,250
I'm sure the pork in the braised kimchi is good.

711
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,679
(The meat is tender and seasoned well.)

712
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,250
I asked the meat to be cut into thick pieces.

713
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,219
- It's a whole kimchi.
- It's too big.

714
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,889
The knife was somewhere here.

715
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,949
- The knife...
- No, I'll cut it with scissors.

716
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,419
(Attentive Dong Il)

717
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,760
(Cutting)

718
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,129
- You're supposed to tear it.
- Here.

719
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,129
- You can have the big pieces.
- But you're supposed to tear it,

720
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,160
- not cut it.
- No, it needs to be cut.

721
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,970
- Tear it with your hands.
- I should?

722
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,730
But I only have one glove on.

723
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,340
- Use the scissors to tear it.
- Got it.

724
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,970
Leave after dinner.

725
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,910
Leave, Mi Ran.

726
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,139
(But Mi Ran came to Japan from Korea.)

727
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,509
I'll tear it for you, Mi Ran.

728
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,440
- It tastes different.
- Got it.

729
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,750
(I'm a guest today.)

730
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,720
- This is what you want, right?
- Yes.

731
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,390
Here. Get some rice.

732
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,960
This is what mothers did in the past.

733
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,359
Eat it.

734
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,360
(Sighing)

735
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:38,190
She's the pickiest guest we've ever had.

736
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,000
(Coughing)

737
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,100
(Feeling small)

738
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,599
- Dong Il.
- What?

739
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,030
She's a guest from Korea.

740
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,870
I was talking about you.

741
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,140
(Thank you.)

742
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,470
(Regardless, Na Ra is blowing a kimchi pipe.)

743
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,050
(Tearing)

744
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,709
(Wrapping the meat with kimchi cut by Dong Il)

745
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,380
(Eating a mouthful)

746
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:05,150
(Is it too big?)

747
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,820
Good, right?

748
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,890
- It's delicious.
- Isn't it?

749
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,389
- The best dish with rice.
- Yes.

750
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,030
(The legendary braised kimchi approved by all the members)

751
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,230
(Na Ra and Hye Young have become close.)

752
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,240
- Is the tuna seasoned?
- Slightly.

753
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,770
- Is it?
- Enjoy with grilled vegetables.

754
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,240
- I'll try it with onion soy sauce.
- It's awesome.

755
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,450
The tuna is amazing.

756
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,480
- The tuna?
- Yes, this one.

757
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,879
- Try it, Mi Ran.
- Okay.

758
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,690
(Trying a piece of tuna after dipping it into the onion soy sauce)

759
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,820
How is the thick tuna so good?

760
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,259
(This time, it's raw tuna shiso ssam.)

761
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,460
Mix it together.

762
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,129
(Eating Expert Mi Ran)

763
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,759
(A combination of raw tuna and onion soy sauce)

764
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,800
(Impressed)

765
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,900
You've dug in, right?

766
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,270
- I'm not done yet.
- Eat more.

767
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,339
After dinner, I'll serve potatoes and corn that are famous in Japan.

768
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,710
Do you know about...

769
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,210
raw corn that you don't boil?

770
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,020
- Super sweet corn?
- Yes.

771
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,619
- The sweet ones.
- We've got some.

772
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,649
I'll serve them later.

773
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,720
There's a 20,000-dollar melon.

774
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:12,919
You know what it is, right?

775
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,860
- Was it Umeda melon?
- Umeda melon?

776
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,289
- It...
- Yubari?

777
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,059
- Yes, that one.
- Yubari melon.

778
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,089
- Yubari.
- Yubari?

779
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,259
- I'll serve you potatoes and corn.
- Okay.

780
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,559
That's a great idea.

781
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,270
(Let's have potatoes and corn.)

782
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,770
You can eat it, right? Hold on, run a bit.

783
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,940
(While Hye Young is off to digest)

784
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:34,079
(Struggling)

785
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,810
(The warmest spot)

786
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,619
(Hee Won takes the guest's spot.)

787
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,680
How nice.

788
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,120
Hee Won, that's where the guest should sit.

789
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,089
I'm only here to cook, but you...

790
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,430
(Nagging)

791
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,699
(Trudging)

792
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,899
Stay seated, sir.

793
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,769
How big is your thick puffer jacket?

794
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,870
(Your thick puffer jacket looks warm.)

795
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,199
- Do you want to wear it?
- No.

796
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,799
I can keep running.

797
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,910
- It'll make me warm.
- Right?

798
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,779
- Come here, Na Ra.
- Sit over there.

799
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,109
- Sit here, Na Ra.
- Do it.

800
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,649
- Thank you.
- Toast the marshmallows there.

801
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,650
Okay.

802
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,549
Closer. Good, right?

803
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,980
- Yes, it's warm.
- Nice, isn't it?

804
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,690
- Dong Il, the potatoes.
- Right.

805
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,520
There are five kinds of potatoes in Japan.

806
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,219
Look at these.

807
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,390
(Colorful potatoes)

808
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,889
(Hokkaido, a vast potato patch, )

809
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:28,830
(produces 80 percent of potatoes in Japan.)

810
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:34,840
(There are around 50 improved kinds of potatoes.)

811
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,070
He's someone we met in Japan.

812
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,510
He sent it to us.

813
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,539
(Even an explanation of the potatoes)

814
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,640
It's so pretty.

815
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,450
- This is the translation.
- Yes, here.

816
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,420
May Queen.

817
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:51,350
This potato is May Queen.

818
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,020
Here.

819
00:33:53,021 --> 00:33:54,289
- May Queen.
- Good.

820
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,490
Here.

821
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,689
It's warm. Try it.

822
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:58,929
- Really?
- It's warm.

823
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,329
- May Queen...
- Yes?

824
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,799
Is similar to Korea's Sumi potatoes.

825
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,299
- I love Sumi potatoes.
- Yes.

826
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,329
May Queen.

827
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,469
- It has a chewy texture...
- It looks good.

828
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,799
- and subtle sweetness.
- Sweetness.

829
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,970
(May Queen is commonly used in cooking.)

830
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:13,140
Dong Il, this potato tastes like injeolmi.

831
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,179
(The potato is very chewy.)

832
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,049
- Next is Red Moon.
- All right.

833
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,550
(Red Moon Potato?)

834
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,750
(It looks like a sweet potato.)

835
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,690
It's red on the outside, and the inside is yellow.

836
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,389
It looks like a sweet potato, but it's a potato.

837
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,460
- This one?
- Yes.

838
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,729
(Sniffing Red Moon out of curiosity)

839
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,800
(What?)

840
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,870
(Does it taste sweet like sweet potatoes?)

841
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:41,870
Red Moon tastes like an ordinary potato.

842
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,610
I like this one. It has a unique scent.

843
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,409
- The potato scent?
- Red Moon?

844
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,480
- This one.
- Yes.

845
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,109
(He tries a different type of potato.)

846
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,620
Dong Il, it tastes really like a chestnut sweet potato.

847
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,520
Which one is that? "Kita Akari."

848
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,450
Kita Akari.

849
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,059
Due to its strong sweet taste, it's also called chestnut potato.

850
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,159
(Fluffy)

851
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,729
This is just like a sweet potato.

852
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,929
(It tastes like a chestnut sweet potato.)

853
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,700
This is really like a sweet potato. Do you want to try it?

854
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,169
(She takes out another type of potato.)

855
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,229
This one is...

856
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,270
(She takes out another type of potato.)

857
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,740
(Is it a roasted sweet potato?)

858
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,970
That one looks delicious.

859
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,210
It looks like a roasted potato. It's called Shadow Queen.

860
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,149
A colored potato with a subtle sweet taste.

861
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,619
(A colored potato with a subtle sweet taste?)

862
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,320
(Colored?)

863
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,150
It looks like radish from Ganghwa.

864
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,789
You mean a turnip?

865
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,790
(She cuts Shadow Queen open.)

866
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,330
(What is it?)

867
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,829
You mean a turnip?

868
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,830
(Moaning)

869
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,700
- Hey.
- It doesn't look good.

870
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:45,400
(Purple)

871
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,440
What? What's wrong with the color?

872
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,270
The color doesn't look delicious.

873
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,440
I actually think that it'll be good.

874
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,680
(Taking a bite of Shadow Queen carefully)

875
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,780
- Isn't it nice?
- It tastes like a potato.

876
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,149
- Isn't it more bland than others?
- Yes.

877
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,920
(Shadow Queen has more moisture than stickiness of a potato.)

878
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,050
- This one looks the best for me.
- Let's add butter and honey to it.

879
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,490
Honey.

880
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,860
- It's really good.
- Honey.

881
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,190
Don't you have honey here?

882
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,930
- We had potatoes with honey.
- I'm sorry, but we only have sugar.

883
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,730
- Sugar?
- We have oligosaccharide.

884
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,069
That sounds good.

885
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,630
(Oligosaccharide that Hee Won applied on his hands)

886
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,939
(Fumbling)

887
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,970
How will you eat it?

888
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,809
I'll add butter and honey on it.

889
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:24,940
(Mi Ran's Honey Potato: 1. A lot of butter on the potato)

890
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,779
- It's like butter potato.
- It looks delicious.

891
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,680
(2. Pour honey or oligosaccharide on top.)

892
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,649
(One for Na Ra)

893
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,680
It's butter potato.

894
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,250
- Butter potato?
- Yes.

895
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,250
- Did you add butter to it?
- This is for Na Ra.

896
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,860
(Me?)

897
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,890
- Thank you.
- Is it for Na Ra?

898
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,460
You also put oligosaccharide.

899
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,799
- Butter potato?
- Would you like some?

900
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,099
(Mi Ran's magic makes an ordinary potato taste 2 or 3 times better.)

901
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,129
It's delicious.

902
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,570
(Mi Ran is the best.)

903
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,199
You put it on your hands earlier.

904
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,569
(This time, she delivers it directly to his mouth.)

905
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,640
It tastes good.

906
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,010
(Finger-licking delicious)

907
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,539
Really?

908
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,709
(Delicious food should be shared.)

909
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,940
(Isn't it good?)

910
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,809
Usually, this corn is more yellow than that.

911
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,619
I was very surprised after tasting it.

912
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,620
(This is pure white corn you can eat uncooked.)

913
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:09,689
Try some.

914
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,589
- Oh, my. It's sweet.
- I was very surprised.

915
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,619
(A bite of corn with the husk removed)

916
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,060
- It's very sweet.
- Isn't this an apple?

917
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,289
- Right?
- It explodes with juiciness...

918
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,590
in the mouth.

919
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,130
Even though it's white, it tastes like super sweet corn.

920
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,629
ASMR.

921
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,630
(Laughing)

922
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,640
(Whatever she does, she's cute.)

923
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,600
ASMR.

924
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,410
(Crunching)

925
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,880
(I don't know what it is, but I'm strangely drawn to it.)

926
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:41,380
(While she's working hard on creativity)

927
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,290
Dong Il, it doesn't burn.

928
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,690
- No, in the countryside...
- You're making smoke.

929
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,860
We burnt this on purpose to keep mosquitoes away.

930
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,929
Does it keep mosquitoes away?

931
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,059
The smoke keeps everything away including mosquitoes and people.

932
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,330
(I see.)

933
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,270
The smoke keeps the living beings away.

934
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,099
Go away.

935
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,100
(Very upset)

936
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,740
- Dong Il. Hye Young.
- She just got here...

937
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,480
Thank you for coming.

938
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
(Are you siding with them, Hee Won?)

939
00:38:08,841 --> 00:38:10,780
Hee Won has a warm heart.

940
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,950
What's wrong? Isn't this what we decided to do?

941
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Go away.

942
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:17,290
(A married couple's argument never lasts.)

943
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,620
(Na Ra cooks the marshmallows by gently rotating them.)

944
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,330
It got burnt.

945
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,090
Take these.

946
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,199
Grab it with these and pull it out.

947
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,500
(Mi Ran's suggestion, marshmallow and potato chips?)

948
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:33,140
(S'more, roasted marshmallow in between crackers)

949
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,440
(Salty potato chips instead of crackers?)

950
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,039
Like this.

951
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,209
(Pulling out the marshmallow with potato chips)

952
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,950
- Gosh.
- There you go.

953
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,549
It's too burnt.

954
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,720
(Mi Ran's recommentation, potato chip s'more)

955
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,319
(Sweet, salty, and crunchy)

956
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,790
(An irresistible combination of salty and sweet)

957
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,229
(The next one is for Hye Young.)

958
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,560
(Stretching out her neck)

959
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,030
- Ta-da.
- Yes.

960
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,770
(A taste you can have endlessly)

961
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,999
Suddenly, I feel happy.

962
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,110
(Thanks to Mi Ran, the sweet tooth sisters became happy.)

963
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,769
I made it last time, and it was delicious.

964
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:13,779
(What is she making again?)

965
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,680
(Pressing)

966
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,409
(A corn skewer)

967
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,750
Are you going to roast it? Nice.

968
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,589
- When it's roasted...
- Won't the wooden chopstick burn?

969
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,149
It might not taste good when it's roasted.

970
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,320
(Placing uncooked corn right into the fire)

971
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,160
(Curious and anticipating)

972
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,730
Butter.

973
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,559
Hokkaido is known for its butter.

974
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,130
- Right, I heard that too.
- Dairy products.

975
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,870
- Did you just roast it?
- I roasted it.

976
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,509
Corn roasted in butter.

977
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,039
(Dishes come out endlessly.)

978
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,950
- With butter...
- This has to taste good.

979
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,279
Something keeps dripping.

980
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,349
(Butter drips from the hot corn.)

981
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,350
It's butter.

982
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,349
- Eat this side.
- Can I try one bite?

983
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,789
The butter melted. I just took it out of the fire.

984
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,689
(She tries a bite.)

985
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,330
(Quiet)

986
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,060
(How is it?)

987
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:10,069
It's burnt corn, not butter corn.

988
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,130
(Does it taste strange?)

989
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,539
(She takes another bite.)

990
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,170
She's puzzled by the taste, so she keeps eating it.

991
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,839
(It's almost empty.)

992
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,710
It tastes good.

993
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:22,009
(When the three are together, they eat until the end.)

994
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,010
It just tastes like butter.

995
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:28,049
Anything that's grilled or fried in butter is good.

996
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,050
I definitely agree.

997
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,220
(Talking about food lightens the mood.)

998
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,259
Hee Won is working very hard because you came from afar.

999
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,620
(Have a talk with a hot drink.)

1000
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:40,100
(It's time to get warm with tea made by Hee Won.)

1001
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,099
(Glasses covered with steam)

1002
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,330
Hee Won is like the owner of the campsite.

1003
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,169
(Wearing a hat in the middle of the night)

1004
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,940
- It's nice to drink something hot.
- The hat looks perfect on you.

1005
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,210
- You have a gentle-looking face.
- Right?

1006
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,710
I have all the necessary facial features.

1007
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,480
And your lips are slightly thick.

1008
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,750
(Laughing)

1009
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,250
- You seem like a cozy person.
- Right.

1010
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,249
As someone who has kissed Hee Won...

1011
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,790
That's right. Didn't you play a married couple?

1012
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,590
- There was a scene where we kissed.
- Wasn't it called...

1013
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,230
It was a movie called "Hot Young Bloods."

1014
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,829
- We were a young couple.
- We were in a relationship.

1015
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,830
Really?

1016
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,529
(That star is your star)

1017
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,240
(Touching)

1018
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,839
(Forward)

1019
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,810
(Shy)

1020
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,880
I was very expressive with my feelings, but he was timid.

1021
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,280
He wanted to be secretive about our relationship.

1022
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,220
I said, "When are we..."

1023
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,820
"going to do it?" I was upset at him.

1024
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,960
When I approached him to kiss him,

1025
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,019
I could feel that he was pushing me away.

1026
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,760
(He pushed me away.)

1027
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:47,529
I could feel that he was pushing me away.

1028
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,530
(I'm sorry about that, Mi Ran.)

1029
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:51,270
Then I grabbed him tightly like I was twisting a coil.

1030
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,840
(Backing away little by little)

1031
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,369
(Throwing herself onto him)

1032
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,740
(Scared)

1033
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,370
(Lifting and slamming)

1034
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,780
- He was a very timid man.
- I'm sorry.

1035
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,480
(Just imagining it makes her cringe.)

1036
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,719
- You don't have to apologize.
- I've never met Hye Young before.

1037
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,019
- She's very positive and honest.
- Is it your first time meeting her?

1038
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,050
- It's my first time meeting her.
- Right.

1039
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,719
- Don't you two get along well?
- Definitely.

1040
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,790
Yes.

1041
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,460
I've known Mi Ran...

1042
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,530
for ten years.

1043
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:24,200
She raised her voice at me once.

1044
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,300
- Did she?
- Yes.

1045
00:42:25,301 --> 00:42:27,400
- I was very furious.
- In Japan...

1046
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,039
- You remember...
- What happened?

1047
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,540
We went on a trip to Japan.

1048
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:34,540
What I imagined as our walking distance...

1049
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,249
and her idea of a quick walk.

1050
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,109
- There was a huge gap.
- Wait.

1051
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:42,019
- You committed a huge sin.
- I was walking happily.

1052
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,190
It was past the mealtime.

1053
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,949
We were heading to a supermarket.

1054
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,390
She kept walking towards the supermarket.

1055
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,229
I told her many times. "Hye Young,"

1056
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,629
"let's stop somewhere and eat."

1057
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,629
- "It'll be break time soon." - Right.

1058
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,200
I suggested eating something at a nearby restaurant.

1059
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,639
After saying okay, she kept walking.

1060
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Come on.

1061
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,809
- She remembers it so differently.
- It was way past the mealtime.

1062
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,139
Let's give them some space.

1063
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,680
- Tell us when you're ready.
- Then Mi Ran stopped...

1064
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,950
in the middle of the way.

1065
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:15,479
She shouted, "When are we going to eat?"

1066
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,520
(Plopping down)

1067
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,590
(Looking back on it, she's slightly embarrassed.)

1068
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:22,320
Right after that, we went to eat delicious ramen.

1069
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,759
- Did she feel better after eating?
- Yes.

1070
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,260
- She calmed down right away.
- It doesn't take long.

1071
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,399
I became very gentle.

1072
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,659
- Yes, right away.
- I get it now.

1073
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,530
You get along well because you're simpleminded.

1074
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,500
It's 10pm. It's late. Let's go to bed.

1075
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,039
- Okay, let's go to sleep.
- Okay.

1076
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,340
(They might chat all night long.)

1077
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:39,009
(Tonight, Na Ra and the guests sleep inside House on Wheels.)

1078
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,140
It's really nice.

1079
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,550
- Goodness.
- Shall we have a night snack?

1080
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,779
A night snack?

1081
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,309
Should I go to the restroom after eating it?

1082
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,380
(They aren't thinking about sleeping.)

1083
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,779
Good night, Dong Il.

1084
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,550
Good night. Sleep well.

1085
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:53,460
Are you already lying down inside?

1086
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,619
I'm just lying down.

1087
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,730
(He's ready to sleep.)

1088
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,130
Is it okay inside?

1089
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,329
(She cares for them violently.)

1090
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:02,560
(Zipping down)

1091
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,599
(Chuckling)

1092
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,999
It's nice and warm.

1093
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,400
(An overwhelming greeting to receive while lying down)

1094
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,609
- I really like it.
- Are you saying hello like that?

1095
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:12,709
(Crowding up)

1096
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,710
It's really nice.

1097
00:44:13,711 --> 00:44:14,940
Why are you sleeping?

1098
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,279
Where is he?

1099
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,310
- I don't see him.
- I'm right here.

1100
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:19,810
- Go ahead and sleep.
- I need to sleep.

1101
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,549
- Sleep well.
- Good night.

1102
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,620
Good night.

1103
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:25,450
- He's lying down like gimbap.
- I was curious.

1104
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,489
- I was so surprised.
- Put the shoes inside.

1105
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:28,490
Okay.

1106
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:32,329
I got a breakout all over my face.

1107
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:33,959
Oh, no. I also got this...

1108
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,599
- today.
- My whole face broke out.

1109
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,200
Really? Oh, no.

1110
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,070
I have an ointment.

1111
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:40,739
Can I use some of it?

1112
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,069
Spread the ointment over your face.

1113
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,409
Thank you.

1114
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,140
I used to have...

1115
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,510
These days, makeup doesn't cover it.

1116
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,750
I think it happens when I'm having a hard time.

1117
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,219
Can you give me back the ointment?

1118
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,750
I'm sorry. Didn't I give it back?

1119
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,120
- Do I still have it?
- Did you put it in your pocket?

1120
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,320
Did I put it in?

1121
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,360
- I'm sorry. I have a bad habit.
- I didn't think you'd do that.

1122
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:05,360
I have a bad habit of stealing.

1123
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,860
Where did I put it?

1124
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,560
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

1125
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,130
The girls are having a lot of fun.

1126
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,970
I don't think they'll sleep tonight.

1127
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,370
(They expect a very long night.)

1128
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,180
Gosh, my stomach feels bloated again.

1129
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,979
Right? I feel like I'm becoming water hyacinth.

1130
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,290
Exactly like water hyacinth. That's the perfect description.

1131
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,419
I feel like water hyacinth.

1132
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,420
(They're chatting again.)

1133
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,960
What time is it?

1134
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,730
It's 1:30am.

1135
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:40,430
Gosh, it's still early.

1136
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:44,030
(The girls' night continued until 3am.)

1137
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,070
(Stories as countless as stars at night drift by.)

1138
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,540
(The front yard by the lake lights up gradaully.)

1139
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:00,520
(The gentle ripples beckon.)

1140
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:07,390
(The animals of Hokkaido wake up and prepare for the morning.)

1141
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:12,830
(Hye Young of House on Wheels also got up at 5:10am.)

1142
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:16,870
(After stretching for a long time)

1143
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,970
Gosh, my handful daughter woke up.

1144
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,510
(Turning)

1145
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:25,370
- Are you up?
- Yes.

1146
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,910
(With a lot of energy early in the morning)

1147
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:31,079
- Goodness, you're dancing.
- Yes.

1148
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,149
(Joining her dad who's having his morning walk)

1149
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,379
My body feels very light.

1150
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,380
- Really?
- Yes.

1151
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,590
I get to walk with my daughter at this hour.

1152
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,960
(In a good mood)

1153
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,530
Hee Won is up.

1154
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:45,189
Hey, brother.

1155
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:46,260
(I'm glad that I caught him.)

1156
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,360
Hee Won.

1157
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,629
(Father and daughter in sync)

1158
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,770
We should spend the morning with her.

1159
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,269
- He's right. I'm leaving today.
- Go up to him.

1160
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,510
Bring him from the restroom.

1161
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,280
I'll be waiting for you in front of the restroom door.

1162
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,339
(Don't wait for me.)

1163
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,780
We wouldn't leave so easily.

1164
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,849
(Father-and-daughter jogging group that abducts)

1165
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,920
That's my handful daughter.

1166
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,620
Come out.

1167
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,359
(Holding tightly)

1168
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:18,930
It looks like she's visiting her uncle in a nursing home.

1169
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,729
We've traveled a lot together,

1170
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:23,629
but it's my first time walking with Hee Won this early.

1171
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:25,929
- Really?
- Yes, we're on Season Five.

1172
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,140
- I can't believe it.
- In the morning.

1173
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,469
Are you walking right now because of me?

1174
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:32,240
Of course. You traveled far to get here.

1175
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,509
(Hee Won wanted to walk with Hye Young who traveled far.)

1176
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:34,580
I feel very moved.

1177
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,080
This is my first time.

1178
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,909
(On the other hand)

1179
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,380
(Flinching)

1180
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,020
(Mi Ran also gets up.)

1181
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,750
(Na Ra went to wash up.)

1182
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,920
(Disheveled)

1183
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:54,430
(She gets up and takes a look outside.)

1184
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,370
(Rolling up the curtain)

1185
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,840
(She takes a comfortable position.)

1186
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:08,380
(Enjoying the view of the front yard in the morning)

1187
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,250
(A fresh view of the outside)

1188
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,120
(The sound of the waves in the lake near the front yard)

1189
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,260
(Morning when you get good vibes)

1190
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,990
(She also takes a quick walk around the house.)

1191
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,869
(Na Ra)

1192
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,840
(How are you doing?)

1193
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:38,410
(Sorrowful)

1194
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,710
I'm doing well.

1195
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,410
(Smiling)

1196
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,380
(The two of them got very close overnight.)

1197
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,520
Gosh, where is my wallet?

1198
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:55,959
(Did Na Ra's wallet disappear?)

1199
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,960
My wallet.

1200
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:00,760
Wait. Think, Jang Na Ra. My wallet.

1201
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,430
I need to think. Where's my wallet?

1202
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:05,599
- My wallet.
- Your wallet.

1203
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,040
- My wallet.
- Your wallet.

1204
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,340
- What do I do?
- What does it look like?

1205
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,639
It's a wallet with a long strap.

1206
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,679
- Is it in your bag?
- I took out my bag.

1207
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,680
(The wallet that Secretary Na Ra is attached to)

1208
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,180
Did you take it outside?

1209
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,310
Where could it be?

1210
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,019
- Where could it be?
- I can't imagine where it is.

1211
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,020
Wait.

1212
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:25,790
(Thinking)

1213
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:27,420
Did you eat something spicy?

1214
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,890
Something spicy?

1215
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:33,930
It's not here either.

1216
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:34,930
(It's not inside the car.)

1217
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,769
(In an emergency)

1218
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:39,300
Let's see.

1219
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,340
When I lift this, something will come out.

1220
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,210
Did you look here?

1221
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,480
Did you put it in my bag?

1222
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,609
You have a bad habit of stealing.

1223
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:53,720
(Getting even with her for last night)

1224
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,849
I'm sorry.

1225
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:56,850
(Where did the wallet go?)

1226
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:57,850
(Exclaiming)

1227
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:00,119
I'm sorry, Mi Ran.

1228
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,120
I startled you, didn't I?

1229
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:03,390
(My wallet)

1230
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:06,029
(She finally found it.)

1231
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,760
I didn't know the wallet was that big.

1232
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,830
(Feeling good)

1233
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:12,370
I hear them laughing already.

1234
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:15,270
- Na Ra.
- Good morning.

1235
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,870
Good morning. Hello.

1236
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:20,540
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

1237
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,749
Did you take a walk this morning?

1238
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,209
- Did you run?
- I went jogging...

1239
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,920
around the campsite.

1240
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,649
I ran, sweated, and took a shower.

1241
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,690
That's impressive.

1242
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:34,290
(Time for a simple breakfast)

1243
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,990
Did someone make her drink this morning?

1244
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,029
This is you, Dong Il.

1245
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,030
Are you mimicking me?

1246
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,269
(Staggering)

1247
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:45,300
In "Reply 1988."

1248
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,499
- In "Reply 1988." - In "Reply 1988?"

1249
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,500
He kicked the briquette.

1250
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:50,299
(His extraordinary staggering diagonally)

1251
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,669
- "He kicked the briquette." - He looks like Drunken Master.

1252
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:53,710
This is how he came home.

1253
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,479
- "He kicked the briquette." - She looks exactly like him.

1254
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,480
Don't we look the same?

1255
00:50:56,481 --> 00:50:57,510
(Lowering his head)

1256
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,909
Kicking the briquette while shouting.

1257
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:01,149
(Here's a master of slapstick.)

1258
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:02,250
That's hilarious.

1259
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:09,920
(Daughters, why won't you listen to me?)

1260
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,959
Do you remember his bluish green jacket?

1261
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,960
(Accurate)

1262
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,100
He had a bluish green jacket when coming from the bank.

1263
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,329
(Laughing)

1264
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:19,530
Gosh, my daughters.

1265
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,200
Did Mi Ran also play your daughter?

1266
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,879
She was the eldest daughter who ran away from home.

1267
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,880
(The birth of a secret child)

1268
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:31,450
What time is it?

1269
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,049
- We should go. It's 9:20am.
- It's 9:20am.

1270
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,050
Do we have to go?

1271
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,919
Do we go like this?

1272
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,890
- Let's hurry.
- Let's go.

1273
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:43,020
(Where are they going today?)

1274
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,829
(Beneath the silence...)

1275
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:49,460
(lies a place filled with fervent breath.)

1276
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,270
(Lake Kussharo)

1277
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:58,840
(Lake Kussharo is located on the east side of Hokkaido.)

1278
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,580
(Akan Mashu National Park)

1279
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,820
(A massive volcanic zone where geothermal heat rises)

1280
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:14,290
(Where the living land breathes)

1281
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,720
(Created by volcanoes)

1282
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,900
(Huge Caldera Lakes)

1283
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,400
(Lake Akan, a spot for flying fish)

1284
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:33,270
(Lake Mashu)

1285
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,980
(And today's destination, Lake Kussharo)

1286
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:42,249
(What they will encounter there)

1287
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,220
(Primordial heat)

1288
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,260
(Where you can feel the breath of Hokkaido's wilderness)

1289
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:52,260
(We're heading to Lake Kussharo.)

1290
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:56,630
Where we're going is close from here.

1291
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:58,970
- It's nearby.
- I see.

1292
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,999
The weather is very nice and cloudy.

1293
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,240
- It's great.
- I agree.

1294
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,210
The weather is perfect for traveling around.

1295
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,110
It's difficult when the sun is out.

1296
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:08,380
It's perfect.

1297
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,749
- I think we're here.
- Yes, we're here.

1298
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,350
We're here.

1299
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,120
There's a place to eat.

1300
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:18,549
- In front of the parking lot.
- Something sweet...

1301
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:19,550
There's something over there.

1302
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:20,690
(They find snack bars next to the parking lot.)

1303
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,860
- We're here.
- Thank you.

1304
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,290
We're here.

1305
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,200
(They go straight to the shop like they're drawn to it.)

1306
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:29,999
- Hotteok?
- It looks like hotteok.

1307
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,170
It must be something like hotteok.

1308
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:34,000
- What is this?
- It's potatoes.

1309
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:36,700
Let's buy this.

1310
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:39,340
(They decide to order two for now.)

1311
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:41,739
(As soon as they order, )

1312
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,179
(it's deep-fried in oil.)

1313
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,910
I think it's just potatoes.

1314
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:47,720
Is it uncooked potatoes?

1315
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,849
She's just deep-frying the potatoes.

1316
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:53,050
(Are they rice cakes or fried food? While they're getting cooked...)

1317
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,160
I'll buy this.

1318
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,260
Dong Il, this is what I'll buy.

1319
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,559
(Hee Won got a new item.)

1320
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,130
(All right)

1321
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,269
You're not a child.

1322
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:07,770
- But...
- Let it go. Or we'll have to pay.

1323
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,339
- This is for Haidong Gumdo.
- Exactly.

1324
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,540
(Haidong Gumdo)

1325
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:16,310
Dong Il, you should buy this.

1326
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,479
You should get a cane.

1327
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,480
(This is for you.)

1328
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,450
- It's the bear.
- My gosh.

1329
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,689
- It's the bear.
- My gosh.

1330
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,049
The bear bell.

1331
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:27,890
(This is...)

1332
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,660
(This is a bear bell!)

1333
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,759
(The bear bell the expedition leader carried around!)

1334
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,230
(The bear bell the expedition leader carried around!)

1335
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,960
(Fiddling with it)

1336
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:39,469
(Dong Il wanted a bear bell.)

1337
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:40,869
- The bear bell.
- It's a bear bell.

1338
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,269
- Let's buy this.
- A bear bell.

1339
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,469
- A bear bell?
- A bear bell.

1340
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,470
(I must buy this!)

1341
00:54:44,471 --> 00:54:45,540
A bear bell.

1342
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,779
Getting one bear bell would be nice.

1343
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,040
I can wear it for the morning walks.

1344
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,120
(He purchases a bear bell!)

1345
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,520
(Ringing)

1346
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,420
(Ringing)

1347
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,460
My goodness.

1348
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,030
We'll need to hear that the whole day now.

1349
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,939
- I can't help but shake it.
- We shouldn't have bought it.

1350
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,000
(He can't stop shaking it.)

1351
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,309
(He might end up dancing while chasing bears away.)

1352
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,480
I just can't stay still.

1353
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:29,049
(While Dong Il is dancing with the bear bell, )

1354
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:30,850
(the snacks are ready!)

1355
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,789
(Putting the sauce)

1356
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,259
What is he applying?

1357
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,989
- Is it soy sauce?
- It's dango sauce.

1358
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:39,030
- Sweet soy sauce?
- Yes.

1359
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:41,030
That's dango sauce?

1360
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,830
(Gulping)

1361
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:44,400
Thank you.

1362
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:45,900
- It's hot.
- Okay.

1363
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,240
It's hot.

1364
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,269
Let's eat.

1365
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:53,510
(Freshly fried, together with sweet sauce. How will it taste?)

1366
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:54,839
- Eat when it's warm.
- When it's warm.

1367
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,140
- I'll eat as I go.
- Sure.

1368
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,480
- I'll share one with Hee Won.
- Okay.

1369
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,020
You eat the left side. I'll eat the right side.

1370
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,649
(The younger brother takes a bite first.)

1371
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:06,650
How is it?

1372
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,119
It's delicious.

1373
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,390
- Is it?
- Yes.

1374
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:11,959
You should eat more.

1375
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,190
- It's delicious. You have it.
- Let's go.

1376
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,499
(Mi Ran takes a bite too.)

1377
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,699
- It's not ordinary potato.
- Hee Won.

1378
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,900
This isn't normal potato.

1379
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:22,669
They shaped it into this.

1380
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,739
Exactly.

1381
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,870
- They boiled it and shaped it.
- It's potato.

1382
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:27,270
Here.

1383
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:30,039
- It's like potato jeon.
- Yes.

1384
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,010
(It tastes similar to Korean potato jeon!)

1385
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:35,350
Thanks for the food.

1386
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,590
There they are.

1387
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,890
What is this? Flour?

1388
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:43,360
Potato.

1389
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:45,590
Potato and...

1390
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:46,829
- Potato and...
- Glutinous rice powder?

1391
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:48,000
(Glutinous rice powder?)

1392
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:49,500
Potato and glutinous rice powder?

1393
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,829
It doesn't taste like flour, right?

1394
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:53,629
It's chewy.

1395
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:54,640
Yes.

1396
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,239
- It's salty and nice.
- Right?

1397
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,010
(It's actually boiled potato deep-fried with starch.)

1398
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:03,440
(Hokkaido's traditional snack, potato mochi)

1399
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:07,920
The lake is beautiful.

1400
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,320
- The lake is splendid.
- Dong Il.

1401
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:13,620
Look at the lake.

1402
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,289
The lake is so cool.

1403
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,159
(They're amazed by the lake.)

1404
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,360
Don't you think so?

1405
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,940
(The large lake sparkles under the sunlight.)

1406
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,500
Goodness.

1407
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:32,769
It's like a painting.

1408
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:35,510
I agree. It's like a painting.

1409
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,709
The water.

1410
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:38,750
Exactly.

1411
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,619
- It's so pretty, Hee Won.
- Yes.

1412
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,019
(A wide, panoramic view of the lake)

1413
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,589
(But)

1414
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:47,820
(Video by: Hokkaido Country Life)

1415
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:54,130
(There's another lake behind the lake?)

1416
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,430
(Actually, they're not two separate lakes.)

1417
00:57:57,830 --> 00:58:01,440
(A huge lake surrounds the whole of peninsula!)

1418
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:10,139
According to the map, it's shaped like this,

1419
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,910
and the water flows on each side.

1420
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:15,079
This is like an island.

1421
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,620
That's right.

1422
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,420
(A gigantic lake, Lake Kussharo)

1423
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,359
(It's 79km², which is bigger than 11,000 soccer fields!)

1424
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,190
(It's 79km², which is bigger than 11,000 soccer fields!)

1425
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:25,989
(You can feel the magnificence of Mother Nature.)

1426
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:27,800
- It's nice, isn't it?
- It's so nice here.

1427
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,260
It's better than I thought.

1428
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:33,699
(Hye Young dips her foot in the lake.)

1429
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,640
Are you showing off your water boots?

1430
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,410
How's the water?

1431
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,770
It isn't as cold as I thought.

1432
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,679
This is a volcanic area, after all.

1433
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,740
I think it's warm.

1434
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,450
Dong Il, that's the outdoor bath.

1435
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,549
- That's the outdoor bath?
- Yes.

1436
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,990
- There are people in it.
- There are?

1437
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:55,160
(What's happening?)

1438
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:01,200
(Lake Kussharo was created from a volcanic eruption.)

1439
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,569
(Underneath, the geothermal activity is still ongoing!)

1440
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:07,000
(Hot spring water)

1441
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:08,869
(When cold winter comes, )

1442
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:10,799
(the temperature difference becomes apparent.)

1443
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,980
(Frozen, not frozen)

1444
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:19,310
(A fascinating lake where cold water and hot water coexist)

1445
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:22,720
(There's something you can only experience here.)

1446
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:30,590
(Enjoying the hot spring with the lake view)

1447
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:36,500
(You can enjoy it in various parts of the lake!)

1448
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,469
(In cold winter, swans come to rest too.)

1449
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:42,770
(It's warm.)

1450
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:44,610
It's so nice here.

1451
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:46,739
The water is so clear too.

1452
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:47,910
- Right?
- I can see the river bed.

1453
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,150
(The water is so clear that it's as transparent as glass.)

1454
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,120
(You can see the river bed of the deep water too!)

1455
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:58,420
(It's even clearer on sunny days.)

1456
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,050
Hee Won.

1457
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,290
Let's take a picture.

1458
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:04,430
Sure, come here. Let's take a picture.

1459
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:06,429
(Let's take a picture in front of the nice scenery!)

1460
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:08,300
Where we're at isn't important.

1461
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,560
You're right.

1462
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:15,000
(They capture their memories in the picturesque view.)

1463
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,440
- The canoe is over there.
- Yes.

1464
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,670
(A canoe?)

1465
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,979
You used to paddle really well, didn't you?

1466
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,809
I'm pretty good.

1467
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:24,810
(Laughing)

1468
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:27,579
It must be them.

1469
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:28,720
(They'll soon start...)

1470
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,479
(the Lake Kussharo canoe tour.)

1471
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,150
- Hello.
- Hello.

1472
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:35,659
I'm Ai, your guide,

1473
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,419
and he's Kazuaki.

1474
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,630
He's my husband.

1475
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,559
They're married.

1476
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,000
(They'll be joined by the guide couple.)

1477
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:46,270
(They each wear a life vest.)

1478
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:49,100
My chest feels pretty tight.

1479
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,770
Is it? Okay.

1480
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:52,470
- Done?
- Yes.

1481
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,839
- Okay.
- That's enough.

1482
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,039
Okay.

1483
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:59,679
Today, we'll go to the inferno hot spring...

1484
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,220
at the end of the peninsula and come back.

1485
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,349
What?

1486
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:06,949
(The inferno hot spring?)

1487
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:07,990
"Inferno?"

1488
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,769
(There's an inferno...)

1489
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:13,610
(in this calm-looking lake?)

1490
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,739
(Inferno)

1491
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,980
(A hot and dangerous zone where geothermal energy erupts)

1492
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:20,979
(Somewhere at the end of the peninsula, )

1493
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,480
(which is a 3km round trip...)

1494
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,050
Hee Won, look at that.

1495
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,650
(There's an inferno!)

1496
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:30,090
Look at that.

1497
01:01:30,091 --> 01:01:33,190
(A shocking place that surprised everyone)

1498
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:36,130
(And...)

1499
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:39,629
(a very special experience there!)

1500
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:41,869
We came to this scary place fearlessly.

1501
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:44,800
(The Lake Kussharo inferno tour, coming soon!)

1502
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:48,870
(The members get in the canoes to the inferno.)

1503
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:54,750
(Mrs. Cheetah is the first to get into it bravely.)

1504
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:56,379
My goodness.

1505
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,580
(He's already moaning even before starting.)

1506
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,420
Let's go, canoe.

1507
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:01,919
- Let's go.
- Go.

1508
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,090
Go.

1509
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:12,230
(To the inferno 1.5km away)

1510
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:15,829
(The canoes set sail.)

1511
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:17,400
One, two.

1512
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:19,340
It's nice.

1513
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:21,869
(So far, the lake is very peaceful that you can't imagine an inferno.)

1514
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:23,440
It's so calm and nice, isn't it?

1515
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:27,679
(As they paddle clumsily)

1516
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,950
- Dong Il, it's so nice here.
- I know.

1517
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:35,290
People canoe because it's peaceful.

1518
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:38,520
It'll be nice if you canoe alone and play some music.

1519
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,389
- Right?
- You'll die from the heat...

1520
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:41,559
on sunny days.

1521
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,300
- That's true.
- The weather is very nice today.

1522
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,029
The weather helped.

1523
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:47,630
(The slightly cloudy weather works in their favor today.)

1524
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:52,809
The quiet sound of the paddle cutting through the water.

1525
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,140
- Isn't it really nice?
- Yes.

1526
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,639
The sound of it cutting through the water is so nice.

1527
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,779
(The sound of the paddle in the water can be heard.)

1528
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,280
This is so nice.

1529
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:03,250
I wonder if Na Ra can adjust well...

1530
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:07,390
in that team. I'm worried about her.

1531
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,660
We've never had such active people...

1532
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,729
on this show so far.

1533
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:15,260
(We've never had such active people on this show so far.)

1534
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,429
Let's go

1535
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:22,230
(Let's go)

1536
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,199
- Let's go - Let's go

1537
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,509
- Let's go boating - Let's go boating

1538
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,840
(She adjusted perfectly.)

1539
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:33,780
My goodness.

1540
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,380
I'm so embarrassed.

1541
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:40,120
Can you guys keep quiet?

1542
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,090
I'm sorry.

1543
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:46,329
Na Ra

1544
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,459
(She doesn't intend to stop.)

1545
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,130
Please sing

1546
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:51,230
What's that again?

1547
01:03:51,231 --> 01:03:52,730
(The melody is familiar to Na Ra too.)

1548
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:53,999
It's DJ DOC's song.

1549
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,840
- I like tteokbokki so much - So much

1550
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,210
- So I went - So I went

1551
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:04,709
- To a tteokbokki restaurant - To a tteokbokki restaurant

1552
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,710
- In Sindang-dong - In Sindang-dong

1553
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:11,719
- One plate of tteokbokki - You even know that part.

1554
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,820
(Are you a singer? Your score is 99.)

1555
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:17,860
(Hye Young's song request, "Cocktail Love" by Marronnier)

1556
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:24,730
(Na Ra's song request, "One and a Half" by Two Two)

1557
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:27,570
(Even ALLDAY PROJECT)

1558
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,600
TARZZAN is cute.

1559
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:34,140
I wanted to travel silently. They're annoying.

1560
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:36,440
It's embarrassing.

1561
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:44,420
(With the guide, who assimilated with them)

1562
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,119
- Good job.
- Sorry?

1563
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,350
- Good job.
- Good job.

1564
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:50,490
- Good job.
- Okay. Good job. I got it.

1565
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:54,229
- Are there three of you?
- Yes.

1566
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:55,260
No.

1567
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:58,129
- Really?
- Yes. We have seven more.

1568
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,130
- You...
- Just keep paddling.

1569
01:04:59,131 --> 01:05:00,930
(We have seven more. Just keep paddling.)

1570
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:03,000
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

1571
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,640
- We'll paddle at top speed.
- Top speed? Hey.

1572
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,840
- Start! One, two.
- One, two.

1573
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:10,740
- One, two.
- One, two.

1574
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,549
Her voice is getting closer.

1575
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:16,180
It's getting closer.

1576
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,049
- One, two.
- See that?

1577
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:20,220
(Going berserk)

1578
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:24,490
(Team Mi Ran moves ahead at frightening speed.)

1579
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:28,189
- We can break the record.
- One, two.

1580
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,629
One, two.

1581
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:33,470
(They paddle hard too, caught in the heat of the moment.)

1582
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,100
- Let's go!
- One, two.

1583
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,800
Why did they come here?

1584
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,340
- They're here to train.
- Are they here to train?

1585
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,569
I should've secretly tied our canoe to theirs.

1586
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:44,609
- Then we...
- That sounds good.

1587
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:45,640
(What a mature thought.)

1588
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:48,010
(Confused)

1589
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:49,250
(Surprised)

1590
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,150
(The attack of tree branches)

1591
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:56,460
(Surprised)

1592
01:05:58,590 --> 01:05:59,659
(They're forced to do abs workout.)

1593
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:01,660
My stomach hurts.

1594
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,730
It looks like dinosaurs live here, like "Jurassic Park."

1595
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,770
(It looks like they're in a jungle.)

1596
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,380
Why is there yellow moss?

1597
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:20,779
It's interesting.

1598
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:25,150
(Unfamiliar yellow moss is found between rocks.)

1599
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,620
- Don't you smell sulfur?
- Is that it?

1600
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:33,090
(Observing)

1601
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,530
- I think it does smell of sulfur.
- I think so.

1602
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,169
(Yellow?)

1603
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:43,570
(Smells of sulfur?)

1604
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,940
- Is this hot spring water?
- It is. Bubbles.

1605
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:49,780
He says bubbles rise here.

1606
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:53,250
- You can see bubbles rising.
- Where?

1607
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,280
- My gosh.
- Can you see the bubbles?

1608
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:01,450
(Hot bubbles rise from the cold lake bed.)

1609
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:07,790
(They're popping on the surface of the water.)

1610
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,289
Mi Ran, right next to you.

1611
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:10,730
(It's hard to believe what they're seeing.)

1612
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:12,799
It's scary here.

1613
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,930
- It's no joke.
- It's scary.

1614
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:18,440
- One, two.
- It's smoking.

1615
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:20,670
Look over there. It's smoking.

1616
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:23,580
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

1617
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,650
I suddenly see smoke.

1618
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:28,950
(As soon as they turn the corner, they come to face...)

1619
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:30,650
It looks like it's on fire.

1620
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:35,690
(Steam that shoots up from the ground.)

1621
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,029
Hee Won, look at that.

1622
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:41,189
(Surrounded by the thick smoke)

1623
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:43,000
- What's that?
- My gosh.

1624
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:44,730
That's impressive.

1625
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:50,440
(They arrive at the inferno hot spring.)

1626
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:54,540
(Hee Won gets out first.)

1627
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:57,240
(Slightly scared)

1628
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,150
(Dong Il gets out carefully too.)

1629
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,980
Isn't it hot?

1630
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,720
My gosh.

1631
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,619
Look at the smoke. Here, too.

1632
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,660
(They look around.)

1633
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:15,890
(The cliff colored with yellow sulfur)

1634
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:19,300
We came to a scary place so fearlessly.

1635
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,200
(This place feels like it's a different world.)

1636
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,670
- Look at the hot water rising.
- It's coming up.

1637
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:29,980
My gosh, something is bubbling up.

1638
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,909
You're right. They're rising from the holes.

1639
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,380
(Hot spring water shoots up from underneath their feet.)

1640
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,719
This is amazing.

1641
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,049
(While they're focused on the pool, )

1642
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:42,820
(at one side...)

1643
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:44,090
(The guides are looking for something.)

1644
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:45,090
The shovel.

1645
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:48,030
- Where's the shovel?
- The shovel.

1646
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:51,500
Mr. Kim.

1647
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:58,240
(Why did he suddenly take out a shovel?)

1648
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,640
What?

1649
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,239
(Dig the ground over there using this shovel.)

1650
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,280
Over there.

1651
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:08,010
- Let's go, everyone.
- Let's go together.

1652
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:11,250
(They all follow the guide.)

1653
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:14,050
- The water is lukewarm.
- Really?

1654
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:18,320
- My gosh.
- It's warm.

1655
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,499
- Yes.
- I want to sit down here for a bit.

1656
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,229
(The warm lake water envelopes her ankles.)

1657
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:27,470
I want to sit down here. Can I dip my butt in?

1658
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:30,869
- It's so warm.
- It's warm.

1659
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:32,039
(Across the lake, which is fascinatingly warm)

1660
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,310
It's so warm.

1661
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,840
- Dig here?
- Yes.

1662
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,049
- Here.
- Yes. Here?

1663
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,180
(He hands over the shovel to confused Mi Ran.)

1664
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:42,380
(Throwing)

1665
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:45,149
(Throwing)

1666
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:47,850
(Unlike the sounds she makes, she's rather slow.)

1667
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:50,059
Look at her.

1668
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,559
(The spectators are thrilled.)

1669
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,460
Oh, dear. What to do?

1670
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:56,260
It's hot.

1671
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:59,160
There it is.

1672
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:00,900
It's 100°C.

1673
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:02,630
It's 100°C?

1674
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:04,470
That's the hottest water you can get.

1675
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:07,010
- The water is boiling.
- It's 100°C.

1676
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:09,040
(Really?)

1677
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,739
- It's hot.
- The water temperatures of here...

1678
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,250
and here are different.

1679
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,150
(The water of the lake is below 30°C.)

1680
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,320
Is it hot there?

1681
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,560
Here and here are different.

1682
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,830
(They face the mystery of the earth.)

1683
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:32,930
(Power up)

1684
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:35,299
(A boiling pool of hot spring water)

1685
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,300
Okay.

1686
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,640
- You add this here?
- Like this?

1687
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,319
(What are they putting in the hot spring water?)

1688
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,390
Put the whole thing in.

1689
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,660
(Eggs?)

1690
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:47,130
That's fine.

1691
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:51,560
(A special experience only at the inferno hot spring)

1692
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,400
(Hot spring water which springs up from where you dug)

1693
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:03,140
(You boil eggs using it.)

1694
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:10,580
(Known as inferno eggs)

1695
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,220
It's eight minutes for soft-boiled eggs...

1696
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,990
and 12 minutes for hard-boiled eggs.

1697
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,660
- Who wants soft-boiled eggs?
- Me.

1698
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:22,530
- All of us.
- All of you?

1699
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:26,060
(Will they become nice soft-boiled eggs?)

1700
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,870
(At that moment)

1701
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:30,399
Look at that.

1702
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,870
(Mi Ran spots something.)

1703
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:35,940
Gosh, look at the water boiling.

1704
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,880
It's like lava. It's overflowing.

1705
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:45,420
(The inferno's hot spring water)

1706
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,820
Let's take a look at it.

1707
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:53,430
(They carefully approach it.)

1708
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:56,729
Nature is a mysterious thing.

1709
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:57,930
Mi Ran, look at it.

1710
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:03,740
(Blazing inferno hot spring water)

1711
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:05,700
That's scary.

1712
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:07,940
(I need to take a photo of it.)

1713
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:11,840
It's like the volcano is erupting.

1714
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:14,750
- Send me the video, will you?
- I will.

1715
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:18,220
- That's water boiling, isn't it?
- It is.

1716
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,650
Let's touch it.

1717
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:21,720
(Laughing)

1718
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,819
It's upset. This is so fun.

1719
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:25,890
This is so fun.

1720
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:28,459
What is it?

1721
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,159
- It's time.
- Is it done?

1722
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,100
- It's done. Let's go.
- It's done.

1723
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,730
The eggs turned dark.

1724
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:39,270
(Sulfur-rich hot spring water turned the eggshells dark.)

1725
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,510
I wonder how they would taste.

1726
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:47,080
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

1727
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:48,350
Mi Ran!

1728
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:49,350
(It's a huge accident.)

1729
01:12:49,351 --> 01:12:51,150
- It's okay. 3, 2, 1.
- In 3, 2, 1.

1730
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,950
(Light)

1731
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:54,549
- It was slippery.
- Because you're wearing boots.

1732
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:56,659
- It's okay.
- I'll assist you.

1733
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:59,019
I'm okay. It's wet.

1734
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:00,029
Gosh.

1735
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:01,030
(Why do things like this always happen to Mi Ran?)

1736
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:03,730
(She's got the heaven-sent sense of humor.)

1737
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:07,600
(Feeling moist, she keeps walking.)

1738
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,800
What's this now?

1739
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:11,169
- Bento?
- So pretty.

1740
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:13,910
It's a handmade snack gift.

1741
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:19,180
(On the simple table laid out by the lake, )

1742
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,380
(there are colorful drinks...)

1743
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,180
(and cute snacks made of Hokkaido ingredients.)

1744
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:29,249
She made them from scratch.

1745
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,260
I know.

1746
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:32,720
- You made these from scratch?
- Yes.

1747
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,529
(Shall we enjoy the inferno tea time together?)

1748
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:37,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1749
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:41,400
(They start with today's highlight, the inferno egg.)

1750
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:44,770
It's hot.

1751
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:50,710
(They carefully peel the darkened eggshells.)

1752
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,880
(Dong Il tries it first.)

1753
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:57,150
It's soft-cooked.

1754
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:00,419
Look. Doesn't it look like jelly? Look at this, Hee Won.

1755
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:01,990
(Inside the egg white, the yellow yolk is like jelly.)

1756
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:05,220
(Na Ra takes a bite too.)

1757
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:07,589
(It's so good that she wants to cry.)

1758
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:09,390
What's the expression Chef Anh Sung Jae uses?

1759
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,360
- About the doneness.
- "Evenly cooked."

1760
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,900
It's evenly cooked.

1761
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:16,199
It's silky smooth.

1762
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,899
- I know.
- For me, the smoked eggs...

1763
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,170
are too dry.

1764
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:22,170
It's nice and soft.

1765
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,270
Really soft.

1766
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,739
It's good.

1767
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:27,350
(Eggs from inferno are the best!)

1768
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:29,879
Try it. It's really good.

1769
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,049
(He puts a cookie into Hye Young's mouth.)

1770
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,080
It's so good, isn't it?

1771
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:35,649
- Try it.
- It's moist and soft.

1772
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:36,820
Right.

1773
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,890
- Moist and soft.
- Moist and soft.

1774
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:40,490
Cookie?

1775
01:14:40,491 --> 01:14:42,590
There's this, too. Gluten-free one.

1776
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,300
I see. What's the point of eating a cookie then?

1777
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:46,400
(I don't want to go free.)

1778
01:14:46,401 --> 01:14:48,030
- Why would I...
- It's really nutty.

1779
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:52,270
(The tea time gives them the joy of choosing cookies.)

1780
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:56,169
It's too hot to sit here.

1781
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:57,379
- It's hot, isn't it?
- It is.

1782
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,780
(Hee Won's seat is too hot.)

1783
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:06,449
You should lie on your back.

1784
01:15:06,450 --> 01:15:08,419
You have ondol in Korea, right?

1785
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,420
- Ondol.
- Yes.

1786
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,760
No wonder it was so nice and hot when I lied down.

1787
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:14,360
- It was nice and hot.
- It's very...

1788
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,700
(She uses the log as a pillow and lies down.)

1789
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:22,000
Let's see. What should I eat next?

1790
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,070
It's so nice...

1791
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:28,070
that this place isn't packed with people.

1792
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:32,110
(I should enjoy it more.)

1793
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:34,609
(It's another way Mi Ran enjoys the inferno.)

1794
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:35,810
She's sleeping.

1795
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,549
She's not sleeping. She's drying her pants.

1796
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:42,650
(She's drying her pants using the inferno ondol.)

1797
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,629
Okay.

1798
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:49,259
Let's go.

1799
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:50,430
(The fun inferno hot spring tour ends.)

1800
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,499
Would I ever come back? Unless I deliberately travel here,

1801
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,800
- I probably wouldn't.
- We need to say bye.

1802
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,899
Bye.

1803
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:58,900
(They say farewell.)

1804
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:00,410
Take care, guys.

1805
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:04,009
Let's hurry and get going.

1806
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:05,710
Only then we can go to the volcano.

1807
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:10,049
Are we going to the volcano next?

1808
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:12,420
(After the hot spring, they're going to the volcano?)

1809
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:14,850
- The inferno volcano sounds fun.
- Goodness.

1810
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,089
(In a 25-minute drive from Lake Kussharo...)

1811
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:23,290
(Lake Kussharo to Volcano)

1812
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:25,060
I don't want to hear it.

1813
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:27,370
Look there. There's smoke.

1814
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:29,370
That's the volcano.

1815
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:31,800
(Behind the lush trees, )

1816
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,470
(you can see the white smoke in the distance.)

1817
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,679
Steam is billowing out of the mountain.

1818
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,710
(There’s a subtle sense of yet another inferno...)

1819
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:43,780
Goodness.

1820
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:47,150
(Amazed)

1821
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:50,720
(This place makes you lift your camera in awe.)

1822
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:54,459
(The earth’s heartbeat that never stops)

1823
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:58,030
(The sulfur volcano)

1824
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,370
(As if the earth was breathing, nonstop, massive plumes of steam!)

1825
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:07,940
It could boil 100 trays of eggs at a time.

1826
01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:12,079
When you place the eggs, they will boil instantly,

1827
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,850
and by the time they reach the foot, they will be done.

1828
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,179
(Just imagining it is fun enough.)

1829
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:18,020
It will be like a boiled egg vending machine.

1830
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,380
A vending machine.

1831
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,820
It's a vending machine that makes boiled eggs for 100 people.

1832
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:26,359
When you say, "One boiled egg, please,"

1833
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,330
someone roll down raw eggs from the top.

1834
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:34,570
(Will Hye Young's imagination come to life?)

1835
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:36,940
They will be done by the time they reach the bottom.

1836
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:41,770
What are you being all chatty about?

1837
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:45,009
I imagined something funny.

1838
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:46,010
(The fascinating Mother Nature makes you imaginative.)

1839
01:17:46,011 --> 01:17:47,679
Something coming out of the volcano...

1840
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,210
- blah, blah.
- So funny.

1841
01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:51,320
But in reality, it's a dangerous place.

1842
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,950
- You're right.
- Right? It can erupt any time.

1843
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:59,019
Is it a dormant volcano? Or is it an active volcano?

1844
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,990
It must be an active one to be producing the steam.

1845
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,559
(Is it a dormant volcano or an active volcano?)

1846
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,300
They said it wasn't an active volcano.

1847
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,900
I don't think it's a dormant volcano.

1848
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:09,270
(It's spurting out the steam endlessly.)

1849
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:11,700
(The spring water is boiling hot.)

1850
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:14,239
(It's an active volcano...)

1851
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,840
(that's very much active.)

1852
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:18,879
- Right.
- The steam...

1853
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,179
- spurts out.
- And it makes that hissing sound.

1854
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:22,910
They are walking all the way there.

1855
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:27,650
(It turns out...)

1856
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:31,690
(there are many people on the volcano.)

1857
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:35,560
(They are observing from right next to the steam.)

1858
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:40,730
(Sulfur volcano is a volcano that usually discharges steam.)

1859
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,299
(So you can follow the permitted sightseeing track...)

1860
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:47,270
(and observe it closely.)

1861
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:51,140
(It's a special experience to walk on the active volcano.)

1862
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:53,980
(Take me a good photo.)

1863
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:56,080
How can nature be like this?

1864
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:58,750
Why is the floor white?

1865
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:02,890
- Perhaps it's sulfur?
- Is that sulfur powder?

1866
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:04,819
Wouldn't it be because of sulfur?

1867
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:06,060
(Why is there white powder piled up on the floor in summer?)

1868
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:13,829
(He smells it first.)

1869
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:15,970
- Does it smell?
- It doesn't smell of anything.

1870
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:19,800
Let's ask AI.

1871
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:26,309
We're at the mountain where a sulfur hot spring runs.

1872
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:29,410
Why is there white powder on the floor?

1873
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:32,279
(She somehow managed to ask the question.)

1874
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,019
(Searching)

1875
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:38,460
It's sand with high sulfur content.

1876
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:40,729
When it's exposed to the oxygen in the air,

1877
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:41,889
it turns into sulfur crystals,

1878
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:44,359
and they are deposited on the floor as yellow or white powder.

1879
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,099
(Yellow powder contains sulfur, )

1880
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,829
(and white powder contains silica and sulfate.)

1881
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:50,640
Right. But it's like that only here. Look at that mountain.

1882
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,869
(Unlike this mountain, barren and covered with mineral dust...)

1883
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:55,310
Compare the two mountains. It's like inferno and paradise.

1884
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:59,179
The two mountains look completely different.

1885
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:00,180
(The mountain without the steam is nice and green.)

1886
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:04,350
(It's a fascinating terrain with two types of mountains.)

1887
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,449
Compare the two mountains. It's like inferno and paradise.

1888
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:08,890
This mountain, that mountain.

1889
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:12,990
- Flowers bloom.
- Bloom.

1890
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,959
- Run!
- I knew she would do that.

1891
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,960
(Running)

1892
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:24,299
(Laughing)

1893
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:26,399
(Come, Hye Young.)

1894
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,909
(Wait for me, Mi Ran!)

1895
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,310
Mi Ran!

1896
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:38,279
(She's like a zebra...)

1897
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:41,890
(racing on a white snow field.)

1898
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,720
(She jumps lightly like sulfur smoke.)

1899
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:50,059
Because the ground is white,

1900
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:51,060
- people stand out more.
- I know.

1901
01:20:51,061 --> 01:20:53,230
Because of the color of their clothes.

1902
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:54,770
Okay.

1903
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:56,300
Let's go.

1904
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:02,610
(They leave the heat of Mother Nature behind.)

1905
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:06,210
(It's time for Hye Young to leave.)

1906
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:08,350
Goodness, I don't want to leave.

1907
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,980
(What did you say?)

1908
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:13,990
(A bang filled with bittersweet vibes)

1909
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:15,790
(Affectionate)

1910
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:18,290
(Sighing)

1911
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,359
(Peeking)

1912
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,490
I feel sad.

1913
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:29,030
(Posing)

1914
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:30,970
(The three ladies take photos of each other.)

1915
01:21:30,971 --> 01:21:32,399
(Giggling)

1916
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,700
I love it.

1917
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:35,509
Wait.

1918
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:37,710
(And there's a father.)

1919
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:40,009
(Standing afar)

1920
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,510
Mr. Nakamura!

1921
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:45,479
("Yes" is one of a few Japanese words he knows.)

1922
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,920
(Very...)

1923
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:49,689
(Laughing)

1924
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:51,890
I am otaku.

1925
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,429
(Okane)

1926
01:21:54,430 --> 01:21:57,430
(I said otaku, not okane.)

1927
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:01,269
Look here. Please look here.

1928
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:03,670
(I will take a photo of you all.)

1929
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:05,469
I love the composition.

1930
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:06,869
(I love the composition.)

1931
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:09,009
I love how Na Ra is standing away from them.

1932
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:12,209
(Laughing)

1933
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:14,109
Wait. I am going to use the timer.

1934
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:15,579
(She puts the camera upright to take a family photo.)

1935
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:16,980
You can fix it upright.

1936
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,450
Hee Won.

1937
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:22,220
(Posing awkwardly)

1938
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,459
This is nice.

1939
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:25,889
(Thanks to Hye Young, they take a lovely photo.)

1940
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:27,390
That was nice.

1941
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:31,859
Now... Take care, Hye Young.

1942
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,059
Thank you.

1943
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,629
- Bye.
- Please come back.

1944
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:38,299
(They show the father-daughter chemistry until the end.)

1945
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:39,999
Before I go,

1946
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,039
I will give you...

1947
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,040
(She takes things out of it.)

1948
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:43,710
this padded jacket.

1949
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:45,939
(Last night at the camp site...)

1950
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:47,179
It's freezing.

1951
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:49,650
(It's freezing.)

1952
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:52,149
It's freezing here.

1953
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:53,720
Do you want this?

1954
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:56,149
Do you want to try it on?

1955
01:22:56,150 --> 01:22:58,789
No, I am too lazy to take off my jacket.

1956
01:22:58,790 --> 01:22:59,890
- Really?
- Wear it on top.

1957
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:03,060
You should wear this today.

1958
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:04,660
- Thank you.
- It's too cold.

1959
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:09,830
(Hye Young lent her the extra vest she brought.)

1960
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:12,600
(Happy)

1961
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,570
(Happy)

1962
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:15,840
I love it.

1963
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:20,239
(Thanks to Hye Young, Na Ra stayed warm today.)

1964
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:21,309
(I love it.)

1965
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:23,050
(Thanks to Hye Young, Na Ra stayed warm today.)

1966
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:24,779
I will give you this.

1967
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:25,849
- Give her the vest then.
- I...

1968
01:23:25,850 --> 01:23:27,219
I will take the vest.

1969
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,489
I will make sure to clean it...

1970
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:30,520
and return it.

1971
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:32,159
- Thank you so much.
- She will return it.

1972
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:33,459
- It will keep you warm.
- Na Ra.

1973
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:35,330
If you go out of reach, it will be yours.

1974
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:38,599
Na Ra shouldn't catch a cold.

1975
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:39,759
I am so grateful.

1976
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:40,900
(They are sweet until the end.)

1977
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:43,900
- I had a lot of fun.
- You traveled so far.

1978
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,469
- I...
- Thank you for the jacket too.

1979
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:48,510
- Thank you.
- Take care.

1980
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,309
(And...)

1981
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:52,780
Thank you for coming.

1982
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,250
Yes.

1983
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:55,879
Stay happy.

1984
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,079
Let's get together sometime.

1985
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,550
- Bye.
- I will get going then.

1986
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,150
Peace.

1987
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:07,060
She's happy to go alone.

1988
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:08,760
Hye Young,

1989
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:10,700
we parked in the same parking lot though.

1990
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:13,030
Okay.

1991
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:14,369
Let's go.

1992
01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:16,869
We are going to the same parking lot, so don't go yet.

1993
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:18,240
- Okay.
- She's...

1994
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:21,469
Maybe someone else might come this evening?

1995
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:23,940
- Someone is coming.
- She must be on the way.

1996
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:26,480
Following the route I took yesterday.

1997
01:24:30,450 --> 01:24:31,820
(Worried)

1998
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:36,020
That thought suddenly pops up in my head.

1999
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,219
How can I be seeing Jang Na Ra?

2000
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:41,430
(How can I be seeing Jang Na Ra?)

2001
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:43,660
She was my idol.

2002
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:45,600
She was my wannabe.

2003
01:24:46,430 --> 01:24:50,169
What am I going to do in front of her?

2004
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:51,640
I don't know.

2005
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:56,710
(When Na Ra's biggest fan arrived in Hokkaido, )

2006
01:24:57,010 --> 01:24:58,139
Dot, dot, dot.

2007
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:59,879
(Na Ra, the idol...)

2008
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,380
(of Na Ra's biggest fan is...)

2009
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:04,519
(What?)

2010
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:05,920
Look at the sky on the left side!

2011
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:09,020
Look at that sky.

2012
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:10,920
It's like a croissant.

2013
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:13,819
It's like a croissant that's put upright.

2014
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:15,589
- It looks like a croissant.
- That looks like a croissant?

2015
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:16,929
It looks like waves to me.

2016
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:18,500
As soon as I saw it, I thought of a croissant.

2017
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:21,529
Are you craving for a croissant right now?

2018
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:24,570
No, it's the layers that reminded me of a croissant.

2019
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,369
It's like a croissant put upright.

2020
01:25:26,370 --> 01:25:27,870
(She's just a bread lover now.)

2021
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:35,750
(How will Na Ra's biggest fan and the bread lover meet?)

2022
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:39,850
(Sun Bin is here.)

2023
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:44,720
(Sun Bin is the self-claimed No. 1 fan of Jang Na Ra.)

2024
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,059
(She spends the day with her favorite artist.)

2025
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:48,259
(You are a good person.)

2026
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:49,860
(Thank you, Good Person.)

2027
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:52,430
(Pressing with love)

2028
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:54,770
(She's got too much love.)

2029
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:56,230
(Gasping)

2030
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,400
(Acting cute)

2031
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:00,040
(Na Ra gets infected with Sun Bin's energy.)

2032
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:02,169
(Spirit!)

2033
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:03,640
(Thanks to Sun Bin, Na Ra becomes full of energy.)

2034
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:08,810
(Jang Na Ra is unleashed.)

2035
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,980
(What happened to her overnight?)

2036
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:13,550
(You call pork barbecue a light brunch?)

2037
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:16,320
(Mi Ran, the Eating Expert, joins her in the kitchen.)

2038
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:19,820
(Dong Il and Mi Ran work together.)

2039
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:25,330
(Their collaboration produces many dishes.)

2040
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,470
(Give a shout!)

2041
01:26:28,630 --> 01:26:29,969
Is she eating it all or tasting it?

2042
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:31,070
(Just eat.)

2043
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:32,570
(Eating Expert Mi Ran...)

2044
01:26:32,571 --> 01:26:34,340
(versus Chef Sung)

2045
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:39,140
(Their eventful match)

2046
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:43,050
(And...)

2047
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:44,719
(Hokkaido's biggest wild forest)

2048
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,020
(Shiretoko)

2049
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:47,749
(They enter the pristine primeval forest.)

2050
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:48,890
(The deer.)

2051
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,790
(They witness the pristine primeval forest.)

2052
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:54,329
(And...)

2053
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:56,590
(another face of Mother Nature)

2054
01:26:56,890 --> 01:26:59,460
(The wild zone at night...)

2055
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:03,800
(makes even Dong Il terrified.)

2056
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,800
(What happened to the family?)

2057
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:11,810
(Sung Dong Il)

2058
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:13,910
(Kim Hee Won, Jang Na Ra)

2059
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:22,890
(House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean)
