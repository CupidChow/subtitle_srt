1
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,440
(Sung Dong Il)

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,980
(Kim Hee Won, Jang Na Ra)

3
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,820
(House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean)

4
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,859
(The guests have left, )

5
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,630
(and the morning has come.)

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,500
Let's go. Here we go.

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,029
Let's go.

8
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,899
(Biei, Furano, campsite, Sapporo)

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,040
(It's time to go to another front yard.)

10
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,209
- The place we're going now...
- Yes?

11
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,310
We have to go further to the east.

12
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,050
We have to travel 240km.

13
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,090
(Serious)

14
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,390
(Where we're headed today)

15
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,960
(Lake Kussharo)

16
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,170
(This is not a common Hokkaido tourist destination.)

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,470
(It's a place not many tourists visit.)

18
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,050
(Into the unknown world)

19
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,349
(Daisetsuzan National Park)

20
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,659
(With Daisetsuzan National Park in the middle)

21
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,189
(West, East)

22
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,789
(Hokkaido is divided in half between the west and east sides.)

23
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,830
(West)

24
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,300
(While the transient popular is concentrated on the west side, )

25
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,270
(Hokkaido's east area...)

26
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,010
That's sulfur.

27
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,679
This area is totally nature itself.

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,249
The mountains have a totally different feel.

29
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,979
(Lush, )

30
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,420
(magnificent nature)

31
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,790
(There, we'll meet...)

32
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,330
(the owners of this land, the wild animal.)

33
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,070
(House on Wheels is headed into the heart of this land.)

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,810
We won't see this kind of city from now on.

35
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,249
(After driving for about 3 hours, over 240km)

36
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,679
(Biei, Lake Kussharo)

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,549
(Our house is headed to a secluded road.)

38
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,550
If we go a bit farther,

39
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,620
we'll be in the area...

40
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,590
with many sightings of bears and deer.

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,830
Bears and deer.

42
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,400
- Make sure to wipe...
- Yes?

43
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,670
The camera lens of your phone.

44
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,430
You don't know when you'll see them.

45
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,269
Should I take the pictures while driving?

46
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,470
You should...

47
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,516
You should drive with one hand and take pictures with the other.

48
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,140
I'll be on standby.

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,640
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

50
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,880
But look.

51
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,180
- You barely even see any people.
- You're right.

52
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,020
- I don't even see any puppies.
- Right.

53
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,619
(Forget about wild animals. There aren't even any people.)

54
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,860
I'd say it's a success if we take a picture of a person.

55
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,559
With the sun setting,

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,960
all of the trees,

57
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,470
driving down a road without many cars on it,

58
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,440
it kind of feels like the beginning of a horror movie.

59
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,870
You're right.

60
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,210
(It feels like something will pop out on this eerie road.)

61
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,880
(My gosh)

62
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,450
Later, we'll lose phone service.

63
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,650
- Right.
- Right.

64
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,919
Nothing works in this area.

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,750
- The car suddenly breaks down.
- Yes.

66
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,290
(Oh, my gosh)

67
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,090
(The horror gets worse.)

68
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:58,230
(Our house was crossing the silent forest.)

69
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,800
There are no people or cars, but...

70
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,870
I'm starting to get a bit nervous.

71
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,140
The internet signal has been...

72
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,610
- Is it gone?
- Yes.

73
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,580
We're starting to lose connection.

74
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,880
What you say can come true. I'm nervous.

75
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,780
"The three went into the forest."

76
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,020
(Pupils expanding)

77
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,820
Dong Il, do you want some snacks?

78
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,090
(Scared)

79
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,790
- Oh, I see.
- Here.

80
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,430
Have some.

81
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,330
- Do you want some, Hee Won?
- Pardon?

82
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,099
- Want some?
- Sure.

83
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,500
(Handing it to him without looking)

84
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,740
(Keeping his eyes on the road)

85
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,940
(Glancing over)

86
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,570
Dong Il, sitting there is making you nervous, right?

87
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,509
You're not even driving,

88
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,510
but you handed me the snack without looking at me.

89
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,580
It was so funny.

90
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,920
- Are you driving?
- No.

91
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,420
(Giggling)

92
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,790
I had to see if any cars were coming our way.

93
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,359
I've never seen someone hand the driver a snack...

94
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,860
without looking at the driver.

95
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,929
It's getting dark,

96
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,460
and we've never been here before.

97
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,830
You're right.

98
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,600
- There's a car coming.
- Thank you.

99
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,639
- I'll drive safely.
- I finally...

100
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,000
- Deer.
- There's a deer sign.

101
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,670
Finally.

102
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,980
(We finally see a road sign with a deer on it.)

103
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,350
(Like the natural area it is, )

104
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:29,749
(Hokkaido has many signs to look out for animals.)

105
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,659
The level keeps going up.

106
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,059
- Later, we'll see dinosaurs.
- Dinosaurs...

107
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,590
- Is this a safari adventure?
- It is.

108
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,559
We're passing through the deer section.

109
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,799
(Safari on Wheels, This is the deer sighting area.)

110
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,500
- I like it.
- I like it.

111
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,900
(Suddenly, she looks out the window.)

112
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,069
It's so dark here.

113
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,169
(Next to the gray rain clouds)

114
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,469
It's golden.

115
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,539
(A golden sunset)

116
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,540
How pretty.

117
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,639
- Isn't it pretty?
- It is.

118
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,850
(Next to the gray rain clouds is a golden sunset.)

119
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,450
(The sunset and rain clouds are side by side.)

120
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,819
Like the painting, "Creation of Adam."

121
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,120
(A landscape painted by nature)

122
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,800
(Next to our House on Wheels, we can now see...)

123
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:20,440
(Lake Kussharo)

124
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:27,340
(A giant caldera like made by nature)

125
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,219
(In the basin made by a volcanic eruption...)

126
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,720
(tens of thousands of years ago, )

127
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,089
(water collected and became Japan's largest caldera lake...)

128
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,220
(with a circumference of 57km.)

129
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,060
(Due to volcanic activity, thermal water bubbles up...)

130
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,930
(in various spots around the lake.)

131
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,870
(People can enjoy hot springs in nature...)

132
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,210
(around Lake Kussharo, our next front yard.)

133
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,979
(On the huge lake)

134
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,679
- It's pouring, right?
- It's so foggy.

135
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,049
- It's pouring.
- Onto the lake.

136
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,209
Oh, that fog-like thing is rain?

137
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,019
Yes, the rain is pouring onto the lake.

138
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,449
(Front-row seats to a pouring rain shower)

139
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,550
How cool.

140
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,989
We should've looked this way, not at the sunset.

141
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,130
You're right.

142
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,859
(Although they didn't see any wild animals, )

143
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,140
(they can really feel that they're surrounded by nature.)

144
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,269
It's so dark that I can barely see anything.

145
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,069
(We've finally arrived at today's front yard.)

146
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,939
- Oh, we go in this way?
- Yes.

147
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,940
Okay.

148
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:30,969
(We parked on the grass with permission from the campsite.)

149
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,009
(Current time: 6:50pm)

150
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,210
We can't see anything right now because it's nighttime.

151
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,009
Oh, I'm exhausted.

152
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,979
(Oh, I'm exhausted.)

153
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,820
Okay. Since we don't have time,

154
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,519
- let's quickly...
- Should we have some ramyeon...

155
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,119
- and go to bed?
- eat some ramyeon and go to bed.

156
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,990
- Nice and easy.
- Nice and easy.

157
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,729
- Where is our ramyeon?
- Up there.

158
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,800
- I think it was up here.
- There it is.

159
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,929
- Oh, my. Let's just...
- There it is.

160
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,530
- eat ramyeon today.
- Yes.

161
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,600
(Just the smell of the ramyeon makes him sing.)

162
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,909
(Once the soup starts to boil)

163
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,940
Okay.

164
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,240
(Using her strength to break the noodle block in half)

165
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Okay.

166
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:10,241
(She adds in the noodles she broke in half.)

167
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,150
(This seems too simple...)

168
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,719
Kimchi ramyeon.

169
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,520
(He changes it up to aged kimchi ramyeon.)

170
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,860
This gives it an extra layer of flavor.

171
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,500
Oh, my. You just put in the kimchi, and I can already smell it.

172
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,600
(I can't wait any longer!)

173
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,439
(The smell draws him into the kitchen.)

174
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,469
- I'm a pretty good ramyeon maker.
- Really? Then you should make it.

175
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,440
- Okay. I mean, this is all I do.
- Okay.

176
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,010
(I just wanted to smell it up close.)

177
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,450
That looks delicious.

178
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,080
This has to be delicious.

179
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,020
Our ramyeon restaurant is open.

180
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,589
- That looks delicious.
- That looks delicious.

181
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,430
(Just looking at it makes them salivate.)

182
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,170
- Here you go.
- Oh, my!

183
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,870
- Applause.
- Hurry on over, honey.

184
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,239
This is it.

185
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,710
(With 3 side dishes, this meal looks incredible.)

186
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,179
My gosh. Look at the color.

187
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,640
(Aged kimchi ramyeon)

188
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,609
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

189
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,750
Bon appetit.

190
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,720
(That's what I'm talking about!)

191
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,560
(Slurping)

192
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,460
(Oh, my!)

193
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,459
This is it.

194
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,260
(Ramyeon tastes extra tasty while on a trip.)

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,340
(Their slurping sounds fill the house.)

196
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,980
(I'm sweating.)

197
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,850
(Taking a bite with the nicely aged kimchi)

198
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,979
This kimchi in the ramyeon...

199
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,620
- is seriously delicious.
- It really is.

200
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,260
(The kimchi added a nice spicy kick to the ramyeon.)

201
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,990
- I like it.
- I like it.

202
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,030
Why do our tastes never change?

203
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,230
I get why.

204
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,500
(That hits the spot.)

205
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,100
- The soup is so refreshing.
- The soup is nice, right?

206
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,170
Instead of adding rice into the ramyeon broth,

207
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,139
I prefer taking some noodles like this...

208
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,940
and eating it with the rice.

209
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,310
He likes light things.

210
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,980
(This is that carb and carb combo.)

211
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,990
The broth is really taking away my carsickness.

212
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,129
The broth is really taking away my carsickness.

213
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,760
Same, I got a bit carsick too.

214
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,169
(The hot ramyeon soup washes away their exhaustion.)

215
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,529
We were driving for so long.

216
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,070
(The hot ramyeon soup washes away their exhaustion.)

217
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,610
(He only has soup left.)

218
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,080
(Drinking the last bit of soup)

219
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,320
The guests who are coming tomorrow...

220
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,320
I think I'm losing it.

221
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,050
How can we best host them?

222
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,629
It takes seven hours from the airport to here.

223
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,029
Oh, gosh. It's seven hours excluding the time it takes them...

224
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,829
to go from their house to the airport...

225
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,699
- and to fly here.
- Excluding all of that.

226
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,829
Yes, seven hours.

227
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,100
- They'll be sitting...
- For seven hours.

228
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,469
- For almost four hours...
- I'm so grateful.

229
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,230
(She's so grateful they're willing to come.)

230
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,246
I'll treat her like an older sister.

231
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,409
Right, regardless of their age, let's treat the guests...

232
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,039
who are coming tomorrow like older sisters.

233
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,726
(Who will they be treating like older sisters?)

234
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,150
Okay, then. Let's go to sleep early today.

235
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,380
- Sounds good.
- We're all tired. All right.

236
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,066
Since our guests are coming tomorrow,

237
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,419
- let's prepare something yummy.
- Okay.

238
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,380
(Tired from all the driving, we call it a night.)

239
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,660
(After a cozy night with just the three members, )

240
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,660
(a new morning comes to the lake.)

241
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,530
(Who will come to our house today?)

242
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,340
We're late. We need to hurry. We have 15 minutes left.

243
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,440
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

244
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,940
Let's go.

245
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,380
Let's so meet our guest, who has come a long way.

246
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,219
She really did come a long way.

247
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,250
(Hurriedly heading out to pick up the guest)

248
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,750
(Looking over)

249
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,590
(Looking over)

250
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,060
(Poking his head out)

251
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,800
(Dong Il seems a bit excited.)

252
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,670
Since the weather is like this,

253
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,470
I want to serve her something warm.

254
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,400
- Nurungji.
- Nice.

255
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,670
Something similar to nurungji.

256
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,710
If she wants a bonfire, we'll make one.

257
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,800
I can even burn the house for her if she's cold.

258
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,210
- We can use our gas.
- Burning up.

259
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:41,080
(Driving with the determination to even burn the house)

260
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,560
(Who is the guest they're heading to pick up?)

261
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,890
(10am, They arrive at the meeting location.)

262
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,160
(Is she already here?)

263
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,400
(Meanwhile...)

264
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,240
They're...

265
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,440
They're parking?

266
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,880
(This hiker looks very suspicious...)

267
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,890
Where are they coming from?

268
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
I lost them.

269
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,250
(Very sloppy hide-and-seek)

270
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,020
Where is she?

271
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,249
We're meeting here, right?

272
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,336
(She's right in front of them, but the members have no idea.)

273
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,860
- Where is she?
- Isn't she your guest?

274
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,889
- What?
- Isn't she your guest?

275
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,990
I mean...

276
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,100
I'm meeting her for the first time today.

277
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,569
- What are you talking about?
- It's my first time.

278
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,699
- Seriously?
- Yes.

279
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
- You too?
- Yes.

280
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:31,739
(Today's guest has never met Hee Won or Na Ra.)

281
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,840
I see.

282
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,270
(Bickering while their guest is right in front of them)

283
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,840
(Did I do too good a job hiding?)

284
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,480
(This won't do!)

285
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,780
- Dad!
- Oh, my!

286
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,220
- Dad!
- Oh, my!

287
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,390
(This guest calls Dong Il "Dad?")

288
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,830
(Here to see Dad Dong Il...)

289
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,059
(is his handful daughter, Ryu Hye Young.)

290
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,429
Hello!

291
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,150
(It's his handful daughter, Ryu Hye Young.)

292
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,230
(She was Dad Dong Il's pride in "Reply 1988...")

293
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,610
(but also a scary oldest daughter.)

294
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,909
(What do you know, Dad?)

295
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,280
(Slamming the door)

296
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,109
(I'm sorry, my daughter, for making you come all this way...)

297
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,650
(Holding back tears)

298
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,220
(Study what you want.)

299
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,020
(Prepare for the bar exam.)

300
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,219
(Thanks to Dad Dong Il's support, )

301
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,359
(she became a lawyer in the drama "Law and the City.")

302
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,589
(She laughs a lot, )

303
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,629
(eats well, )

304
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,530
(is good at her job.)

305
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,930
(Dong Il's favorite daughter, Ryo Hye Young)

306
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,200
(Dad, I'm here.)

307
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,940
(With Hye Young here, this feels like a real home.)

308
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,810
(A touching father-daughter reunion)

309
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,980
(And next to them...)

310
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,309
(Awkward)

311
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,009
- Hello.
- You...

312
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,349
- You really came a long way.
- I can't believe...

313
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,619
- we're meeting here.
- Seriously.

314
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,919
- Hello, Na Ra.
- Hello.

315
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,460
(Meeting the family for the first time)

316
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,690
Na Ra, this is...

317
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,259
limited-edition choco pie...

318
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,659
(Quickly grabbing it)

319
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,500
I heard you liked snacks.

320
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,929
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

321
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,570
(So touched at the unexpected gift)

322
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,640
- What about mine?
- I'll give it to you later.

323
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,139
Really? My gosh. You came such a long way.

324
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,209
It must've been such an exhausting trip.

325
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,909
- No, it was very comfortable.
- Hee Won and Na Ra...

326
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,586
(They are both grateful and sorry that she came all this way.)

327
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,680
How long did it take?

328
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,979
- How long? Well, yesterday...
- Sorry. I feel bad asking.

329
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,950
Right. I arrived at the airport around 2,

330
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,719
- and I landed past 11pm.
- Oh, no.

331
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,389
- The day kept...
- I'm sorry.

332
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,060
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

333
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,099
- I get it.
- I didn't even have...

334
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,199
phone service at some point.

335
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,680
- Right, you lose phone service.
- There was no phone service.

336
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,340
While we don't have phone service,

337
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,840
- we can have fun together.
- You're right.

338
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,540
(We have a positive guest today.)

339
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,079
But because of the storm, it's hard to have fun.

340
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,009
I actually love the rain.

341
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,510
- I do too.
- Did I bring the rain?

342
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,926
- I'm so happy right now...
- Go back to Korea.

343
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,549
Right? I think the weather will clear up if I go back.

344
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,089
- Give me your bag. It's heavy.
- Thank you.

345
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,889
It's heavy. I'll carry it for you.

346
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,106
(Dad will carry the bag since Hye Young came a long way.)

347
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,530
I'm glad you're here.

348
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,899
What was it? Tell us.

349
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,060
What do you want to eat?

350
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,129
How about going all out at the convenience store for lunch?

351
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,130
It'll be a simple meal.

352
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:19,139
- The convenience store?
- Yes.

353
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,939
- Shall we?
- Yes to everything.

354
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,809
- Yes to everything.
- We're in on anything.

355
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,970
- Right?
- Yes to everything.

356
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,879
That's a convenience store too.

357
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,009
- Really?
- Go ahead and choose as round one.

358
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,050
Okay.

359
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,019
Just don't steal.

360
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,279
Yes, sir. We're finally here!

361
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,719
Good. Let's go.

362
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,189
- This is...
- What's up today?

363
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,420
Go and choose.

364
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,730
Choose what you want to eat.

365
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,659
- Do you like mushrooms?
- Me?

366
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,660
I love them.

367
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:47,699
Same here.

368
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,200
Can we grill ingredients?

369
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,590
- We can grill anything.
- Like vegetables.

370
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,639
- I'll carry it.
- No, I will. It's okay.

371
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
(A rock-solid defense)

372
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,169
Let's grill bell peppers.

373
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,780
Okay. Pick some.

374
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,609
- The tomatoes are so pretty.
- For real.

375
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,050
- Cute, aren't they?
- Yes.

376
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,279
- Shall we buy one?
- Get it.

377
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,380
Shall we grill it?

378
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,920
It sounds good.

379
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,950
- Let's go.
- All right.

380
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,219
Shall we get some milk?

381
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,259
- Do they not sell milk?
- Milk?

382
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,319
- Milk.
- Milk.

383
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,660
- Okay.
- Let's get some milk.

384
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,130
Do you like milk?

385
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:18,459
I have a feeling I should have milk in Japan.

386
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,129
Milk is good.

387
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,660
- I don't drink it often.
- Yes.

388
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,570
- My gut tells me you like milk.
- I do.

389
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,369
- The last one.
- This one looks good.

390
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,469
That one? Okay.

391
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,340
(Moving)

392
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,279
(Putting it in right away)

393
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,340
Look around.

394
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,079
- But whatever you want.
- There's milk here.

395
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,109
- Milk.
- Good.

396
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,150
- Which milk? Chocolate milk?
- Milk.

397
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,279
This one's coffee milk, then there's white milk and chocolate milk.

398
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,750
You're right. What about yogurt?

399
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,989
- You can buy anything.
- Anything?

400
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,660
(You can buy anything.)

401
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,660
That one is fresh farm milk.

402
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,860
One fresh farm milk.

403
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,730
- Me too.
- Get fresh farm milk.

404
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,959
You get two.

405
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,229
(My daughter can get 2.)

406
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,330
- Really?
- Yes.

407
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,540
Coffee and chocolate milk.

408
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,969
- No farm milk?
- I've already put in one farm milk.

409
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,009
- You chose three?
- I chose three. Is that okay?

410
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,379
But I said two. No, it's okay.

411
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,509
Maybe I'll take coffee milk out.

412
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,750
No, try it.

413
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,810
- Milk is good here.
- Can we go?

414
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,119
- She's very bright.
- What?

415
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,190
- Hye Young is very bright.
- Yes, she's energetic.

416
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,050
- What a relief.
- Nice.

417
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,660
Excuse me. Ma'am.

418
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,960
(Dong Il suddenly starts a conversation with a staff member?)

419
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,599
A famous restaurant in Hokkaido.

420
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,670
- In Hokkaido?
- Yes.

421
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,239
I'm asking about the best restaurant in the area.

422
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,340
(Dad wants to take his daughter to a local must-try place.)

423
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,939
- Butadon?
- Butadon?

424
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,739
- Butadon?
- I was craving it last night.

425
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,380
- You were?
- Butadon?

426
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,980
It's not nearby, but there's a city named Obihiro.

427
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,880
That's where butadon originated.

428
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,690
- What's butadon?
- The origin.

429
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,019
Pork bowl.

430
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,089
(Japanese-style pork bowl)

431
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,090
The original.

432
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,329
- She even came with information.
- I did.

433
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,830
(Feeling proud of her)

434
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,430
(Meanwhile, the staff member has found the restaurant's address.)

435
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,699
- It's four minutes by car.
- Four minutes. Okay.

436
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,600
- Go.
- Thank you.

437
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,569
(Thanking the staff member)

438
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,209
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

439
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,609
We're really lucky, Hye Young.

440
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,679
To think that the lady recommended that to us.

441
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,749
- Exactly, and it's close.
- It was what she was craving.

442
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,050
- I know, right?
- Great.

443
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,479
The weather is amazing.

444
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,579
- The weather is clearing up.
- Yes.

445
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,589
(Feeling happy)

446
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,490
As expected, my daughter...

447
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,290
- My daughter. Nice.
- I bring good weather.

448
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,959
She has a really bright personality.

449
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
- Me?
- Hye Young?

450
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,659
I'm so happy to have come here.

451
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,029
I'm going to stop being formal.

452
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,469
Please do so. Please stop being formal.

453
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,529
(You too, Na Ra!)

454
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,399
- May I do that?
- Of course.

455
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,940
- Please stop being formal.
- Okay.

456
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,140
(Shaking it from happiness)

457
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,240
Butadon that my daughter is craving.

458
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,780
- Butadon!
- Butadon, here we go.

459
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,280
She has a completely different energy. I love it.

460
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,349
She's optimistic.

461
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,720
Hye Young is...

462
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,920
The girls are called the handful daughters in the "Reply" series.

463
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,490
Among all the daughters, Hye Young is the most reliable.

464
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,199
All of a sudden, the atmosphere has become bright.

465
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,029
(That's the charm of my daughter.)

466
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,099
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

467
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,629
- Poppotei.
- Is that the place?

468
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,740
- Yes, it's Poppotei.
- We're here.

469
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,939
That's the way in.

470
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,910
- Shall I turn here?
- Yes.

471
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,079
These chairs must be for waiting, Dong Il.

472
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,410
There are chairs for waiting.

473
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,550
That is the symbol of a must-try place.

474
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,910
Chairs for waiting.

475
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,120
But there's no line.

476
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,079
- What a relief.
- Nice.

477
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,820
- Let's go.
- Amazing.

478
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,619
- Go in.
- Thank you.

479
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,190
Hi.

480
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,230
- Hi.
- Hi.

481
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,060
(What kind of vibe does the restaurant have?)

482
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,400
- Thank you.
- It's so pretty.

483
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,740
(A wood-toned, cozy local restaurant)

484
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,810
(Like the locals' recommended must-try place, )

485
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,480
(the neighborhood residents come for a hearty meal here.)

486
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,009
We've come at the perfect time.

487
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,920
(Excited)

488
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,050
Choose.

489
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Let's ask.

490
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,490
Butadon.

491
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:07,590
(Hye Young chooses the Japanese-style pork bowl.)

492
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,959
- This looks good.
- I want this one.

493
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
- Right?
- What is it?

494
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,159
- It looks like an assortment.
- A set menu.

495
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,030
- A set menu with an assortment.
- A set menu?

496
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,930
And what's this one?

497
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,930
- Thank you.
- It's ramen.

498
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,170
It's a popular dish.

499
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,740
Isn't it with...

500
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,579
Clams?

501
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,910
There are no clams in it.

502
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,079
(To think it'd get through.)

503
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,160
She communicated with this.

504
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,719
You too are amazing. She takes after me, right?

505
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,620
- Totally.
- It's my survival instinct.

506
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,789
- All right.
- I want to get this one. Butadon.

507
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,389
- One of these, and one of that.
- Yes.

508
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,429
- One each.
- And?

509
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,490
- What else are you craving?
- Which one?

510
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,529
We should get chicken nanban.

511
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,069
- This one?
- Okay.

512
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,930
All right. Since you're craving it...

513
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,740
- Get one and share it.
- Let's share.

514
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,640
Is this spaghetti?

515
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,140
That's also ramen.

516
00:21:58,141 --> 00:21:59,710
(Na Ra, who was staring at the two)

517
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,609
This, this, this, and this. These four.

518
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,709
What's this?

519
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,250
(What's this, my dear daughter?)

520
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,320
(I want this one, Dad.)

521
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,060
- Don't you like mutton?
- I rarely eat it.

522
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,840
- Then...
- Shall we get it?

523
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,029
- One of these.
- Would you like regular?

524
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,760
- Regular, please.
- Okay.

525
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:21,400
(Ordering without a hitch)

526
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,399
She speaks a bit of Japanese.

527
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,629
- Right?
- Hye Young studies Japanese.

528
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,740
I think she's able to read all the letters.

529
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,370
Yes, I can read both hiragana and katakana.

530
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,439
I can't memorize katakana.

531
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,509
Is that so?

532
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,979
- They confuse me.
- I still get katakana mixed up.

533
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,449
All of them look the same.

534
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,109
Totally, the katakana letters look similar.

535
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,019
- All of what?
- Katakana.

536
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,420
- Katakana.
- I see.

537
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,990
I thought you meant something else.

538
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,220
I'm meeting Hye Young for the first time today,

539
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,059
- and I was a bit taken aback.
- She's completely different...

540
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,060
when she acts versus when she doesn't.

541
00:22:51,061 --> 00:22:52,929
- I was surprised.
- Why? Please be honest.

542
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,229
Since we're meeting for the first time,

543
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,769
I looked you up online and watched videos, like your interviews.

544
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,346
- I watched several.
- She's totally different.

545
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,739
When I watched the interviews, I thought, "She and I must have..."

546
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,140
"quite a lot in common."

547
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,339
"Hye Young must think a lot by herself."

548
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,340
She does.

549
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,979
Something like this.

550
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,780
Correct, she keeps thinking about acting.

551
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,180
Same here.

552
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,579
You seem like it.

553
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,520
I'm totally like that.

554
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,160
But now that I'm over 30 years old, all I'm left with are jokes.

555
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,090
She wasn't this talkative at first.

556
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,559
I thought she must've gone through a serious hardship.

557
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,900
- Right.
- A hardship?

558
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,230
When we had just met her earlier,

559
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,869
I was more surprised than you two.

560
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,400
- Why?
- Although I didn't say it.

561
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,309
She was never the type to be expressive.

562
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,430
- True.
- Overly expressive.

563
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,309
- So in the past, she was...
- Yes.

564
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,950
- the quiet type.
- I was surprised.

565
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,620
"What happened?"

566
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,649
Right. Dad must've been...

567
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,919
I've never seen her wear a cropped top before today.

568
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,719
- Right. I've never...
- She never wore one?

569
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,529
Hye Young never wore such an outfit.

570
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,629
- I used to wear baggy clothes...
- Yes.

571
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,760
And walk around like this.

572
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,469
I was like that.

573
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,030
Did you get scammed or something?

574
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,899
- No.
- I was shocked, you know?

575
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,910
She did a 180.

576
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,890
- I've become outgoing, right?
- Yes.

577
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,410
To be honest, I stopped thinking since the end of last year.

578
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,249
"Let's stop thinking."

579
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,019
How much did you contemplate before coming to that conclusion?

580
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,460
Did you suddenly become enlightened?

581
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,149
Yes. I looked at myself in the mirror...

582
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,690
after washing up in the morning.

583
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,860
I was like, "What are you doing right now?"

584
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,329
"You're pretty, healthy,"

585
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,659
- "in perfect condition," - Right.

586
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,129
"and mentally healthy."

587
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,690
"What are you doing all alone at home?"

588
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,699
- "Let's show people my true self." - How cool.

589
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,570
I had such enlightenment last year.

590
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,210
Where did you get that mirror?

591
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,409
It was a mirror just hanging in my bathroom.

592
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,919
I asked because I wanted that mirror.

593
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,049
- Give him the mirror.
- Yes.

594
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,326
I'll take the mirror down and give it to you.

595
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,860
(I can become bright too.)

596
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,989
I love and feel relieved that the energy you're giving out...

597
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,229
- is all natural, from happiness.
- Right?

598
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,900
- It's not forced energy.
- Exactly.

599
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,599
I can't imagine the dilemma you faced before making your choice.

600
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,930
Yes, totally.

601
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,900
- I know for sure.
- But the thing is...

602
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,940
(That's cool.)

603
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,670
- Right.
- It's here.

604
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,939
(The food is here.)

605
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,940
- Chicken.
- Gosh.

606
00:25:20,941 --> 00:25:23,210
- Thank you. What's this?
- Here.

607
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,860
- It looks good.
- What is this?

608
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,719
- It's this one.
- Yes.

609
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
This one and...

610
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,790
(Japanese-style pork bowl)

611
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,130
(Trying the pork she's been craving since yesterday)

612
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,660
How is the pork so tender?

613
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,100
(Na Ra also tries a piece of pork.)

614
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,100
(Impressed)

615
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,840
- It's really tender.
- Is it?

616
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:56,350
(The sweet marinade has soaked into the pork.)

617
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,309
It's delicious.

618
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,380
- Really?
- Yes.

619
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,379
How is the pork so tender?

620
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,390
(The sauce is dripping.)

621
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,549
- Napkin.
- The sauce is different.

622
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,820
Thank you, my daughter.

623
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,820
I'm at the age where I need a bib.

624
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,730
(It's time to try the ramen with the white broth.)

625
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,399
The food is going down easily this morning.

626
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,600
(Slurping the noodles)

627
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,770
It's so good.

628
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,970
This is nothing like the ramen I've had until now.

629
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,380
- Is that so?
- Really?

630
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,939
There's not even an ounce...

631
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,150
- of salt in it.
- Seriously?

632
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,809
It's not salty at all. It tastes just like egg soup.

633
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:32,919
(Soothing like egg soup)

634
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,749
- Right?
- It's gentle on the stomach.

635
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,750
Exactly.

636
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:37,749
It's a good breakfast menu.

637
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,289
- Yes, it's easy on the stomach.
- Right?

638
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,689
Is it a soothing ramen?

639
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,820
- Yes.
- That's right.

640
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,760
- It's very mild.
- You can't taste even a bit of MSG.

641
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,930
- Is that so?
- Yes.

642
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,330
- Right?
- Yes.

643
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,430
What's this?

644
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:51,151
- What's with this flavor?
- I know, right?

645
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,470
I'm certain they used ground beans.

646
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,309
It's clean and creamy.

647
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,640
- Pureed soybean ramen?
- Yes.

648
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,240
- It's like pureed soybean ramen.
- Right?

649
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,010
(A savory and rich broth)

650
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,249
Such lightly seasoned ramen is a first for me.

651
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,019
- Exactly.
- Normally, it's salty,

652
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,820
so I end up drinking a ton of water.

653
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,089
- But this one is...
- It's nothing like that.

654
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,330
Right? It's savory, not salty.

655
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,359
- This is the best Japanese ramen...
- It's very savory.

656
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,700
- I've had.
- This one?

657
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,230
It's all thanks to my daughter.

658
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,130
- I must have good luck with food.
- Totally.

659
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,699
You brought the most important luck.

660
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,809
- A very important kind of luck.
- Yes.

661
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,910
- Right?
- Yes.

662
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,780
- I shouldn't have rice.
- I didn't realize...

663
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,180
You can work out again today.

664
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,850
- Later?
- Yes.

665
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,349
(How optimistic.)

666
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,480
It's still early in the day.

667
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,290
Have you been struck by lightning?

668
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,660
How can someone change so much?

669
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,660
She said the mirror did the trick.

670
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,189
The mirror must've been the lightning.

671
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,230
Exactly.

672
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,800
- The mirror...
- Lightning.

673
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,330
I'm happy for you.

674
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,630
- It was good.
- Was it?

675
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,470
The ramen...

676
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,139
(Hye Young wants to know the secret behind the soothing ramen.)

677
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,240
Beans?

678
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,080
Beans?

679
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,809
It has soybeans inside.

680
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,110
- Tofu...
- The tofu soybeans are inside.

681
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,350
The white thing is the soybeans used to make tofu.

682
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,019
- It was soybean noodles.
- Was that why it was soothing?

683
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Probably.

684
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,390
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

685
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,290
Thank you for the meal.

686
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,429
Let's go to a coffee shop.

687
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,829
You can choose in person with Na Ra.

688
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,070
- I'm in.
- Okay.

689
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,940
Isn't it raining right now?

690
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,640
It's hard to tell what the weather is like today,

691
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,770
and the same goes for my daughter.

692
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,579
- I just felt a raindrop.
- I love it.

693
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,709
- That street where raindrops fall - That street where raindrops fall

694
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,649
- What's after that?
- Standing there

695
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,550
Why are you taking a video of us?

696
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,779
- It's a nice view.
- Your breath

697
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,549
(Flapping)

698
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,110
- You two get along well.
- How pretty.

699
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,260
(We've met for the first time.)

700
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,730
It's a nice view.

701
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,790
- You two get along well.
- How pretty.

702
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,569
Loneliness. The lonely man.

703
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,100
(The lonely man of Hokkaido)

704
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,539
I can kind of picture Hee Won's expression...

705
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,870
without looking at him.

706
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,810
- What is it like?
- Show us Hee Won's expression.

707
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,379
It's identical.

708
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,010
(Feeling under the weather)

709
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,550
Try and guess it.

710
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,579
- Hee Won, look at her.
- It's the same.

711
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,556
Look at Hye Young. You two have the same expression.

712
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,589
- Why are you smiling?
- I've been smiling the whole time.

713
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,720
Really?

714
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,719
(Ryu Hye Young, the master of expressions)

715
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,789
I'm in love with how beautiful Japan's waterways are.

716
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,960
- Exactly.
- Look.

717
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,200
- Right?
- Yes.

718
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,269
Isn't it incredible luck that water this clear...

719
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,599
runs right through the town?

720
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,670
- Of course.
- Yes.

721
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,339
Photos taken in Japan turn out great because of...

722
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,939
- The weather?
- That's part of it.

723
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,579
But it's really the colors of the streets and the town...

724
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,109
- Colors?
- that make everything look pretty.

725
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,250
- The colors?
- Yes.

726
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,079
- Even this bridge...
- Right.

727
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,080
Is in a pretty color.

728
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,949
- The color is unique.
- True.

729
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,550
And right next to it, there's red and white.

730
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,619
Take photos, and they all come out great.

731
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,859
Isn't it especially the white and red?

732
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,959
- Right?
- Yes.

733
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,999
(After Hye Young brings out the country-lane vibe of Hokkaido, )

734
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,360
The colors are really well chosen.

735
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:14,370
(every corner turns into a perfect photo spot.)

736
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,339
- It's getting warm.
- Yes.

737
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,379
For real. I bet Hee Won will feel hot later on.

738
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,579
(Hokkaido's weather changes constantly.)

739
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,779
But it's cold at night, right?

740
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
- Yes.
- At night, the temperature...

741
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:26,279
- drops to around 13°C to 14°C.
- Yes, it does.

742
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,619
I'm glad I brought a puffer jacket.

743
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,949
- You did?
- Yes.

744
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,990
I see.

745
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,490
What's the size of it?

746
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,259
The size? Are you planning to wear it?

747
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,329
- Don't tell me...
- To think you'd ask...

748
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,989
- the size to take it from her.
- It's unisex,

749
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,800
- so I'm sure you can wear it.
- You, too, are amazing.

750
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,820
Wait. There's a coffee shop here.

751
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,530
- You're right.
- Is it open?

752
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,540
- It's open.
- It is. The lights are on.

753
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,510
Isn't it closed?

754
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,870
Oh, gosh.

755
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,909
It's very unique.

756
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,540
- Do we go over there?
- Right.

757
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,480
- There?
- Over there?

758
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,149
(As they open the door and step inside)

759
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,649
Sit inside, Hye Young.

760
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,620
This place has a vibe.

761
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,220
- Yes.
- They even serve food here.

762
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,820
It feels like a coffee shop from the 1970s.

763
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:11,159
Totally, like a Korean coffee shop from the 1980s.

764
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,280
(A warm, unusual atmosphere)

765
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,169
Are we getting takeout or eating here?

766
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,229
- Let's eat here.
- Okay.

767
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,699
- Shall we?
- Why not?

768
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,339
(The vibe is too unique not to dine in.)

769
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,000
This place is kind of...

770
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,710
- A homey vibe?
- Even the location.

771
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,269
It's interesting.

772
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,980
The whole place is filled with baseball uniforms.

773
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,210
All baseball-related.

774
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,650
(From baseball uniforms hanging overhead...)

775
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,589
(to portraits of baseball players)

776
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,690
- The owner must be a baseball fan.
- We have a baseball fan here.

777
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,189
It's all baseball.

778
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,550
(Even the TV is playing baseball.)

779
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,829
(One poster stands out in particular.)

780
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,859
This...

781
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,800
(A photo of Ohtani, who led LA to victory)

782
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,500
Does his son play baseball?

783
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,340
- Maybe.
- It's a possibility, right?

784
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,209
I mean, there are awards on the wall.

785
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,210
(Could Ohtani be the owner's son?)

786
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,980
It's...

787
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,119
How long have you been running this coffee shop?

788
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,320
(Today as well, Dong Il can't hold back his curiosity.)

789
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,890
It's been 40-something years.

790
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,589
Maybe 43 years?

791
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,590
This place has been open for 43 years.

792
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,330
This coffee shop is 43 years old?

793
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,700
(Impressed)

794
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,629
Does your child play baseball?

795
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,939
(Is your son Ohtani?)

796
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,439
It's not my son.

797
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,669
This is the meeting place...

798
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,440
for the local booster club of the Nippon-Ham Fighters.

799
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,650
So they support the Fighters.

800
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,320
You're good at Japanese.

801
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,720
My listening isn't that bad.

802
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,349
- It really isn't.
- You're good.

803
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,420
She's really good. Hye Young can read most of it.

804
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,890
- You can speak Japanese too.
- But I can't read it.

805
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,030
Dong Il just throws out whatever words.

806
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,899
- This place...
- Yes?

807
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,959
Is where baseball fans...

808
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,530
hold get-togethers.

809
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,939
And the owner is a baseball fan too.

810
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,639
- Yes.
- Ohtani Shohei used to play...

811
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,140
for the Fighters.

812
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,770
Ohtani Shohei, right here?

813
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,109
So Ohtani was also a Fighters player.

814
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,810
(Ohtani was once a Fighters player!)

815
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,949
The deity of baseball was here.

816
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,349
(His love for the ex-Fighters player)

817
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,449
Japan is... Back then...

818
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,449
Even the coffee shop where we met your friend was old.

819
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,520
- It's been there for fifty years.
- Fifty years.

820
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,120
Coffee shops in Japan are, on average, about ten years old.

821
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,190
I guess new coffee shops don't open often.

822
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,260
"Open?"

823
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,770
But, Dong Il, running a coffee shop...

824
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,469
for 43 years isn’t easy at all.

825
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,470
True.

826
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,010
Since the baseball fans always got together here,

827
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,709
it must've helped the coffee shop survive.

828
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,710
The baseball fans...

829
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:40,939
- must drink coffee here, - Yes.

830
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,409
Like how Korean fans drink beer.

831
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,079
I bet they have drinks at night.

832
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,979
Judging by the TV here, the fans must watch the games together.

833
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,819
- Then beers are a must.
- Yes.

834
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,849
Exactly.

835
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,159
- They must drink while watching.
- Do they drink coffee...

836
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,590
- and beer here?
- Most likely.

837
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,930
Both the coffee shop from back then and this one right here...

838
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,929
Look.

839
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,329
- There are juices, teas...
- Parfait?

840
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,700
- It's parfait!
- Parfait!

841
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,470
- The parfait looks good.
- Goodness.

842
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,039
- I'll have juice here.
- Juice.

843
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,640
What's listed for the coffee?

844
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,280
- It says...
- Yes?

845
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,080
"grand coffee."

846
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,409
- You can read it?
- "Straight coffee."

847
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,310
(Straight coffee!)

848
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,080
Iced coffee.

849
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,589
"French Coffee."

850
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,490
- What's French coffee?
- Exactly.

851
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,119
I think it has cream on top.

852
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,189
(Reading the types of coffee)

853
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,130
- I want that one.
- French coffee.

854
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,229
- I want cream soda.
- You do?

855
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,429
- Just regular coffee.
- Regular coffee.

856
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,869
- Hee Won?
- French coffee.

857
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,929
- French coffee.
- French coffee.

858
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,599
- I'm getting cream soda.
- Soda.

859
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,069
- This one.
- Parfait? Okay.

860
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,170
Go order them.

861
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,970
- Ask if they run a tab.
- Okay.

862
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,509
Ask politely if they run a tab.

863
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,810
"Ask politely."

864
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,779
- May I order?
- Yes.

865
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,179
(The perks of having a Japanese speaker)

866
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,280
This...

867
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,450
One grand coffee.

868
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,120
One French coffee.

869
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,120
I'm glad she came.

870
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,390
We need to find a way to keep her with us.

871
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,729
- I couldn't keep Jun Han with us.
- Na Ra is thinking...

872
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,270
- of keeping everyone here.
- I failed to keep Jun Han.

873
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,800
- She's such a catch.
- Is everyone a catch now?

874
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,270
Parfait.

875
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:20,710
(She ordered fluently!)

876
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,920
The sun is up and bright.

877
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,349
- It looks hot outside.
- I'd better put on sunscreen.

878
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,420
For real.

879
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:33,689
Knowing you'd never pack sunscreen,

880
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,090
- I brought one with me.
- You did?

881
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,129
It's an easy-to-apply one.

882
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,289
Help me apply it on my face outside later.

883
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,300
Okay.

884
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,929
You didn't apply sunscreen, did you?

885
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,729
- I didn't.
- Just apply it on your face.

886
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,500
- Like this?
- Yes, go ahead.

887
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,870
- Don't use my daughter's.
- Why not?

888
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,540
Because she's my daughter.

889
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,410
It's okay. I can wipe it with a tissue.

890
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,040
- Wipe what?
- The surface.

891
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,850
Are you supposed to wipe it?

892
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,380
I'm joking.

893
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,150
It's a joke.

894
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,889
- Over here.
- You're very thorough.

895
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,119
- All done?
- Yes.

896
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,350
This much should do.

897
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:06,920
Thank you.

898
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,859
(Are the drinks ready?)

899
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,959
Strangely enough, in Korea,

900
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,259
we get impatient when the order doesn't come.

901
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,099
We get impatient when the order doesn't come.

902
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,870
- But in Japan...
- You feel more relaxed.

903
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,370
I can't be impatient in Japan...

904
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,169
because there is a long wait everywhere.

905
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,299
(In Japan, the order is served at a different speed.)

906
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,210
- Even soba takes 30 minutes.
- Soba?

907
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,540
- It took 30 minutes.
- Soba?

908
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,710
It doesn't have to be quick.

909
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,919
That's not true. You made a huge fuss...

910
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,750
about how slow the Internet was in Japan.

911
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,489
I wanted to pay my residence tax yesterday.

912
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,520
It was annoying.

913
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,390
- I had to pay my car tax.
- I didn't pay six dollars.

914
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,289
We're in the middle of nowhere.

915
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,629
(Traveling here can be frustrating as it's in the countryside.)

916
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,700
It's interesting.

917
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,129
(You've waited for a long time.)

918
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,269
- The parfait is here.
- Thank you.

919
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,870
It looks so cute.

920
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,610
- All right.
- It's really adorable.

921
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,310
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

922
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,809
- It's so cute.
- Let's eat before it melts.

923
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,530
Let's eat it all before Hee Won comes back.

924
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,510
Try it.

925
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:04,751
(Hee Won went to the restroom.)

926
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,949
How did they shape...

927
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,050
- the ice cream like a hedgehog?
- It's cream.

928
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,770
- It's like a flower. Hedgehog.
- Yes, like a flower.

929
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,589
It tastes like cream that I had as a child.

930
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,310
- Really?
- Yes, how it tasted in the past.

931
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,990
- There's ice cream in the middle.
- There's something in the middle.

932
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,229
On top of ice cream...

933
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,310
(On top of ordinary vanilla and chocolate ice cream)

934
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,440
(Made with love by the shop owner)

935
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,010
(Rustic cafe style parfait)

936
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,479
Something like a flower...

937
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,809
It doesn't taste fancy.

938
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,149
- It has an old-fashioned taste.
- Right.

939
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,679
- Right?
- It's the taste from our memory.

940
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,749
Exactly.

941
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,050
(It's not fancy but full of nostalgic charms.)

942
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,120
(Hee Won is back.)

943
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,020
- We started without you. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

944
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,529
Strangely, I looked at the mirror in the restroom longer than usual.

945
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,206
(Strangely, I looked at the mirror in the restroom longer than usual.)

946
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,069
- The mirror...
- Did you talk to your reflection?

947
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,040
I looked at myself longer than usual with the mirror in the restroom.

948
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,539
- "Hee Won, what are you doing?" - I know.

949
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,700
"You've got nothing to lose."

950
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,950
- I never looked in the mirror.
- "You could die tomorrow."

951
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,579
Did you pick up Japanese from watching Japanese dramas?

952
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,650
Dramas and cartoons.

953
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,949
- Cartoons?
- Clearly...

954
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,960
I also read a lot of cartoons.

955
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,690
When I hear it, the intonation is so unique that I end up mimicking it.

956
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,290
(You hear it?)

957
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,000
Hee Won, did you read comic books?

958
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,100
- I read a lot of comic books.
- That's translated into Korean.

959
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,616
- That won't help at all.
- Right, it's in Korean.

960
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,799
It's impossible to improve.

961
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,120
- Gosh, you are...
- Animation...

962
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,650
I'll look at myself in the mirror again in the restroom.

963
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,779
- I can't continue like this.
- I'll bring the mirror for you.

964
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,940
I should look at myself more.

965
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,460
I should look at the mirror more often and change myself.

966
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
Cream soda.

967
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,389
- Gosh, it looks so old-fashioned.
- It looks old-fashioned.

968
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,920
- You two said the same thing.
- Cream soda?

969
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,729
- Here you go.
- It looks so adorable.

970
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,060
- Here's some coffee.
- You see it often in cartoons.

971
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,100
- Is it good?
- Yes, it tastes old-fashioned.

972
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,200
- Really?
- Try it.

973
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,500
- Is it called "sawa?" - Cream soda.

974
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,639
Cream soda?

975
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,840
(Popping inside the mouth as soon as you eat it)

976
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,209
It has a pretty color.

977
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,509
(Vanilla ice cream added to popping melon soda)

978
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,450
- It's better with the cream.
- Vanilla ice cream and melon soda.

979
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,679
- Isn't it refreshing?
- Children would love it.

980
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,040
- Children would love it.
- Right.

981
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,519
The coffee is tasty too.

982
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,790
- Is the coffee good?
- Yes, it's really good.

983
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,659
- Isn't it very smooth?
- Isn't it nice?

984
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,030
The taste brings back memories.

985
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,860
Even the taste of the coffee brings back memories.

986
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,770
- Isn't it nice?
- It's bitter and smooth.

987
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,470
Right.

988
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,710
On an unexpected journey, I ended up at a cafe with 40 years of history.

989
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,310
(Taking a photo of the 43-year-old cafe)

990
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,720
Your eyes were on fire while taking the photo.

991
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,620
It's my passion for the photo.

992
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,390
Is this a cafe or a coffee house?

993
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,020
It's kissaten.

994
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,020
Kisstatae?

995
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,000
Kissaten means an old-fashioned coffee house in Japanese.

996
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,569
These days, many young people like...

997
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,099
the retro vibe.

998
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,439
A place like this?

999
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,099
Many of them go on kissaten tours in Tokyo.

1000
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,370
- Really?
- Yes.

1001
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,379
(Kissaten, a retro Japanese-style coffee house...)

1002
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,639
(where you can enjoy coffee and meals)

1003
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,849
(Unlike ordinary cafes, everything is made slowly but with care.)

1004
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,020
(A place to savor the moment in a classic atmosphere)

1005
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,590
(The purpose of doing this)

1006
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,760
(To mix the caramel sauce thoroughly)

1007
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,500
(At some places, you can see performances by masters.)

1008
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,069
(Quickly becoming a trend among young Japanese people)

1009
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:49,500
(Kissaten, retro cafes where it feels like time has stopped)

1010
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,340
They search and visit retro coffee houses like this one.

1011
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,109
They should run into it like us instead of searching for it.

1012
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,339
- That's right.
- That's life.

1013
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,050
- This is what makes it fun.
- Of course.

1014
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:01,280
You're working so hard to side with me no matter what.

1015
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,319
That's why I adore you.

1016
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,450
I'm not working hard. I'm naturally on your side.

1017
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,030
Hee Won, do you have a daughter like her?

1018
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,960
The line has been drawn clearly.

1019
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,760
- What do you mean?
- Us versus you two.

1020
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,929
(You two versus us)

1021
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:16,930
- Is that it?
- Really?

1022
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,069
Let's play something, us versus you two.

1023
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,499
- Bring it on.
- All right.

1024
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,876
- Let's play after eating this.
- Okay.

1025
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,470
- What do you want to do?
- I have something on my mind.

1026
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,540
What could it be?

1027
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,049
This is something I want to learn.

1028
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,750
- Did you see her taking photos?
- What?

1029
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,456
- She took a photo like this.
- This?

1030
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,549
- This?
- Yes.

1031
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,990
- A surveillance camera shot.
- Yes.

1032
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,619
You know what was surprising? She looked amazing when she did it.

1033
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,930
Instead of taking a photo carefully,

1034
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,999
she took it casually while talking.

1035
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,200
(Taking a photo indifferently)

1036
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,199
(This is how MZers take photos.)

1037
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,239
This is how she took it.

1038
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,269
- Like this?
- Yes.

1039
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,470
She didn't even look back.

1040
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,770
- She's on the other team.
- Okay.

1041
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,409
- Am I her enemy?
- He is so ridiculous.

1042
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,480
Why did you pick sides?

1043
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,379
Look, doesn't it look stylish?

1044
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,350
(Look, doesn't it look stylish?)

1045
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,279
- Didn't you take the photo?
- Well done.

1046
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,819
(A big compliment from Hee Won?)

1047
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,620
- Dong Il.
- Isn't that what you were saying?

1048
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,419
- Right.
- She cut you out of the frame.

1049
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,130
(She cut you out of the frame.)

1050
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,759
- Let me see it.
- Over here.

1051
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,830
You can't see Dong Il.

1052
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,329
Only three of us are in the photo.

1053
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,470
(Backstabbing her teammate)

1054
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,670
- You can't see Dong Il.
- Only three of us are in the photo.

1055
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,669
The sides...

1056
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:34,310
- Are you still on the same team?
- I tried it without thinking.

1057
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,980
(Dong Il is upset.)

1058
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,710
- Don't be conscious of the camera.
- Right.

1059
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,720
Pretend that you don't see it.

1060
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,550
- Yes, that's it.
- Right.

1061
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,119
But we're looking at the camera. Look at me.

1062
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,190
It came out so well.

1063
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,989
- It looks good.
- It came out well.

1064
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,990
(This is how MZers take photos.)

1065
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,060
- It's the trendy vibe.
- Is this trendy?

1066
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,430
- It looks like a manipulated photo.
- I still can't understand.

1067
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,070
This is also how I take them.

1068
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,269
(Bursting out laughing)

1069
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,390
- Do you mean movies?
- Hey.

1070
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:09,080
- I poked myself with the fork.
- I see.

1071
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,949
This is good. The atmosphere of their team is...

1072
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,309
- We're on the same team.
- Right.

1073
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,230
- It's falling apart.
- Yes, it's falling apart.

1074
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,149
It will be fun. We're competing for the first time.

1075
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,220
Let's go.

1076
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,690
- Thank you.
- I'm getting competitive.

1077
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,030
Where are we going next?

1078
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,129
Oh, this place...

1079
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,970
(He checks something on his mobile phone.)

1080
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,670
For the four-person fishing,

1081
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,570
they told us to come to the following address by 1pm.

1082
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:39,210
Fishing?

1083
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,840
- Fishing competition sounds fun.
- Oh, my.

1084
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,750
It's by 1pm.

1085
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,879
- By 1pm? What time is it now?
- The time is...

1086
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,750
- It's 12:25pm.
- We have enough time.

1087
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,550
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

1088
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:52,820
Let's go.

1089
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,419
I'm worried.

1090
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,580
(The nemesis of his soul he meets again after 3 years)

1091
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,300
I got it.

1092
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,570
(Snatching as soon as he throws it)

1093
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,370
(Unstoppable Hee Tai Gong)

1094
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,140
(The beginning may be humble, but the end will be great.)

1095
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,840
(A slow starter, Dong Tai Gong)

1096
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,380
(Rivals of the soul for 3 years)

1097
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,280
(To put an end to their competition)

1098
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,650
(Where will the fishing battle take place in Hokkaido?)

1099
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,690
(The wilderness of Hokkaido, Akan River)

1100
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,800
(In a place with primeval traces)

1101
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,900
(The members will compete in the raging rapids.)

1102
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,310
(Between you two and us, who will be the final winner?)

1103
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,780
We have 42km to go.

1104
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,710
- Forty-two kilometers?
- Yes.

1105
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,349
We're far from everywhere.

1106
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,556
(Akan River is 1 hour away from Lake Kussharo.)

1107
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,680
- It won't take long.
- Right.

1108
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:59,220
The sun is really strong.

1109
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,219
Did you put some on the back of your hands?

1110
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,159
- Could you give me some?
- Back of the hands burn easily.

1111
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,429
A female guest is making Na Ra more energetic than usual.

1112
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,030
- Right.
- They can talk to each other.

1113
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,099
- It's great.
- She must've been frustrated...

1114
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,199
- while traveling with us two.
- That's not true.

1115
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,370
- She must've been so bored.
- That's right.

1116
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,669
Her easiest target was snacks from the convenience store.

1117
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:21,709
(Her easiest target was snacks from the convenience store.)

1118
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,480
- She chewed on those snacks.
- That's why you like snacks.

1119
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,980
Is it easy or difficult to get along with us?

1120
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,919
- It's very easy.
- Really?

1121
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,920
Of course.

1122
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,180
No matter what you ask her, she'll always be positive.

1123
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,720
Ever since the mirror...

1124
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,760
Since the mirror incident, her mind will always be positive.

1125
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,600
- I wish you could stay another day.
- Shall I?

1126
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,829
- Seriously?
- Yes, it's fine by me.

1127
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:44,870
- Really?
- Yes.

1128
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:48,240
My flight is the day after tomorrow.

1129
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,109
I can go directly to the airport.

1130
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:53,309
- Really? That's my daughter.
- Just in case, I reserved...

1131
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,909
a flight ticket one day after the shoot.

1132
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:58,110
- Gosh, you're the best.
- Just in case.

1133
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,479
- It's so funny.
- It finally feels like...

1134
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,420
we're traveling. Don't you think, Hee Won?

1135
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,719
- Twists and turns. Right, Na Ra?
- Yes.

1136
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,960
Seriously.

1137
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:11,530
- Then stay one more day. Good.
- Okay.

1138
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,329
Unexpected twists are the charm of traveling. They make it fun.

1139
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,330
(This is what real traveling is about.)

1140
00:46:16,331 --> 00:46:18,770
What's important in traveling is...

1141
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,339
with whom you travel, not where you travel.

1142
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:24,570
- Yes, that's the most important.
- That's crucial.

1143
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,979
(They go deeper into nature with positive Hye Young.)

1144
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:31,609
Nature here is very well preserved.

1145
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:32,679
- I agree.
- That's why there are...

1146
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,249
many wild animals.

1147
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,280
Right.

1148
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,820
We might bump into an animal.

1149
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:40,489
It's getting dark already.

1150
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:42,050
(The forest path is growing more lush.)

1151
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,860
I want to see a bear. I haven't seen a bear yet.

1152
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,799
You're lucky enough to see a bear.

1153
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,960
- Right?
- Yes.

1154
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:53,369
We practiced our acting in case we don't encounter any wild animals.

1155
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:54,399
Really?

1156
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Gosh, look at that.

1157
00:46:55,401 --> 00:46:57,209
Isn't that a bear? Hey.

1158
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,910
It's a bear. Stop the car. Did you take a photo or not?

1159
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,339
- I'll take a photo.
- Goodness.

1160
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,650
- That's amazing. Be careful.
- It's a bear. Stop the car.

1161
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:08,120
It's just a motorcycle.

1162
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,720
It isn't a bear.

1163
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:12,849
You're a good liar.

1164
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,250
(A group that wastes their talents)

1165
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:17,259
What if we don't say a word when we actually see a bear?

1166
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,829
- No one can say a word.
- All of us will freeze.

1167
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,499
We might be stunned.

1168
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,330
I have a feeling that we'll see something.

1169
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:25,830
Right?

1170
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:30,069
- I see a deer.
- You startled me.

1171
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,109
- On the right.
- There it is.

1172
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:32,409
- I see a deer.
- Where?

1173
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:33,439
- There it is.
- On the right.

1174
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,409
There's a deer on the right.

1175
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:36,950
Gosh, there's one. Drive slowly.

1176
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,950
(They spot a deer.)

1177
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,979
- One deer. Two deer.
- There it is.

1178
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,389
(Lake Kussharo's wild deer appear in front of the members.)

1179
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,419
I couldn't find any yesterday no matter how I tried.

1180
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,759
- I see them with my daughter.
- There are more deer.

1181
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,060
They look beautiful.

1182
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,259
They look exactly like Bambi.

1183
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,170
- Right.
- They have white spots.

1184
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,100
(They have spots like Bambi.)

1185
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:06,170
- Thanks to my daughter...
- Good morning.

1186
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,780
Good morning. Hello.

1187
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:14,820
(Communicating with local deer in Japanese)

1188
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,820
See you again.

1189
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,720
There are more here.

1190
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:27,960
(Hello)

1191
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,129
Are there more deer over there?

1192
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,670
Yes, they're watching our car.

1193
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:32,330
That's fascinating.

1194
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,339
As I'm with my daughter, I get to see things like this.

1195
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,509
- They're really here.
- I summon the deer.

1196
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,839
They live in the wild. They aren't behind a barbed wire fence.

1197
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,909
- Right.
- I know.

1198
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:44,210
In a way, we're passing by where they live.

1199
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:45,990
- That's the right way to put it.
- Right?

1200
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,779
(Guys, we're passing through for a minute.)

1201
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,289
They look so peaceful.

1202
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:52,650
- I know.
- Even when they saw us,

1203
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:55,050
- they seemed nonchalant.
- Nonchalant.

1204
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,430
So we saw deer.

1205
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:58,860
We haven't seen a bear yet.

1206
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,560
If there's a bear, shouldn't it be on the news?

1207
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,800
Bears are found here often so they wouldn't make the news.

1208
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,040
- This is their habitat.
- Yes.

1209
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,870
They say that a lot of bears live here.

1210
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:15,579
How did you spot them so quickly?

1211
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,679
I know.

1212
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,879
(What will fishing in the wilderness be like?)

1213
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,910
I'm lucky.

1214
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:20,879
We're here.

1215
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,149
- Please get out.
- Thank you for driving.

1216
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,890
We're here.

1217
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,650
Come this way.

1218
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:31,259
(They enter the place indicated in the text message.)

1219
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,330
What's this?

1220
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,100
(A strong presence already at the entrance)

1221
00:49:37,101 --> 00:49:38,770
(Clicking)

1222
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:41,269
It's a habitat for bears.

1223
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,000
(The smell of wilderness)

1224
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,369
Gosh, there is...

1225
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:46,509
(A sculpture of a wild bear)

1226
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:47,510
(Welcome, civilized people.)

1227
00:49:47,511 --> 00:49:49,479
It must be a place for activities.

1228
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,380
(Once they pass the bear sculpture and a primitive couple)

1229
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:55,879
Fishing.

1230
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,880
(A fish sign appears.)

1231
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:00,720
(They're greeted by a fish that looks intense.)

1232
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,060
We made a reservation for fishing.

1233
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:05,260
Come this way.

1234
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,690
Hello.

1235
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,629
(An instructor dressed like an explorer)

1236
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,970
- Hello.
- Hello.

1237
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:14,900
(There are two of them.)

1238
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:19,010
(From a warm-looking instructor covered in exploration gear...)

1239
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,440
(to one who gives off a vibe of a jungle master)

1240
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:26,010
(It doesn't seem like an ordinary fishing center.)

1241
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,680
- It's a bear.
- It's really a bear.

1242
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,889
Where?

1243
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,119
(Comparing her height with the bear)

1244
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,250
It's huge.

1245
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,690
(Meanwhile, what catches Hye Young's attention)

1246
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,059
(An enormous fish)

1247
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,259
That's what we're going to fish. Trout.

1248
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,629
- Really?
- Yes.

1249
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,299
It'd be amazing to catch that.

1250
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,606
(If they get lucky, they'll meet the rainbow trout.)

1251
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:49,040
Once you get changed, we will set out.

1252
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,709
(What kind of fishing requires us to get changed?)

1253
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:52,790
They will let us borrow it.

1254
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:56,839
- Medium?
- Yes.

1255
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,760
(Waders are prepared for everyone in the group.)

1256
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,960
It looks like someone is inside.

1257
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,320
(Singing)

1258
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:08,060
(What kind of fishing is it that requires waders?)

1259
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:11,090
I get to fish with my daughter.

1260
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,660
Who decided to go fishing?

1261
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,500
I thought that you'd want to go fishing.

1262
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:20,440
As expected, you have good instincts.

1263
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:24,040
(Hee Won completes his explorer look with the hat.)

1264
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,469
(Everyone got changed. Today...)

1265
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:28,980
Today, you will go fly fishing.

1266
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,650
(Fly fishing?)

1267
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:41,620
(The movie called "A River Runs Through It")

1268
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,230
(Fly fishing became many fishermen's fantasy.)

1269
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:48,930
(A fishing technique that uses insect-shaped lures to attract fish)

1270
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,000
(It's usually done in flowing streams or rivers.)

1271
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,870
(Some flying fish experts don't hesitate to wade into the water.)

1272
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,040
(By trying fly fishing, )

1273
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:04,249
(it could be a chance to feel like a movie hero like Brad Pitt.)

1274
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,350
It's so cool.

1275
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,150
The fish you will catch today is rainbow trout.

1276
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:12,249
(This is a rainbow trout that we saw earlier.)

1277
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:14,290
- Rainbow?
- It's delicious.

1278
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,760
The trout is very red, and it's tasty.

1279
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,960
- Right.
- With some bean powder.

1280
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:25,129
For the past 25 years, you're required to release...

1281
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:27,240
all the fish you catch at the river.

1282
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,170
You have to release the fish you catch.

1283
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:32,370
And another thing to remember.

1284
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:37,410
Since this is a national park,

1285
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:41,080
you must not take anything with you, not even a branch or a leaf.

1286
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,249
(I see.)

1287
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:46,590
We will be heading to Akan River.

1288
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,659
(Pristine...)

1289
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:55,030
(Pristine Hokkaido)

1290
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:01,140
(Existing on the east of Hokkaido for over a thousand years)

1291
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,970
(A dense, primeval forest and a canyon)

1292
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,840
(A haven for countless wild animals)

1293
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,710
(Where they're considered the rightful owners)

1294
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:20,420
(Where primeval nature breathes and lives)

1295
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:26,430
(We're heading to the true wilderness of Hokkaido.)

1296
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:29,830
(In that case...)

1297
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:35,040
- Are there bears?
- Yes, there are bears.

1298
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,940
(There are really bears?)

1299
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:42,449
(At Akan Mashu National Park)

1300
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:46,420
(It's more of a habitat for animals than people.)

1301
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,390
Speaking of the bears that have been in the news lately,

1302
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:54,229
there hasn't been a single bear-related incident...

1303
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,330
in this area for over 100 years.

1304
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:00,840
We'll guide you along routes where you won't encounter bears.

1305
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,680
You can be rest assured when following us.

1306
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:08,110
(We visited safely accompanied by experts.)

1307
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,979
The weather is beautiful.

1308
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,250
(They take a car to the fishing spot.)

1309
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,580
It's already so much fun.

1310
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:19,220
(Ringing)

1311
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,289
(They keep hearing...)

1312
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:24,660
(bell ringing from somewhere.)

1313
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,529
(Ringing)

1314
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,859
(It's coming from here.)

1315
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:28,959
(Ringing)

1316
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,300
Bears don't like the sound of bells.

1317
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,900
- Bears?
- Really?

1318
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:34,999
Bear bell.

1319
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,010
- Oh, it's here.
- It's a bell.

1320
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,879
(An essential safety gear for areas where bears may appear)

1321
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,939
Don't we have to hang one here?

1322
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,180
Shouldn't we hang it here?

1323
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,390
I'm wearing the bear bell, so don't worry.

1324
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,149
Isn't there one for us?

1325
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,150
(I want to wear a bear bell too.)

1326
00:54:50,151 --> 00:54:51,220
It's okay.

1327
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,989
- I have this too.
- We'll be okay without it.

1328
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:55,020
We'll be okay.

1329
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,159
Look. It's a bear-deterrent spray.

1330
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,660
- Oh, it's a spray.
- Yes.

1331
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Splash.

1332
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,970
I want it too.

1333
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,676
(Spraying on his daughter's materialistic desire)

1334
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,570
(Now's not the time to covet this.)

1335
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,709
Lawson.

1336
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:10,710
Yes.

1337
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,639
(Suddenly...)

1338
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,239
(heading to a convenience store?)

1339
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,380
Why are we going there?

1340
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,109
Are we buying food?

1341
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,220
(Confused)

1342
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:23,590
(Is he going to treat us?)

1343
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:26,289
- Hye Young likes this place.
- I love it.

1344
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,660
(Still confused, they enter the shop.)

1345
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:30,589
Fishing tickets.

1346
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:34,660
(Give me the fishing tickets.)

1347
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:36,930
- Ticket?
- Ticket.

1348
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,500
One day, 15 dollars.

1349
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,139
One, two, three, four.

1350
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,439
- Use 10 dollar notes.
- That's 60 dollars.

1351
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,969
- Sixty dollars.
- Sixty dollars, okay.

1352
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:47,216
(Fishing tickets, which you can easily buy in convenience stores)

1353
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,279
(You must buy it to fish...)

1354
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,509
(at national parks and controlled waters!)

1355
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,110
You write the date and stuff there.

1356
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,479
I think this is the right way to protect nature.

1357
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,619
To protect nature...

1358
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,690
- and manage it.
- And manage it.

1359
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,689
(After buying the tickets, they set off.)

1360
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,370
Go to where you can catch fish as soon as you cast the fishing rod.

1361
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,230
I hope at least one of us will catch fish.

1362
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:10,930
You know me.

1363
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,699
(I'm Hee Tai Gong.)

1364
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:13,939
Anyway,

1365
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,839
- I'll team up with my daughter.
- Okay.

1366
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,269
You and Na Ra will team up. It's 2 on 2 today.

1367
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,510
- It's a match.
- Yes.

1368
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,780
- Na Ra, just trust me.
- Okay.

1369
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:23,649
I believe in you, my daughter.

1370
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,079
- Okay. Just trust me.
- What?

1371
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,080
I'm serious.

1372
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:27,949
Then it's Ryu Hye Young versus Kim Hee Won.

1373
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:29,489
(Ryu Hye Young versus Kim Hee Won)

1374
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,920
I'll catch one as soon as I cast my fishing rod.

1375
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,789
Let's take them down a peg.

1376
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:35,790
Yes.

1377
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,659
(They drive while declaring war at each other.)

1378
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,230
There's water.

1379
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,630
I think we're here.

1380
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:46,199
(We'll get down here.)

1381
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,800
- There's water.
- Do we get down?

1382
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,100
We're getting down here.

1383
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:53,380
We'll practice at a place with less wind.

1384
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,639
(A crash course on fly fishing...)

1385
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,680
(for beginners)

1386
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:58,809
- This is the rod.
- Rod.

1387
00:56:58,810 --> 00:56:59,979
- Reel.
- Reel.

1388
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,320
- Line.
- Line.

1389
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:04,290
(Now, let's cast it.)

1390
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,850
Stop when it's at the back.

1391
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,620
(Casting)

1392
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:09,190
Stop when it's at the back.

1393
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,289
Look at that.

1394
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:12,290
(Smooth)

1395
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,629
- Okay.
- My gosh.

1396
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:14,729
(That's cool.)

1397
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:15,859
It's like rhythmic gymnastics ribbon.

1398
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:16,970
Rhythmic gymnastics ribbon.

1399
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:19,800
Comparing to a clock,

1400
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,240
Stop behind your back at one o'clock.

1401
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,210
- Cast at ten o'clock.
- Okay.

1402
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,340
Okay.

1403
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,210
- Move away from him. He...
- Okay.

1404
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,050
- He...
- Okay.

1405
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:33,630
- I might get caught by the hook.
- "Move away from him."

1406
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,020
Using one hand?

1407
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,090
(Hee Tai Gong is unbothered.)

1408
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,490
(Dropping right in front of him)

1409
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,560
Okay.

1410
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,559
(The master cast until here.)

1411
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,459
(Hee Tai Gong cast until here...)

1412
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,770
It's game over.

1413
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:51,629
The bell is ringing. Just leave now.

1414
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:52,640
(Laughing)

1415
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,369
(Dejected)

1416
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,940
Relax.

1417
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:57,540
No power.

1418
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:00,279
(2nd attempt without using strength)

1419
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,379
(I got it.)

1420
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,480
It flies further when you don't use your strength.

1421
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:05,970
When you don't use your strength?

1422
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,680
Just like this.

1423
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,120
(Casting casually)

1424
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:11,620
- Okay.
- Then it goes far.

1425
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,496
(Hee Tai Gong already got the hang of it.)

1426
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,520
Okay.

1427
00:58:14,521 --> 00:58:16,760
(Why is he good at it?)

1428
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:18,489
- Okay.
- Hello.

1429
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:19,729
- Give me that.
- Okay.

1430
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,499
Just throw it casually without using force.

1431
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,400
(I can do it too!)

1432
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,600
(Like this!)

1433
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:38,140
He's a lost cause. The person who can actually do it should try.

1434
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,880
(Dad!)

1435
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,650
(Why is he opening his mouth like that?)

1436
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:45,850
No.

1437
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:48,120
You... Stop here.

1438
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,260
- I see.
- Okay?

1439
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:51,659
(Before correcting his posture)

1440
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,230
(His fishing rod went too far back.)

1441
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:58,100
(After correcting his posture)

1442
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,239
(Rating his teaching five stars)

1443
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,240
You're okay.

1444
00:59:01,241 --> 00:59:02,369
See? Heard that?

1445
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:03,639
One more time. Me?

1446
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,970
- Okay? One more time.
- Okay.

1447
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,839
No. Okay.

1448
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,780
(You're not that good.)

1449
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,580
One, two.

1450
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,049
- Good, that's it.
- That's it.

1451
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,319
- One, two.
- Until here.

1452
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,620
- She's good.
- Good.

1453
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,550
She throws the farthest.

1454
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,890
That's it. Good job.

1455
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:20,159
- She's good.
- She is...

1456
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,920
Good, that's it.

1457
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:23,989
(Lastly, Hye Young tries too.)

1458
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:25,660
One, two.

1459
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,060
One, two.

1460
00:59:27,061 --> 00:59:28,729
(Like father, like daughter. Their postures are the same.)

1461
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,000
- You need to...
- One.

1462
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:32,470
- Okay.
- You're the best.

1463
00:59:32,471 --> 00:59:33,739
- One, two.
- Throw.

1464
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,740
- Okay.
- Okay.

1465
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:38,370
- Master, let's go.
- Let's go.

1466
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,480
- Okay.
- I'm feeling competitive now.

1467
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,380
The weather is so nice.

1468
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:47,850
There's a scene of fly fishing in "A River Runs Through It."

1469
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,249
It's cool.

1470
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,519
(It feels like they've become explorers.)

1471
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,550
It's nice.

1472
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:53,390
This way, please.

1473
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,359
(Into the bush, not following the path?)

1474
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,560
We need to go this way.

1475
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:58,530
Watch your steps.

1476
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:00,259
Walk slowly.

1477
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:02,000
(They enter the wilderness.)

1478
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,500
(The grass comes up to their knees.)

1479
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,000
Wearing this outfit makes me feel invincible.

1480
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,639
I can go anywhere.

1481
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,939
(Invincible squirrel Hye Young takes big strides.)

1482
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:13,940
(Groaning)

1483
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:16,450
(And Hee Won groans as he walks.)

1484
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,980
Isn't this the place?

1485
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:20,750
Nakamura, stay here with these two.

1486
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,620
I'll go over there with the other two.

1487
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:26,689
- Two people will stay here.
- We'll split into two.

1488
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:27,789
- Yes.
- Okay.

1489
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,459
- Good. Anyway, let's go.
- Let's do this.

1490
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,530
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1491
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:35,429
(They wish each other luck coolly and go separate ways.)

1492
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:36,970
- Watch your steps.
- Okay.

1493
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:41,770
(Team You Two walks downstream.)

1494
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,140
(Burping)

1495
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,200
I've only walked this much, and I'm burping.

1496
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,539
It's nice to see you digesting well.

1497
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:49,610
Is that so?

1498
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:51,950
I'm less worried.

1499
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:54,649
My daughter is worried about her dad.

1500
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:57,350
(He walks while being touched by her filial piety.)

1501
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,320
Here.

1502
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:04,089
- Fish is here.
- It's big.

1503
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:05,890
(Fish is here.)

1504
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,429
It's huge.

1505
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,130
(It's an arm-sized rainbow trout!)

1506
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,400
(This amazing fish here...)

1507
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:14,670
(is the fish they saw the model of just now!)

1508
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,670
(You can often catch rainbow trouts as big as this here.)

1509
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:22,040
(Try to aim for me.)

1510
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:23,549
It's huge.

1511
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:24,879
(They spot the fish even before they start fishing.)

1512
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,120
- It'll be fun to fish.
- It'll be fun.

1513
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:28,950
It's making me get competitive.

1514
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:31,319
- Here?
- Okay.

1515
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,089
- One person over here.
- Okay.

1516
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:34,090
Okay.

1517
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,729
I'll take them down a peg.

1518
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:38,130
(Declaring his goal multiple times)

1519
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,059
(He casts his rod for the first time with great ambition.)

1520
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,260
- Okay.
- Okay.

1521
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,069
Pull it back and...

1522
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:47,069
(Hye Young's bait)

1523
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,069
(Surprised)

1524
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:50,170
Nice posture.

1525
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,779
(I am...)

1526
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,210
(Brad Pitt of Hokkaido.)

1527
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:04,990
(They become one with nature while fly fishing.)

1528
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:14,560
(His first catch is the tree.)

1529
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:20,200
(He casts his rod again.)

1530
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:27,079
(All he catches is a juniper.)

1531
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,140
My gosh.

1532
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:30,810
This is why I don't like fishing.

1533
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:33,919
(Hye Young tries ambitiously.)

1534
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:34,920
(Rustling)

1535
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,020
It's caught right away.

1536
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,959
- I failed immediately.
- Oh, gosh.

1537
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,960
(Even fishing skills are hereditary.)

1538
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:43,790
You can actually catch fish here?

1539
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:47,060
(She starts doubting when there's fish right in front.)

1540
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:49,670
How's the other team doing?

1541
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,639
(Meanwhile, Team Us)

1542
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,069
(Amazed)

1543
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,940
(Isn't it cool?)

1544
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,379
Let's go inside the river now.

1545
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:01,840
(What?)

1546
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,409
- The current is pretty strong.
- We need to enter it?

1547
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:05,750
(The current seems pretty rough.)

1548
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:09,479
(You need to go catch the fish.)

1549
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,250
I don't think there's any fish here.

1550
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:15,960
This spot always has a lot of water, so there's a lot of fish here too.

1551
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,560
Okay.

1552
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:23,770
(Hee Tai Gong gets to work.)

1553
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,140
That's good.

1554
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:32,610
(Why is he so good at it?)

1555
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:38,879
(Will Hee Tai Gong in Hokkaido be lucky with fishing today too?)

1556
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,880
Good.

1557
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,190
(Then I'll try too.)

1558
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:47,220
I'll catch one no matter what.

1559
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,030
(A soft shout)

1560
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,530
(A rather simple shout unlike her determination)

1561
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,560
(Throwing)

1562
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:57,730
Come in.

1563
01:03:58,930 --> 01:03:59,940
(A soft shout)

1564
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:05,510
That's it.

1565
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:08,640
(Hitting him in the process)

1566
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:13,749
(The student catches the master instead of the trout.)

1567
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,880
I'm sorry.

1568
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:18,649
(She even threw away her bait.)

1569
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:19,760
Where did it go?

1570
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:24,790
Which do you like?

1571
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,629
(Fly fishing bait container made by the master himself!)

1572
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:31,870
What about this?

1573
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,940
This looks pretty.

1574
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:38,170
(It will wiggle underwater.)

1575
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,440
(Hooking the new bait chosen by Na Ra)

1576
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:49,850
(While they spend the time amicably...)

1577
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:52,690
Why is this... Goodness.

1578
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,420
It stings.

1579
01:04:55,421 --> 01:04:57,330
(Hee Tai Gong is struggling on his own.)

1580
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:00,229
Ever since it's caught it won't fly far.

1581
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:03,930
(Grumbling)

1582
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:10,510
(He casts his rod again gloomily.)

1583
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:12,440
Where did it go?

1584
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:17,180
I think it's stuck somewhere.

1585
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,720
- My gosh.
- What is it?

1586
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,189
(He lifts the fishing line that feels somewhat heavy.)

1587
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:27,120
It's a crayfish. Amazing.

1588
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:29,719
- My gosh.
- It's a crayfish.

1589
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,790
It's a crayfish.

1590
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:33,130
- Amazing.
- That's cool.

1591
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,960
(Surprised)

1592
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,230
(Staggering in excitement)

1593
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,499
This crayfish isn't normally caught...

1594
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,870
in valleys.

1595
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:46,680
(He's lucky to have caught the crayfish!)

1596
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:48,709
It's amazing.

1597
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:50,910
(Hee Tai Gong's luck in fishing continues in Hokkaido.)

1598
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:54,750
(Following the rule, he returns the crayfish into the water.)

1599
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,920
My goodness.

1600
01:05:55,921 --> 01:05:57,890
(Hee Won's Illustrated Book)

1601
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,259
(Hee Tai Gong's victory is announced to Team You Two.)

1602
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,260
It's a crayfish.

1603
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,300
- My gosh.
- He caught something?

1604
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:09,800
Crayfish.

1605
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:11,500
Did you catch it?

1606
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:15,440
I caught a juniper.

1607
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,510
He doesn't have any trees behind him.

1608
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,080
Master.

1609
01:06:22,081 --> 01:06:26,150
(His achievement is void yet again today.)

1610
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:28,080
(At that time)

1611
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,720
Hold on.

1612
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:32,920
There's a huge one over there.

1613
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,260
That's huge. How do I catch that?

1614
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,359
(She hurriedly casts her rod.)

1615
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,430
It's under the tree.

1616
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,970
(It happens to be at a place where it's hard to catch.)

1617
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:46,870
Dad, here.

1618
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,870
Is there one?

1619
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:53,010
Should I go down there? Wait for me.

1620
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,610
Master, I can.

1621
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:57,580
Here.

1622
01:06:58,310 --> 01:06:59,919
(Making a fuss)

1623
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,980
- It's huge.
- Okay.

1624
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,520
It's a rainbow trout.

1625
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,749
You've never caught one.

1626
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:09,120
(He was mocked numerous times in the past.)

1627
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,689
(I must catch this rainbow trout.)

1628
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:12,089
I'll take him down a peg or two.

1629
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:13,450
(I must catch this rainbow trout.)

1630
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,870
It's wagging its tail.

1631
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:19,470
Here.

1632
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,200
(Frozen)

1633
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:27,539
(I caught a tree again.)

1634
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:29,080
- Just a minute.
- Darn it.

1635
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,210
(Frustrated)

1636
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,580
It swam past the tree.

1637
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,190
Fish is smart.

1638
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:43,330
(It was a futile attempt.)

1639
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:46,599
There's a lot of fish here, but there's also a lot of trees.

1640
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,800
- Exactly. The line gets stuck.
- I can't cast the rod.

1641
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:52,499
We'll go to the other place.

1642
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,140
(Team You Two will move to another spot.)

1643
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:58,740
Nature is so pretty.

1644
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:01,580
That's the charm of fly fishing.

1645
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:03,980
Look at this.

1646
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:07,090
There's something like this too.

1647
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,019
It's a scratch mark of a bear.

1648
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,350
A bear?

1649
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:12,049
A bear scratched the tree.

1650
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:13,620
(Carved into the tree like a scar...)

1651
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,960
(is the sharp claw mark of a bear.)

1652
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:19,589
(Growling)

1653
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:20,660
It's scary.

1654
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,870
- It's scary.
- It's scary, isn't it?

1655
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,370
But this is scarier.

1656
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,600
What is it? Which one?

1657
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:31,010
(Purple wildflower)

1658
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:32,840
- It's pretty.
- You die if you eat it.

1659
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:35,839
(You die if you eat it.)

1660
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,080
- You die if you eat it?
- Yes.

1661
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:40,320
- You die if you eat it.
- It's called wolfsbane.

1662
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,719
- Wolfsbane?
- Wolfsbane.

1663
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,789
Wolfsbane.

1664
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:45,390
(Unlike how it looks, it's very deadly.)

1665
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:47,519
- So the Ainu people...
- This flower.

1666
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,060
Used this root...

1667
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:52,260
to apply on the arrow tip.

1668
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:53,829
And they shot bears.

1669
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:55,430
(The Ainu people used it to hunt bears.)

1670
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:01,140
We should grind the roots and apply it on the fishing hook.

1671
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,140
- We'll use it like a whip.
- Kill the fish with this?

1672
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,740
If there's anyone in Korea...

1673
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:09,340
that you cannot forgive,

1674
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,080
call me, and I'll send you this.

1675
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,249
(Laughing ominously)

1676
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:16,480
(The master smiles scarily as he talks about the poisonous plant.)

1677
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,049
Shall I pluck some and give them to Hee Won?

1678
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,820
(The students plan their revenge.)

1679
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,790
- "Try this. It's edible." - I should do that.

1680
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:25,560
(Team Us is moving to another spot too.)

1681
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:27,429
- Na Ra, is it doable?
- Yes.

1682
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:28,500
(Na Ra is here.)

1683
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:30,530
(Walking through the fern forest as tall as Na Ra)

1684
01:09:30,531 --> 01:09:33,900
Hold on. Okay.

1685
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,340
Isn't it pretty?

1686
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,109
It's very pretty.

1687
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:41,386
(The valley in the dense forest is different from the spot before.)

1688
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:43,509
Once you cross this valley,

1689
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:46,780
there's a fishing spot.

1690
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,050
Can we cross from here to there?

1691
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:50,850
Oh, my gosh.

1692
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,089
(Following the expedition master)

1693
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:54,090
My goodness.

1694
01:09:54,091 --> 01:09:55,860
(Following the expedition master)

1695
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:58,289
- Be careful, Na Ra.
- I will.

1696
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:00,060
(The two walk upstream in the old valley.)

1697
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:06,400
(The view they see after crossing the valley)

1698
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:08,200
My gosh.

1699
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:10,910
Why did they come in front of us? This doesn't feel good.

1700
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:13,540
(They meet their enemies across the valley.)

1701
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,509
Did you catch anything?

1702
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:17,410
(Who's this?)

1703
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:20,679
- Did you catch anything?
- I caught a small one,

1704
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,380
but he told me to let it go.

1705
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,250
You caught a fish?

1706
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:27,220
A juniper.

1707
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:30,929
I understand.

1708
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:32,489
You caught a juniper.

1709
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:33,560
(As I thought.)

1710
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,720
Did you catch anything, Hye Young?

1711
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,530
I'm going to catch one now.

1712
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:44,210
(What surprised Hye Young?)

1713
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:48,080
Did you see that fish?

1714
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:51,580
I think we can catch it. I got the feeling.

1715
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,920
(I feel like this will be my future!)

1716
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:57,290
That's a good spot.

1717
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:59,349
I think I can catch it.

1718
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:00,460
(This is a great spot.)

1719
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,020
Look, it's a rainbow trout.

1720
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:04,830
This...

1721
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,500
Over there.

1722
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:11,100
(She spots another fish.)

1723
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:14,570
(Trembling)

1724
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:17,009
(The fishing line is taut.)

1725
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:19,210
Did I catch it?

1726
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,920
(Really?)

1727
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,480
She must've caught it.

1728
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:27,190
Lucky her.

1729
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,059
How do I pull it? It's heavy.

1730
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:34,090
(Struggling)

1731
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:36,930
This...

1732
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:38,660
(Is this a rainbow trout?)

1733
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:40,870
It's stuck on a stone.

1734
01:11:40,871 --> 01:11:42,870
(It's stuck on a stone.)

1735
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,670
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1736
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,270
I'm sorry.

1737
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:49,010
I'm so sorry.

1738
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:50,980
I'm so sorry.

1739
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:52,350
(After that)

1740
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:54,980
There's fish here.

1741
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,580
There's one under there.

1742
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:01,549
(Exploring)

1743
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:02,690
That's nice.

1744
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:05,460
Please notice it.

1745
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:07,659
(Na Ra starts begging the fish.)

1746
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:08,730
My friends.

1747
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:15,500
It's reaching the other side.

1748
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:22,069
(His casting skills have become flashier.)

1749
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,080
It's cool.

1750
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,710
This is how you fly fish.

1751
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:27,179
Dong Il, look.

1752
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:28,180
(Hee Tai Gong waves it in the infinity symbol-shape.)

1753
01:12:28,181 --> 01:12:31,750
- It really happened.
- This is how you fly it.

1754
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:33,189
(Laughing)

1755
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:34,190
This is how you fly it.

1756
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:36,720
That's almost like martial arts.

1757
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:45,600
(In the end, they do flying martial arts.)

1758
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,900
(But they had fun.)

1759
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,509
Let's move on. There's no fish. Let's go.

1760
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:54,839
Hold on. The best...

1761
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,000
(The valley fishing in the wild was fun in many ways!)

1762
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,010
My goodness.

1763
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,149
I didn't even get to see it.

1764
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:02,790
That was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

1765
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,780
I'm glad you think that.

1766
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,920
- It was so fun.
- I agree.

1767
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,019
It's not about whether you catch the fish or not.

1768
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,920
- That's right.
- That's not important.

1769
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:14,330
Na Ra has...

1770
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:16,959
finally become one with nature.

1771
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,429
Are you starting to enjoy it?

1772
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:22,330
(She finally gets the taste of nature on her 8th day.)

1773
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,470
Let's hit the road.

1774
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:24,970
It was so fun.

1775
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:28,310
- I healed myself in nature.
- Yes.

1776
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:32,680
What kind of chocolate pie is this?

1777
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:35,386
(Na Ra, who is hungry, spots Hye Young's present.)

1778
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:37,119
- This is milk tea flavor.
- That's amazing.

1779
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,719
- They sell for a limited time.
- Let's try it.

1780
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,320
- I was getting hungry.
- Chocolate pie.

1781
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,700
I focused so much on fishing that it made me hungry.

1782
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,760
- It's time to eat something sweet.
- That's right.

1783
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:48,159
Here, Hee Won.

1784
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,200
(He properly delivers it to Hee Won's mouth today.)

1785
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:52,530
(Impressed)

1786
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:54,800
(Impressed)

1787
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,639
- It's very delicious.
- I can totally taste milk tea.

1788
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,446
(The sweetness brings the two girls together.)

1789
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:01,039
- It's chewy and dense.
- Yes.

1790
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,369
(Dong Il loves it too.)

1791
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:04,179
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

1792
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:06,580
(Thanks to Hye Young's gift, they get their sugar fix!)

1793
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,380
Goodness.

1794
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,779
Look at the deer!

1795
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:14,390
- Where?
- It's a deer.

1796
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:17,019
- Two. Didn't we see them earlier?
- Hello.

1797
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,589
(The two deer are eating peacefully.)

1798
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:20,090
So adorable.

1799
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,360
(Hello)

1800
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,799
- There's another one. Left side.
- She...

1801
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,499
- Where?
- On the left side. Look carefully.

1802
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,599
- There?
- In the front there.

1803
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,840
- Here it is.
- There it is.

1804
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:34,339
(Attention)

1805
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:35,810
(Focused)

1806
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:40,979
- There it is.
- There.

1807
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,180
- Can you slow down a bit? Gosh.
- Hello.

1808
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:46,119
It disappeared so quickly.

1809
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,490
- Are you a taxi driver now?
- It's only 40km per hour.

1810
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:52,390
- Gosh.
- It was so cute.

1811
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:53,989
We saw it.

1812
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,290
I saw it too.

1813
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:56,699
It's bigger than I thought,

1814
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,029
- and it's got a stiff fur.
- It's huge.

1815
01:14:58,030 --> 01:14:59,030
- Right?
- Yes.

1816
01:14:59,031 --> 01:15:02,029
- The fur on the fishing hook.
- It's their fur.

1817
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,600
It was stiff when I touched it.

1818
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:07,109
- They eat so well.
- It must be their dinner time.

1819
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:08,569
- Right.
- They are eating...

1820
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,540
- passionately.
- We ate the chocolate pie too.

1821
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:13,450
(Is it your first time to see deer eating?)

1822
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,580
There's another deer.

1823
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,979
(This time, the deer is eating right on the side of the road.)

1824
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:20,689
- Are there lots of them?
- This one is...

1825
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:22,496
- I didn't get to see it.
- There are lots of them.

1826
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,389
There are lots of them, so you should slow down.

1827
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:26,590
- Okay.
- When you see one.

1828
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:30,359
But when you look, they are here and there.

1829
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,459
- Right. You see them.
- Right.

1830
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:33,576
(It looks like a deer crossing area.)

1831
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,199
There's one here.

1832
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,439
There's one on the right.

1833
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,839
- They are everywhere.
- Hello.

1834
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:38,870
There's one here too.

1835
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:40,910
Hello.

1836
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:43,809
- It's now looking at you.
- They are everywhere.

1837
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:44,810
(M... Me?)

1838
01:15:44,811 --> 01:15:46,549
- Look.
- How many are they?

1839
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:48,849
- There are six of them.
- There are a lot of them.

1840
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:51,820
(This time, it's a big family.)

1841
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:55,220
(My gosh, they are adorable!)

1842
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,789
- It's a family.
- So cute.

1843
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:58,360
They are eating dinner.

1844
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:00,429
Bambi.

1845
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:02,390
(I've never seen these humans before.)

1846
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:04,529
- So cute.
- So cute.

1847
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:06,100
(How dare you?)

1848
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:08,400
Could they be eating out too?

1849
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:09,670
I know.

1850
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,139
Nom, nom.

1851
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,780
- This is fun.
- I saw them face to face.

1852
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:15,039
- It's dinner time.
- Nom, nom.

1853
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,286
(Being completely won over by their cuteness)

1854
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:18,580
- So cute.
- There are so many of them.

1855
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:19,910
- You're right.
- Yes.

1856
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:22,979
(Like Hee Won said, )

1857
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:25,050
(this place is...)

1858
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,250
(Here)

1859
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,920
(There)

1860
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,590
There's another one.

1861
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:35,390
When you look, there's a deer.

1862
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:38,229
- You're right.
- Yes.

1863
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:39,929
- There's another one.
- There's one. They're everywhere.

1864
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:41,029
There. On the left side.

1865
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:42,799
- They are here and there.
- Look at its pattern.

1866
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,140
(Deer posing like a model)

1867
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,469
- There are two, three there.
- Look there.

1868
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:47,939
- Look. They are here.
- There are three there.

1869
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:49,209
- I am the deer spotter.
- They are looking at us.

1870
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:50,210
- How cute.
- Another one.

1871
01:16:50,211 --> 01:16:51,540
(The deer family is eating out.)

1872
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,150
It's like a safari.

1873
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,249
- Deer safari.
- Yes.

1874
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:57,020
(It's like Safari World.)

1875
01:16:57,950 --> 01:16:59,349
They must be tired too.

1876
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:01,950
"Here comes another one. People are passing."

1877
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,820
Maybe they know all the car types?

1878
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,790
Maybe they know all the car brands.

1879
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:08,089
They've seen so many cars.

1880
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,930
(Adults having fun with deer)

1881
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:13,629
Look! The right side, the left side.

1882
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:16,239
They are everywhere here too.

1883
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,440
They are everywhere.

1884
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,339
It's like a buffet here.

1885
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,109
- This place is...
- It's dinner time.

1886
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:22,839
It's like a zoo.

1887
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,240
(Welcome to the Deer Hot Spot)

1888
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,709
(There's too many...)

1889
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:28,910
- There are so many of them.
- It is dinner time.

1890
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,280
(deer.)

1891
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,860
Now, even if there are deer, let's just quickly get past them.

1892
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:34,950
(He just yelled at Hee Won to slow down.)

1893
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:36,060
I know.

1894
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:39,120
- We've seen enough.
- Yes.

1895
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:43,030
Why is that car using its hazard lights?

1896
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,330
Is something passing?

1897
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,639
There's nothing.

1898
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,770
Fox!

1899
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,310
- Fox!
- Fox?

1900
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:56,640
(Hi.)

1901
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:57,839
The fox was standing...

1902
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,509
- on the road.
- It's so beautiful.

1903
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:02,350
They were looking at the fox.

1904
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:04,479
It had really pretty eyes.

1905
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,549
(It's most charming eyes make you want to stop the car.)

1906
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:08,649
Around this time is when they all pour out.

1907
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:09,660
Yes.

1908
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,489
- Right?
- They must've all come down.

1909
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:13,589
- Most of them are down.
- Yes.

1910
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:15,560
Fox and deer.

1911
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,930
We're almost home.

1912
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:22,530
Is she going to be there?

1913
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,639
I don't think she would be there yet.

1914
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,480
(Is there another guest other than Hye Young?)

1915
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:29,169
- What time is it now?
- It's 5:20pm.

1916
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:30,510
(Current time 05:19pm)

1917
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,210
- I don't think she's there yet.
- It's 5:19pm?

1918
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:36,720
I heard she might be arriving a little late.

1919
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:40,989
(Who's the mysterious guest coming from afar?)

1920
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:42,819
(They put her behind and...)

1921
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:45,089
- It's here.
- It's here.

1922
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:46,560
It's here.

1923
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:50,159
- Is that it?
- Yes. That's it.

1924
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,799
- It's so cute.
- Is it cute?

1925
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:52,800
It is.

1926
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:56,839
(In the green camp site...)

1927
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,099
- It looks like a cafe, doesn't it?
- It looks like a cafe.

1928
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,380
(They arrive at the house that looks like a little cafe.)

1929
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,400
Girl, what do you think of Dad's house?

1930
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:06,040
It's pretty.

1931
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:08,049
My daughter came home after a long time.

1932
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:10,779
(For the daughter returning home, he set up the house.)

1933
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:12,520
- Thank you.
- We arrived.

1934
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:17,659
Get off.

1935
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:19,260
(Escorted by Dad, she gets off the car.)

1936
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,690
(My goodness.)

1937
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:24,330
It's so pretty.

1938
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:25,750
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- It is.

1939
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:28,499
(Singing)

1940
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,800
- Where is the entrance?
- First...

1941
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:35,210
No way, this is the entrance!

1942
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,439
You should've written something here.

1943
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,780
We didn't get to it yet.

1944
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,149
We've been busy doing other things.

1945
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:42,456
(She's the first person who spotted the name plaque.)

1946
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,979
(Thank you, Hye Young.)

1947
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:47,650
(Hye Young's Rediscovery of House on Wheels)

1948
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:50,820
Excuse me. Goodness, the floor.

1949
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:54,660
The floor is so pretty too.

1950
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,300
(The floor is overjoyed.)

1951
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:03,269
We've got some living items.

1952
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:05,199
Look how pretty the handles are.

1953
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,569
We've got plates too.

1954
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:07,570
(Thank you.)

1955
01:20:07,571 --> 01:20:09,510
- No way.
- We've got the sauces here.

1956
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:12,909
And if you will look here...

1957
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:14,249
(She's a little excited.)

1958
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,319
- Because the space is tight, - Yes.

1959
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,120
- they built storage underneath.
- Yes.

1960
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:22,020
- When you open like this...
- Goodness.

1961
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:25,620
You can put stuff inside.

1962
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:27,759
That's a cooler.

1963
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,460
- Isn't it nice?
- It's nice.

1964
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:31,300
It's really nice.

1965
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:34,570
- It's better than having a bed...
- It's really comfortable.

1966
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,700
They did a really great job.

1967
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,800
- It's nice, isn't it?
- It's nice.

1968
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:42,879
- It's prettier than my house.
- It's nice.

1969
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:43,939
I know.

1970
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:47,909
Seeing the scenery outside through these windows is...

1971
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:50,320
- They are like photo frames.
- They are like frames.

1972
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,550
They are nice and big too.

1973
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,450
- You can see the scenery.
- They did a great job.

1974
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,559
- It's great.
- They did a terrific job.

1975
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,560
(With Hye Young spotting everything, the house looks even prettier.)

1976
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:59,321
You can see the sky through the ceiling too.

1977
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:01,430
Oh, my gosh.

1978
01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:08,469
- It's nice, isn't it?
- It's well-made.

1979
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:10,469
- There's an air conditioner too.
- Yes.

1980
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:11,600
(Looking around)

1981
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,040
(She looks around for a while.)

1982
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,610
How much is this?

1983
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,049
What?

1984
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:23,050
(What?)

1985
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,450
How much is this?

1986
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,419
How much is this camping van? We are not selling it.

1987
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,120
(We are not selling it.)

1988
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,529
- It's not for sale.
- We're not selling.

1989
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:36,030
(Determined)

1990
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:38,460
It's really pretty.

1991
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:42,199
(He won't sell it even to his daughter.)

1992
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,770
There's a window at the back too.

1993
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:47,510
It's nice.

1994
01:21:47,511 --> 01:21:49,110
(She says it loudly.)

1995
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:50,810
- It's amazing.
- So warm.

1996
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:53,209
(Her father's house is so nice that she wants to buy it.)

1997
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:54,909
- Stare at the fire.
- It's warm.

1998
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:55,979
(Burning love)

1999
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,020
It's so warm.

2000
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,219
Na Ra, come and stand in front of the fire.

2001
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:01,180
- Na Ra, come here.
- Stand in front of the fire.

2002
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,390
- Come, Ms. Jang.
- She's cute.

2003
01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:05,520
Madam Jang.

2004
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:07,489
- Ms. Jang.
- Look at her running.

2005
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:08,789
- It's cold.
- She's going inside.

2006
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,990
(The house owner enters the house receiving attention.)

2007
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,029
Who would think she's 40 years old?

2008
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:14,069
I know.

2009
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:17,170
She looks like a high school girl who's come on a school fieldtrip.

2010
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,070
I'll be there soon.

2011
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,109
(Flapping)

2012
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:23,579
(The cheerful girl returns.)

2013
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:24,580
(Groaning)

2014
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:29,450
(Staring at the fire quietly...)

2015
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:31,619
- To eat the first meal.
- I guess so.

2016
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,380
- But...
- We should've bought marshmallows.

2017
01:22:34,090 --> 01:22:35,090
That one.

2018
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:36,619
- What is it called?
- S'more.

2019
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:38,920
- S'more. Right.
- What? Sumo?

2020
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:41,529
It's good when you barbecue the marshmallow.

2021
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:43,499
What does marshmallow have to do with sumo?

2022
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,359
It's like sandwiching chocolate...

2023
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,429
and barbecued marshmallow between biscuits.

2024
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:48,800
You press them and eat it.

2025
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,300
(Na Ra explains the dessert, and Hye Young eats it.)

2026
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:57,340
(Watching them...)

2027
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,710
They are like high school classmates.

2028
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,650
(They are dressed similarly too.)

2029
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:05,650
(Uncle Sumo is out.)

2030
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,549
(Thinking)

2031
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:10,219
I should've bought the marshmallows.

2032
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:11,490
Isn't there a store here?

2033
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:13,460
- A store?
- They must sell the marshmallows.

2034
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:15,889
- Should we go to the store?
- Is there a store though?

2035
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:19,499
That looks like the base. Shall we go and find out?

2036
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,729
Does anyone have money though?

2037
01:23:20,730 --> 01:23:22,599
- Wait.
- Dong Il has money.

2038
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:23,600
Wait.

2039
01:23:23,601 --> 01:23:24,699
(What are they up to now?)

2040
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,380
(They really talk like high school girls.)

2041
01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:29,139
- Na Ra.
- Yes?

2042
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:30,180
What are you going to buy?

2043
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:35,209
We are going to see if the store here sells the marshmallows.

2044
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:36,719
You should drive and go.

2045
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,600
- Should I do that?
- To the convenience store.

2046
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:40,089
- Should I do that?
- I love that.

2047
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:41,819
- You want to go, don't you?
- I do.

2048
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:43,559
- I could do that.
- Go to the convenience store.

2049
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,560
Take the car.

2050
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:46,290
I love it.

2051
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:47,659
(Feeling happy, they dance.)

2052
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:48,690
She's so cute.

2053
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:51,860
Na Ra is so cute.

2054
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:55,529
I'm glad she's here. Na Ra is cheerful again.

2055
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:58,210
(While the two high school girls are excited to go to the store...)

2056
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:02,240
I guess they can't pick up because there's no signal.

2057
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:06,880
Hello? Yes, it's me.

2058
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:08,780
I'm almost there.

2059
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:11,150
There's no signal,

2060
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,389
so I can't reach you.

2061
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:14,850
So I am talking to myself.

2062
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:18,019
I can't reach them.

2063
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:19,760
(She can't reach them.)

2064
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,989
You got fooled. You thought I had them.

2065
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:24,910
(Someone with a great sense of humor is coming.)

2066
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,629
We are going to the store.

2067
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:28,900
Drive safely.

2068
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,670
We're going to the convenience store.

2069
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:34,409
We will buy the marshmallows...

2070
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:36,410
- and soda.
- And soda.

2071
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,149
- I can drive on the right side.
- Right.

2072
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:42,610
- It's strange to come to a store.
- Is it really?

2073
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:44,480
Thank you.

2074
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:49,150
Let's buy some marshmallows.

2075
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:52,119
(Jumping)

2076
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,506
- My mouth is suddenly watering.
- There are tons of things.

2077
01:24:54,530 --> 01:24:56,159
My mouth is suddenly watering.

2078
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,560
There is lots of bread too.

2079
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,560
Oh, my gosh.

2080
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:16,880
(Ding-dong)

2081
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:18,150
Let's...

2082
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,919
(There's the sound of someone coming in.)

2083
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:20,920
(They are clueless.)

2084
01:25:20,921 --> 01:25:22,020
Mint soda.

2085
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:24,759
That wouldn't be as bad as mint chocolate.

2086
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:25,920
Mint soda.

2087
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:28,789
I think mint soda would be okay.

2088
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,759
Should I try this?

2089
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:31,929
Try it.

2090
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:33,430
- Soda.
- Soda.

2091
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:35,530
- Soda and...
- This is...

2092
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:37,600
- Soda and...
- Hey!

2093
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:41,040
(Surprised, she falters.)

2094
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,410
Hello! It's nice to meet you.

2095
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:48,009
It's nice to meet you.

2096
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:49,856
(Another secret guest is Ra Mi Ran, Madam Cheetah)

2097
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:52,019
- Hello.
- It's just a two minute car ride.

2098
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:54,149
(It's their first time to meet, but they are not awkward.)

2099
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:55,919
- How about that?
- Okay.

2100
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,660
(What's the special dinner they will have with Mi Ran?)

2101
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:07,230
(This guest stands out the moment she enters.)

2102
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:08,969
(The family-like friend, )

2103
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:10,300
(Ra Mi Ran comes to Hokkaido!)

2104
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,799
(They start by bowing to each other.)

2105
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,070
(Okay.)

2106
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:15,810
(Can Hee Won do anything?)

2107
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,009
He's making sushi?

2108
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:19,040
Goodness.

2109
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,349
(My gosh.)

2110
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:22,750
(She nags the house owners as soon as she arrives.)

2111
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:25,619
(She tries to take over Dong Il's position as the griddle king.)

2112
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:26,620
(Immersed)

2113
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,649
(She has high energy lasting all day.)

2114
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:31,489
(Laughing their hearts out, acting hard)

2115
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:33,490
(They won't stop laughing at the House on Wheels.)

2116
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:36,959
(Even the guests with the highest energy will be amazed by...)

2117
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,300
(Lake Kussharo, Japan's biggest caldera lake.)

2118
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:41,490
(No way. That was only the beginning for Mi Ran.)

2119
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:44,769
(Moving to Team Leader Ra's chant, )

2120
01:26:44,770 --> 01:26:47,640
(they train like national athletes.)

2121
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:50,809
(Going wild)

2122
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:51,810
(Crazy)

2123
01:26:51,811 --> 01:26:53,479
(Mi Ran's boat runs with the wildest energy.)

2124
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,350
(Struggling)

2125
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,949
(With the crazy energy, they arrive somewhere.)

2126
01:26:57,950 --> 01:26:59,649
(It's steaming.)

2127
01:26:59,650 --> 01:27:00,690
Look there.

2128
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:03,519
(It's Oyacotsu Jigoku.)

2129
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,219
(It's inferno?)

2130
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:08,660
- Look there.
- Look at the steam.

2131
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,160
It's like lava.

2132
01:27:10,530 --> 01:27:15,000
(The family get stranded in inferno.)

2133
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:16,529
It's burning in inferno.

2134
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:20,240
(What will happen to them?)

2135
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:26,010
(Sung Dong Il)

2136
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:28,480
(Kim Hee Won, Jang Na Ra)

2137
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:36,090
(House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean)
