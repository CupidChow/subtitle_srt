1
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,440
(Sung Dong Il)

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,980
(Kim Hee Won, Jang Na Ra)

3
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,820
(House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean)

4
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,820
Hye Young is really gone.

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,260
She's gone.

6
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,789
(With precious memories of Hye Young, )

7
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,300
(the handful daughter, behind them)

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,970
- Where are we going now?
- The next campsite.

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,339
(House on Wheels is going...)

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,240
(farther in Hokkaido.)

11
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,879
Let's go.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,139
(Amidst the lush greenery, )

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,809
(as they drive along the serene landscape)

14
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,880
It's so beautiful.

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,950
- We're here.
- We're here.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,089
We're here.

17
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,720
(They arrived at today's front yard.)

18
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,359
This place is completely open.

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,590
- Look at the trees.
- Oh, my.

20
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,129
It's completely open.

21
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,929
(A place where open nature greets you)

22
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,560
This place is quite close to the sea.

23
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,100
Yes.

24
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,069
There are mountains far over there.

25
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,900
(They came deep inside the nature of Hokkaido.)

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,309
(The east end of Hokkaido)

27
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,640
(Shiretoko Peninsula)

28
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,710
(Hokkaido)

29
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,280
(The easternmost part of Hokkaido)

30
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,119
(Russia, Sakhalin, Sea of Okhotsk)

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,750
(Japan's northeasternmost region that's adjacent to Russia)

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,260
(Primeval nature untouched by civilization)

33
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,029
(During winter, arctic ice drifts down in the Sea of Okhotsk.)

34
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,040
(During winter, arctic ice drifts down in the Sea of Okhotsk.)

35
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,610
(A wild land encompassing an entire ecosystem)

36
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:03,980
(Where rare creatures wander freely)

37
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,720
(And)

38
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,200
(The breath of wilderness passing right before our eyes)

39
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,070
(Located at the root of Shiretoko Peninsula)

40
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,840
(It'll take place in the front yard that's closest to nature.)

41
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,580
(Miraculous events that are possible only in Shiretoko)

42
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,980
Please wait.

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,850
Korean fried rice.

44
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,420
I'll give you one bowl.

45
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,899
(In the wild land of Shiretoko, )

46
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,060
(what will be the stories at House on Wheels?)

47
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,269
Thank you for driving.

48
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,869
Thank you for driving.

49
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,600
(We entered the lawn with permission from the campsite.)

50
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,810
The lawn is so soft and fluffy.

51
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,180
(Enjoying the nature of Hokkaido with her whole body)

52
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,550
- Are you drunk?
- No, it's comfy.

53
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,289
You...

54
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,020
(Drunk with the nature of the eastern end)

55
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,719
- What time is she coming again?
- Try it.

56
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,390
(What time is she coming again?)

57
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,729
- Tonight...
- She's on her way, right?

58
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,800
(A new guest will arrive later!)

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,630
Do you know her?

60
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,899
The guests we had so far were like that,

61
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,869
- but she's very bright.
- Yes.

62
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,040
(The new guest who even Mi Ran knows is currently...)

63
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,409
She's taking the same route I took yesterday.

64
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,279
(Taking about 7 hours on the route Mi Ran took)

65
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,779
(From yesterday's front yard to today's front yard)

66
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,549
What if she arrived in the evening?

67
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,550
She'll spend most of the morning on the road.

68
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,820
Strictly speaking, this is kidnapping.

69
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,060
I've been kidnapped, everyone.

70
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,400
It sounds like fun. What do I do once I get there?

71
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,929
It keeps popping up in my head every now and then.

72
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,999
(The reason she's so hyper)

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,239
To think I'd be able to meet Jang Na Ra.

74
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,270
(Frozen)

75
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,010
Later on... But really...

76
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,509
What if I behave like that in front of Na Ra?

77
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,279
In my day, she was our role model.

78
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,880
In my view, spending time together is unbelievable.

79
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,349
Please wait for me.

80
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,820
(Who is the new guest who is in love with Na Ra?)

81
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,549
- She's very bright.
- Yes.

82
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,550
(Curious)

83
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,560
Either way, we have to treat her well.

84
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,190
- Are you craving anything?
- Shouldn't we have jeon?

85
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,430
Actually, Mi Ran, we'll go...

86
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,499
and find whatever delicious dish we can buy...

87
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,970
in the supermarket. You two should...

88
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,800
discuss...

89
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,409
and prepare the ingredients for kimchi jeon...

90
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,410
along with some seafood. Don't do anything else.

91
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,509
Let's do that, okay?

92
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,540
(Kimchi jeon accepted!)

93
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,809
- Let's go, Hee Won.
- Okay.

94
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,449
- Have a safe trip.
- You've got it, right?

95
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,519
(We leave it to you!)

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,550
Let's go.

97
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,720
Mi Ran is quick with her hands, so it won't take long.

98
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,290
(He trusts her 100 percent.)

99
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,960
There's not a lot to do, is there?

100
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,730
(Smelling)

101
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,060
Rinsed aged kimchi should be better.

102
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,470
Let's just chop it up a bit.

103
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,300
There's really nothing to prepare.

104
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,840
(Preparing for kimchi jeon is easy peasy.)

105
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,680
(They lie down.)

106
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,650
Looking at the scenery while lying down is the best.

107
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,750
Sitting around, zoning out,

108
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,920
and reading books.

109
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,159
I must've needed this time.

110
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,560
(Thanks to Mi Ran, Na Ra can relax.)

111
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,329
I like how breezy it is, Mi Ran.

112
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,530
(It's nice, but...)

113
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,030
Not making the batter in advance should be okay, right?

114
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,499
Of course. It's not good to make batter in advance.

115
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,540
(Trust me!)

116
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,239
(Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.)

117
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,279
We'll be arriving late since we have to make a stop.

118
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,479
Let's see if we can buy anything ahead of time.

119
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,249
(They are heading downtown to buy a welcome gift for the guest.)

120
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,380
(Front yard)

121
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,290
Something we can buy for her.

122
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,860
What could there be?

123
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,760
There's literally nothing here.

124
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,300
(Like a wild animal's territory)

125
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,259
(Sniffling)

126
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,699
We're downtown, but... Right?

127
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,899
(Downtown literally has nothing.)

128
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,000
This is downtown.

129
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,609
- Wait, that's a bakery.
- It's a bakery.

130
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,769
It's the best of something.

131
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,610
(Stuttering from the surprise)

132
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
It's not bad.

133
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:31,550
(Suddenly happy)

134
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,750
- Hi.
- Good morning.

135
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,419
Let's see.

136
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,720
(Taken aback by the foreigners)

137
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,260
Popular cake.

138
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,230
The best and popular cake.

139
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,129
Famous cake.

140
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,640
(Exaggerating the pronunciation)

141
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,040
- How do I say it?
- I only know Japanese.

142
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,739
(Dong Il's language can't get through.)

143
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,010
(Sulking)

144
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,709
One that's pretty.

145
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,110
- The pretty ones are this and that.
- The one next to it.

146
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
- Next to it?
- Yes.

147
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,519
(I must present this one.)

148
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,990
(Bear bread!)

149
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,089
(The bear paw is also popular!)

150
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,090
The bear paw.

151
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,090
(The bear paw is also popular!)

152
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,090
This is a shocker. Come here.

153
00:07:13,091 --> 00:07:14,359
(Dong Il spots something?)

154
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,030
Bears just roam around...

155
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
downtown.

156
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,299
Downtown.

157
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,469
(The town is slowly revealing its true colors.)

158
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,530
Bears just roam around.

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,670
(Bears are wandering around the street.)

160
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,840
That means bears may come to our area.

161
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,240
(No way.)

162
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,639
(They're back out on the empty street.)

163
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,780
What's that place?

164
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,249
- Which one?
- What?

165
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,550
- Keep walking.
- Judging by the bear on there...

166
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,719
(They spot another bear!)

167
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Oh, dear.

168
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,290
It's that. The town's...

169
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,200
Shall we have a look?

170
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,130
It's like an angel is flapping its wings.

171
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,370
Something alive is moving around. What is it?

172
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,740
Isn't it a fish?

173
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,110
(Inside the water tank the two are staring into...)

174
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,779
Look at it.

175
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,380
(is a small and transparent being!)

176
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,089
It's standing up like an angel.

177
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,620
- Look - What is it?

178
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,489
- Look at it.
- It looks like this.

179
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,559
Exactly. It's up here.

180
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
(The name is Clionidae.)

181
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:25,659
Look. It must only live in glaciers.

182
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,270
- Inside the glaciers of Hokkaido.
- I see.

183
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,239
The water must be cold.

184
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,739
- You're right.
- It's 3°C.

185
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,969
- What?
- Isn't it 3°C?

186
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,870
- Yes, 3°C.
- Right?

187
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,940
(This living being that only lives in cold water is...)

188
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,149
Interesting.

189
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,619
(Living under the drift ice in the Sea of Okhotsk...)

190
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,050
(in the cold Shiretoko Peninsula)

191
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,019
Look. It's like a human being or an angel.

192
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,360
(The ocean's angel, Clionidae)

193
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,560
(Flapping)

194
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,400
(Leaving behind Dong Il who wants to become an angel)

195
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,870
This is so cute. Look at the postcard.

196
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,840
- The bears...
- There are also bears.

197
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,909
It's packed with pretty things.

198
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,969
(Another place full of bears)

199
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,739
Even the plates are pretty.

200
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,950
(Filled with products featuring the bear mascot)

201
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,420
My gosh, even the lunch boxes are cute.

202
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,520
We've come to an area with many bears.

203
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,959
I finally feel relaxed...

204
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,459
- now that we have gifts for them.
- Same.

205
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,990
I was feeling bad, you know?

206
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,399
(By the way...)

207
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,160
What are the two doing?

208
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,830
(Are Mi Ran and Na Ra prepping well?)

209
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,000
What are the two doing?

210
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,069
They kept throwing it.

211
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,839
(Inside the house where they are peacefully lying down)

212
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,740
But the back of their heads looked serious.

213
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,510
(Suddenly, they have a bad feeling.)

214
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,650
(Getting up)

215
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,520
(Getting up)

216
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,449
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

217
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,420
(What time is it right now?)

218
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,289
(It's time for us to return.)

219
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,290
Okay, let's go.

220
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,930
(Shocked)

221
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,560
(We're in trouble.)

222
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,540
(Making it hard to believe they were lying down a second ago, )

223
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
(the two show great reflexes and speed.)

224
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,950
- Give me some water.
- Where's the bowl?

225
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,820
(Moving quickly)

226
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,860
(Singing)

227
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,030
(The car is getting closer to the front yard.)

228
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,430
(After setting up the ingredients and tools in just 1 minute, )

229
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,070
(she starts chopping the aged kimchi without hesitation.)

230
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,710
(Next to Mi Ran, who is showing off her cleaver skills, )

231
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,510
(Assistant Jang sets up the ingredients.)

232
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,309
- Should I make the batter?
- No, don't.

233
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,550
It'll turn bad if you leave the batter out for too long.

234
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,779
That should be enough. Leave it aside.

235
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,350
It looks like a dumpling filling.

236
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,549
- Do we have cling film?
- Yes, over there.

237
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,260
(The kimchi jeon meal kit is ready.)

238
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,090
(Glancing)

239
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,359
Here, salt.

240
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,800
(Just in time, the gray group comes into sight!)

241
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,099
(Suddenly busy)

242
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,129
(Suddenly cleaning up)

243
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,470
It's flat.

244
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,939
- Mi Ran.
- Welcome back.

245
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,469
- Hi.
- Hey.

246
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,069
- What did you get?
- Mi Ran.

247
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,070
- Yes?
- Are you busy?

248
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,440
- What?
- Are you busy?

249
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,680
- No, I'm not.
- Spare me a minute.

250
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,009
- Come out for a second.
- Come.

251
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,480
Wait, I see several bags.

252
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,979
What is it?

253
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,520
We went downtown...

254
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,359
and bought a gift for you.

255
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,359
It was Hee Won's and my idea.

256
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,760
(Flustered by the unexpected event)

257
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,460
Here. What is this?

258
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,530
(Open it.)

259
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
(What can it be?)

260
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,210
Seriously.

261
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,239
(Cute camping tools personalized for Mi Ran)

262
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,109
The moment we saw it, we thought it'd be great for camping.

263
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,110
It reminded us of you.

264
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,110
(Feeling proud)

265
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:05,150
How pretty.

266
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,920
Nice. That's what it's meant for.

267
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,990
- When I eat.
- Yes.

268
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,689
- Thanks for coming here.
- Yes, thank you.

269
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,259
Is it time to send me off? Is that why you're bringing it up?

270
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,730
The time has come.

271
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,960
Oh, right. For tonight's dinner,

272
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,330
to let Mi Ran rest, we'll go to a local restaurant.

273
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,900
Omakase.

274
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,969
- Omakase.
- Omakase by an elderly woman.

275
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,310
- An elderly woman.
- Omakase by an elderly woman?

276
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,540
(Omakase is...)

277
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,350
(Leaving the menu and ingredients to the chef, )

278
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,350
(it's a high-end Japanese course meal.)

279
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,049
(But the chef...)

280
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,220
(is an elderly woman?)

281
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,820
Cool.

282
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,359
There's nothing out there.

283
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,159
Are we meeting her at the restaurant?

284
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,329
- We have to go to the restaurant.
- Is she coming here?

285
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,999
No, not here. We have to go to the restaurant.

286
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,029
- Let's get going.
- Okay.

287
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,470
(Off to the restaurant to greet the new guest)

288
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,740
Look at the sky on the left!

289
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,770
Look at the cloud, Mi Ran.

290
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,810
It reminds me of a croissant.

291
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,679
A croissant positioned upright.

292
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,519
- A croissant?
- On the left,

293
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,879
- you see it falling down.
- It's like a green onion root.

294
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,220
It looks like a croissant to me.

295
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,019
Are you craving a croissant right now?

296
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,859
No, it's the texture that reminded me of an upright croissant.

297
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,829
So an upright one.

298
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,830
(All she thinks about is bread.)

299
00:13:22,831 --> 00:13:24,260
(Smiling)

300
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,959
To think we'd have different views.

301
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,100
(As they drive away while looking at the croissant-shaped cloud)

302
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,800
This is downtown.

303
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,869
There are factories here.

304
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,309
Yes, we're in downtown.

305
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,870
(The downtown has nothing much.)

306
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,839
I don't think there will be anything here.

307
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,240
- We're here.
- We're here.

308
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,010
(An omakase place in this town?)

309
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:44,919
Yes, that must be the place.

310
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,950
- Over here.
- Here?

311
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,980
It doesn't look like a restaurant.

312
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,049
You wouldn't know if there weren't a sign.

313
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,320
(This is the meeting place.)

314
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,430
(An omakase course here?)

315
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,089
We must've arrived first.

316
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,100
(The members enter the restaurant.)

317
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,270
Quiet. There's a customer.

318
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,910
(Realizing)

319
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,240
(A bar seat right next to the entrance)

320
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,280
(Is the food he's enjoying alone omakase?)

321
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:22,150
(With their curiosity growing, they head inside.)

322
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:26,320
- Hi, welcome.
- Hi.

323
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,460
All are floor-sitting seats.

324
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,260
Doesn't this room remind you of one from a Japanese comic?

325
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,660
That's the rainbow.

326
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,069
(Floor-sitting seats that give off a homelike vibe, )

327
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,740
(like those from a Japanese comic)

328
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,470
(For some reason, there's a bunch of family photos!)

329
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,110
(Along with this town's mascot, a bear, )

330
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,310
(and posters that show their age)

331
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,349
(Looking around in mesmerization)

332
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,379
This trip is really... Right, Na Ra?

333
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,049
I've seen a place like this in Japanese comics.

334
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,090
Welcome.

335
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,550
- Thank you.
- Good evening.

336
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,990
(Welcoming them from earlier on)

337
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,530
(Who is she?)

338
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,200
- Thank you.
- Good evening.

339
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,870
I run this restaurant's omakase.

340
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,070
(Oh, so it's her!)

341
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,870
(The elderly woman who owns this restaurant)

342
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,039
I select the menu for this restaurant,

343
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,280
and all of the dishes are made with local ingredients.

344
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,549
Do you have draft beer?

345
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,249
Me too. One, two...

346
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,250
(Ordering drinks first)

347
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:33,190
(Okay.)

348
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,820
(Walking away)

349
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,029
She just left.

350
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,689
Aren't you drinking anything?

351
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,760
I'm fine.

352
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,170
(Rejecting all orders other than drinks)

353
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,740
(In this restaurant, everything is up to the elderly woman.)

354
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,509
(The land of the eastern end of Hokkaido, Shiretoko)

355
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,709
(The mountains of the eastern end of Hokkaido, Shiretoko)

356
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,080
(The sea of the eastern end of Hokkaido, Shiretoko)

357
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,620
(With seasonal ingredients from Hokkaido, the blessed land, )

358
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,650
(the elderly woman decides the menu as she sees fit every day.)

359
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,760
(The so-called Elderly Woman's Choice Restaurant)

360
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,330
(What kind of food will be served today?)

361
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,460
But I'm getting quite excited.

362
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,299
Right? I doubt...

363
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,029
people who often travel to Japan have come...

364
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,499
- to such a place.
- Exactly.

365
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,069
- Yes.
- They can't stop by.

366
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,610
It's not a tourist spot. They can't stop by.

367
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,839
It's hard to find.

368
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,040
- About fifty years?
- Fifty?

369
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,480
Yes, 50 years.

370
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,010
What about you, Mi Ran?

371
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,750
(Impressed)

372
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,220
(Elderly Woman's Choice Restaurant's first menu)

373
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,260
(What are these dishes?)

374
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,790
What's this?

375
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,230
Tuna?

376
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,100
It's salmon jerky.

377
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,040
- Dried salmon?
- Dried salmon.

378
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,710
(One of the most abundant fish in Hokkaido, )

379
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,650
(salmon)

380
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,790
(Even the Ainu, the natives of Hokkaido, )

381
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:15,160
(dried, stored, and ate salmon throughout the winter.)

382
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,189
(With that, Hokkaido's traditional preserved food was born.)

383
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,099
(Salmon jerky)

384
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,029
- It's dried.
- How do we eat it?

385
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,829
- As it is?
- Ma'am.

386
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,340
Eat it after you peel the skin off.

387
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,840
You have to peel the skin off.

388
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,479
It's like being served gwamegi with the skin on.

389
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Exactly.

390
00:17:34,481 --> 00:17:35,810
But it comes off easily.

391
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,349
- Is that so?
- It peels off well.

392
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,350
(Peeling it off)

393
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,550
(Impressed)

394
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,519
- It's good.
- Yes.

395
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,560
(Munching)

396
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,459
It's mild yet tasty.

397
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,560
(Right up Na Ra's alley)

398
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,400
(Chewy)

399
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,699
- My teeth are...
- Let it melt in your mouth.

400
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,000
- I can't...
- Spin it around.

401
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,210
(Struggling)

402
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,840
The jerky is really tough.

403
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,539
(Using all his teeth)

404
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,680
But if you chew it...

405
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,979
- It's not salty at all.
- No.

406
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,450
The downside is if you have poor teeth...

407
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,850
- You have to suck on it.
- My teeth hurt now.

408
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,960
(Salmon jerky becomes more flavorful the more you chew it.)

409
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
What's that?

410
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,700
Isn't it a seasoned vegetable?

411
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,600
(What is this mysterious salad?)

412
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,770
I'll try it.

413
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,939
Yes, in order to introduce the dish.

414
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,310
(Mi Ran volunteers to taste it.)

415
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,909
- Is it spinach?
- No.

416
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,910
Isn't it a marine plant?

417
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,010
What is it?

418
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,549
(An unfamiliar taste that's a first even for the Eating Expert)

419
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,550
It's a seasoned vegetable.

420
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,380
(Trying again)

421
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,150
What is it?

422
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,550
Ma'am.

423
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,489
Ask her what this is.

424
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,760
(Ask when you don't know!)

425
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,189
It's normally called the asparagus found in the mountains.

426
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,660
- Asparagus?
- Asparagus.

427
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,470
(This is asparagus?)

428
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,929
You know the top part...

429
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,339
- of the asparagus, - The one you can find...

430
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,439
not the stem?

431
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,709
- I think it's the top part...
- Right.

432
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,740
Of the asparagus that has grown more.

433
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,340
- It's your guess, right?
- Yes.

434
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,380
- Mi Ran.
- Yes.

435
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,550
- That's what I'm tasting.
- Then...

436
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,080
- This right here.
- This?

437
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,190
- Are they bamboo shoots?
- It looks different.

438
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,090
Or it must be shoots, like baby vegetables.

439
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,860
Like shoots.

440
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:33,000
(Ooamadokoro, Hokkaido's wild greens)

441
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,970
(Similar to a type of wild sealwort tea leaves in Korea)

442
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,770
(It's called a mountain's asparagus due to its taste and texture.)

443
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,510
- Asparagus?
- Asparagus.

444
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,139
- Asparagus.
- It's an energy booster...

445
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,480
and is good for your digestion, blood circulation, and numbness.

446
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,449
It's slightly bitter, so it's best when eaten with mayonnaise.

447
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,520
With mayonnaise?

448
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,890
It has an antioxidant component that helps remove toxins in the body!

449
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,890
(And she leaves again.)

450
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,190
(The elderly woman is busy.)

451
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,560
(Food must constantly be served in my restaurant!)

452
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,000
(Serving the next dish quickly)

453
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Here.

454
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:17,939
(New dishes keep appearing.)

455
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,840
But our guest isn't here yet.

456
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,749
I'm sure she'll come soon.

457
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,950
(When will our guest arrive?)

458
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,180
(Shocked)

459
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,619
It's dark now.

460
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,750
(Who the members are eagerly waiting for)

461
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,090
(The guest seems very excited.)

462
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,759
I'm the only person out here.

463
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,230
(Laughing)

464
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,430
It's here.

465
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,129
(Rushing)

466
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,430
(Heading toward the members)

467
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,940
(Spying)

468
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,540
(Quietly)

469
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,550
(The one who crossed the ocean and mountains for the members)

470
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,550
Is this the place?

471
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,620
(Excited)

472
00:21:01,621 --> 00:21:02,690
(A cheerful appearance)

473
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,390
(Flapping)

474
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:06,690
(Full of bright energy!)

475
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,330
(Actress Lee Sun Bin)

476
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,530
(Never backing out when it comes to drinking)

477
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,699
(Flawlessly excelling at cussing)

478
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,340
(Flawlessly excelling at cussing)

479
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,910
(The extreme extrovert is here!)

480
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,950
(You treat me to food today!)

481
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,050
(The best friend even Mi Ran dials back a notch)

482
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,990
(Sun Bin is here, following her best friend!)

483
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,160
(Quietly)

484
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,729
(Still trying)

485
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,730
How's the potato?

486
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,100
It's good.

487
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,100
The seasoning isn't anything special, is it?

488
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,269
(A shadow comes closer!)

489
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,440
Hi.

490
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,610
Hi.

491
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,650
(She's finally here!)

492
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,450
Hi.

493
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,549
(Appearing ever so brightly)

494
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,650
Hi.

495
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,219
Hey.

496
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,419
Hi.

497
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,620
- Hi.
- Hi.

498
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,319
Hi.

499
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,560
- Come in.
- Hi.

500
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,730
- Okay. Really...
- Hey.

501
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,499
- It takes a while.
- Sorry.

502
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,270
- Seriously, we're sorry.
- Sit.

503
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,600
- Thanks for coming.
- Over there.

504
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,409
We left the most uncomfortable seat for you.

505
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,069
- The CEO seat?
- Yes.

506
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,540
(An optimistic girl)

507
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,410
(Screaming)

508
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,809
(Proving that she's Mi Ran's best friend)

509
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,480
(Here she goes again.)

510
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,890
What's with the energy?

511
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,489
(Another challenging energy after Hye Young)

512
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,520
Here's what I was worried about.

513
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,159
Since it took quite a long time,

514
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,860
I was able to sleep a lot.

515
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,600
You did?

516
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,969
But aren't you all tired?

517
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,040
No, we're fine.

518
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,839
Thank you so much...

519
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,269
- No, you asked me to come.
- for coming.

520
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,370
You had it tough.

521
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,779
No, it's fine.

522
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,879
Have you worked with everyone before?

523
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
No.

524
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:10,250
- I've never met them before.
- Is this your first?

525
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,549
- We've talked on the phone before.
- Yes.

526
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,550
- We met once, - Yes.

527
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:16,720
- and then after "Jirisan." - Right.

528
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,989
I met Hee Won at the after-party...

529
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,689
- Yes.
- for "HI-FIVE."

530
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,990
- And I've never met Na Ra before.
- We are meeting for the first time.

531
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,500
(Finally, the first conversation with my idol)

532
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,600
(Suddenly shy)

533
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,530
(What's wrong with her?)

534
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,240
(I'm in front of my idol.)

535
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,209
Do you want to drink anything?

536
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,209
I'm fine with anything, even just Sprite.

537
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,540
It could even be oolong tea.

538
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,179
Do you not want draft beer?

539
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,309
- I don't drink draft beer.
- She can't drink.

540
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,149
- No.
- Is that so? Good.

541
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,120
(The thirsty souls make a toast.)

542
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,650
- You don't drink either, right?
- No.

543
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,559
(Initiating a conversation with her idol)

544
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,320
- It's hitting the spot.
- Here.

545
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,430
- What is it?
- Dried salmon.

546
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,059
(Here.)

547
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,259
- What is it?
- Dried salmon.

548
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,660
- It's good.
- It's really good.

549
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,329
- Do I just tear it apart?
- Throw the skin away.

550
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,399
- Use your teeth.
- It's really tough.

551
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,339
- Is it?
- You need to use your teeth.

552
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,810
- You might lose your teeth.
- Okay.

553
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,539
Tear it off gently.

554
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,179
- It's a part of the salmon.
- What?

555
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,550
- Good, right?
- Yes.

556
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,220
- This is the dried version of that.
- I see.

557
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,790
(The main menu is grilled Hokkaido salmon.)

558
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,260
It's really good.

559
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,789
(Eating it whole like a native Hokkaido local)

560
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,860
Delicious.

561
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,969
(Chewy, as it's been slightly dried before grilling)

562
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,200
Make sure to dig in.

563
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,470
What else did you eat here?

564
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,610
We didn't eat.

565
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,610
- We waited for you.
- We really did wait for you.

566
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,639
- Really?
- Yes, we waited for you.

567
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,780
We just started eating.

568
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,549
- We were already served.
- We wanted to eat but waited.

569
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,920
(We waited for you.)

570
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,519
We really did wait for you.

571
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,650
(Acting as if it's her first bite)

572
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,290
Doesn't it taste like potato stems?

573
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,630
- The center is hollow.
- Try it.

574
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,189
Is it a plant?

575
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,560
(A familiar yet unfamiliar pickled vegetable?)

576
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,300
What's that plant that's hollow in the center?

577
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,799
- At a glance, it looks like penne.
- Yes.

578
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,399
- Totally.
- Right.

579
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,540
(Giving off penne vibes)

580
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,540
It's been penned.

581
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,780
Hence the shape.

582
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,249
(Laughing)

583
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,350
- And it's saucy.
- Exactly.

584
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,950
How do you keep bringing people who click better?

585
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,549
- It's nice.
- A surprise.

586
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,650
(Laughing)

587
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,790
(So what is the penne-like dish?)

588
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,230
(Often eaten as a spring vegetable even in Korea)

589
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,130
(Butterbur stalks)

590
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,429
(Seasoned butterbur stalks, Shiretoko's native dish)

591
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,669
This is good too.

592
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,240
(Seasoned butterbur stalks, Shiretoko's native dish)

593
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,010
- But really.
- Yes?

594
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,410
Back then, you seemed quite calm.

595
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,809
- During the preview?
- The VIP preview.

596
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,809
- Me?
- She was really loud back then.

597
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,349
- I was never calm.
- No, but...

598
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,849
I thought it was her movie preview.

599
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,850
Exactly.

600
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,749
Maybe you're confusing me with Bo Young.

601
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,020
- She was next to Bo Young.
- Right.

602
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,759
Coincidentally, Bo Young and Chun Woo Hee...

603
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,620
- were sitting next to me.
- Exactly.

604
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,490
I'm serious. You seemed kind of...

605
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,500
- calm back then.
- Here.

606
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,429
(Calmly bright)

607
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,469
Nice.

608
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,769
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

609
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,000
- Cheers.
- I'll make sure to have fun.

610
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,140
This restaurant feels like your go-to place.

611
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,709
Make sure to dig in.

612
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,740
(Laughing)

613
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,450
More food will be served.

614
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,450
(Laughing)

615
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,219
- She's very bright.
- Yes.

616
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,190
- What?
- You're very bright.

617
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,289
Yes, she's bright.

618
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,659
- Oh, no.
- Why?

619
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,359
- I'm holding back right now.
- Exactly.

620
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,830
- She's suppressing herself.
- Yes, I totally am.

621
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,500
Mi Ran was harassed by me for six months.

622
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,500
- While shooting our drama.
- She kept talking into my ears.

623
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,710
"Hey, Mi Ran."

624
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,870
(Attacking with a sudden reenactment)

625
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,209
Stop!

626
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,479
(Acting charming towards Mi Ran)

627
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,250
When I tried to kiss her, she was appalled.

628
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,450
Look at it steaming.

629
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,819
(Steaming soups are here.)

630
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,989
Thank you.

631
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,290
It's hot. Here.

632
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,629
- Take it.
- No.

633
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,530
- Hurry up and take it.
- Okay.

634
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,630
Thank you.

635
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,630
(Laughing)

636
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:24,699
Here, Dong Il.

637
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,099
(Drinking it directly from the bowl)

638
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,340
- Can't you smell the mushrooms?
- It's good.

639
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,170
The soup is hitting the spot.

640
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,249
Can't you smell the mushrooms in the soup?

641
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,349
Yes, it's rich.

642
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,380
Delicious.

643
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,180
- How cute.
- It's really good.

644
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,289
It's very chewy. Try it.

645
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,090
The texture is very unusual.

646
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,929
- It looks like wild mushrooms.
- Right?

647
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,429
There must be more dishes.

648
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,230
I took a peek inside just now.

649
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,970
(What's the next dish that'll be served?)

650
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,740
(Impressed)

651
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,170
What's this?

652
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,940
Isn't it hot wings?

653
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,639
Is it a fish croquette?

654
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,340
(What is this deep-fried dish?)

655
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,179
- Give it a try, Dong Il.
- Okay.

656
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,250
Hot wings?

657
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,919
- Sun Bin.
- It's not oysters, is it?

658
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,949
- Shall I try?
- Yes.

659
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,349
- You try, Sun Bin.
- The guest first.

660
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,390
Got it.

661
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,989
You should've said so earlier.

662
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,619
What would that make me?

663
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,989
Weren't you going to give it to her?

664
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,360
He already had one.

665
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,729
- I was going to give it to her.
- You were giving it to her.

666
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,860
It slipped my mind.

667
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,530
I didn't take the hint.

668
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,230
- Sorry. Try it.
- I shall try it.

669
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,110
- The juice is...
- It's oyster.

670
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,940
Oyster?

671
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,910
- Oysters are just that big.
- Can oysters be this big?

672
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,509
- Oyster?
- Right?

673
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,809
- It's deep-fried oysters.
- Is it an oyster?

674
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,550
(Deep-fried oysters!)

675
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,020
(Filled with the fresh scent of the ocean!)

676
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,289
Thank you.

677
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:53,320
(Deep-fried oysters made with whole, plump oysters)

678
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,090
Unbelievable.

679
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,890
It's amazing.

680
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,660
- Is it?
- Yes.

681
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,559
- I love it.
- It's delicious.

682
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,629
- Isn't it?
- It's incredible.

683
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,800
- Really?
- Yes.

684
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,100
(Crunchiness that carries the scent of the ocean)

685
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,209
Cheers.

686
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,270
Nice.

687
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,369
- Cheers.
- I said it'd be good.

688
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,440
(Cheers as it's good)

689
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,709
I sang your song...

690
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,419
at a talent show in elementary school.

691
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,550
You did?

692
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,849
You sang at a talent show?

693
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,549
I practiced with two of my friends.

694
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,090
- Which song?
- "I Love School."

695
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,019
Back in elementary school...

696
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,389
I'm sorry when you're eating.

697
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,390
(Shaking)

698
00:29:31,391 --> 00:29:33,229
- Stop.
- I wanted to tell you.

699
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,860
- I was dying to tell you.
- Not many know that song.

700
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,769
Not many know that song.

701
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,170
My friends and I...

702
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,539
- gave it some thought.
- I see.

703
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,309
There were just so many of Na Ra's famous songs,

704
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,539
including "Sweet Dream" and "I Am a Woman Too."

705
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,140
We had so many options.

706
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,980
But we wanted to be special.

707
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,180
That was why at school...

708
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,779
As a real geek.

709
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,549
We chose "I Love School." Like, I love school.

710
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,750
(Even to impress the school!)

711
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,160
(An excellent song choice)

712
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,319
Sun Bin used to be in a dance club.

713
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,329
- True.
- What?

714
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,129
I was in my high school's dance club.

715
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,229
- She was even an idol trainee.
- I was a trainee.

716
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,659
She became an actress...

717
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,430
- As a singer?
- after being a trainee.

718
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,340
(Actually, not only is Sun Bin good at acting, )

719
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,640
(but she's also skilled in dancing...)

720
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,910
(and singing.)

721
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:26,420
(She's a well-rounded talent!)

722
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,790
I debuted as a musical actress first.

723
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:33,090
She was in Hakchon's "The Invincible Trio."

724
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,120
- You know it, Hee Won.
- Sun Bin was in it.

725
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,789
- Hakchon? The theater company?
- Yes.

726
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,959
When she was young.

727
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,399
Back in the first year of high school.

728
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,160
(Debuted as a musical actress)

729
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,530
Which year was that?

730
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,370
It was probably in 2010.

731
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,940
In 2010?

732
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,539
When I was a total baby.

733
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,010
(Laughing)

734
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,810
You're as bright as a baby even now.

735
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,339
(Laughing)

736
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,450
And I love that.

737
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,880
You're still...

738
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,419
a baby. You still belong to the baby group.

739
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,189
No, Mi Ran. I believed that too.

740
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,789
But remember the shooting sites?

741
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,519
There are actors and actresses who were born in 2003 and 2004.

742
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,130
But there aren't that many.

743
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,189
(Oh, right!)

744
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,629
- What is it?
- Aren't your kids still young?

745
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,730
- Gen Z?
- They are Gen Z.

746
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,239
But we don't talk, so I'm not sure.

747
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,539
They don't communicate.

748
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,270
I'm not sure if I should bring this up,

749
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,380
- but the actor who spent...
- Yes?

750
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,109
The most time with my children was Kwang Soo.

751
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,750
- Really?
- I'm serious.

752
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,850
- Kwang Soo loves children.
- Right?

753
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,219
Since we didn't have a TV at home,

754
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,850
they didn't know Kwang Soo at first.

755
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,559
Their friends must've told them later...

756
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,159
about how my children...

757
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,190
- Uncle Giraffe?
- were close with Uncle Giraffe.

758
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,630
- Uncle Giraffe?
- That they were close.

759
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,870
Kwang Soo sent a lot of gifts to my children.

760
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,329
- Really?
- Yes.

761
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,500
(How sweet.)

762
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,900
- It's good.
- It's delicious.

763
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,109
The more you eat it,

764
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,340
- the better it tastes.
- Right?

765
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,910
(Eating)

766
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,949
(Laughing)

767
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,679
- Isn't the cucumber good?
- Yes.

768
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,649
Sun Bin is truly enjoying the food all the way in Sapporo.

769
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,620
(Munching)

770
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,789
Let's put up our tents far away today.

771
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,630
We might not get any sleep tonight.

772
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,329
Because of how loud it'll be.

773
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,230
(They can already picture tonight.)

774
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,600
- Why were you like that at first?
- What?

775
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,829
When we first met,

776
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,440
- You?
- you didn't come after me.

777
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,670
Mi Ran.

778
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,940
(Upset, she acts all charming.)

779
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,240
- I...
- Yes?

780
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,079
Look at how she moves her shoulders.

781
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,179
Listen.

782
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,480
(Copying her)

783
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,019
You were a much more senior actress than me.

784
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,520
- You found me difficult?
- Of course.

785
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,659
You found me difficult?

786
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,530
- Cute.
- Of course.

787
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,659
(Sulking)

788
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,529
She feels wronged. I've never met someone who expresses it like her.

789
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:57,099
Really. It's only natural.

790
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,970
- So you found me difficult.
- Of course.

791
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,509
With her tiny face,

792
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,139
she expresses so many different emotions.

793
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,140
Do you see them?

794
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:08,810
(She's very expressive with her emotions.)

795
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,750
(The elderly lady serves them a dessert on her own.)

796
00:33:10,751 --> 00:33:11,850
She brought us a dessert.

797
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,179
It's on the house.

798
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,520
- "On the house?" Thank you so much.
- "On the house?"

799
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,459
- Look at the shape.
- She even gave us a free dessert.

800
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,120
It's straight from nature.

801
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,960
- The tomatoes taste good.
- I think she grew them.

802
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,430
It looks like it. Each tomato is shaped differently.

803
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,340
(Someone from a nearby farm brought them last night.)

804
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,140
(I knew it.)

805
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,379
At a fancy restaurant, the dishes may look...

806
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,350
- impressive.
- Right.

807
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,150
- This kind of food is homier.
- I agree.

808
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,550
- The ingredients taste natural.
- Exactly.

809
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,189
- It's delicious.
- It's like food made at home...

810
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,219
- by your grandmother.
- Right.

811
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,260
(Tonight's dinner with the presence of grandmother's love)

812
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,160
Ma'am, you're the best.

813
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,430
- Okay.
- "How are you doing?"

814
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,770
- This is the campsite.
- This is our house.

815
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,669
- Take a look around the house.
- Finally.

816
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,440
(Mi Ran, who feels at home now)

817
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,209
My goodness.

818
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,179
(And a cicada, who came to take a look around)

819
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,610
Oh, my.

820
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,979
Be careful.

821
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,249
(She enters the house accompanied by Na Ra.)

822
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,149
- It looks so cute.
- This is the room.

823
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,649
Okay. Can we just sleep on here?

824
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:27,290
- We lay down the blankets to sleep.
- I see.

825
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,189
(A brief fan-meet disguised as a house tour)

826
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,560
I've never seen something like this.

827
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,000
(Lovey-dovey)

828
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,600
Mi Ran, I know that you're also here as a guest.

829
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,200
(We leave the kids to you.)

830
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,970
Please take care of the kids.

831
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,539
- Why are you letting them go?
- No.

832
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,179
They remind me of Bin.

833
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,180
They're so full of energy.

834
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,079
(Energetic Sun Bin is here.)

835
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,380
- You already took a look around?
- Yes.

836
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,620
It's so cute inside.

837
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,720
By the way...

838
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,259
- You came a long way.
- Okay.

839
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,259
We'll give you a big gift in the beginning...

840
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,730
- to upgrade you.
- What is it?

841
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,200
(Quietly)

842
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,400
- What is it?
- This is...

843
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,070
- Gosh.
- Here's a drawing of a bear.

844
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,239
- Take a look inside.
- What is it?

845
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,609
- What could it be?
- What is it?

846
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,679
- You will be very surprised.
- Oh, my.

847
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,319
- It's a towel for the face.
- It's not a handkerchief.

848
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,649
- Hee Won picked it out.
- Really?

849
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,249
- Hee Won did.
- Thank you.

850
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,519
What is something...

851
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,420
that would go along with that?

852
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,290
What is it?

853
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,390
(What?)

854
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,729
(The second present is a tumbler.)

855
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,730
It's cute.

856
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:45,000
(The second present is a tumbler.)

857
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,739
Forget about all the hardships and enjoy tonight.

858
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,039
- Thank you so much.
- He's so thoughtful.

859
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,710
(Expressing gratitude with presents)

860
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,810
That's cute.

861
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,880
(Three women are sleeping inside the House on Wheels again tonight.)

862
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,320
(Checking the time)

863
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,659
It's only 10:30pm, but we're getting ready for bed.

864
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,789
I know. Sleeping at this hour...

865
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,760
(I don't even remember.)

866
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,960
(Unlike the tent zone where everyone is asleep)

867
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,330
(The girls' night starts now.)

868
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:22,910
(After sharing so many stories, the women...)

869
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,710
Mom.

870
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,350
(Both of them are staring.)

871
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,249
Mom.

872
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,550
(When she gets up, she finds herself with two daughters.)

873
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,049
The three of us should hold hands.

874
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,619
(The three of them got very close overnight.)

875
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,860
(Humming)

876
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,230
(Opening the cover for the microwave)

877
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,130
- Do I put it in here?
- The cover? I'll go up.

878
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,100
The cover.

879
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,800
(She goes to help her while humming.)

880
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,540
We won't be able to pull it out.

881
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,640
My goodness.

882
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,080
It's stuck.

883
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,679
(In the end, she gets up on the sink.)

884
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,749
Wait a minute.

885
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,809
(Struggling)

886
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:08,650
I don't think it goes in here. We should keep it out.

887
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,789
Be careful of your head.

888
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,489
(She's determined to help her in any possible way.)

889
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,390
I will put it down.

890
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,090
(Laughing)

891
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,030
- I think it worked, Mi Ran.
- Okay.

892
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,160
It looks like it's been there from the start.

893
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,299
(Father Dong Il is shaving.)

894
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,770
Over here...

895
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,739
Take a look, Sun Bin. We bought everything we could.

896
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,539
- Is this it?
- It's the best bread at this place.

897
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,710
(A bag of snacks from the convenience store)

898
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,110
What's this? It's dango.

899
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,610
This is...

900
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,049
You said that you wanted it, so I bought it. I know everything.

901
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,150
- I love this.
- Yes, dango.

902
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,619
And I bought famous types of bread at this place.

903
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,089
(A complete breakfast for Sun Bin)

904
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,560
This is another bread that's hard to swallow.

905
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,059
(Mi Ran is also preparing something.)

906
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,860
(Glancing)

907
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,370
- For breakfast?
- For breakfast.

908
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,469
- As an appetizer.
- Something light to eat.

909
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,610
(This is the perfect appetizer.)

910
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,180
(Sizzling?)

911
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,950
(Sizzling)

912
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,619
(What is this sound?)

913
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,620
Are you making jeon?

914
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,050
- Are you making jeon?
- No.

915
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,190
For breakfast...

916
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,359
- We're making a simple brunch.
- It's something simple.

917
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,789
For a simple brunch,

918
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,759
- It's just a brunch.
- you're grilling pork?

919
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,899
How could she grill meat for brunch?

920
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,370
(Doesn't everyone eat like this?)

921
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,670
We need to finish this to buy more.

922
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,270
Mi Ran is right.

923
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,869
Brunch, meat.

924
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,640
(Meat is the best for brunch.)

925
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,850
(Mi Ran's special brunch)

926
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,250
(Peeking)

927
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,820
Meat in the morning.

928
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,720
Meat is the best when you need energy.

929
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,559
- The smell... Right?
- The smell is insane.

930
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,559
(The chicks are waiting for food.)

931
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,690
Meat is the best in the morning.

932
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:02,230
- You make food so quickly.
- I'm doing ballet from watching.

933
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:05,269
I'm standing on the tip of my toes because of the smell.

934
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,900
(Please give me food now.)

935
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,009
Goodness.

936
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,410
(Meat that will fill the baby birds' bellies)

937
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,650
Gosh, what's this?

938
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,090
(Steam is rising from the morning meat.)

939
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,050
It's the most famous bread in this area.

940
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,659
The famous bread at the convenience store.

941
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,120
It looks delicious.

942
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,490
Here's your favorite orange jam.

943
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,730
It goes well with the meat.

944
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,200
- Jam on pork belly?
- Jam.

945
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,430
Those are perilla leaves from Gangjin...

946
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,240
and stir-fried shishito peppers with dried anchovies.

947
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,670
Make a wrap with a perilla leaf. I strongly recommend it.

948
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,010
That's why I grilled the meat.

949
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,310
The perilla leaves looked so good.

950
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,149
Mi Ran, it sounds like I'm asking you a favor.

951
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,120
- Could you make me one?
- I'll do it.

952
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,949
(Making a wrap neatly after complaining)

953
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,020
Put it on top.

954
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,519
- Sun Bin, try it.
- Me? Thank you.

955
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,759
(Giving it to Sun Bin first)

956
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,960
Try it. The perilla leaf...

957
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,459
Try it. The perilla leaf...

958
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,230
(She passes out as soon as she eats it.)

959
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
- Is it good?
- Yes.

960
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:10,300
- This also looks good.
- It's really good.

961
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,200
Do you want some?

962
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
It's delicious.

963
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,610
(Humming).

964
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,809
Mi Ran, give me one more. I know that it sounds like a chore.

965
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:19,940
(Mi Ran, give me one more.)

966
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,010
(Laughing)

967
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,210
Are you done eating?

968
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,620
(I only had one.)

969
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,090
This is just a tasting. Aren't you done eating?

970
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,730
I'm worried that we will get too full to eat lunch.

971
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,630
(Let me still try some.)

972
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,460
- My gosh. Hee Won.
- Yes?

973
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,200
Try a wrap with meat and a perilla leaf.

974
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,870
We only get to have one each.

975
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,340
I don't think you'll stop after one.

976
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,510
No way.

977
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,049
Na Ra, wrap some meat with it.

978
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,680
(We have so much food to eat today.)

979
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,850
(Glancing)

980
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,560
This is delicious.

981
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,220
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

982
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,289
Isn't it good with perilla leaves?

983
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,900
(Isn't it delicious?)

984
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,260
(As he keeps eating...)

985
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:19,200
(Now, he's eating while standing up.)

986
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,700
This is really delicious.

987
00:41:20,701 --> 00:41:22,269
(You can't stop after one, can you?)

988
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,340
This is delicious.

989
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,610
(The morning meat is irresistible.)

990
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,450
- Na Ra, wrap some meat with it.
- It's so good.

991
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,079
- Instead of ssamjang...
- Stop it.

992
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,520
- No, don't stop me.
- Mi Ran.

993
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,819
(Meat with jam? Mi Ran!)

994
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,190
Come back to me.

995
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,890
(I want to eat it with jam.)

996
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,789
(Rascal Mi Ran complains about the side dishes.)

997
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,690
(The dad stops her.)

998
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,659
- Clean up the table.
- I want some.

999
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,670
If you're going to fight, clean up.

1000
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:54,300
(She bursts into tears when the mom appears.)

1001
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,070
(Calm down.)

1002
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,780
(Satisfied)

1003
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,250
(It's hard to raise a daughter.)

1004
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,080
- You refuse to eat this?
- Me?

1005
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:06,880
You refuse to eat this?

1006
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,450
- I like strange combinations.
- It will be crunchy.

1007
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,220
- "Strange combinations?" - It's delicious.

1008
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,550
- Isn't it so good?
- Yes.

1009
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,119
"Strange combinations?"

1010
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,930
(They're curious about the taste of the combination.)

1011
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,360
(Exclaiming)

1012
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,259
- Dong Il.
- Wait, this is...

1013
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,060
- What?
- You don't want it with orange jam?

1014
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,630
- I don't think so.
- You don't want it?

1015
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:29,440
(Tempted)

1016
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,369
- Is it good, Mi Ran?
- I will try it first.

1017
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,480
It's a combo that can't taste bad.

1018
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,010
It's a combo that can't taste bad.

1019
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,610
(Eating Expert is confident about food.)

1020
00:42:38,611 --> 00:42:41,420
- It can't taste bad.
- It's impossible to taste bad.

1021
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,390
(How is it?)

1022
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:53,190
Pork is very delicious with orange jam.

1023
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,930
It's refreshing, so it goes well with the meat.

1024
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:58,399
It's delicious.

1025
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,730
(It's delicious?)

1026
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,939
(He dabs some orange jam on the meat.)

1027
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,940
Try this too.

1028
00:43:04,941 --> 00:43:06,340
This is really good.

1029
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,809
It's delicious.

1030
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,280
(Dong Il also gives credit to the meat, orange jam combo.)

1031
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,250
I'm so glad that you grilled some meat.

1032
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,050
This is necessary for a brunch.

1033
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,219
Grilling meat in the morning?

1034
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,220
(Everyone is satisfied with the brunch.)

1035
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,459
Mi Ran, you've done a lot of camping.

1036
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,059
- Yes.
- Isn't the weather funny today?

1037
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,660
It looks like it's about to rain.

1038
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,429
The weather is nice.

1039
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,100
- It's not gloomy, is it?
- Nice weather.

1040
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,530
Right?

1041
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,869
It's moist but not wet.

1042
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,009
(Impressed)

1043
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:38,340
That's a great expression.

1044
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,040
(In awe)

1045
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,509
(She's getting intoxicated with herself today.)

1046
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,850
That milk stood out to me.

1047
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,789
- Now...
- Cheers.

1048
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:51,850
(Clattering)

1049
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,559
He's cleaning up again.

1050
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,290
- What are you doing?
- Stop eating.

1051
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:58,659
(All of a sudden?)

1052
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,459
- "Stop eating?" - Stop eating.

1053
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,560
- Dad.
- Stop eating.

1054
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:05,030
This is enough. Stop eating.

1055
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,400
Can I have some dango?

1056
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,540
We have so many dads here.

1057
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,139
Protect the dango.

1058
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,170
- It's delicious.
- Stop eating.

1059
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:14,209
There's a convenience store at the airport.

1060
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,240
- You can find it there.
- If we bring some home...

1061
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,110
- That's enough. Stop eating.
- Hee Won.

1062
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:20,919
(Before he comes, the perilla leaf...)

1063
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,850
(He takes it away.)

1064
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:24,889
- That's enough.
- She's still eating.

1065
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,760
- Why are you taking it away?
- Stop eating.

1066
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,359
Stop eating.

1067
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,360
(He's firm about cleaning up the dishes.)

1068
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,929
(What's wrong with him?)

1069
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:34,000
It's all done.

1070
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,060
- It was just the right amount.
- Here's why.

1071
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,170
We went to the supermarket yesterday.

1072
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,600
All the raw fish was sold out.

1073
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,669
- We should hurry.
- It will get crowded.

1074
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:44,840
- What time is it?
- So now...

1075
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,779
The supermarket opens at 9:30am.

1076
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,880
It's nearby.

1077
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,240
Shall we go?

1078
00:44:49,241 --> 00:44:50,449
(Na Ra and Dong Il go together with Sun Bin in the front.)

1079
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,610
Shall we go?

1080
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:53,679
(Today, Na Ra drives to the supermarket.)

1081
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,219
Is Dong Il joining us?

1082
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,220
Yes.

1083
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,949
Is the supermarket far?

1084
00:44:57,950 --> 00:44:59,789
- No, it's close.
- It's nearby.

1085
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,220
(The supermarket members leave.)

1086
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,129
(Rummaging)

1087
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:07,130
We don't need it.

1088
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,500
Mi Ran, do you want to share this?

1089
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,740
What are you doing?

1090
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,540
Now that they're gone, why don't we eat?

1091
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,809
Dong Il, can't you draw a map of this place now?

1092
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:24,950
I can draw a map of this neighborhood.

1093
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,350
I walk here every morning, so I know what it looks like.

1094
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,419
No matter how much I look, I can't tell.

1095
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,290
- I'm exactly the same.
- What?

1096
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:33,690
I love you.

1097
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,059
- Is it the same for you?
- We're the same.

1098
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,559
This is how bad I am. I'm also terrible with directions.

1099
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,559
- On set...
- I love you.

1100
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,259
After six months on a film set, I'm still lost.

1101
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,730
Can I join the conversation? I don't know either.

1102
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,199
But you know your way around.

1103
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,800
It's because I take walks.

1104
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,809
When I heard you talk before going to bed last night,

1105
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:55,379
you talked and laughed a lot. It sounded like so much fun.

1106
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

1107
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,780
I think I fell asleep in the middle of a sentence.

1108
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,719
- You did?
- That's right.

1109
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,780
You fell asleep while talking.

1110
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,520
- I can't remember clearly.
- Right.

1111
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:05,450
I was jealous.

1112
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:07,619
Right before falling asleep,

1113
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,490
- we had a deep conversation.
- Yes.

1114
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,329
It's something that I rarely do,

1115
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,860
so it made me feel so good.

1116
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,969
- I was happy.
- Aren't you glad that you came?

1117
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,669
- Definitely.
- Yes, definitely.

1118
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,970
(It was a good night for everyone.)

1119
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,510
You can find it there.

1120
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,170
- Thank you for driving.
- Thank you for driving.

1121
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,309
- I'll leave this cart to you.
- Okay.

1122
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,350
I won't interfere with anything.

1123
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:33,249
I won't stop you, so pick whatever you want.

1124
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:36,080
No, please. I'd like you to interfere.

1125
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,490
- I'd like you to interfere.
- There.

1126
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,760
- Pick whatever you want.
- There.

1127
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,630
- Are these conches?
- Yes, conches.

1128
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,099
- We have to boil them in water.
- Boil them?

1129
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,699
- Yes.
- Do we have time for that?

1130
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,900
They're alive. Of course.

1131
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,629
Conches.

1132
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,830
(She gets delicious-looking ones.)

1133
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,439
- Where's the raw fish?
- What?

1134
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,239
- Where's the raw fish?
- It's that way.

1135
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,640
That's what you will eat.

1136
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,739
(A fish that's about to be prepped)

1137
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,780
The touch of a master.

1138
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,949
There are salmon that are caught in the morning.

1139
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,849
- I see.
- That's...

1140
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:12,120
(Salmon that's caught this morning?)

1141
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,820
(An advantage in Shiretoko)

1142
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:23,630
(Salmon that are caught in the morning of that day)

1143
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:30,940
(Quickly delivered straight to a nearby supermarket)

1144
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:36,240
(It's possible to buy freshly caught salmon at the supermarket.)

1145
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,880
It was caught this morning.

1146
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,009
Right in front of our eyes?

1147
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,820
(Like at a seafood market, it's cleaned as soon as you order.)

1148
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,889
- Gosh, this is...
- It's huge.

1149
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,289
This is very big.

1150
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,460
(Their first time seeing freshly caught salmon)

1151
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,190
(On top of that, it's a whole salmon.)

1152
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:53,730
That's fascinating.

1153
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:58,830
I've never had fish caught in front of my eyes.

1154
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,469
That's why Hee Won tried...

1155
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:04,539
to stop you from eating this morning.

1156
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,169
- So that I could enjoy...
- Right.

1157
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,440
A lot of delicious salmon.

1158
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,380
- What? Dong Il.
- Yes.

1159
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,109
Cut?

1160
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,080
Okay, I can cut it.

1161
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:20,090
(What will they make with the whole salmon today?)

1162
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,289
(Paying with excitement)

1163
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,520
Na Ra, this is...

1164
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,989
Where did he go?

1165
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,799
- Sun Bin, this is for you.
- Let's go.

1166
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,000
- Dong Il.
- I paid it myself.

1167
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,170
Really?

1168
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,500
- Dong Il.
- Oh, my.

1169
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,540
Thank you so much.

1170
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,270
Please.

1171
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:42,610
Why are you flirting with me by giving me a flower?

1172
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,550
He gave me a flower.

1173
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,219
That's nothing to brag about.

1174
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,849
No one is listening to me.

1175
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,550
- Stop it.
- I'm listening.

1176
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:56,820
(A lovelier couple is at the campsite.)

1177
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,159
(Very close together)

1178
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,699
This doesn't need to be rinsed, does it?

1179
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,629
(In the midst of endless laughter)

1180
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:07,039
- What? I'll finish it up.
- I'm serious. Look.

1181
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,269
- It doesn't need to be rinsed.
- Thank you.

1182
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:10,339
Show them quietly.

1183
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,310
He caught a salmon for us.

1184
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,840
Hey.

1185
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:15,810
(Ta-da)

1186
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:19,110
- Shiso.
- Isn't it adorable?

1187
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,849
Take a look, Mi Ran.

1188
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:22,850
(We have this too.)

1189
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,250
What's this?

1190
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:28,220
Scallops and clams. We will have them steamed.

1191
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,260
- I'll steam them.
- Okay.

1192
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:32,789
Is there a steamer?

1193
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:34,160
(Giving off the vibe of the house owner)

1194
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,230
(She takes something out.)

1195
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,469
Cypress-steamed?

1196
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:39,529
(She remembered where the cypress steamer was.)

1197
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:41,400
Where is it? Here it is.

1198
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,810
(Putting water in the bottom shelf)

1199
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,739
- Scallops.
- Scallops.

1200
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,440
(We will start with the scallops.)

1201
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:50,610
- Mi Ran, how many?
- Put all of them.

1202
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:53,750
Line them up.

1203
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,680
(Placing scallops like putting puzzle pieces together)

1204
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,019
It's not much when you steam them.

1205
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,690
(8 scallops fill up the space.)

1206
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,689
Let's put the clams in here.

1207
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:03,690
(Opening the 2nd layer)

1208
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,090
- Clams.
- Clams.

1209
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,360
(Shall I take out the clams?)

1210
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,729
(This clam...)

1211
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:11,900
This is unbelievable.

1212
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:13,899
It's really big.

1213
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,740
(Can a clam be this big?)

1214
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,670
The clams are as big as a fist.

1215
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,479
- These...
- They're enormous.

1216
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,550
(Since they're big, they must be very delicious.)

1217
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,779
(Big clams fill up the 2nd layer of the steamer.)

1218
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,750
Will there be space for conches?

1219
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,280
Conches?

1220
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,220
We'll put them in between.

1221
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,360
We can put them in between.

1222
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,620
- It's just for a bite.
- Yes.

1223
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,189
(Closing the lid)

1224
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:41,700
(Does it not close?)

1225
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,170
- It's not closing.
- It's not?

1226
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:48,340
Should we take one out?

1227
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,140
Or keep it that way?

1228
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,539
(She presses it hard, but it's impossible.)

1229
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,880
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

1230
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,620
(While the ambitious cypress-steamed scallops are getting cooked)

1231
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:05,289
(What are they up to?)

1232
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,860
(Absorbed)

1233
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,160
You're good at taking it out.

1234
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:13,390
You're good at using metal.

1235
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:18,899
- It can't be done with force.
- Do you have to relax?

1236
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,930
You have to pull it out lightly.

1237
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,500
It looks like you're performing surgery.

1238
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,269
(Salmon Surgeon, Kim Hee Won)

1239
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:25,670
Oh, good.

1240
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:28,339
- Are there many?
- There are so many.

1241
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,679
(Hee Won is pulling out every hidden bone with tweezers.)

1242
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,180
You're so good at pulling them out.

1243
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,380
In the kitchen... Oh, my.

1244
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,289
Do you have to pull each of them out? Goodness.

1245
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:39,489
- We're doing it for you.
- Gosh.

1246
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:41,660
(Moved)

1247
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:43,759
Hi.

1248
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,760
(Sun Bin, I also prepared one more thing.)

1249
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,330
(In case you get hungry from waiting)

1250
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:49,330
Lie there.

1251
00:51:49,331 --> 00:51:51,370
Lie there evenly.

1252
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:52,470
As a refreshment.

1253
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,199
There's one per person. You can't have more.

1254
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,300
(It's just a refreshment, so one per person!)

1255
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,970
(It's her first time eating squid as an appetizer.)

1256
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,909
The squids are lying down side by side.

1257
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,179
(Starting to steam whole squids to get rid of hunger)

1258
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,180
Steam them.

1259
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,349
- Is it done? Okay.
- It's done.

1260
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:08,350
It's done now.

1261
00:52:08,351 --> 00:52:09,650
(Salmon is also ready to be cooked.)

1262
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,550
(The griddle chef appears.)

1263
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,989
The real performance will start now.

1264
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,020
Okay.

1265
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:21,230
(Melting butter with bare hands)

1266
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:26,099
When you leave your hands on for a long time, it gets hot.

1267
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,040
(Leaving them longer will be too hot.)

1268
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:32,970
(Finally after a quick yet intense performance)

1269
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:36,909
(The fresh, scarlet salmon goes on the griddle.)

1270
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,450
Gosh, it's very nice.

1271
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,249
It's because it was caught in the morning.

1272
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,020
(The fresh, scarlet salmon goes on the griddle.)

1273
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,620
- Salmon that's caught today.
- This morning.

1274
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,259
- Sizzling.
- He caught it...

1275
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,260
in front of you.

1276
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,260
(The salmon is called Sizzling.)

1277
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,989
The smell.

1278
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:54,259
(The scarlet salmon sizzles in the butter.)

1279
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,559
It was caught this morning.

1280
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,570
I know. It's very fresh.

1281
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,869
I have to take a photo of this.

1282
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:03,169
- Where is it?
- Don't do it.

1283
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:04,239
Stop, it's embarrassing.

1284
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,140
Normally... My goodness.

1285
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,340
- I can't hold myself back.
- Where did you put it?

1286
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,610
(I found it!)

1287
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:14,379
(She runs back while smiling like a puppy.)

1288
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,420
Na Ra.

1289
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,520
(Peace sign)

1290
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,790
It's so gorgeous.

1291
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,160
A salmon steak as big as this.

1292
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:25,860
They don't even sell one this big.

1293
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:28,959
Hold this part. Let's flip it simultaneously.

1294
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,259
- Put it here.
- Here?

1295
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,829
- Like this?
- Yes. Flip it.

1296
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,229
(You need two to flip it.)

1297
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:36,799
(The back of the gigantic salmon staek is golden brown.)

1298
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,840
Next.

1299
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,340
- Two, three.
- Two, three.

1300
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,109
- Okay.
- My gosh.

1301
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,740
(They flip the 2nd steak on the count of 3.)

1302
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,449
(It turned into an apricot color.)

1303
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:48,850
(How will the salmon steaks taste?)

1304
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,889
(Meanwhile, Mi Ran and Hee Won are making sushi.)

1305
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:54,860
This...

1306
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,060
- There's dried seaweed for sushi.
- Yes.

1307
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,299
(Suddenly taking out dried seaweed for sushi?)

1308
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,160
- There's dried seaweed for sushi.
- Yes.

1309
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:05,069
- That!
- Let's make gunkan maki.

1310
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:07,300
- Yes, let's.
- Urchin roe gunkan maki.

1311
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,470
You're so detailed.

1312
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,880
The rice...

1313
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,410
Wrap the strip around it. Just make it round.

1314
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,480
Smaller? This much?

1315
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:23,549
- Do I roll it?
- Goodness.

1316
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:24,650
(Frustrated)

1317
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:27,860
(Just give me that.)

1318
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,320
Give me that.

1319
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,390
- Like this.
- Yes.

1320
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:33,289
- Wrap it like this.
- Yes.

1321
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:35,300
Put urchin roe on top here.

1322
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,470
- I see.
- Then it becomes gunkan maki.

1323
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,869
Like this.

1324
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:43,700
(Fiddling with it)

1325
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,409
- Like this?
- Yes.

1326
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,039
The edge... Yes.

1327
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,210
Well, the rice...

1328
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,349
Urchin roe needs to go on top, so you need to leave some space.

1329
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:52,549
- Put half the rice.
- I see.

1330
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:53,550
(The ingredient needs to go on top of the rice for gunkan maki.)

1331
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,319
- I understand.
- You get it, right?

1332
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,219
Make a mold and place urchin roe.

1333
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,720
(It's just Chungmu gimbap now!)

1334
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,349
(Like this.)

1335
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:04,060
(You need some empty space for the ingredient to go in.)

1336
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,630
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

1337
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:08,659
- Okay.
- I understand.

1338
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,830
(He understands.)

1339
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,100
This much.

1340
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,100
(As expected of Sushi King, he picks up fast.)

1341
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,340
(Mi Ran is in charge of adding urchin roe topping!)

1342
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,910
If there's too little of it, you can't feel the buttery flavor.

1343
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,910
(Eating Expert's magic touch makes it look so much better.)

1344
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:26,750
This looks so delicious.

1345
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:28,779
- It'll be tasty.
- That's amazing.

1346
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,720
- The rich flavor.
- Yes.

1347
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:33,219
(She adds a tiny bit of urchin roe to the mini gunkan maki.)

1348
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,860
There's no space to put more.

1349
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,129
(With one touch from Eating Expert, )

1350
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,329
- It's done.
- It looks great.

1351
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:40,430
(it looks as elegant as a fine-dining dish!)

1352
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,660
Why are you so good?

1353
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,330
(It's a compliment.)

1354
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:47,440
Where's salmon roe? We can add it too.

1355
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,369
(Rice on top of a wider dried seaweed strip)

1356
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:50,869
(Shiso on top of it)

1357
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:53,209
(Radish sprout on top of it)

1358
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:55,909
(Urchin roe on top of it)

1359
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:57,180
(Heaps of urchin roe)

1360
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,009
(Add as much ingredients as you want and fold both corners inward.)

1361
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:00,680
It already looks legit.

1362
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,950
(A cone-shaped norimaki is made!)

1363
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:05,019
I'll add salmon roe too.

1364
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,390
(Adding a generous amount of topping since there's a lot more space)

1365
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,320
What would we have done if you weren't here?

1366
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,089
You can do so many things.

1367
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:13,160
It's my first time making this.

1368
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,059
It's your first time, and you're so good. That's crazy.

1369
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,370
(I agree.)

1370
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:20,500
It's ready.

1371
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,739
It's maki.

1372
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,510
- My goodness.
- My gosh.

1373
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:26,510
They look gorgeous.

1374
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,280
This... How...

1375
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,009
My goodness.

1376
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:33,880
(Since she showed off her amazing skills, )

1377
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:36,120
(let's have the appetizer.)

1378
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,020
(Singing)

1379
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:39,890
(Adding a sound effect)

1380
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:42,889
- One, two, three.
- Three.

1381
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:43,960
Ta-da.

1382
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:45,529
(Under cypress-scented steam...)

1383
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:46,929
- It's cute.
- Stop now.

1384
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:48,129
It's done.

1385
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,500
(The whole squids are steamed moistly.)

1386
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:51,730
Ta-da.

1387
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,599
(Becoming very expressive)

1388
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,600
(Amazed)

1389
00:56:56,601 --> 00:56:57,709
It's cute.

1390
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:58,710
(Cheering)

1391
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:00,609
- The intestines.
- These...

1392
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:03,309
(She carefully picks up the whole squid.)

1393
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:04,479
It's separated.

1394
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,549
(Cut off)

1395
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:07,249
It's separated.

1396
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,380
- You can put it back in.
- Yes. I'll put it back in secretly.

1397
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:11,420
Like this.

1398
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,119
- Go back in.
- Done.

1399
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,159
Go in!

1400
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,860
(Their savage way of steaming whole squids)

1401
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,629
It looks delicious.

1402
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:19,290
I think they were family.

1403
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,229
You think they were family?

1404
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,630
Yes. The one in the middle is small.

1405
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:25,229
(The small one is probably...)

1406
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:27,670
(me?)

1407
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,369
- Get chogochujang ready.
- Yes.

1408
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:30,670
It smells amazing.

1409
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:31,969
(Sun Bin brought chogochujang!)

1410
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:33,040
It's a baby.

1411
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,980
It looks so delicious.

1412
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:40,550
- Here's the appetizer, Hee Won.
- Hee Won.

1413
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,319
What's this?

1414
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,250
Squids are here

1415
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,350
Delicious and fresh

1416
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,060
- Stop eating.
- The intestines are still inside.

1417
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:53,890
We actually don't know how it tastes.

1418
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,030
Please try.

1419
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:59,070
(Hee Won takes a bite too.)

1420
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:00,529
It's surprisingly nice and soft.

1421
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:01,770
- It's good.
- Yes.

1422
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:05,139
(Na Ra dips it in chogochujang and takes a bite.)

1423
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,609
- I'll take the small one.
- Is it steamed well?

1424
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:08,979
- Yes. Try it.
- It's so good.

1425
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,480
It's so soft.

1426
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:13,110
(Exclaiming)

1427
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,550
(Sun Bin dips generously.)

1428
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:20,290
Your chogochujang is proving its worth.

1429
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:22,889
(Satisfied)

1430
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:24,260
- Have you all tried it?
- Yes.

1431
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:25,930
Stop eating now.

1432
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:28,100
You have a lot to eat. You need to eat nonstop.

1433
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,299
(Focus on the generous amount of the main dish.)

1434
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,570
It's fresh because it was caught this morning.

1435
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:33,400
The raw fish is so nice.

1436
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:35,240
This is for rice bowls.

1437
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,169
This is for rice bowls.

1438
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:39,069
- That's a lot.
- It is.

1439
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:40,340
It looks delicious.

1440
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,039
Heat it up a bit, and it'll be fine.

1441
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,350
- Like yangpun bibimbap.
- Like yangpun bibimbap.

1442
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,949
Slice some lettuce into big chunks.

1443
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:52,890
(Add some lettuce sliced into big chunks.)

1444
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:55,960
Dong Il, I'll add some chogochujang onto the raw fish rice bowl.

1445
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:57,989
Chogochujang? Sure.

1446
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:59,030
Okay.

1447
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,500
(One round of savory sesame oil first)

1448
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:06,470
(And the long-awaited chogochujang!)

1449
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,839
There's a lot of rice.

1450
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,710
(If there's a lot of rice, add more chogochujang!)

1451
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:17,709
(Sun Bin mixes chogochujang raw fish rice bowl...)

1452
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:21,320
(using her hand.)

1453
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,550
(Add as much sesame seeds as you like.)

1454
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:25,420
There's a bit too much rice.

1455
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:27,250
- Is there too much rice?
- Yes.

1456
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,259
- It's fine as long as it's tasty.
- It is tasty.

1457
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:31,230
Then, it's fine.

1458
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,359
(To check if it's really tasty, )

1459
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,700
(she keeps eating it.)

1460
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,260
Hey, stop eating.

1461
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,870
- You're not tasting, you're eating.
- No.

1462
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:42,540
(There are so many things to eat!)

1463
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:45,939
(Hokkaido salmon steak...)

1464
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:47,410
(which was freshly caught in the morning)

1465
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,439
I should stop steaming them.

1466
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,809
(Cypress-steamed scallop full of cypress fragrance)

1467
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:53,050
They finally opened.

1468
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,650
(Are the ones at the bottom cooked well too?)

1469
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,119
They're open.

1470
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,920
(Steamed giant clams and conch too)

1471
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:04,929
Scallops.

1472
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:06,390
(A plateful of assorted steamed shellfish)

1473
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,160
This is like a restaurant.

1474
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,000
Nice.

1475
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:13,130
- You must finish everything.
- I totally will.

1476
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,440
Let's sit.

1477
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,240
Let's sit.

1478
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:20,139
(A plentiful Hokkaido seafood meal)

1479
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:22,240
- For this, you told me...
- Yes.

1480
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,509
Not to eat other stuff.

1481
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:25,810
- You took them away.
- Exactly.

1482
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:27,350
Thank you for the food.

1483
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:29,049
- Eat up.
- I will.

1484
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,080
(Now, enjoy the food!)

1485
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,189
Shall I eat this in one bite first?

1486
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,450
(Starting with gunkan maki, made by Hee Won and Mi Ran)

1487
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:34,960
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1488
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:40,090
(Eating it at once)

1489
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,430
(Waiting for her feedback)

1490
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:43,900
(Satisfied)

1491
01:00:43,901 --> 01:00:45,070
(Clapping)

1492
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:47,130
Gosh, I feel relieved now.

1493
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:49,540
(That's really hard to make, you know.)

1494
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,010
- Let's try norimaki.
- Try it.

1495
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,980
(Sushi King relaxes and takes a bite.)

1496
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:58,410
(Amazed)

1497
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:02,950
(Na Ra takes a big bite too.)

1498
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:04,819
It's delicious.

1499
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,319
(The flavors of the ingredients fill up her mouth.)

1500
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,019
(Urchin roe, salmon roe, radish sprouts)

1501
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,620
(You can enjoy all of these at once as norimaki.)

1502
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:12,729
Try the salmon steak when it's still warm.

1503
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:14,530
(Try Hokkaido fresh salmon steak when it's still warm!)

1504
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:17,900
(Trying warm salmon steak)

1505
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:20,730
(Amazed)

1506
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:22,400
It smells strong.

1507
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,640
It doesn't smell fishy at all.

1508
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:26,140
Because it's fresh.

1509
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:28,539
The guy filleted it in front of my eyes.

1510
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:29,680
That's right.

1511
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,550
It was huge.

1512
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:34,479
Look at the color.

1513
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,680
(They bought it when it had the freshest color.)

1514
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:39,549
It's impossible to taste bad.

1515
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:41,720
(Freshly grilled salmon steak)

1516
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,360
- It's so soft.
- It's 100 dollars.

1517
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:51,570
It's not fishy. It's savory.

1518
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,599
- Scallop.
- Yes.

1519
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,770
(Next is cypress-steamed scallop!)

1520
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,070
It's huge.

1521
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,910
(One mouthful)

1522
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,850
The cypress fragrance smells so good.

1523
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,390
(The fragrant cypress smell fills their mouth.)

1524
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:13,650
(Na Ra separates the scallop from the shell.)

1525
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:16,190
(She dips it in chogochujang.)

1526
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:19,459
- I didn't know.
- Is that it?

1527
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,300
(Eating the whole scallop at once)

1528
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,060
It's so nice to dip it in chogochujang.

1529
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:26,299
(Na Ra loves chogochujang.)

1530
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,770
- It's spicy.
- I'm glad to hear that.

1531
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:29,769
- Is this a raw fish rice bowl?
- Raw fish rice bowl?

1532
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:31,310
- Raw fish bibimbap?
- Yes.

1533
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:35,309
(Rice bowl expert Chef Sung tries it first.)

1534
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:36,739
(Surprised)

1535
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,349
Raw fish rice bowl is really delicious.

1536
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:39,379
- It's delicious, right?
- Raw fish bibimbap.

1537
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,120
(Chogochujang raw fish rice bowl is really delicious!)

1538
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,120
(Hee Won takes a bite too.)

1539
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:48,160
- This is mixed well.
- It is.

1540
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,520
We always had it with soy sauce.

1541
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,359
For the first time in a while,

1542
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,660
- we're having it spicy.
- It's so nice.

1543
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,300
It's so good.

1544
01:02:58,330 --> 01:02:59,600
I'm so glad to hear that.

1545
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:03,700
This is so big that it became a plate.

1546
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,669
(The huge scallop shell became a plate.)

1547
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:08,840
You're right.

1548
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:13,550
(If you have an XXL sized scallop, which you can use as a plate, )

1549
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,749
The clam is as big as a man's fist.

1550
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,620
(there is a gigantic clam too.)

1551
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,389
(Impressed)

1552
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:22,220
- The soy sauce tastes really good.
- My gosh.

1553
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:25,030
I need to cut this.

1554
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:27,490
(It's too big to simply eat it!)

1555
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:29,729
Do you need a knife? Give me that. I'll cut it for you.

1556
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:30,730
(Dong Il stands up again.)

1557
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:33,029
I've never seen a clam that big.

1558
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:36,700
(He cuts it into bite-sized pieces.)

1559
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,309
Here you go.

1560
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:39,940
(Here's the cut clam.)

1561
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,079
- Na Ra.
- Do you want to come here?

1562
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,150
(Na Ra, you take the biggest piece.)

1563
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:46,650
- It's savory.
- Come here.

1564
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,690
(Savory)

1565
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,350
This is the tasty part.

1566
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:59,190
(This part is chewy, and you can bite it off.)

1567
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,960
This is tender.

1568
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:08,270
(The big northern clams have various textures.)

1569
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,169
I had a year's worth of seafood.

1570
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:12,510
(A year's worth of seafood consumed)

1571
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:14,170
I'm full.

1572
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:16,410
That's enough.

1573
01:04:16,411 --> 01:04:19,150
(The lunch that satisfied even Eating Expert is over!)

1574
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:20,809
- We need...
- Yes.

1575
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:23,149
To set off at 2pm...

1576
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,850
- to be there on time.
- Okay.

1577
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:29,460
You can't bring any food there.

1578
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:31,630
- Only water is allowed.
- That's right.

1579
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,889
"Wear comfortable clothes."

1580
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:36,400
"Avoid black clothes and perfume that insects like."

1581
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:38,000
There are a lot of insects.

1582
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:40,700
- The place we're going?
- Yes.

1583
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,869
They'll run away when they hear that sound?

1584
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:46,809
Bears hate the metallic sound.

1585
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:47,870
That's why I bought it.

1586
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:56,760
(Bears will appear?)

1587
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:02,460
(To the place where anything could appear)

1588
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,299
- That's the sea in front, right?
- Yes, it's the sea.

1589
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,870
- Where?
- We're going up to the peninsula.

1590
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,669
We're going to the beach.

1591
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:13,670
(They're heading to the far east of Hokkaido.)

1592
01:05:13,671 --> 01:05:14,710
That's where we're heading.

1593
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,910
There are a lot of mountains and lands.

1594
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:21,149
It's a huge land.

1595
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,050
(They'll enter the embrace of Mother Nature.)

1596
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,089
- Here in the middle.
- Yes.

1597
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,650
Park where there's a lot of space.

1598
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:30,160
- Hee Won.
- Yes.

1599
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:33,290
- I'm wearing the color of a bear.
- You are.

1600
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:34,730
- I'm worried.
- Yes.

1601
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,059
- Should I remove my top?
- They might come to you...

1602
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:37,329
thinking you're one of them.

1603
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:38,399
Should I remove my top?

1604
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,470
A lot of people are wearing short sleeves.

1605
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:44,540
(He spots him.)

1606
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,110
Hello.

1607
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:47,839
Hello, Mr. Sung, Mr. Kim.

1608
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,939
- Hello.
- He's the guide.

1609
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,609
- Hello.
- Hello.

1610
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:55,310
(Today's forest tour guide, Yoshida)

1611
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,720
Now, we'll go on a walk in the forest.

1612
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:04,020
(This place where they'll have a walk with the guide...)

1613
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:07,589
(On the far east of Hokkaido, )

1614
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:09,900
(if you go deeper inside...)

1615
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:14,170
(The area untouched by humans)

1616
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:22,440
(World Natural Heritage, Shiretoko National Park)

1617
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:30,220
(The 5 lakes capturing the blue sky)

1618
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:36,720
(The primary forest containing the breath of the ancient times)

1619
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:41,360
(We'll walk into the grand Mother Nature.)

1620
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,659
(This is the territory of wild animals, )

1621
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:48,769
(the owners of this place.)

1622
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:50,470
It's Mother Nature.

1623
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,870
- It might be here somewhere.
- It might be nearby.

1624
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,080
I won't be surprised to meet one here.

1625
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:01,249
- But bears are huge.
- They're huge.

1626
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,579
- I might freeze on the spot.
- Around 300kg?

1627
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:06,850
No, 200kg to 250kg, I think.

1628
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:09,890
(She is nervous too.)

1629
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:12,859
You'll have a pre-training...

1630
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:15,590
before we head to the forest.

1631
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,229
(We need a pre-training...)

1632
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:21,630
(when we're just going for a walk?)

1633
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,500
(They follow him for now.)

1634
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:26,239
It's like a field trip.

1635
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,039
(Bell ringing)

1636
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,210
- A field trip.
- A field trip?

1637
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,940
Mi Ran, does the sound stand out a lot?

1638
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:34,549
It's fine. It's pretty noisy.

1639
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,580
I'll walk gently.

1640
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:38,820
This must be the actual size.

1641
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:40,489
(The bear models made true to the actual size welcome them.)

1642
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,320
I don't even want to imagine it.

1643
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:46,859
- Okay.
- Please sit here.

1644
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:48,660
(They enter a bit nervously.)

1645
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:52,770
(A calendar suddenly appears?)

1646
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,099
(Marked on the calendar...)

1647
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,840
(are bears?)

1648
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,310
(Flinching)

1649
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:01,309
- The dates when bears were spotted.
- That month.

1650
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:02,340
(The calendar shows when bears were spotted in this month!)

1651
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,779
- What's that? Yesterday?
- It appeared yesterday.

1652
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,310
There was one yesterday.

1653
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:09,820
(A bear was spotted here just yesterday.)

1654
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:12,790
- Are we going that way?
- We're taking the first course.

1655
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,249
- The yellow course.
- It's...

1656
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,060
(Bears actually appear here!)

1657
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:20,090
(For safety, when a bear appears, all courses shut down.)

1658
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:21,459
(Replacing it with a video of a similar content)

1659
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:24,729
(Shiretoko National Park has one of the most outstanding views...)

1660
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:27,970
(even among World Natural Heritage.)

1661
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:32,810
(You could run into bears here.)

1662
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:36,479
(Big-sized bears are 2m tall, )

1663
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,540
My goodness.

1664
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,950
(and they weigh about 400kg.)

1665
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:45,079
(Also, they're fast runners, and they can run at 50km per hour.)

1666
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:48,020
They're so agile. They can climb trees well too.

1667
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:51,459
(So you can't run away from them by running.)

1668
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,890
(Running will aggravate the bear, which makes things more dangerous.)

1669
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:56,959
(Baby bears like to climb trees, so you must check up the trees too.)

1670
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,059
My goodness.

1671
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:02,500
(Baby bears like to climb trees, so you must check up the trees too.)

1672
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:05,600
I hope they only have baby bears like that.

1673
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,670
But there'll be mother bears around them.

1674
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:13,550
(A mother bear is definitely nearby a baby bear.)

1675
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,220
(You must be extremely careful.)

1676
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:20,950
(If you don't want to run into a bear, remember!)

1677
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:23,290
(In the areas like a dense forest where you don't have a clear view, )

1678
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:25,259
(make loud noises or clap...)

1679
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:28,560
(to let the bears know that there are people here.)

1680
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:31,860
(Like this!)

1681
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:36,240
(Don't forget to clap too!)

1682
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,099
(When you run into a bear...)

1683
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,169
(1. Do not run.)

1684
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:40,209
(2. Do not chat.)

1685
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:42,569
(3. Turn around and walk away slowly.)

1686
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:46,050
(Extremely important!)

1687
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:48,410
You need to walk back.

1688
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:52,020
(They keep in mind the precautions.)

1689
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:56,220
(Now, it's time to meet the real nature.)

1690
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,890
The course we'll walk today...

1691
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,160
(The course they'll walk today is 1.6km long.)

1692
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:06,170
This part from here...

1693
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:09,069
to the observatory...

1694
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:12,809
doesn't have an electric fence.

1695
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:15,269
So we might run into a bear.

1696
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:16,640
There's no fence?

1697
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:21,410
(There are two types of paths here.)

1698
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:25,150
(Surrounded by the fence with current flowing through it)

1699
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,360
(Wooden deck path which bears can't approach)

1700
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,120
(And the path that leads to that...)

1701
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:34,959
(is pure nature.)

1702
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,360
(There's no electric fence.)

1703
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:42,270
Keep in mind that you can run into a bear anytime.

1704
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:46,870
(So you must follow the guide's instruction well.)

1705
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,479
Form a line and follow me.

1706
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,939
You're the captain.

1707
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:53,410
(Stand in front.)

1708
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:54,650
(Sneezing)

1709
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,150
Captain.

1710
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:58,120
(He suddenly starts sneezing when he's told to stand in front.)

1711
01:10:58,250 --> 01:10:59,250
(Sneezing)

1712
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:01,889
I must be allergic to bears. I don't think I can go.

1713
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:02,920
(He senses danger and instinctively becomes allergic to bears.)

1714
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,690
It's important to make loud noises like that.

1715
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:07,190
(What?)

1716
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,190
You need to let the bears know that there are humans here.

1717
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,130
I see.

1718
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,270
(I have this too.)

1719
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:16,040
(He is heavily armed with all sorts of sounds.)

1720
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:20,710
(In the end, Dong Il with the bear bell stands in front.)

1721
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:22,640
Shall we go?

1722
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:24,809
Let's go.

1723
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:27,950
(They finally enter the primary forest.)

1724
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:32,580
(Feeling both nervous and expectant, )

1725
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,690
(they walk into the unknown nature.)

1726
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,429
When would I get a chance to experience this?

1727
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:44,200
(From here, it's complete wilderness without any humans.)

1728
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:46,169
That's very scary.

1729
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:49,300
A path which you wouldn't be surprised to meet a bear.

1730
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:53,470
The path is so narrow. You can't even turn back when you see a bear.

1731
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:58,910
(The path is narrower and rougher than they imagined.)

1732
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:00,279
Here...

1733
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:03,320
(To chase away the bear that could be anywhere, )

1734
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:07,490
(the family makes noise as they walk.)

1735
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:10,420
(Meanwhile, Captain Sung was walking in the front.)

1736
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,090
It's so nice to walk here.

1737
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,059
The air is so fresh.

1738
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:17,930
It is. It's refreshing.

1739
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:20,770
(Actually, )

1740
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,500
(if you put down the fear and look around, )

1741
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:28,840
(this is a natural trail full of the smell of flowers and grass.)

1742
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,939
It's been ages since I walked around a place like this.

1743
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,380
Right. It's really nice, isn't it?

1744
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:35,850
This is wilderness.

1745
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,680
We never get a chance to walk these days, you know.

1746
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:41,389
(Clapping)

1747
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:42,549
(They shouldn't lower their guard because of the beautiful scenery.)

1748
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:45,360
(Laughing)

1749
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:47,729
When the guide claps, we should clap too.

1750
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:48,730
Okay.

1751
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:49,900
(They will clap when the guide claps.)

1752
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:51,730
Papa.

1753
01:12:51,731 --> 01:12:53,329
(The land of wilderness makes them stay alert.)

1754
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:55,300
I feel like it might actually come out.

1755
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:56,439
Hey!

1756
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,870
(She gets nervous again.)

1757
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,910
(After walking and clapping for a while...)

1758
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,079
It's a lush forest.

1759
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,380
(They enter a lush forest.)

1760
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,319
This place is... Goodness.

1761
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,520
(This forest with a mysterious atmosphere is...)

1762
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:18,020
This is the forest untouched by humans.

1763
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:23,130
(Primeval forest)

1764
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:26,430
(Its untouched, primordial beauty...)

1765
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:29,940
(draws every gaze.)

1766
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:34,010
(And there is...)

1767
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,379
- Those are the claw marks.
- Claw marks.

1768
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:38,739
- There.
- It's up there too.

1769
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:41,110
It's all the way there too.

1770
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:51,620
- Bear claw marks.
- Bear.

1771
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,889
Yes.

1772
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:55,330
(There are bear claw marks all around the tree.)

1773
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:57,529
- Goodness.
- There are some up there too.

1774
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:58,600
Right.

1775
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:00,800
The bear went all the way up there.

1776
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:03,940
Why do you think the bear went up the tree?

1777
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,710
(Suddenly, he gives a quiz about bear.)

1778
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:11,679
- To eat berries?
- To eat something up there?

1779
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,410
- To eat something.
- To eat something.

1780
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:17,020
Correct. There must've been some food up there.

1781
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,350
What was this food then?

1782
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,290
Pine cones? Bees?

1783
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:22,919
(Of course not.)

1784
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,960
Squirrel.

1785
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,830
- No.
- Squirrel.

1786
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,330
It's a small fruit.

1787
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:31,129
- Fruit.
- Fruit.

1788
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:32,759
- It hangs on a vine like this.
- Where could this fruit be?

1789
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,800
(It hangs on a vine like this.)

1790
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:37,240
Kiwi?

1791
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:39,939
(I see.)

1792
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:41,639
Mi Ran is a Bear Woman.

1793
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,879
Kiwi hangs on a vine like that.

1794
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,710
Mi Ran was a Bear Woman.

1795
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:50,250
(Aren't bears carnivores, though?)

1796
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:54,550
What do you think the Hokkaido bears feed on?

1797
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:56,720
- What do they eat in spring?
- Spring?

1798
01:14:57,690 --> 01:14:59,759
Salmon?

1799
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,729
(Salmon?)

1800
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:02,890
That's for the autumn.

1801
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,599
- Spring.
- Spring.

1802
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,160
Spring, you are supposed to eat spring greens.

1803
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,730
- Spring greens are tasty.
- They are seasonal.

1804
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:13,770
(Dong Il's answer is spring greens.)

1805
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:14,940
(Why is spring greens the right answer?)

1806
01:15:14,941 --> 01:15:17,210
- You are right.
- Right. Spring greens.

1807
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:18,540
Really?

1808
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:21,079
(It's true.)

1809
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,549
(Munching)

1810
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:24,580
What do you think of me?

1811
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:29,450
They eat the wild greens in the forest.

1812
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,860
- Right. Sprouts.
- Right.

1813
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:34,960
- That's the seasonal delicacy.
- They eat the sprouts.

1814
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:38,030
I guess they would eat some fruits in summer.

1815
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:39,330
- Fruits?
- Fruits?

1816
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:43,199
In summer, they eat bugs.

1817
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,200
Bugs?

1818
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,239
- Bugs?
- They eat all sorts of things.

1819
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,039
- Bugs.
- Like maggots.

1820
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,909
They eat ants, bee larvae, and cicada larvae.

1821
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:55,480
I guess they eat the ants from the anthill.

1822
01:15:56,850 --> 01:16:00,250
(In this forest, you can see some trees that are hollow inside.)

1823
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:04,819
(It's the trace of a bear...)

1824
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:07,160
(neatly ripping into a rotted tree for ants.)

1825
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,430
It eats all sorts of things then.

1826
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,969
In autumn, bears eat acorns, walnuts,

1827
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:16,200
and fruits.

1828
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:19,970
(They eat a lot in the autumn and sleeps in the winter.)

1829
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:23,779
A bear would never hunt a living deer and eat it.

1830
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:24,810
It rarely happens.

1831
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,280
We were completely mistaken.

1832
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:31,280
You can't pretend to be dead then.

1833
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:35,320
If you pretend to be dead, it will eat you.

1834
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,490
Exactly.

1835
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:42,260
We all learned it the wrong way.

1836
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:45,229
Are we supposed to turn back and just go our way?

1837
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:46,330
(What should you do when you run into a bear?)

1838
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:49,269
(You should walk backwards slowly!)

1839
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:52,040
But it hurts my ego to walk backwards.

1840
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:53,970
Like this?

1841
01:16:53,971 --> 01:16:57,439
Bears don't attack suddenly.

1842
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,080
I've run into thousands of bears, but I was never attacked once.

1843
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,419
Their traits can differ depending on their habitat.

1844
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,920
If you don't provoke it...

1845
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,720
As long as you don't provoke it, you are fine.

1846
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:11,489
So bears don't attack people.

1847
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:14,659
But that might only apply to the bears here.

1848
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:15,690
The bears from another region might be different.

1849
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,460
(When they walk for a while, they arrive at...)

1850
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,100
You can see the big leaves here.

1851
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:26,710
There are many of those here, and that's what the bears eat.

1852
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,909
- This is what the bears eat.
- This is what the bears eat.

1853
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:31,340
(These are the leaves the bears eat?)

1854
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:32,709
These leaves.

1855
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:36,819
It's got the root vegetable that is similar to a potato.

1856
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:39,619
- The mucus.
- It eats the root.

1857
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:41,690
It digs it up and eats the root.

1858
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:45,260
(After checking what the bears eat, they feel a lot better.)

1859
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,059
(But they are still scared.)

1860
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:52,130
We clap well even when we're not told to.

1861
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,969
(Peeking)

1862
01:17:56,970 --> 01:17:58,700
Look at the tree that fell a long time ago.

1863
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:01,539
It snapped.

1864
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:02,940
A broken tree. Yes.

1865
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:05,539
I feel like a spirit would come out, not a bear.

1866
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:07,150
(A broken old tree in the primeval forest)

1867
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:10,679
- A bear did that?
- No. By strong wind.

1868
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,749
Wind. The wind must've been super strong to break that.

1869
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:15,050
So it wasn't hit by lightning.

1870
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,319
There's a very important meaning to a breaking tree.

1871
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,090
It’s the forest going through its natural renewal process.

1872
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,800
When it snaps,

1873
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:27,969
the shadow is removed, and the trees below grow.

1874
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:31,440
(The old trees nourish the new. It's nature’s cycle at work.)

1875
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:34,010
This is the same in human life.

1876
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:39,240
If the older generation doesn't collapse,

1877
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,280
the younger generation can't grow.

1878
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,650
(Looking)

1879
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,949
(Their eyes naturally gather at someone.)

1880
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:50,460
- Come down from your place.
- Gosh, it makes me sad.

1881
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:51,819
You should come down.

1882
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:52,820
(The human old tree is sad.)

1883
01:18:52,821 --> 01:18:55,729
Ask him what you have to do if the old tree doesn't break.

1884
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:56,760
Then we have to break it.

1885
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,970
The younger generation won't be able to grow,

1886
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:02,300
and the forest will be ruined.

1887
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,599
(The younger generation is touched.)

1888
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:07,039
So you should go on your own will.

1889
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,069
- Right.
- Us?

1890
01:19:08,070 --> 01:19:10,280
You think you won't break like that?

1891
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:13,040
(They have fun teasing Dong Il.)

1892
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:14,909
I've never felt so sad looking at a tree...

1893
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:16,820
broken by the wind.

1894
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,650
Why don't you take a photo of it and make it your profile photo?

1895
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:24,760
- Hey, you should go now.
- Go there.

1896
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,889
It would make a nice profile photo.

1897
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:30,060
That would be nice.

1898
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:33,700
I think I smell the bear poop.

1899
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:35,770
- Bear poop?
- Bear poop?

1900
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:37,870
I think it might be somewhere around here.

1901
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:39,840
- Around here, right?
- It just feels like it.

1902
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:41,910
I feel like it would be nearby.

1903
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,510
(Dong Il was leading them.)

1904
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:49,010
- What's this sound?
- What?

1905
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:51,619
(Is something there?)

1906
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,050
- This?
- The left side?

1907
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:57,170
(The family points at something.)

1908
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:58,929
It's a bear.

1909
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:00,370
(Is it really bear?)

1910
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:04,940
- It's deer.
- Over there.

1911
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:06,640
It saw us.

1912
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:09,680
Deer.

1913
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,910
(It's me, deer.)

1914
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,080
(Surprised)

1915
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:17,819
(They speak quietly so the deer won't run away.)

1916
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:19,049
There are two of them.

1917
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,589
- It's a baby.
- It's a baby.

1918
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:22,460
They are Sika deer, mother and baby.

1919
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:24,260
Mother and baby.

1920
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:32,270
The baby on the right side was born in June.

1921
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:35,470
(I am 2 months old.)

1922
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,839
It's only two months old,

1923
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,170
- but it's still quite big.
- It's still very young.

1924
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:44,950
When he sees these animals,

1925
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:46,880
does he recognize them all?

1926
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:49,319
I can tell by their sizes.

1927
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,949
(He can't recognize their faces.)

1928
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:52,749
(When he sees their size, he can estimate their age.)

1929
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,360
He just estimates how old it is.

1930
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:56,759
It's looking at us.

1931
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,330
It must know that we're talking about it.

1932
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:01,460
(It rubs its cheek on the tree bark.)

1933
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:05,430
(What are you looking at?)

1934
01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:08,900
(Then it does its own thing again.)

1935
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:11,610
They are not scared. They know people are not here to hurt them.

1936
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:18,150
(This is our territory.)

1937
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:19,950
So pretty.

1938
01:21:19,951 --> 01:21:22,450
(They've seen deer several times in Hokkaido.)

1939
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:25,190
It came all the way here.

1940
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,859
- Goodness.
- There are 260 of them.

1941
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:29,620
- There are 260 of them.
- The tail is very short.

1942
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,029
It's just fur. There isn't much tail.

1943
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:34,700
- It's mostly fur.
- It's so cute.

1944
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,699
That's not everything.

1945
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:37,999
(This meeting feels more special.)

1946
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,529
There's a very short tail, and there's fur around it.

1947
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:40,570
I know.

1948
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:45,310
(The deer mother and daughter slowly disappear.)

1949
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:47,980
They disappeared as soon as we heard about them.

1950
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:51,480
(He's sorry.)

1951
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:54,149
(Feeling sorry, they keep looking around.)

1952
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:55,350
There's something else here.

1953
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:58,850
A tree grows here.

1954
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:03,290
A new tree is growing on top of a broken tree.

1955
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,460
- Moss.
- No, there's a tree growing.

1956
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:09,999
(It's another broken old tree.)

1957
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,599
- Where?
- A tree is growing on top.

1958
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,169
(There's moss on top of it.)

1959
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:15,070
It's growing from a dead tree?

1960
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,469
There.

1961
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:18,470
(A new life grew on the old tree.)

1962
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:20,639
The broken tree became the base...

1963
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,840
for the new tree to grow on.

1964
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,680
Is he talking about old people again?

1965
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:31,020
I told you he was going to talk about that.

1966
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:34,760
Why don't you lie down now?

1967
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:36,289
Please lie next to it.

1968
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:37,760
I should lie down there?

1969
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:40,800
This is nature's way.

1970
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:43,030
(He joins them and teases too.)

1971
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,630
- This is life.
- This is life.

1972
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:50,300
He keeps saying an old tree must fall.

1973
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:52,009
He's right.

1974
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:53,270
(Dong Il happened to find another old tree.)

1975
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:55,940
This is a very meaningful walk.

1976
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:58,450
- We're learning about life.
- Right. We're learning about life.

1977
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,449
We are getting life lessons.

1978
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:02,880
(They are learning life in the forest.)

1979
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:07,050
(After thoroughly looking at the primeval forest...)

1980
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:10,060
It's a lake observatory.

1981
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:12,160
(They spot the lake observatory.)

1982
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:15,400
It's so pretty.

1983
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:18,230
(At the end of the forest path...)

1984
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:22,170
The reflection of the mountain is so beautiful.

1985
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:29,479
(There are five lakes in the Shiretoko National Park.)

1986
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,750
(Lake 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

1987
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:35,980
(And they arrived at Lake 2.)

1988
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:37,919
(The ridgeline on the water creates...)

1989
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,690
(a mirror-like reflection.)

1990
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:44,790
(This lake is known as the most beautiful one among the 5.)

1991
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:46,760
- It's really like a mirror.
- Right?

1992
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:49,600
It's so pretty.

1993
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,999
- So pretty.
- The reflection...

1994
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,400
The reflection of the mountain is so beautiful.

1995
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,999
There are water striders.

1996
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,639
It means the water is clear.

1997
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,010
(While everyone else is enjoying the scenery...)

1998
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,210
Like we're on a honeymoon.

1999
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:05,449
(Sweet)

2000
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:06,609
(Sweet)

2001
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:09,250
(They pretend to be newlyweds.)

2002
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:10,789
(We are on our honeymoon.)

2003
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:12,550
- The sky is beautiful.
- I know.

2004
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:16,860
It's so lovely. Look at the sunshine.

2005
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:19,189
So pretty.

2006
01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:20,559
- The sunshine is pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

2007
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,200
The sunshine hitting the floor.

2008
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:26,270
(Photosynthesizing!)

2009
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:29,200
(They truly enjoy the primeval forest.)

2010
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:30,810
Are you scared of bears?

2011
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:32,870
- Bears?
- Bears?

2012
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:35,280
Or do you want to see the bears now?

2013
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:37,810
- No.
- I want to see them.

2014
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:39,080
From a distance.

2015
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,880
When was the time you saw them the closest?

2016
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,420
- It was this close.
- This distance.

2017
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:47,789
How long ago was that?

2018
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:48,889
(When did you see the bear so closely?)

2019
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:50,930
It was about ten years ago.

2020
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:53,159
- Ten years ago.
- I see.

2021
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,129
The bears in this area live here permanently.

2022
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:58,169
They must recognize each other by now.

2023
01:24:58,170 --> 01:25:00,030
- They are acquainted. Hi.
- They are acquainted.

2024
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:03,439
- I recognize them.
- See?

2025
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,640
Their fur colors are all different.

2026
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:08,080
But don't the bears recognize him too?

2027
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:09,480
Do they?

2028
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:10,810
They might.

2029
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,550
See? I knew it.

2030
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:14,780
Okay.

2031
01:25:14,781 --> 01:25:17,550
(Proud)

2032
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:21,360
(When they walk further...)

2033
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,160
This must be the observatory.

2034
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:27,300
(The deck is raised high.)

2035
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:29,860
It's to prevent the bears from climbing up.

2036
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:33,600
(The door is tightly sealed.)

2037
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:36,070
Here are the electric wires.

2038
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,769
- Electric guidelines.
- Yes.

2039
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,440
- I mean the safe lines.
- That's right.

2040
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:42,680
Above here is the safe area.

2041
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,609
(Relieved)

2042
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:46,749
There are electric wires.

2043
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,279
Is it to prevent the bears from climbing up?

2044
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,450
They will climb up otherwise.

2045
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:52,850
From now on, you are lucky if bears show up.

2046
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:55,019
You get to watch them safely.

2047
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:56,360
It's safe.

2048
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,590
Let's enter the safe path now.

2049
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,400
(They go through the iron gate...)

2050
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:03,229
(and go to the 2nd floor.)

2051
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:05,070
From this point on, it's very safe.

2052
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:09,600
(They enter the safe area.)

2053
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:13,869
(And before everyone's eyes...)

2054
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:14,940
This is it.

2055
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,350
It's beautiful.

2056
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:27,790
(Breathtaking scenery)

2057
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:33,330
(You can walk along the trail that traverses the wild field...)

2058
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:39,400
(and admire at the beauty of Shiretoko with your eyes.)

2059
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Pose.

2060
01:26:42,001 --> 01:26:44,970
(Feeling sad about the passing time, they take photos.)

2061
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:46,970
Pose.

2062
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:50,679
(We didn't run into bears.)

2063
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,910
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

2064
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:57,789
Is the horizon up there?

2065
01:26:57,790 --> 01:26:59,520
Yes, the horizon is up there.

2066
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:01,559
It's above the land.

2067
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,759
(The scenery is more beautiful because they are together.)

2068
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,290
Look at the reflection on the water.

2069
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:06,629
The reflection of the sun.

2070
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:08,059
(Which Hokkaido spot will the family enjoy next?)

2071
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,400
- It's pretty.
- It's vast.

2072
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:15,100
(House on Wheels is in need of positivity.)

2073
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,040
(The queen of positivity, Seolhyun appears.)

2074
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,470
(Positive energy to the max)

2075
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,410
(I found the clover with five leaves.)

2076
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:23,939
(Thanks to her overflowing positivity and luck...)

2077
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:25,110
(Where?)

2078
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:28,350
(They find this on the road!)

2079
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:31,820
(This is the power of positivity.)

2080
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,360
(However...)

2081
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:39,390
(A creeping fear of the unknown)

2082
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:41,229
(There!)

2083
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:42,430
(Gosh!)

2084
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:44,100
(In a hair-trigger situation, )

2085
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,940
(they see the wild side of Hokkaido for the first time.)

2086
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:49,470
(Screaming)

2087
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,309
(What does the real wild look like, )

2088
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:54,479
(where screams and terror erupt?)

2089
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,780
(Wait.)

2090
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:58,110
Korean fried rice.

2091
01:27:58,410 --> 01:28:00,380
(I will give you one bowl of it.)

2092
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,180
(They make the most special connections too.)

2093
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:05,089
(Between positivity and crisis, )

2094
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:06,650
(what will be the fate of House on Wheels?)

2095
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:12,590
(Sung Dong Il)

2096
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,900
(Kim Hee Won, Jang Na Ra)

2097
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:22,840
(House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean)
