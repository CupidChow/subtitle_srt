1
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,420
(The morning sun rises in Furano and Biei.)

2
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:45,502
(A gentle morning breeze blows by our house.)

3
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:52,372
(Dong Il woke up at 5am as usual.)

4
00:00:52,372 --> 00:00:54,812
(Yesterday, he woke up at 3am.)

5
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:57,812
(He starts the day with a walk.)

6
00:00:57,837 --> 00:00:59,373
The wind is pushing me forward.

7
00:01:00,782 --> 00:01:05,192
(It's still the middle of the night in House on Wheels.)

8
00:01:05,492 --> 00:01:08,362
(Squirming)

9
00:01:17,932 --> 00:01:20,172
(Drowsy)

10
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:24,072
(Stepping over)

11
00:01:25,572 --> 00:01:30,712
(He stretches his leg as much as possible not to step on Hee Won.)

12
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:35,122
(Careful)

13
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:37,663
Dong Il.

14
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:45,432
(Jun Han quickly came out to take a walk with Dong Il.)

15
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,490
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, I did.

16
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,920
Do you like walking?

17
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,760
Walking? I do.

18
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,990
It's nice to walk in the morning wherever you go.

19
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,530
This place is quite high.

20
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,470
- Yes, the area is very mountainous.
- The height.

21
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,919
This place is high too.

22
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,310
How beautiful.

23
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,340
(Over the ridge before us...)

24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,620
(is a mountain covered in snow even in the middle of summer.)

25
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,360
(Below are hills with patchworks of green.)

26
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,360
- This is nice.
- It's so nice.

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,013
Yes.

28
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,700
It's not a job you have a license for or something.

29
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,760
Right?

30
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,170
(Gently pushing him away from the road)

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,810
(Jun Han is so considerate of Dong Il.)

32
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:42,898
Hey.

33
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,040
You're not married, right?

34
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,480
Right.

35
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,850
Before, it felt so far away.

36
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,420
I didn't understand why she kept asking me about it.

37
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,142
Right.

38
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,290
Maybe that worked.

39
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,090
I started to think about it.

40
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,900
"What will happen if I get married?"

41
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:08,970
It's fun. It's nice.

42
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,940
We fight too, but there are more good things.

43
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,410
My mom will be happy...

44
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,240
that you're talking to me about marriage.

45
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,250
(I think my mom will be happy.)

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,620
This morning...

47
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,850
feels nicer...

48
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,460
with you walking with me.

49
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,332
Goodness.

50
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,390
What a nice morning.

51
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,190
- I'm enjoying it even more.
- Really?

52
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,670
- I think Seung Hyun will be sad.
- Why?

53
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,200
About missing out on this morning walk.

54
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,000
(Gently laughing)

55
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,010
(Seung Hyun woke up.)

56
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,320
(He's reading?)

57
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,650
(The first guest on House on Wheels to read in the morning)

58
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,930
(Seung Hyun's book recommendation is "Essays" by Montaigne?)

59
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,900
(Enjoying a relaxing morning with a book)

60
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,430
(Our front yard became a library in nature.)

61
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,740
(Dozing off)

62
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,440
Oh, gosh.

63
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,580
What was that?

64
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,150
Who was that?

65
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,620
(Confused)

66
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,190
(Pole 1)

67
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,620
(Pole 2)

68
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,960
(Pole 3?)

69
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,090
(Where did this pole come from?)

70
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,160
What is this?

71
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,330
(The middle pole fell down because of the wind.)

72
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,000
What is this? What should I do?

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,540
(What should I do?)

74
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,010
Nothing seems off.

75
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,640
(Unaware of this, Seung Hyun chooses to...)

76
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,610
I'll just leave it here.

77
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,750
(Quietly walking over)

78
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,820
(Hiding it)

79
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,120
(Relieved)

80
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,990
(The members return, completely unaware.)

81
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,990
- That was a great walk.
- Perfect.

82
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,430
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

83
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,730
- Did you rest well?
- Good morning.

84
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,640
- Na Ra.
- Good morning.

85
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,340
- Did you have a nice walk?
- Yes.

86
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,610
Right. You look healthy today.

87
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,980
- Nice.
- Nice.

88
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,680
Yes.

89
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,250
I left early in the morning and went on a walk with Jun Han.

90
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,320
I think we walked for about two hours.

91
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,250
- That was a long walk.
- Yes.

92
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,890
- I need to do my skincare.
- What is this?

93
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,290
This is melasma cream.

94
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,460
I get these in the protruding areas of my face.

95
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,560
- I do too.
- So I need to use this.

96
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,300
I like exercising outside.

97
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,570
- I'll apply it like this.
- Yes.

98
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,510
Apply it like that and tap it in. Skincare is important.

99
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,810
- We need to take care of our skin.
- Of course.

100
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,580
(Hee Won also woke up after a good night's sleep.)

101
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,690
Please wear brighter colors in the morning. You're like a crow.

102
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,290
Leave him to clip his nails. He doesn't appreciate bread.

103
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,360
- Let's go to the bakery.
- Okay.

104
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,790
(A bakery?)

105
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,130
You didn't look carefully, right?

106
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,700
- This is a cafe.
- You're right.

107
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,470
- I see.
- Awesome..

108
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,770
(In our front yard,)

109
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,110
(there's a reception office for the campsite.)

110
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,510
Oh, it's a bakery.

111
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,910
- It says, "Camp and Bakery." - "Yuyu."

112
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,950
Shall we go in?

113
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,280
- "Homemade organic..." - Excuse us.

114
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,050
- Hi.
- Hi.

115
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,990
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

116
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:49,246
Oh, the smell.

117
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,667
(A cozy, cute neighborhood bakery)

118
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,660
Oh, salted butter rolls. These are famous.

119
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,960
(Oh, my)

120
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,270
(The bread is here!)

121
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,070
- Here. Have a smell.
- I'll do it.

122
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,400
(Na Ra, the bread lover, grabs it right away.)

123
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,140
- The butter...
- They're freshly baked!

124
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,670
- Yes. Freshly baked, right?
- Yes.

125
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,340
(Their signature item)

126
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,980
(Salted butter rolls with that rich, buttery aroma!)

127
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,790
- It's amazing.
- Thank you.

128
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,890
- Isn't this so nice?
- Oh, my.

129
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,960
(Everyone is impressed by the smell of the bread.)

130
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,360
Well...

131
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,560
- "Ado." - Pardon?

132
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,670
The bread. "Ado," please.

133
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,270
- After?
- Yes, after.

134
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,900
- Can we...
- Can we buy all of this?

135
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,040
(He carefully mulls over what Dong Il said.)

136
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Yes, after.

137
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,440
- Can we...
- Can we buy all of this?

138
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,280
- All of it?
- Yes.

139
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,740
- Yes, all of it.
- All of it.

140
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,950
- All of it.
- All of it, yes.

141
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,050
- Is that okay?
- Is that okay?

142
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,920
- Yes.
- Thank you.

143
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,090
- The wallet!
- The wallet.

144
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,760
We can only use cash here...

145
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,920
Can we pay later?

146
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,690
- Present.
- Oh, is it free?

147
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,760
(This is free. It's your breakfast!)

148
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,530
- Is it free?
- Present.

149
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,560
Present?

150
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,940
(The breakfast bread is free for those staying at the site.)

151
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,370
Present? Oh, it's a present.

152
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,610
Thank you.

153
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,540
Tell Na Ra to pay. Let's see her reaction.

154
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,240
Let's tell Na Ra we have to pay for it.

155
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,310
- Let's go for now.
- Let's go to Na Ra.

156
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,180
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

157
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,420
- This is warm.
- Let's have Na Ra pay.

158
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,620
- Tell Na Ra to pay.
- You can go pay.

159
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,720
Got it.

160
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,890
Present.

161
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,060
(It's free breakfast!)

162
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,160
It's your breakfast.

163
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,400
- Thank you.
- It's your breakfast.

164
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,130
(What a happy surprise!)

165
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,500
Oh, they really serve it for breakfast here.

166
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,270
- What a nice campsite.
- What a nice campsite.

167
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,470
- It can't get better than this.
- We have coffee too.

168
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,910
- With coffee...
- This place is special.

169
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,680
For those two...

170
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,350
Do you have lemonade?

171
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,520
We have lemonade.

172
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,320
Do you have warm lemonade too?

173
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,820
- Warm?
- We can do warm lemonade.

174
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,890
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

175
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,020
- It's like...
- Oh, it's lemon tea.

176
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,730
- It's lemon tea.
- Lemon tea. I see.

177
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,760
- One warm lemonade, - One.

178
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,930
- please.
- Of course.

179
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,170
(They could ordered quickly thanks to Jun Han.)

180
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,670
If they hear about this, they might not let you leave.

181
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,070
(The perfect talent for House on Wheels)

182
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,740
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

183
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,510
(Let's hurry before the bread gets cold!)

184
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Thank you.

185
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,350
The coffee and tea are here.

186
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,350
(Their signature item, salted butter rolls)

187
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,120
(How do these freshly-baked salted butter rolls taste?)

188
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,690
Let's give it a taste.

189
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,030
(Crunch)

190
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,330
It's nice and warm.

191
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,700
(Smiling)

192
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,570
- This is the...
- This is so delicious.

193
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,480
(Our bread lover is very serious right now.)

194
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,810
Aren't you a bread expert, Na Ra?

195
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,850
Yes, she likes bread.

196
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,850
You bake cookies and bread, right?

197
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,060
(These are all of the fruits of our bread lover's ambitions.)

198
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,990
(She even gives out baked goods to her fans as gifts!)

199
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,830
I made this at home.

200
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,860
This is so delicious.

201
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,700
- It's so delicious.
- It tastes healthy, right?

202
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,370
(Our bread lover picks the chocolate bread!)

203
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,410
(Pulling a piece off)

204
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,010
- Oh, my.
- Isn't it nice and warm?

205
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,580
Yes, they're freshly baked.

206
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,080
(What does the bread lover think?)

207
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,520
(Her mouth fills with sweet chocolate and rich butter!)

208
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,290
(Blissful)

209
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,930
- It's tastier than hotel bread.
- It's so delicious.

210
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,930
Right?

211
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,500
The bread here is warm and tasty.

212
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,570
- So delicious.
- Yes.

213
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,570
(Warm and tasty bread is extra delicious.)

214
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,970
How did you learn Japanese?

215
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,970
- When he did music.
- When I used to do music,

216
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,910
I had a chance to release...

217
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,180
an album in Japan.

218
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,350
I watched Japanese variety shows...

219
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,350
- You watched a lot of those?
- for about two years.

220
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,920
I watched at least five hours every day.

221
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,060
- It wasn't hard.
- You must be good at Japanese.

222
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,790
- Just a little.
- That's what we've been saying.

223
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,460
- Where were you?
- He talked a lot over there.

224
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,060
Hey, crow. Join us, will you?

225
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,540
(Where will they go today with the crow?)

226
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,510
Before the tourists start coming,

227
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,380
- let's go see some flowers...
- The flower field?

228
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,750
People usually come here for that flower field.

229
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,080
All tourists do.

230
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,180
(The town we're in...)

231
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,890
(Biei, Furano, Sapporo)

232
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,860
(Furano and Biei, the center of Hokkaido)

233
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,430
(Furano and Biei represent the summer of Hokkaido.)

234
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:05,000
(There are endless flower fields full of color...)

235
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,440
(and a lake and waterfall with magical colors.)

236
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:20,080
(There are also patchwork hills that look like quilts...)

237
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,460
(and cows peacefully grazing on the hills.)

238
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,160
What did you want to eat most while being here?

239
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,600
There must be something specific you want to do or eat.

240
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,800
Just one thing. We can't do everything.

241
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,670
I heard the soft ice cream was great.

242
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,540
Soba sounds nice.

243
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,110
There's also soup curry...

244
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,680
You guys thought about it a lot.

245
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,210
- I heard it was tasty.
- Soup curry.

246
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,280
Soup curry.

247
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,750
(We're headed to live out our Hokkaido summer dreams.)

248
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,250
Here we go.

249
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,165
- Here we go.
- Oh, my.

250
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,860
(Where is their first dream destination of the day?)

251
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,890
(Our House)

252
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,400
(Shikisai-no-oka, that's near our house)

253
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,230
It's lavender season right now, isn't it?

254
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,770
From what I know, it's a lavender field.

255
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,770
I see.

256
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,840
(The lavender they've heard of is...)

257
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,980
It's lavender that has a nice scent, right?

258
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,750
Lavender softener.

259
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,220
Right? Many softeners are lavender-scented.

260
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,180
These kids have gone to too many supermarkets.

261
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,490
(The lavender field in our imagination...)

262
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,090
(A place with good vibes)

263
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,460
(Something like this?)

264
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,160
(What kind of fairy tale-like scenery will they see?)

265
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,630
(While they're slowly getting excited)

266
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,470
(The current scenery before them...)

267
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,670
(is very cloudy.)

268
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,880
(Getting windier than when they left)

269
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,250
(It's practically a gale.)

270
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,390
Under this weather, I bet all the flowers have fallen.

271
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,160
I looked it up just now.

272
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,430
The peak is at the end of July.

273
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,460
The peak is at the end of July?

274
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,300
End of July to the start of August.

275
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,100
The first two weeks of August.

276
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,600
But it's currently... Doesn't that mean there are no flowers?

277
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,940
The species are different.

278
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,170
Something must have bloomed, right?

279
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,410
There must be some greenery at least.

280
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,640
That's the charm of a trip.

281
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,050
"The flowers are all gone."

282
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,420
(What will they be able to see?)

283
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,160
I heard this place is a famous tourist spot.

284
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,330
That's right. People come from Sapporo to see this. I'm serious.

285
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,460
Goodness, look at all these cars.

286
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,460
- Gosh.
- So many cars.

287
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,070
See all those buses?

288
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,940
A lot of people have come even in this weather.

289
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,770
(Tourist buses lined up,)

290
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,480
(with groups of tourists getting off one after another.)

291
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,110
(Follow me!)

292
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,080
(Even the parking lot is almost full.)

293
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,350
There's one over there.

294
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,420
(Thanks to getting an early start)

295
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,020
Some spots are still empty.

296
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,760
It's that over there. Look.

297
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,490
I know, right? I thought it would be empty.

298
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,620
Great job.

299
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,630
Dong Il, I guess we have to drive around.

300
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,300
- What a cute car.
- Oh, my.

301
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,330
How about we rent a car?

302
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,030
(The car that caught Hee Won's attention...)

303
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,470
(is the mini cart.)

304
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,340
(You can enjoy every corner of the flower garden.)

305
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,710
You want to rent a car?

306
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,810
Come on, we're here to walk around.

307
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,550
You didn't even walk in the morning.

308
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,980
We all went on a walk.

309
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,750
- Can't I rent one?
- No.

310
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,490
Are you so forceful about everything, Dong Il?

311
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,530
(Laughing)

312
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,030
(Passing through the entrance while bickering)

313
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,730
The tickets. Let's go line up.

314
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,730
(Tickets must be bought from a machine.)

315
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,270
- Try it. It's cash-only.
- First of...

316
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,300
- Right.
- Here.

317
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,940
(Rummaging)

318
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,070
(Laughing)

319
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,510
Are you in charge of the wallet?

320
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,110
I'm in charge of ordering and paying.

321
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,910
I collect the receipts, you know?

322
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,880
This one right here.

323
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,220
(As Na Ra showed off)

324
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,120
Ask for the receipt.

325
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
(While getting the receipt)

326
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,660
Jun Han has studied Japanese.

327
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,660
That's right.

328
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,230
I don't think the cart is a bad idea, but do you want to walk?

329
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,630
- Let's walk.
- Okay.

330
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,930
- Stop it.
- Behind you, Hee Won's face...

331
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,470
is getting gloomy. "Let's rent the cart."

332
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,940
- "Let's walk." - Hee Won.

333
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,910
Are you going to rent one alone when we're going to walk?

334
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,040
(Like a son getting scolded by his dad)

335
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,710
- With you...
- No, I'm going to walk.

336
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,780
See this? You try it.

337
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,610
What?

338
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:49,390
(Hee Won is struggling.)

339
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,590
I can't walk.

340
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,120
Really, you're driving me crazy.

341
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,660
- Why?
- Seriously.

342
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,260
- Here's the receipt.
- I'll take it.

343
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,500
(Na Ra and Jun Han got their tickets.)

344
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,260
- All set. Five tickets.
- Let's go.

345
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,570
(Looking forward to the fairy tale-like lavender garden)

346
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,140
(They finally enter.)

347
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,280
(Where are the lavenders?)

348
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,850
- What are lavenders?
- Those are...

349
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,850
Aren't those lavender?

350
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,520
You're right, those are lavender.

351
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
(Those?)

352
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,160
(Did they spot them right away?)

353
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,460
- You're still alive, lavender.
- Ms. Lavender.

354
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,960
(However...)

355
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,970
They look a little wilted.

356
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,000
- Are these really lavender?
- I think so.

357
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,240
- They are lavender.
- Right.

358
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,310
Does it smell like fabric softener?

359
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,470
- No?
- Not yet...

360
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,540
(What?)

361
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,080
(While they aren't sure)

362
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,620
A tractor?

363
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,050
That's really...

364
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,290
(A big tractor stops in front of them.)

365
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,690
- A hands-on farm activity?
- It is a farm.

366
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,130
(Excuse Me Dong Il sets off.)

367
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,860
Those are catmint, not lavender.

368
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,700
They're not lavender.

369
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,170
(Catmint, Lavender)

370
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:16,540
(Similar in color, but totally different plants)

371
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,680
There's no lavender.

372
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,380
- Thank you.
- There aren't any.

373
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,150
(They came to see lavender.)

374
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,880
He was like, "As if those are lavender."

375
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,350
Right? "Lavender at this time of the year?"

376
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,050
It felt like, "Why are you guys here?"

377
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,760
- No.
- No.

378
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
(I'm not lavender.)

379
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,590
We're leaving without being able to check...

380
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,030
if it smells like fabric softener.

381
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,060
(Smell it at the supermarket.)

382
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,270
(They walk along, comforting their disappointment.)

383
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,170
- The size of it is...
- By the way...

384
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,510
- Incredible.
- This place is...

385
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,750
(Flowers blooming all over the hill...)

386
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,350
(make the place look like a painting.)

387
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,990
(The paths between the flower gardens...)

388
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,430
(are used by toy-like carts.)

389
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,000
(Amid the lovely scent of the flowers,)

390
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,440
(couples walking along every path...)

391
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,380
(make memories even more beautiful than the flowers.)

392
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,650
(Throwing)

393
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,480
(Shikisai-no-oka is full of colors.)

394
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,490
How picturesque.

395
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,820
- Totally.
- Right?

396
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,000
- I feel refreshed.
- The flowers are pretty,

397
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,600
but it's this scenery that's truly beautiful.

398
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,730
That thing... What do you call it?

399
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,500
Is it Shangri-La?

400
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,140
The ridge is what I find beautiful.

401
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,470
- The ridge.
- The view from here.

402
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,510
- The roundness.
- Yes.

403
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,210
- It looks comforting.
- I agree.

404
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,210
(They quietly take it all in with their eyes.)

405
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,920
Hold on. I'd like a photo with the flower garden.

406
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,350
- Same.
- Shall we take one?

407
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,350
I think that scenery is the best background.

408
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,420
- I brought my phone.
- That hill, no?

409
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,320
As a selfie?

410
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,660
- My arms are...
- Are the flowers visible?

411
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,460
(The House on Wheels members take a photo.)

412
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,270
You know I rarely ask us to take a photo, but the flowers are...

413
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,640
How did they do that? Did they draw a line before planting them?

414
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,610
You can find high-tech laser tape measures.

415
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,380
That area over there looks like it's been painted.

416
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,120
(What is this green garden?)

417
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,250
The green garden is where the flowers will bloom soon.

418
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,860
- You can see the buds.
- The green one.

419
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,860
- Exactly.
- What?

420
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,290
You're right.

421
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,290
Go and take a look before saying anything. Go.

422
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,100
You're being lazy, saying whatever,

423
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,660
- and not walking over there.
- Get car number 23.

424
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,000
(He does as told.)

425
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,640
(Attentively)

426
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,200
I'll take a photo.

427
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,740
(Jun Han takes a photo of the only blooming flower.)

428
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,910
He's taking a photo.

429
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,720
Why photograph the ugly part and not the pretty one?

430
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
I know, right?

431
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,190
It would've been pretty if we had parked our house here.

432
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,190
Exactly.

433
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,190
(But these people...)

434
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,060
(clearly said they'd walk.)

435
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,800
(Shikisai-no-oka)

436
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,570
(About the size of 20 soccer fields)

437
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,000
(It's much bigger than they expected.)

438
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,140
Those colors remind you of children's saekdongot.

439
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,210
You're right.

440
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,910
- You don't want to walk, do you?
- No, listen.

441
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,250
Admiring it like this is great.

442
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,480
- True.
- If you look up close,

443
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,180
- you'll only see...
- Seeing up close...

444
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,620
one flower, just like Jun Han.

445
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,020
You must see it from afar to get the whole scenery.

446
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,620
If you walk down there,

447
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,190
we might see the hill beyond it.

448
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,090
(He's right.)

449
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,200
Only when you see it from a distance can you spot the heart.

450
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,870
- I agree.
- The same goes for the saekdongot.

451
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,540
The further we walk down, the less scenery we can see.

452
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,170
It's not as beautiful the more we walk down.

453
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,010
(The flower garden is this big.)

454
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,210
(They're done walking.)

455
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,740
There's a red carpet laid out over there.

456
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,150
- Hey.
- These are scarlet sage.

457
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,210
(But now that they've come down)

458
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,480
Are they scarlet sage?

459
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,920
This right here. If you take this part out...

460
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,790
- This long part?
- Yes.

461
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,820
- Right.
- You're drinking the honey out.

462
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,690
- Is that chrysanthemum?
- Yes.

463
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,730
It's chrysanthemum, right?

464
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,000
- Is this chrysanthemum?
- Yellow chrysanthemum.

465
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,100
(Smelling the yellow marigold, a cousin of chrysanthemum)

466
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,230
Flowers without a scent aren't real flowers.

467
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,470
(A pair of butterflies is flying about.)

468
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,470
Butterflies.

469
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
Butterflies do their job.

470
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,810
You just can't help but zone out at the scenery, right?

471
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,180
Yes. Just looking at it makes you happy.

472
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
Absolutely.

473
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,220
Flower zoning out.

474
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,220
(This is indeed flower zoning out.)

475
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,790
We made the right choice coming here, right?

476
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,890
I love it.

477
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,460
- We've all seen it, yes?
- Yes.

478
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,560
Shall we leave?

479
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,660
- Let's go, Dong Il.
- Let's go.

480
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,130
We've seen it all.

481
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,030
All right. Let's go get some ice cream.

482
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,200
- Ice cream.
- Ice cream.

483
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,670
Is it ice cream?

484
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,910
(Let's go get some Hokkaido ice cream!)

485
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,210
Lavender flavor.

486
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,540
- I'll try lavender.
- There's lavender,

487
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,810
- milk, and mixed.
- It must be famous.

488
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:24,080
- I'll try the lavender mix.
- Okay.

489
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,950
- Make it three.
- Three lavender mix?

490
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,420
What are you getting? Ice cream?

491
00:23:28,736 --> 00:23:30,059
I want sausage.

492
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,760
(He somehow spotted it.)

493
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,160
- I want sausage.
- Ice cream...

494
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,390
- No ice cream?
- Sausage?

495
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,430
- The sausage is popular.
- Is it?

496
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,900
(Then we'll order it.)

497
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,200
- If it's popular...
- Popular.

498
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,870
- You guys have ice cream.
- Yes.

499
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,230
Lavender...

500
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,300
- We'll get healthy food.
- Right?

501
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,670
(The healthy sausage is ready.)

502
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,670
- Did he order two sausages?
- Yes.

503
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,040
- Here.
- Sausage.

504
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,810
What are those two?

505
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,720
- The sausage looks great.
- It...

506
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,150
(Taking a bite right away)

507
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,190
Dong Il, the sausage is good.

508
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,560
It's good.

509
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,430
Cancel the ice creams.

510
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,970
(The snack bar sausage Hee Won fell in love with)

511
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,640
(This sausage...)

512
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,940
(has a secret.)

513
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,510
It's made with venison.

514
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,310
(It's made with venison.)

515
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,650
(Earlier, when they were ordering...)

516
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,750
(Venison sausage...)

517
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,150
(is what was written.)

518
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,490
Right. You mentioned deer antlers this morning.

519
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,960
Really, you never say things without thought.

520
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,130
The moment I heard that, I lost my appetite.

521
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,030
Humans are erratic, aren't they?

522
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,330
(Jun Han's food bucket list)

523
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,670
(The ice creams have been picked up.)

524
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,470
Seung Hyun, here's your lavender.

525
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,340
(Lavender ice cream, Furano and Biei's delicacy)

526
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,050
(They're about to taste it.)

527
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,320
(Sniffing)

528
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,980
(What's special about it?)

529
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,120
Is it the one?

530
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,450
It said the ice cream was lavender-flavored,

531
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,660
but I don't know what lavender tastes like.

532
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,490
True, isn't it?

533
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,490
Like fabric softener.

534
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,860
- But the flavor...
- That's not a flavor.

535
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,930
- Have you tried it?
- No.

536
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,100
- I haven't.
- The flavor isn't strong.

537
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,500
It's just like milk ice cream.

538
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,770
(Sniffing)

539
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,370
(Tasting)

540
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,470
It's good.

541
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,640
I should've just gotten lavender.

542
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,780
It tastes like milk.

543
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,350
(A delicious milk ice cream)

544
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,410
Delicious.

545
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,920
I can kind of taste the purple.

546
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,120
Is that so?

547
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,250
Fabric softener...

548
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:49,360
(Lavender ice cream that tastes slightly of purple)

549
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,700
Suddenly hearing that it's venison,

550
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,160
I kind of regret eating it.

551
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,330
- You can't eat it?
- No.

552
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,170
What's with you? You liked it.

553
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,070
Na Ra knew right away when she saw it.

554
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,340
She said, "Why is the sausage so red?"

555
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,540
Na Ra did?

556
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,110
Everything looks dark to us because of the sunglasses.

557
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,110
Exactly.

558
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,050
Now that I look at it, it's red.

559
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,780
(Disappointed)

560
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,080
(Now that I look at it, it's red!)

561
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,360
(The crow makes everyone laugh with his sunglasses.)

562
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,990
- Let's get going.
- Off we go.

563
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,960
(But that was only the appetizer!)

564
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,530
How nice.

565
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,500
When it comes to Japan,

566
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,200
- soba is good.
- Yes.

567
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,800
- How about a soba place?
- I'm in.

568
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,470
- Let's have a light meal.
- I love it.

569
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,100
(The noodles)

570
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,610
We'll have a heavier one at the curry place.

571
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,910
- We're also going to a curry place?
- Yes.

572
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,640
Taste testing.

573
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,810
- Two meals?
- Think of it...

574
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,380
as taste testing at a supermarket.

575
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,050
You know how they cut the dumpling into thirds?

576
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,862
Right.

577
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,550
- Sampling.
- Yes, sampling.

578
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,890
Think of it as sampling.

579
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,260
Get your bowels moving.

580
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,790
(The noodle place flag)

581
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,630
(Head to the place guided by the flag)

582
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,130
- Look at that.
- Buckwheat fields.

583
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,370
(This is also a buckwheat field.)

584
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,170
(Next to the green buckwheat field)

585
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,040
- How cute.
- It's really cute.

586
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,340
I love the vibe of this place.

587
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,810
The soba place is getting me excited.

588
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,380
(Go in.)

589
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,420
(Surprised)

590
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,890
It's only open from 11am to 2pm.

591
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,990
Dong Il, this place is only open from 11am to 2pm.

592
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,730
If we don't eat now, we'll miss it.

593
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,700
The vibe here is really nice.

594
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,270
(Once they enter after pulling the curtain aside)

595
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,270
Nice.

596
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:47,810
(As if they've come to a Japanese home)

597
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,550
(Looking around)

598
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,280
- I love it here.
- What was it again?

599
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
- Dong Il.
- It's a secret.

600
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,750
Entering the place itself has a vibe.

601
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,290
How peaceful.

602
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,990
It's been a while since I last saw such natural light.

603
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,230
The clicking one, right?

604
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,760
We don't use it anymore.

605
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,300
(The place welcoming them with old-style lights)

606
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,830
Look at the scenery behind you.

607
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,870
(How does the buckwheat grown in the front yard taste?)

608
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,770
(Impressed)

609
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,570
Does this place not serve soup curry?

610
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,340
- I want to get them both here.
- All at once.

611
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,940
Thank you.

612
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,380
In a place like this, there's no need to ask.

613
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,750
What was that?

614
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,150
It's the popular menu.

615
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,950
(Flustered)

616
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,220
- Popular menu.
- Your recommendation.

617
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,290
(Gently)

618
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,360
- The popular menu is...
- Popular menu.

619
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,060
Biei's buta seiro.

620
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,990
(Buta seiro?)

621
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,930
What did you just say?

622
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,000
(Amazed)

623
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,030
Cool.

624
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,340
(Fluent, as expected from a Japanese expert)

625
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,500
"Buta seiro."

626
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,570
"Buka teiro."

627
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,555
- His pronunciation is on point.
- It's elegant.

628
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,573
Totally.

629
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,110
This is... What's this?

630
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,550
- Biei's pork.
- Pork?

631
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,920
Hot soup and cold noodles.

632
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,650
(Hot soup and cold noodles.)

633
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,290
It's pork soup and cold noodles.

634
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,960
(The staff said...)

635
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,260
(it's hot soup and cold noodles.)

636
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,100
(Pork soup and cold noodles)

637
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,400
So it's soba and...

638
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,440
(Jun Han misheard "hot" as "pork.")

639
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,070
(The members have no idea.)

640
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,610
- I want that.
- Soba for me.

641
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,910
- Cold.
- Cold soba.

642
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,710
- Okay. This one?
- Soba.

643
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,210
I'll get what everyone gets.

644
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,480
(After successfully placing an order)

645
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,550
Great work.

646
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,520
- I'm bad at it.
- No way.

647
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,250
You're good enough. You didn't forget everything.

648
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,520
(Happy)

649
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,190
I'm serious.

650
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,660
Yes.

651
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,560
(The soba arrives.)

652
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,630
Shrimp? So it's served together with shrimp.

653
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,230
I didn't know it'd be hot.

654
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,400
This is a surprise.

655
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,740
I didn't know it'd be hot.

656
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,210
I thought it'd be cold.

657
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,570
(The hot soup arrived.)

658
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,180
It's hot, not cold.

659
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,750
(Steaming hot)

660
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,480
Earlier, didn't she say it's cold?

661
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,420
- You're right.
- Aren't I?

662
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,290
(Confused, Jun Han checks the menu.)

663
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,360
- What is it?
- Jun Han?

664
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,460
What? Tell me.

665
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,090
- Seiro soba is...
- It had cold soba.

666
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,200
- These are the cold soba, - There are only two cold ones.

667
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,300
while these are cold soba. No, the hot soba.

668
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,930
(What now?)

669
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,140
(He's not happy but doesn't want to waste food.)

670
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,170
(Mixing the soba into the hot soup)

671
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,570
We can ask for it to be changed.

672
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,010
Ask if we can order cold soup.

673
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,240
(Trying the soba)

674
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,850
Ask if we can order cold soup.

675
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,520
(Impressed)

676
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,580
Dong Il.

677
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,490
- It's good.
- Is it?

678
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,660
Is it okay?

679
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,330
Dong Il, this is really good.

680
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,530
What is?

681
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,100
- Try the soup. It's delicious.
- The soup?

682
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,730
(Dong Il tries the hot soup.)

683
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,900
It's rich.

684
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,270
It's completely different from Korean buckwheat soup.

685
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,140
(Trying another spoonful)

686
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,440
I'd love to mix rice into it. I'm serious.

687
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,910
- Is it that good?
- Yes.

688
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,380
- Is it meat broth?
- Try it.

689
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,750
(Curious, Na Ra also tries it.)

690
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,550
In famous soba places, they serve hot noodles.

691
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,550
Good, isn't it?

692
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,760
I can understand why you mentioned rice.

693
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:22,090
- It smells like bulgogi.
- Right?

694
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,730
It's a real delicacy.

695
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,030
(Grilled green onions and pork broth...)

696
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,030
(make a sweet-and-salty bulgogi-like broth!)

697
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,070
It's meaty.

698
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:37,240
(Dip the cold soba into the hot soup)

699
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,270
It's good.

700
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,750
(Amazed)

701
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,010
The noodles are different.

702
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,050
Knowing that it was grown outside...

703
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,390
- Yes, outside.
- It's rich.

704
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,360
No need?

705
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,460
(Chewy noodles and hot soup)

706
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,820
Not trying this would be a bummer.

707
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,490
- It's good.
- It's delicious.

708
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:02,370
(The charm of enjoying two flavors at once)

709
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,430
Do you prefer the cold one or the hot one?

710
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,570
- The hot one.
- Hot one.

711
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,640
Is that so?

712
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:09,547
Delicious.

713
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,580
This is the best food I've had in Japan.

714
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,610
(This is the best food I've had in Japan.)

715
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,750
- I made the wrong order.
- Right.

716
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,620
You made the wrong order.

717
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,950
- This is the charm of traveling.
- But it's...

718
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,250
It's the charm of trips.

719
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,290
Of course.

720
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,030
(What's that?)

721
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,530
- Is that yam?
- No, go ahead.

722
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,230
- Yam. I like yams.
- It's yam?

723
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,300
Yams are good for your health.

724
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,500
It helps your bowels.

725
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,540
(A generous amount of yams on top of the slightly bitter soba)

726
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,440
(Mixing the two until frothy)

727
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,710
The noodles are different.

728
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:51,350
(A clean taste that goes down smoothly)

729
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,520
(Eating a mouthful)

730
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,290
(Frowning)

731
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,220
- It's good.
- We came to a good place, right?

732
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:08,300
(The soba expedition that should've been a sampling...)

733
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,970
(became a full digging-in meal.)

734
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,770
(Drinking it to the last drop)

735
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:21,110
(Empty)

736
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,210
Now then, what soup was it?

737
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,380
Soup curry.

738
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,350
We can't interrupt the flow.

739
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,550
- Keep the flow going.
- Let's go immediately.

740
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,390
By the way,

741
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,360
we didn't recommend what we're about to eat.

742
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,190
- Right.
- It's what you wanted.

743
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,190
True.

744
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,990
To be precise, it's what Jun Han wanted.

745
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,630
- Jun Han.
- You're right, it's Jun Han.

746
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,170
I heard it was a must in Hokkaido.

747
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,840
(Soup curry, Jun Han's Hokkaido dream)

748
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,570
Let's just order two of the curry soup.

749
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,170
(Soup curry)

750
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,980
- The portion isn't that big.
- I see.

751
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,010
The curry soup?

752
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,010
(Laughing)

753
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,410
We should dip bread in it.

754
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,720
(Both of them aren't familiar with it.)

755
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,280
(Off to meet the rumored soup curry)

756
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,520
Thanks to you, we're trying it.

757
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:07,190
(The members head to the bustling town.)

758
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,860
Curry soup places are slowly lining up, aren't they?

759
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:13,530
(Soup curry)

760
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,460
It's this place.

761
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,900
Soup curry. Here we are.

762
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,870
- Soup curry is written in Korean.
- You're right.

763
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:23,010
"Soup curry, Hokkaido's specialty."

764
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,170
(Soup curry, Hokkaido's specialty)

765
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,010
(Unlike the peaceful soba place,)

766
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,350
(the restaurant is by the roadside.)

767
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,850
Yes, this is what I'm talking about.

768
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,050
- Hokkaido's specialty.
- Hokkaido's specialty.

769
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,890
It's packed with people.

770
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,790
- Is it?
- Should I sit inside?

771
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,960
No, I will. I'll sit inside.

772
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,830
Do we order first?

773
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,800
- This...
- Korean...

774
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,830
There's a Korean menu.

775
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,700
- A Korean menu is a surprise.
- Nice.

776
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,270
(Smiling)

777
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:59,280
(But it ends shortly.)

778
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,850
What's this? Isn't it soup?

779
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,220
But what's with the ingredients?

780
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,150
(The menu is strange despite it being in Korean?)

781
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:16,260
(Actually, the soup curry they had in mind was...)

782
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:21,130
(It was soup.)

783
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,730
You eat it with bread. Dip it in and such.

784
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,170
We should dip bread in it.

785
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,570
(They imagined soup served with bread.)

786
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,300
Is it soup made with curry?

787
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,870
(They thought soup curry was curry-flavored soup.)

788
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,510
(And common toppings are...)

789
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,910
(Mushrooms)

790
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,080
(And common toppings are...)

791
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,980
(Croutons)

792
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:41,580
(But the menu they're reading...)

793
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,690
(Various kinds of meat for the soup)

794
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,360
Colorful vegetables.

795
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,360
(Colorful vegetables?)

796
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,460
Like toppings.

797
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,460
(Incomprehensible)

798
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,930
- It's hard to choose.
- This one's interesting.

799
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,670
Apparently, it's a challenging dish.

800
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,900
(What is this soup curry?)

801
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:09,310
(Hokkaido's specialty)

802
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:15,680
(Soup curry)

803
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,790
(A new type of curry born in Sapporo in the 1970s)

804
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,930
(Helping endure the cold Hokkaido winter warmly,)

805
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:31,900
(a bowl with Hokkaido's summer)

806
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,940
(Clear broth boiled for hours with meat, spices, and curry powder)

807
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,210
(The blessed ingredients of Hokkaido's summer)

808
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,080
(Fresh vegetables...)

809
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,920
(and high-quality meat...)

810
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:55,060
(are fried and grilled with much effort...)

811
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,230
(and served with the broth.)

812
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,800
(Soup curry with a clear broth)

813
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,670
(There's even seafood!)

814
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,770
- I'll go with 13 toppings.
- Make that 2.

815
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,910
(Everyone is getting soup curry with 13 vegetables.)

816
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,840
- All of them with this base.
- Okay.

817
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,880
Crunchy broccoli.

818
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,250
- Really?
- It's good.

819
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,380
(Recommending)

820
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,580
He recommends deep-fried spiced broccoli.

821
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,320
(They even ordered the local's recommendation.)

822
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,490
(The members couldn't have ordered without Jun Han!)

823
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,860
(But...)

824
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,960
(where are the other two?)

825
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,360
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

826
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,530
I'll be at the center.

827
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,770
- Help her take it.
- Take it with hers. No, a selfie.

828
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:40,800
A selfie.

829
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,200
I'm so happy.

830
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,610
(Becoming famous like the restaurant)

831
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:46,280
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

832
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,280
Mr. popular.

833
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,450
(Smiling)

834
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,950
(Here's the popular soup curry!)

835
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,620
- Over there.
- Over there?

836
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,920
Thank you.

837
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,020
(Today's second tasting menu)

838
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,930
(Vegetable soup curry)

839
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,960
(A bowl with 13 vegetables from Biei)

840
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,600
(Wood ear, red cabbage, eggplant, cabbage,)

841
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:17,170
(broccoli, paprika, lotus root, green onions...)

842
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,940
(And even the owner's recommended deep-fried broccoli)

843
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,350
It looks good.

844
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,120
(What's his first impression of the soup curry?)

845
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,650
The soup curry is just curry.

846
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:38,530
(To the one who expected soup, it's just curry.)

847
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,500
- It's an actual soup.
- Yes.

848
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,930
(To the other expecting curry, it's soup.)

849
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:50,410
(Soup curry with an unusual consistency)

850
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,880
(Hee Won, the leader of curry in soup curry)

851
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,150
(He tries a spoonful.)

852
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,150
Separately.

853
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,220
- This curry is good.
- Since you like curry.

854
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,890
(Satisfied)

855
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,290
Since you like curry.

856
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:12,460
(Jun Han checks it out after Hee Won's reaction.)

857
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,860
- Gosh.
- This is the best.

858
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,500
(After dipping a spoonful of turmeric rice into the soup,)

859
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:25,370
(he eats a mouthful!)

860
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,210
(It's crazy good.)

861
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,380
(Constantly in awe of the taste beyond imagination)

862
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,420
It's good.

863
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,290
- Isn't this what you...
- Yes?

864
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,660
- wanted to try no matter what?
- That's right.

865
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,060
- I was curious.
- It's good.

866
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,390
- It's delicious.
- It's good.

867
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,430
It's good.

868
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,730
(Feeling proud)

869
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,200
- Because of the shoot.
- Right.

870
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,200
(Next to Jun Han, who's eating the curry with rice,)

871
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,570
(Seung Hyun is concentrating on the soup.)

872
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,510
This dish doesn't remind me of curry, but...

873
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,250
- Soup? Vegetable soup?
- Yes.

874
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:07,420
It reminds me of a Korean soup dish.

875
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:14,660
(Similar to Korea's soup dishes that warm you from the inside)

876
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,690
(The soup curry, somewhere between a curry and a soup,)

877
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,260
(has a mysterious charm!)

878
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,460
(Drinking)

879
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,430
(Drinking)

880
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,340
(That's why this place echoes with a familiar sound.)

881
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,980
(He's Team Soup for sure.)

882
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,980
(Groaning)

883
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,510
(Groaning)

884
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,810
(It's not a Korean hangover soup place.)

885
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,050
(Refreshing)

886
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,110
It's making me angry.

887
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,250
(Refreshing)

888
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,680
This must be really good for the body.

889
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,520
It has all sorts of vegetables inside.

890
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:50,090
(The vegetables are also what make the soup curry special!)

891
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,060
There's a whopping 13 kinds.

892
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,560
(The 13 different vegetables...)

893
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,700
(can be eaten according to taste!)

894
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,800
The deep-fried broccoli tastes different.

895
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,900
- No wonder it was a recommendation.
- Right.

896
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,940
- It's good.
- Interesting, isn't it?

897
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,640
Your dream came true.

898
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,080
- Right?
- Yes, this is delicious.

899
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,380
There won't be any regrets.

900
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:13,620
(Jun Han, in particular, is living his dream to the fullest.)

901
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,280
Where are we going next?

902
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,320
(Curious about the next place after tasting Hokkaido's specialties)

903
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,920
- The pond.
- Pond.

904
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,160
- Pond?
- The Blue Pond.

905
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,460
(The Blue Pond.)

906
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,990
- Is there a famous pond?
- Yes, it's blue.

907
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,500
- It is... Yes.
- The pond is blue?

908
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,000
(Blue water)

909
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,340
(Blue Pond)

910
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,310
(All Hokkaido tourists always stop by this place.)

911
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,080
(I also stopped by.)

912
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,950
- How long will it take?
- It's 17km, so 20 minutes.

913
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:52,090
(It'll take about 20 minutes from the soup curry place!)

914
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,330
What if the guys fall in love with the Blue Pond?

915
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,360
(Driving past the scenery)

916
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,460
- We're almost there.
- We're at the pond.

917
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,300
(Blue Pond)

918
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,070
Let's go.

919
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,840
No wonder I wanted to wear a blue shirt today.

920
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,540
Cheonggye something. What was it again?

921
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,210
- Cheonggye...
- Mount Cheonggye, wasn't it?

922
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,980
- Mount Cheonggye.
- Cheonggye Pond.

923
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,250
We've come to Mount Cheonggye in Yangjae.

924
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,550
This place is also crowded with people.

925
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,620
(A crowd starts from the pond's entrance.)

926
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,730
(Current time: 2pm)

927
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:33,760
(Peak time with the most tourists)

928
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,330
(They've come to the attraction spot at the busiest hour.)

929
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,570
(Tip: The fewest tourists are between 7am and 9am.)

930
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,970
Ice cream.

931
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,070
(Ice cream!)

932
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,610
Is that the famous ice cream place?

933
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:49,040
(It sells ice cream in the color of the Blue Pond.)

934
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,050
(For Instagram photos)

935
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,750
(As popular as it is, the line is long.)

936
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,490
Are we not getting one?

937
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,190
(As the place is crowded)

938
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,720
Where's Dong Il?

939
00:43:00,947 --> 00:43:01,863
What is it?

940
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,160
Where's Dong Il?

941
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,160
Where did he go?

942
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,230
(They lost Dong Il as it got crowded by people.)

943
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,400
He's already up ahead.

944
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,700
Already?

945
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,170
(Making his way leisurely through the crowd)

946
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,670
Doesn't Dong Il's back look like an ascetic's right now?

947
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:20,440
The tourists are moving in groups.

948
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,740
(I'm just making my way along the path.)

949
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,550
So many people are here.

950
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,550
(Following the ascetic)

951
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,650
(Before they know it, a nice walking trail opens up.)

952
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,890
(What’s that peeking through?)

953
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,190
- Is that color real?
- Seriously.

954
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,530
The color is already different.

955
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:42,530
(What color is the pond?)

956
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,170
(They finally reach the Blue Pond.)

957
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,200
- What?
- I see.

958
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,310
(They finally reach the Blue Pond.)

959
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,680
- It feels like we're at a resort.
- A familiar place.

960
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,680
(Giving off a tranquil resort vibe)

961
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,010
- It's almost emerald.
- Exactly.

962
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,220
(An unreal emerald-colored water)

963
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,050
The color doesn't match a place that's this crowded.

964
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:06,660
The water...

965
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,020
Did those trees actually grow in the water?

966
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,130
(Encircled by a forest of deep green)

967
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,130
Interesting.

968
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,730
- This is...
- The color is unbelievable.

969
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,300
(The frozen pond in winter is another breathtaking sight.)

970
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,840
Someone once posted a photo of this place,

971
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,010
- Did it blow up?
- and it blew up.

972
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,510
(It became a default background image and instantly went viral.)

973
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,780
(And that's how the Blue Pond became famous around the world.)

974
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,350
People are in line to take photos.

975
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:40,360
(It's now Hokkaido's best photo spot!)

976
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,160
Since we're here, why don't we get a photo too?

977
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,190
This is...

978
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,630
- Hee Won.
- What?

979
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,100
- A photo.
- Don't push me over.

980
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,230
Let's take a photo.

981
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,130
(Secured a spot with fewer people around)

982
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,930
Let's use Jun Han's nice camera.

983
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,670
- Okay.
- Then Jun Han's camera it is.

984
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:54,900
Why is his camera nice?

985
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,510
- They said it's nice.
- It has three cameras.

986
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,510
The phone itself is old.

987
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,840
- It has three cameras.
- Please.

988
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,140
Having a bunch of balconies doesn't make it a nice house.

989
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,250
(Dumbfounded)

990
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,980
(Taking photos while grumbling)

991
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,580
(A commemorative photo...)

992
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,290
(taken with a phone that has three lenses.)

993
00:45:10,803 --> 00:45:12,073
What do you think of the color?

994
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,420
It's so pretty.

995
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,760
(Staring)

996
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,230
What are those trees?

997
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:20,560
I know, right? Those trees grew in the water, didn't they?

998
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,930
(What the members see...)

999
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,940
(are trees standing in the pond water.)

1000
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,640
(But what exactly are these trees?)

1001
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:32,110
Those trees are dead.

1002
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,180
- Are they dead?
- Yes.

1003
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,850
Maybe the trees got submerged and never recovered.

1004
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:39,280
That's possible.

1005
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,380
But some trees can grow in water.

1006
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,850
Is this a reservoir?

1007
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:45,420
(Everyone has a different theory.)

1008
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,260
Hey, go ask someone.

1009
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,760
Excuse me.

1010
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,760
(Ask someone around.)

1011
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,860
- Excuse me.
- Here, Jun Han. Ask.

1012
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,070
Excuse me.

1013
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:58,270
(His eyes look lost.)

1014
00:45:58,570 --> 00:45:59,570
(Excuse me.)

1015
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,300
(Of course, nobody answers.)

1016
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,740
All of these people are tourists.

1017
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,040
I'm not sure they'll know.

1018
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:10,310
I'll search it up...

1019
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,510
- and let you know.
- Okay.

1020
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:16,020
(Jun Han-GPT is in full operation.)

1021
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,620
- How mesmerizing.
- This is a man-made pond.

1022
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,750
It's a man-made pond.

1023
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,290
- Really?
- A man-made pond?

1024
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:22,460
We were all wrong.

1025
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:25,530
It was built to stop mud from sliding down the mountain.

1026
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,960
(Enlightened)

1027
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:31,300
(A volcano near the Blue Pond)

1028
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,340
(Mount Tokachi)

1029
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:36,640
(Erupted in 1988,)

1030
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,210
(causing soil, rocks, and more to slide down)

1031
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,780
(A levee was built to stop the flow.)

1032
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:47,550
(The water flowed into the birch forest,)

1033
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,690
(submerging part of it!)

1034
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:54,020
(The submerged area)

1035
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:58,090
(That is how the pond came to be!)

1036
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,400
In short, this is the only submerged area.

1037
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,100
That's why the trees inside the pond are dead.

1038
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,370
So there was a reason behind it.

1039
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:06,370
(A naturally created, novel scenery)

1040
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,770
I looked up why the water is that color.

1041
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,040
(Why is the water blue?)

1042
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:14,410
The water flowing in from the White Beard Waterfall...

1043
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:17,780
at Shirogane Onsen contains aluminum, giving it the blue color.

1044
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,910
- Because of the aluminum?
- Yes.

1045
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,020
(Onsen water containing aluminum)

1046
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,150
- That's why the water is blue.
- I see.

1047
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:25,790
(Aluminum in the water scatters sunlight, making it appear blue!)

1048
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:28,420
It's unhealthy water.

1049
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,590
- Aluminum isn't good for your body.
- No.

1050
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:32,360
You shouldn't drink it.

1051
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,900
(Enjoy it with your eyes, not your mouth.)

1052
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,530
It comes out beautifully in pictures.

1053
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,570
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1054
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,340
The water's color has a vibe.

1055
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,810
- It does?
- A trendy vibe.

1056
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,510
Take a bright photo, and it really comes through.

1057
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,110
(After walking while feeling the trendy vibe)

1058
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,510
(The forest trail is now quite empty.)

1059
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,210
- Feels good, right?
- I feel much better.

1060
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:54,380
I know, right?

1061
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,220
(Past the pretty forest trail)

1062
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,490
Oh, dear. Let's take the downhill path.

1063
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,960
(Another view unfolds before the members.)

1064
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,160
(Amazed)

1065
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,700
It has a completely different color.

1066
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,870
The water over there is blue too.

1067
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,440
(Flowing next to the Blue Pond...)

1068
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,840
The blue water starts flowing from over there.

1069
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,440
(is a wide river?)

1070
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,480
Goodness, how pretty.

1071
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,780
(A gorgeous river with a different color)

1072
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,920
(The same catchment area as the Blue Pond)

1073
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,620
It's the color of Powerade.

1074
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,790
(The same catchment area as the Blue Pond)

1075
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:33,120
(Featuring a Powerade color)

1076
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:36,520
(If the Blue Pond is emerald-like,)

1077
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,700
(the Biei River is icy blue, almost eye-chilling.)

1078
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:45,270
Look at how the water tumbles down that wall.

1079
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,140
That's a lot, right?

1080
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,940
(The Biei River has a freshness different from the pond.)

1081
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,080
(A hidden great spot to view the Biei River)

1082
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:59,010
The wind comes from the mountains,

1083
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:00,250
- not the sea.
- Doesn't it feel nice?

1084
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,120
- It doesn't feel sticky.
- Exactly.

1085
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:03,890
- Refreshing, right?
- Yes.

1086
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,890
- Shall we move the house here?
- What?

1087
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,860
Move the house here. What do you think, Na Ra?

1088
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,260
- It's so refreshing.
- Right?

1089
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,860
(Driver Hee has returned to the car to head back.)

1090
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,160
(But...)

1091
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,030
(he's getting into the backseat?)

1092
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,370
Goodness.

1093
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:23,340
(Who's driving this time?)

1094
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,540
Oh, dear.

1095
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:29,280
(Driver Jang takes the wheel for the way back.)

1096
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,080
- What?
- Na Ra will be driving.

1097
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:32,717
What?

1098
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:36,250
(A driving service for the guests)

1099
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,790
- Are you worried?
- No, not at all.

1100
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:43,430
It's my first time riding in a car driven by Na Ra.

1101
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:44,630
Really?

1102
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:48,830
(Let's get back safely.)

1103
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,930
In the end, it starts raining.

1104
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:00,280
(The cloudy sky, gray all afternoon,)

1105
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,650
(begins to sprinkle.)

1106
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,150
Camping in the rain is...

1107
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:09,080
- That's right.
- It's picturesque.

1108
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,090
(Looking forward to camping in the rain)

1109
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,720
Exactly, as long as nothing leaks.

1110
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,220
It shouldn't rain.

1111
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,730
(The owner, who has experienced leaks before, looks uneasy.)

1112
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:19,790
It shouldn't rain.

1113
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:25,230
(Will they be fine in the new house with the rain?)

1114
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,140
We're here.

1115
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:29,500
- Great work.
- Good job.

1116
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,940
Great work.

1117
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,970
Gosh, we're back home.

1118
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,680
(3:40pm: Returned to the campsite)

1119
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:41,680
The rain is...

1120
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,920
(Damp)

1121
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,920
It's...

1122
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,220
(Wet)

1123
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,420
They must've gotten rained on.

1124
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,930
(The shower while they were gone...)

1125
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:54,530
(left many parts of the house wet.)

1126
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,600
The weather turned bad because of you two.

1127
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:02,000
We had the best weather before.

1128
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,040
The weather monster.

1129
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,270
(Blaming himself)

1130
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:07,940
(Kim Jun Han, 42 years old, the weather monster)

1131
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,010
What?

1132
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,190
It's raining.

1133
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,460
(A sudden downpour)

1134
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,690
Dong Il, the rain is...

1135
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:27,160
- It's nice.
- Right?

1136
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,160
(Why is this happening?)

1137
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,370
Today's forecast did say it would rain in the evening.

1138
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:37,640
On our way here, we called ourselves weather fairies.

1139
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,710
Turns out, we were weather demons.

1140
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,550
- You guys are weather fairies.
- That's right.

1141
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:45,450
(Weather Demon, Weather Monster)

1142
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,580
Open this side too.

1143
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,580
(In the downpour)

1144
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,220
- Should I open both sides?
- Yes.

1145
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,290
(Opening the side door)

1146
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:55,220
No, Hee Won. Give me the stool.

1147
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,030
This, right? I'll leave it here.

1148
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,130
Make sure the rain doesn't get to it. Leave a gap.

1149
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:02,200
- Use it as a step.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1150
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,030
- All good.
- Thank you.

1151
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,200
(Opening a temporary passageway)

1152
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:06,870
It's freezing cold.

1153
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,070
- It's okay, right?
- The rain is getting inside.

1154
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:11,140
Rain is seeping onto the floor.

1155
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,010
The rain keeps coming in.

1156
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,640
Guys. Let's go inside.

1157
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,080
(Let's just go inside!)

1158
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,280
Let's go inside.

1159
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,620
(Announcing to take shelter in the house)

1160
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,620
Let's go inside.

1161
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:25,420
There's no other way.

1162
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,260
- Let's just put these chairs away.
- Close the area.

1163
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,060
Let's gather the chairs together.

1164
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,090
- The chairs? Okay.
- Good.

1165
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,090
(Let's stay safe first.)

1166
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,130
Hold on.

1167
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,200
Seung Hyun. What should I do?

1168
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,170
(Jun Han's shoes are water-absorbent.)

1169
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:43,000
(Experiencing the hardship of rain camping)

1170
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,040
My shoes are completely soaked.

1171
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,540
Are they?

1172
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,010
Isn't the mood great with the rain today?

1173
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,080
I totally agree.

1174
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,750
Really.

1175
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:56,020
The best thing about our house is the view, with all four sides open.

1176
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,490
You can feel nature just as it is.

1177
00:52:58,490 --> 00:52:59,790
When it snows, you can feel the snow.

1178
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:01,390
When it rains, you can feel the rain.

1179
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,430
- Incredible atmosphere.
- Love the sound of the rain.

1180
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:06,160
The atmosphere is unbelievable.

1181
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:13,070
(Inside the House on Wheels,)

1182
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:17,470
(they enjoy the atmosphere of rainy Hokkaido.)

1183
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:20,680
It's nice, isn't it?

1184
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:27,080
We calmly wait for Na Ra's pasta.

1185
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,080
Yes.

1186
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:32,020
(Calmly wait for Na Ra's pasta?)

1187
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,660
Can I get to the cooler?

1188
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,390
I'm sorry.

1189
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:37,560
- The cooler is here.
- It's down there.

1190
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,590
I'm sorry.

1191
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:40,300
(To get one ingredient...)

1192
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,030
This is what happens when you try to get something.

1193
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:43,060
- I'm sorry.
- No worries.

1194
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,170
- I will be quick.
- No, take your time.

1195
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,240
- It's okay.
- Slowly.

1196
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,000
- Because of this...
- Alrighty.

1197
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,440
There.

1198
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:51,910
There it is.

1199
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,610
That's a lot, isn't it?

1200
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:54,940
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

1201
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,580
- Take your time, Na Ra.
- Take your time, Na Ra.

1202
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,180
(Na Ra will cook for the first time for the guests!)

1203
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:04,420
(Chef Jang cooks dinner!)

1204
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,250
She mentioned garlic,

1205
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:09,190
so it might be something like aglio e olio.

1206
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:14,260
(Is Na Ra's dinner menu aglio e olio, the oil pasta?)

1207
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,000
(Let's see.)

1208
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:24,510
(She starts to go through what's in the fridge.)

1209
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:26,170
(Whole garlic)

1210
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,140
(Onion)

1211
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,610
(Mushroom)

1212
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,850
(Another mushroom)

1213
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,010
(Looking at the ingredients she picked up...)

1214
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:35,350
(Whole garlic, mushroom, onion)

1215
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,720
(It might actually be aglio e olio?)

1216
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,760
(Slicing the garlic cloves)

1217
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,860
I'm...

1218
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:46,030
(Crushing the garlic cloves)

1219
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,000
She's using scallops.

1220
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:52,746
Great.

1221
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,340
(Scallops?)

1222
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,910
- I'm getting up.
- What are you doing?

1223
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:00,940
I'm just getting up.

1224
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,410
- My bag...
- Can I use this crab meat?

1225
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,710
Yes, go ahead.

1226
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:09,720
(Scallops and crab meat?)

1227
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:14,790
(The recipe is quite mysterious for aglio e olio.)

1228
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:21,100
(Olive oil)

1229
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,460
(Na Ra put olive oil into the pan.)

1230
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:30,710
(She picks up something.)

1231
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:33,010
(Shaking)

1232
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:37,880
(She's pouring a lot of it into the pan. What is it?)

1233
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,720
(Chili powder?)

1234
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,050
(Then this isn't...)

1235
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:45,450
(aglio e olio.)

1236
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:50,260
(The sauce she's making is Jang Family's secret weapon!)

1237
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,630
There you go.

1238
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:55,230
(Garlic and chili oil sauce)

1239
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:59,970
(Is it Chinese-style pasta?)

1240
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:04,940
(Using the garlic and chili fried oil as the base,)

1241
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:11,110
(she adds vegetables and seafood to make her signature pasta.)

1242
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,880
(Nice!)

1243
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,960
(Then she adds...)

1244
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,930
(the highlight ingredient!)

1245
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,670
(Gochujang?)

1246
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:36,270
(Today's dinner menu is gochujang pasta.)

1247
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:37,970
Is that the sauce?

1248
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,110
It's spicy.

1249
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:43,580
It's perfect for curing a hangover.

1250
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,080
- It's for curing hangover?
- Yes.

1251
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,220
Even though nobody is hungover.

1252
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,250
- But it's for curing hangover.
- But it's for curing hangover.

1253
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:54,120
(She adds tomato puree too.)

1254
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:59,460
(It's got all the ingredients packed with flavor.)

1255
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,130
(Na Ra's signature gochujang pasta)

1256
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,730
- Gosh.
- Too bad.

1257
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:05,987
- Let it come in.
- Okay.

1258
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:07,500
- Come in.
- Here it is.

1259
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,000
(While the spicy smell of home wafts across the kitchen...)

1260
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,580
- What happened?
- Why would it...

1261
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,410
It's like a clan village over there.

1262
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,910
Where there are people, there are flies.

1263
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,520
You got it. Gosh.

1264
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,550
That was close.

1265
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,520
It's because of the food smell.

1266
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,620
Sit.

1267
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,720
- Seung Hyun, sit there.
- Okay.

1268
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:32,890
(He's got no time to sit.)

1269
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,130
I caught it. I caught two flies.

1270
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:37,530
Why are there so many flies all of a sudden?

1271
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,570
- It's because of the weather.
- Right.

1272
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:41,040
The weather is clearing up.

1273
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:44,970
(Exclaiming)

1274
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:46,540
It's clearing up.

1275
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,110
- Right? It's clearing up, isn't it?
- This way, it is.

1276
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,710
- According to the weather forecast, - The clouds are passing.

1277
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,180
it was supposed to rain in the evening.

1278
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,920
(Bye, dark clouds.)

1279
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,180
I don't think it will rain.

1280
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:00,920
It cleared up.

1281
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,820
It's not raining.

1282
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:06,860
- It's not raining at all there.
- Right. It cleared up.

1283
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:09,730
Let's set up everything again.

1284
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:10,730
- Okay.
- Okay.

1285
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,900
Right.

1286
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,840
If it rains again, you guys should just leave.

1287
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,910
Okay.

1288
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,840
Forget the pasta. Just leave.

1289
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,810
This is one heck of a trip, isn't it?

1290
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:27,450
This is one heck of a trip.

1291
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:28,920
This is the real trip.

1292
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,590
(It's much more comfortable for her to cook now.)

1293
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:38,130
(The gochujang pasta sauce has become thick.)

1294
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,630
What's this?

1295
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,270
Which one?

1296
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:47,340
(This one.)

1297
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,040
- That's fresh cream.
- Fresh cream.

1298
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,370
This one.

1299
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,680
(100 percent pure Hokkaido fresh cream)

1300
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,910
How many servings is this?

1301
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:01,080
(For the guests who have traveled all the way to Hokkaido,)

1302
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:04,520
(she prepares another special dish.)

1303
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:09,220
(Hokkaido cream pasta)

1304
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,430
(Salt)

1305
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:17,300
(Pepper)

1306
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,970
(The sliced cheese that will make it creamier is also Hokkaido-produced!)

1307
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:24,310
This is strange.

1308
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:27,640
(Creamy)

1309
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,880
(Eating)

1310
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,580
(Creamier)

1311
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:41,590
(She added enough cheese to make the sauce creamy.)

1312
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,860
(Tasting)

1313
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,460
(Exclaiming)

1314
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,270
Very delicious.

1315
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:54,870
(Very delicious.)

1316
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:56,800
To this,

1317
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,910
I might add pollock roe.

1318
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,110
My friend, pollock roe.

1319
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:06,680
(Pollock roe will deepen the flavor of Hokkaido.)

1320
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,190
(The pollock roe garnish will enrich the flavor of the pasta!)

1321
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,020
It will be done in a few minutes.

1322
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:19,130
(While Na Ra's 2 pastas are getting ready...)

1323
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:20,777
Excuse me.

1324
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,694
Is the parcel for us?

1325
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:27,370
It's got my name on it, "Sung Dong Il."

1326
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:28,540
(Parcel?)

1327
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,940
He sent us a lot of stuff.

1328
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:35,110
(Are they carrying boxes of things?)

1329
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,510
In Sapporo, we met...

1330
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:40,550
a Korean guy.

1331
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:43,350
He works as a produce broker at a wholesale market.

1332
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:46,450
- Right.
- And he sent us...

1333
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:47,860
these boxes. Get me a knife.

1334
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:50,860
(He sent these boxes!)

1335
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:55,600
(Yesterday, at the tuna auction,)

1336
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:57,930
(they met the produce broker, Sung Jin.)

1337
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:00,400
(Fruit-and-vegetable market broker)

1338
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,240
(Sung Jin had been away from home for a long time.)

1339
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:05,645
Thank you.

1340
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:08,410
(So Dong Il gave his family aged kimchi as a gift.)

1341
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,510
- Let's open it.
- We can open it.

1342
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:12,350
He sent so many things.

1343
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:14,880
(What's in the box Sung Jin sent?)

1344
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,050
Look, corns!

1345
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,550
- Corn.
- Corn.

1346
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,020
- Corn fanatic.
- Look.

1347
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:21,460
- Na Ra.
- Yes?

1348
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,590
He sent us corn.

1349
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:23,790
- Corn?
- What's this now?

1350
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:25,490
(Corn?)

1351
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:26,760
(Amazing!)

1352
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,900
(Sung Jin's gift No. 1. Corn)

1353
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,470
What's this? Potatoes.

1354
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,900
(Sung Jin's gift No. 2. Potato)

1355
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:37,810
(And in the last box...)

1356
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:38,910
- Melon.
- It's melon!

1357
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,610
- Melon?
- This is fate.

1358
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:41,810
(Melon!)

1359
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,010
(In the last box,)

1360
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:50,150
(there are two melons!)

1361
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:56,420
(The two melons look oddly different.)

1362
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,430
(The two look different, don't they?)

1363
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,660
(What does the paper in the box say?)

1364
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:09,000
(Something seems to be written on the paper.)

1365
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,270
(Sung Jin's wife wrote the information about the melons.)

1366
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:13,410
It's Yubari melon and Furano melon.

1367
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:15,180
What's more famous?

1368
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,240
- Yubari melon.
- Yubari melon.

1369
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,050
This is Yubari melon.

1370
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,520
(Does Dong Il know about Yubari melon?)

1371
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,350
- This is the good one, isn't it?
- Yes. This is.

1372
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:24,650
- Furano melon.
- This...

1373
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,690
An expensive one can go up to 20,000 dollars.

1374
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:30,090
(An expensive one can go up to 20,000 dollars.)

1375
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:31,490
- What?
- For a melon?

1376
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:32,590
It's true.

1377
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,760
(20,000 dollars for a melon?)

1378
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:37,910
(The two melons Sung Jin sent are...)

1379
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,480
(Furano, Yubari)

1380
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,050
(from Hokkaido’s top melon-producing regions.)

1381
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,380
(Furano)

1382
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:44,990
(Furano melon is sweet...)

1383
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:47,520
(and reasonably-priced.)

1384
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,360
(So it's the most popular Hokkaido melon!)

1385
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:55,030
Today in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan,

1386
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:59,100
the first auction of the year for Yubari melon was held.

1387
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:02,670
The highest winning bid was 27,000 dollars per melon.

1388
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:06,140
(How can a melon cost 20,000 dollars per fruit?)

1389
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,080
("A Single Melon Sells for 27,000 Dollars")

1390
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:11,210
(Yubari melon is the local specialty of Yubari region.)

1391
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:13,380
(It's very sweet.)

1392
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:16,280
(The soft flesh that bursts with sweetness...)

1393
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,290
(gives a touch of luxury, like eating a dessert.)

1394
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,460
(It's the most luxurious fruit gift in Japan!)

1395
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:23,620
(These sell for 33,170 dollars for 2.)

1396
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:29,300
(It's a premium product similar to Korean mountain ginseng.)

1397
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:36,570
(Thanks to their Hokkaido friend, they got a Yubari melon!)

1398
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,670
- What?
- For a melon?

1399
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:40,340
Why is it so overpriced?

1400
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,840
(Why is it so overpriced?)

1401
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:46,149
It is, isn't it?

1402
01:03:46,554 --> 01:03:49,850
The 1st melon of the season can sell up to 20,000 dollars.

1403
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,303
This wouldn't cost 20,000 dollars,

1404
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,720
but this is a very expensive gift.

1405
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,860
Look. It sounds like a watermelon.

1406
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,490
(Tapping)

1407
01:03:59,648 --> 01:04:00,349
Listen.

1408
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:03,030
- They are the same.
- They sound the same.

1409
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,400
- They must be different somehow.
- They sound the same.

1410
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:08,600
This is the expensive one.

1411
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,510
So you guys will eat this today.

1412
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,210
(Yubari melon that can sell up to 20,000 dollars)

1413
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,940
- Okay.
- This is everywhere and cheap.

1414
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,650
If you pick it up...

1415
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,310
and accidentally drop it, you can still eat it.

1416
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,250
- Right.
- Let's do that.

1417
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,450
- We will eat that.
- Okay.

1418
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:27,690
Since they sound similar.

1419
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:30,320
(That's how Jun Han thinks.)

1420
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,360
- Move everything else.
- Okay.

1421
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,230
- Just that one.
- Yes. Get them out.

1422
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:38,030
- Should I get it out?
- No, don't get it out.

1423
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:39,030
- Don't even get it out.
- Okay.

1424
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:40,030
(Precious)

1425
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,070
- Don't get it out.
- Let's put it over there.

1426
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:45,940
- Put it over there for now.
- Let's put it over there.

1427
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:47,810
(Exceptional treatment)

1428
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:48,810
Goodness.

1429
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:53,480
Just looking at this makes me really happy.

1430
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:56,150
(Happy)

1431
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:58,150
It's incredible. Yubari melon.

1432
01:04:58,150 --> 01:04:59,350
(Patting)

1433
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:01,190
How do you know about this?

1434
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:06,190
I heard it's famous for being really delicious.

1435
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:07,260
- Yes.
- Yes.

1436
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,330
I actually...

1437
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:12,430
- tried to bring one here.
- You did?

1438
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:13,500
- You...
- But I couldn't get one.

1439
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,000
- tried to bring one here?
- You couldn't get one?

1440
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,870
- I couldn't.
- Take it for 15,000 dollars.

1441
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:18,610
(What?)

1442
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:20,470
- You mean 1.50 dollars?
- It originally sells for 20,000.

1443
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:23,040
- 1,500 in Japanese yen?
- No.

1444
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,680
That would be 1,500,000...

1445
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:27,980
in Japanese yen.

1446
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,180
I'm giving you a 500-dollar discount.

1447
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:33,550
(Thinking)

1448
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:35,790
(I see.)

1449
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:37,990
(Is he actually thinking about it?)

1450
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,330
(Seeing his customer perplexed...)

1451
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,770
- Take it for 10,000 dollars.
- For 10,000 dollars?

1452
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:50,500
(He gives a huge discount.)

1453
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,440
My good conscience won't allow it.

1454
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,570
(Shameless)

1455
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,480
Let's leave it here for now. Let's see if anyone comes to buy it.

1456
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,580
(Will it really taste like a 20,000-dollar melon?)

1457
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,880
(Melon is one thing.)

1458
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:07,150
Corn is something I never crave.

1459
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:11,020
- It's good.
- This is a revelation for me.

1460
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,000
(Are they eating corn?)

1461
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,700
(They never cooked it.)

1462
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,800
(Is Dong Il eating it too?)

1463
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:21,700
- This is different. Na Ra.
- Yes?

1464
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,870
- Is it good?
- It's corn you can eat raw.

1465
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:28,240
- I've never heard of it.
- Try it. It's like a fruit.

1466
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,740
(Corn you can eat raw?)

1467
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:31,950
It's like a fruit, isn't it?

1468
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,050
- Is it not cooked?
- It's not cooked.

1469
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:36,120
- We just peeled it.
- It's ridiculous.

1470
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,150
It's so good.

1471
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:41,350
How can it be so moist when it's not cooked?

1472
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:42,820
- Right?
- Yes.

1473
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,530
- This is amazing.
- Goodness.

1474
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:47,190
- It's amazing.
- Isn't it?

1475
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:51,430
(The name of this white corn is...)

1476
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:53,030
- It's so good.
- Isn't it good?

1477
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:56,140
(Pure White.)

1478
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,170
(This corn, which can be eaten raw is...)

1479
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:00,410
(He doesn't eat the corn silk.)

1480
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:05,150
(a native variety improved and developed in Hokkaido.)

1481
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:08,580
(It's called the phantom corn.)

1482
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:12,790
(Its pure-white kernels are extremely thin,)

1483
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:17,120
(so it can be eaten raw.)

1484
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,360
(Super Sweet Corn can also be eaten raw.)

1485
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:26,300
(Super Sweet Corn is crunchy like an apple.)

1486
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:30,540
(But Pure White kernels are juicy.)

1487
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:34,370
It's like a fruit. It tastes like pomegranate.

1488
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:35,440
It's like pomegranate.

1489
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,810
It's so good.

1490
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:40,110
(They are fascinated by the sweet corn juice.)

1491
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:43,050
I've never seen raw corn being so sweet.

1492
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:46,690
I wonder how it would taste once it's cooked.

1493
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:48,320
I think it would be still good.

1494
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,460
(Sung Jin gifted them with new experience.)

1495
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,960
- This is a precious gift.
- Goodness.

1496
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,000
Let's send a over-the-head-heart...

1497
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,160
to Sung Jin, you and I.

1498
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:59,230
Do it.

1499
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,500
Me too.

1500
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:03,940
Na Ra too.

1501
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:09,880
- Thank you for this.
- But we are not sharing.

1502
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,210
The corn is so good.

1503
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:12,710
I'm enjoying the sight of it.

1504
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:14,980
Even though I can't eat it.

1505
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:17,750
He sent it to us to share it with you.

1506
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:19,920
Isn't this the true joy...

1507
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:22,590
of traveling?

1508
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,190
(They will eat the expensive melon as a dessert after dinner!)

1509
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:27,260
It's almost done.

1510
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,500
(Na Ra's pasta is almost done too.)

1511
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,870
(The gochujang sauce is nice and thick.)

1512
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:36,570
(Exclaiming)

1513
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:41,270
(She transfers it onto a nice bowl.)

1514
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,510
- If you put it here, I will serve.
- Okay.

1515
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:48,420
- Tomato and...
- Scallops too.

1516
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:49,880
(Looking delicious)

1517
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:56,090
(Creamy cream pasta is done too!)

1518
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,460
There's pollock roe too?

1519
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:04,030
(She shapes the pollock roe nicely.)

1520
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,130
(And she garnishes the pasta with it.)

1521
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:09,200
Na Ra has done something big again.

1522
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:13,170
It looks good.

1523
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:23,020
(It's overloaded with Hokkaido fresh cream and cheese!)

1524
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,420
(Na Ra's cream pasta with cute pollack roe garnish)

1525
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:32,690
(Na Ra's gochujang pasta overloaded with seafood)

1526
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:33,730
This looks good.

1527
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:35,960
Let's eat it while it's warm.

1528
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:38,060
- Dong Il.
- Yes?

1529
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,470
It's ready.

1530
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:41,800
Goodness. Thank you for this.

1531
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,170
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1532
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,140
Na Ra cooked this.

1533
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,670
(Her heart pounds.)

1534
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:49,310
Let's eat.

1535
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:52,510
- Let's eat.
- Na Ra's... What's this?

1536
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:54,810
- Pollock roe. We can mix it...
- Pollock roe.

1537
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:56,950
- into the pasta.
- Pollock roe. I love it.

1538
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:00,250
(He gets a mouthful of cream pasta.)

1539
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:03,160
(Is it good?)

1540
01:10:03,307 --> 01:10:04,467
It's exactly what I like.

1541
01:10:05,365 --> 01:10:08,065
- Is it good?
- Yes. It's the best.

1542
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:09,230
(Relieved)

1543
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:12,100
- Goodness.
- I will try the white one first.

1544
01:10:12,777 --> 01:10:14,307
Thank you. You go first.

1545
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,140
- It's in front of you.
- Okay.

1546
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:19,670
(He mixes the pollock roe and sauce and rolls the pasta.)

1547
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:22,380
(I hope he likes it.)

1548
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,210
(His mouth is watering already.)

1549
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,050
(Exclaiming)

1550
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:32,350
(Cream and pollock roe!)

1551
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:33,420
Is it incredible?

1552
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:35,190
- Is it good?
- It's the best, isn't it?

1553
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:36,190
(Smiling)

1554
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,730
This is the first thing I eat when I go to a buffet.

1555
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:39,730
(He truly means it.)

1556
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:41,800
The pollock roe...

1557
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:44,560
The pollock roe made all the difference.

1558
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:46,300
The pollock roe is incredible.

1559
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,330
(Flavorful cream sauce and savory pollock roe mix nicely.)

1560
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,440
(It makes her smile.)

1561
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,540
It's so good.

1562
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:55,680
(He uses both his hands to roll the pasta.)

1563
01:10:56,910 --> 01:11:00,310
(And he finally pops it into his mouth.)

1564
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:02,780
(Cream on his lips)

1565
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:04,650
The pollock roe...

1566
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:05,720
(Pollock roe and cream go perfectly together.)

1567
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,550
balances out the richness.

1568
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:10,260
Did you make the cream sauce too?

1569
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:12,360
I mixed fresh cream and cheese.

1570
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,390
(Na Ra boiled down fresh cream and cheese to make the sauce.)

1571
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,700
- You...
- She made it from scratch.

1572
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,030
This is good.

1573
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:23,670
(The family loves Na Ra's pollock roe pasta.)

1574
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:25,370
- It's my favorite.
- It's so good.

1575
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:26,810
(Slurping)

1576
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:28,070
(Slurping)

1577
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:29,110
(Exclaiming)

1578
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,340
(More pollock roe)

1579
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,310
- She's a sweet girl.
- I know.

1580
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:35,820
(Eat more, friends.)

1581
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:37,450
She's a good cook too.

1582
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:39,320
(There's nothing Na Ra can't do.)

1583
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,650
I never imagined it.

1584
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,360
I'm really curious about how this would taste.

1585
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,430
It's so...

1586
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:46,590
I can't imagine what it would taste like.

1587
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:48,660
(They can't imagine what Na Ra's gochujang pasta will taste like.)

1588
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,700
You'll have to mix it. It has gotten a bit mushy.

1589
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,970
- It's good.
- It is, right?

1590
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:55,700
- It's good. Totally.
- It is.

1591
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:00,970
- Is it interesting?
- It's kind of...

1592
01:12:00,970 --> 01:12:02,140
(An unusual combination of gochujang and tomatoes?)

1593
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:05,080
- It's so good.
- This is kind of like fusion...

1594
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:06,410
What?

1595
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:10,550
It kind of feels like Chinese cuisine.

1596
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,190
I mean, it's pasta, but it has the vibe...

1597
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,190
- of stir-fried jjamppong.
- Like stir-fried jjamppong.

1598
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:16,590
(We found you, you rascal! You're stir-fried jjamppong!)

1599
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:17,690
(Humming)

1600
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,860
- It's like stir-fried jjamppong.
- It's because I fried the sauce.

1601
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:23,360
(The Jang Family's secret sauce: A union of chili oil and gochujang)

1602
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,360
It's spicy.

1603
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,370
(The Jang Family's secret sauce: A union of chili oil and gochujang)

1604
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,200
It's hangover pasta.

1605
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,770
(Gochujang hangover pasta)

1606
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:31,700
- It's good.
- It is, right?

1607
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,840
(Glad to hear that)

1608
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,040
It's good. Totally.

1609
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:36,240
(Taking a big bite)

1610
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,550
(Slurping)

1611
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:41,280
(His cheeks are full.)

1612
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:44,280
Did you buy the scallops and everything for the pasta?

1613
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:45,390
What? Yes.

1614
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:46,390
(It's fun to pick out and eat just the seafood soaked in sauce.)

1615
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:47,550
You had it all planned out.

1616
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:50,020
Actually, at home, I just...

1617
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:52,930
They sell assorted seafood packs.

1618
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:55,630
- Frozen.
- That only costs about ten dollars.

1619
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,600
When it's slightly thawed, you divide it into smaller portions.

1620
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,570
Then, it becomes really cheap.

1621
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:01,370
- You divide and freeze them...
- Yes.

1622
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:02,540
- in single servings?
- Yes.

1623
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,910
On top of that, both of us have our own jobs.

1624
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:08,270
Then, we don't have a lot of ingredients...

1625
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:10,080
- in the refrigerator. So...
- That's right.

1626
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,050
- So, it's not easy to cook.
- Right.

1627
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:15,980
(Looking at the spicy gochujang pasta...)

1628
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:18,280
Wouldn't Dong Il like this?

1629
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,590
- Hey, look.
- This hangover pasta.

1630
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:22,090
(Dong Il's seat is empty.)

1631
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:24,860
- Dong Il?
- Dong Il is almost done cooking.

1632
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:26,160
He's just finishing that up.

1633
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,190
(Preparing something in case they're still hungry)

1634
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:28,290
(Looking determined from behind)

1635
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,330
(Suddenly, he puts down his spoon.)

1636
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:32,970
(Ratting his hair urgently)

1637
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:34,670
- He'll be back.
- Is he by the sink?

1638
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:36,670
(Looking antsy)

1639
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:40,810
(His mouth looks nervous too.)

1640
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:41,810
It's a bit spicy.

1641
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,280
- Is this spicy?
- I can't really handle spicy foods.

1642
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,410
This isn't spicy at all for me. It's delicious.

1643
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:51,050
(Unlike how he looks, he can't handle spiciness.)

1644
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:52,690
Oh, you must have very low tolerance for spice.

1645
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:55,020
Earlier, he had level zero curry.

1646
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,820
- But it still felt a little spicy.
- Really?

1647
01:13:57,820 --> 01:14:00,760
I can't even eat mild-flavored ramyeon.

1648
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:01,860
(Unexpectedly, he can't eat anything spicy.)

1649
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:04,300
Even kids can eat that flavor.

1650
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,270
I see. Then, you won't be able to eat that melon.

1651
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,370
- It's a bit spicy.
- Why?

1652
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:11,800
- Right, the melon is spicy.
- Because it's spicy?

1653
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,540
(They're working together perfectly.)

1654
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:16,380
It might be a little hard for you.

1655
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:17,380
(Drawing the line)

1656
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:19,380
(Taking another bite although it's spicy)

1657
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:20,380
Oh, that's spicy.

1658
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:26,390
(The magically spicy flavor keeps drawing him in.)

1659
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:29,290
Why am I eating so well?

1660
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,160
You are eating well.

1661
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,260
Gosh, this is so good.

1662
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,230
Thanks, you're such a good friend.

1663
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:37,400
(Inhaling)

1664
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,930
But Dong Il is cooking some really tasty meat.

1665
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,270
- This is really tasty too.
- What are you talking about?

1666
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:45,770
But you have to eat that.

1667
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:47,540
We'll eat this, that, and everything.

1668
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:48,540
(Na Ra's 2nd fan club member)

1669
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,280
(Standing on his tiptoes)

1670
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:52,550
(Peeking)

1671
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:54,310
(Snooping)

1672
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:55,920
Dong Il, shouldn't you have some more pasta?

1673
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,720
Just go ahead and eat. I'll bring something out soon.

1674
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:00,350
Go on.

1675
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:01,720
(Finished snooping)

1676
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,220
It does sound tasty.

1677
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,620
- Right?
- Totally.

1678
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:07,930
(What did Seung Hyun see in the kitchen?)

1679
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:09,730
(Expectations shooting straight up)

1680
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,860
(Ingredient 1: rice)

1681
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,530
(Ingredient 2: raw egg yolks?)

1682
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:17,340
(And!)

1683
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:21,410
This meat is supposedly even rarer than wagyu.

1684
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:23,340
(Wagyu straight from the farm)

1685
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:26,350
(Grown on the wide hills of Biei,)

1686
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:28,780
(this area's wagyu boasts the best flavors.)

1687
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:33,120
(What dish will the beef from Hokkaido's number 1 farm become?)

1688
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:38,620
(On the fresh wagyu from the farm)

1689
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:43,000
(Cooking with a torch)

1690
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:46,570
(Dong Il puts care into cooking each piece and adding a fiery flavor.)

1691
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:47,930
(In no time, she has come to watch.)

1692
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:50,100
(Impressed)

1693
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:55,040
(The wagyu is cooked quickly with a fiery taste.)

1694
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,440
Dong Il.

1695
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,640
(Hee Won approaches at the fiery smell as if he's mesmerized.)

1696
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,080
What is that? Are you done already?

1697
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,110
Yes, almost.

1698
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:04,120
- Did you cook that with a torch?
- Yes, a torch.

1699
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,120
Gosh, the fiery smell is no joke.

1700
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:08,860
Gosh, this looks good.

1701
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:13,160
- Do I add one egg yolk each?
- Yes, in the middle.

1702
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:17,300
(Adding a fresh egg from the farm in the remaining spot)

1703
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,300
Okay.

1704
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:20,730
Finished. Okay, there. Let's go.

1705
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:21,870
(Finishing it off with sesame seeds and wasabi, a must for Dong Il)

1706
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:22,900
- Yes.
- We have to eat this...

1707
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:23,940
- before it gets cold.
- Right.

1708
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:26,170
He cooked all of this...

1709
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:28,140
- with a flame.
- I cooked it with a torch.

1710
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:29,510
You can each add your own sauce.

1711
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,040
- Okay.
- Thank you for the food.

1712
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,950
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1713
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:35,050
- I didn't add too much rice...
- Gosh, that fiery smell.

1714
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:38,250
since we have the spaghetti.

1715
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:40,620
- Let's add the sauce.
- The meat...

1716
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:43,120
I used meat that we can trust.

1717
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,520
- Yes.
- Na Ra.

1718
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,530
(How is it, Na Ra?)

1719
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:46,630
(Humming)

1720
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:48,030
The meat is so good...

1721
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:49,830
Right? It makes you laugh, doesn't it?

1722
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:53,330
- It's delicious.
- And it'll be good to eat as is.

1723
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,030
- I'll try it as is first.
- Yes, without any sauce.

1724
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:56,140
- Try it.
- I will.

1725
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,740
Yes, just add the meat on top.

1726
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:00,040
This has more meat. I'll give you another piece.

1727
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:01,870
We'll keep eating this from now on.

1728
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:03,380
(Smiling widely, Eat up!)

1729
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:04,380
- Thank you.
- Try it.

1730
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:05,380
Okay.

1731
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:09,180
Seung Hyun, how is the meat?

1732
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:11,450
Gosh, it's so tender.

1733
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:12,920
- Is it tender?
- The fiery flavor...

1734
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:16,390
- The fiery smell... Gosh, Dong Il.
- Right?

1735
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:20,590
I have to use a torch to cook it as much as I want to.

1736
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:22,700
- Just with a torch?
- On both sides, yes.

1737
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,000
- You only cooked it with a torch?
- Yes.

1738
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,530
(More tender since he cooked it just right with a torch)

1739
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:27,830
He was cooking it for each serving separately.

1740
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,540
This doesn't need any sauce.

1741
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:30,540
- Gosh, Dong Il.
- Yes?

1742
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,210
Don't add sauce if you don't want to.

1743
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:33,270
It's so good.

1744
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:34,870
Don't add sauce if you don't want to.

1745
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:35,940
I won't add any.

1746
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:37,510
(It's so tasty even without sauce!)

1747
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,410
So, I gave you the egg yolk to dip the meat into.

1748
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:42,380
Into the yolk.

1749
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,620
- Break it and dip it.
- Dip?

1750
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:46,650
Then, the savory taste will...

1751
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:47,990
(Trying the wagyu and egg yolk combination as Dong Il suggested)

1752
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,990
(Taking a bite after dipping it into egg yolk)

1753
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:52,190
So, it was sliced meat...

1754
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:53,490
that you cooked with a torch.

1755
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:56,600
Gosh, this meat is great.

1756
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,660
(A fantastic flavor with tender wagyu and savory egg yolk)

1757
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:00,030
- You don't really need wasabi.
- No.

1758
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,100
It really melts in your mouth.

1759
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,870
(So savory)

1760
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,140
The best ingredient. Truly.

1761
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,210
- Yes, it's really good.
- It's the best.

1762
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:10,780
It's really delicious.

1763
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,780
(They exclaim with every bite.)

1764
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,210
It has that exact fiery flavor, right?

1765
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:15,650
- Yes.
- Precisely.

1766
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:16,780
It's so good.

1767
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:18,480
Is the meat all right? It's not like...

1768
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,790
- It's so good.
- It's no joke.

1769
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:20,820
So good.

1770
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:23,090
(A big bite)

1771
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:25,830
Gosh, Hee Won, you're eating so well on this trip.

1772
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:27,060
Me? I know, right?

1773
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:28,090
No, seriously.

1774
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:30,100
Especially on this trip.

1775
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:32,900
I've gained a lot of weight since coming here too.

1776
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:35,270
You ate a lot too. From what I can see, you really did.

1777
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,470
You made me all puffy!

1778
01:18:40,255 --> 01:18:41,785
You're the culprit.

1779
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:42,880
Na Ra, that's not true.

1780
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:48,393
Dong Il, after we eat this, the 20,000-dollar melon...

1781
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:50,690
(I want to eat it.)

1782
01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:52,020
(Dong Il?)

1783
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,690
(I have extra room in my stomach for melon.)

1784
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:56,590
- Melon...
- After these guys leave.

1785
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:58,130
(Jokester Dong Il)

1786
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,300
- What time will you eat it?
- Got it.

1787
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,030
- Tomorrow morning.
- Oh, in the morning?

1788
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:04,400
- With coffee.
- Hang in there until morning.

1789
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,800
Usually, at hotels, they only serve melon in the morning.

1790
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,070
- Only for breakfast?
- Of course.

1791
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:13,410
Gosh, fine. So, Na Ra, do you want to let them have melon?

1792
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:14,650
Oh, of course.

1793
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:16,710
Indeed.

1794
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,480
I was going to give it all to you.

1795
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:20,480
(Choosing her friends without hesitation)

1796
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,490
Is it okay?

1797
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:23,750
- Good. Then, - Of course.

1798
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:25,520
bring a knife.

1799
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,990
(Let's all eat the melon together.)

1800
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:30,190
Gosh, I'm really nervous about this.

1801
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:32,330
(The guests move busily too, in case they change their mind.)

1802
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:34,470
- Gosh, the melon.
- Right on this cutting board,

1803
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:36,230
we'll cut up the melon.

1804
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:38,500
Yubari melon...

1805
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,110
- and Furano melon.
- Yubari.

1806
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,540
- Oh, this one?
- Yes, Furano.

1807
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:45,010
The really expensive ones cost up to 20,000 dollars.

1808
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:48,480
- We're studying together.
- First, smell this.

1809
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,110
The smell. Really, smell it.

1810
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:51,320
(Smelling the Furano melon first)

1811
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,380
You can sniff anywhere.

1812
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:54,850
- I don't smell anything.
- Oh, really? Here, your turn.

1813
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:57,150
(Seung Hyun sniffs it too.)

1814
01:19:57,150 --> 01:19:58,690
- Okay.
- Do you smell anything or not?

1815
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:01,830
- It almost has no scent.
- Right?

1816
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,690
Don't smear it on your face.

1817
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:07,330
Here, Na Ra.

1818
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:08,630
- Smell it.
- Are they different?

1819
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:09,930
(This time, it's the 20,000-dollar Yubari melon.)

1820
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:10,940
Is it different?

1821
01:20:10,970 --> 01:20:12,770
(Eyes wide)

1822
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,370
Is that the difference? Can you smell it right away?

1823
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:16,640
I mean...

1824
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,280
(The sweet melon scent comes through the shell.)

1825
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,340
- I mean, the difference is huge.
- Isn't it melon-scented perfume?

1826
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:21,480
- Did you just...
- Really?

1827
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,210
- spray a melon-scented perfume?
- Smell it.

1828
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:24,580
(20,000 dollars)

1829
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,120
- You can't even make...
- Let me see.

1830
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,150
a perfume that smells like this.

1831
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,960
To be honest, if you smell this with your eyes closed,

1832
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,690
- you wouldn't know it was a melon.
- You wouldn't know.

1833
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,660
It kind of smells like...

1834
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:37,490
- banana milk.
- Right.

1835
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,660
(The 20,000-dollar Yubari melon, Furano melon)

1836
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:43,800
(When it's hard to tell them apart, stick your nose in them.)

1837
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,240
- Why is that?
- The difference is huge.

1838
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:48,710
- The difference is really big.
- This has no scent at all.

1839
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:49,710
- No.
- No.

1840
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:51,440
I mean, I wouldn't be able to tell what it was with my eyes closed.

1841
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:54,180
Right, but this one totally smells like a Korean melon.

1842
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:55,850
- Doesn't it smell like that?
- Yes.

1843
01:20:57,650 --> 01:20:59,320
Okay, who wants to take this?

1844
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,120
(Going for it)

1845
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,620
As a souvenir. Dry it.

1846
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:05,590
You can dry it and make tea with it.

1847
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:06,790
- That...
- Oh, dry this?

1848
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:08,860
- Yes, make tea with it.
- Keep that in a plastic bag...

1849
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:10,330
and plant it at home. It might actually grow.

1850
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:11,830
(Just kidding)

1851
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:13,460
You might have to wrap it.

1852
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,770
(After a day, he seems comfortable enough to joke around.)

1853
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:16,750
A souvenir.

1854
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:20,770
First, I'll split this one open.

1855
01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:22,140
(Comparing the insides, the Furano melon)

1856
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:23,510
- Oh, will you open...
- Compare the colors.

1857
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:25,140
Will you open them up here and show us?

1858
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:26,640
We get to see this before we go.

1859
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,650
(The juice spills out.)

1860
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:29,350
You can just see it and leave.

1861
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:31,050
- Yes, I'll just look.
- All right.

1862
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:33,380
- Oh, this is a yellow melon.
- This one...

1863
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:34,890
has a yellow color.

1864
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:37,660
It's not the same color as the melons we usually eat.

1865
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:43,060
(The crow assassin was quietly preparing to cut the melon.)

1866
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:47,130
(He picks up his blade and approaches the Yubari melon.)

1867
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:48,570
Can't I try cutting this?

1868
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,770
(The 20,000-dollar melon)

1869
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,340
(Sure thing, boss. The crow assassin is very polite.)

1870
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:56,070
You're the one who's good at detailed cutting.

1871
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:58,340
- Okay, this one.
- The color is no joke.

1872
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:00,840
- Gosh, this one is really...
- I'm curious.

1873
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,310
- Okay.
- All right. The auction begins.

1874
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:04,920
(Vocalizing)

1875
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:08,790
(Just like the tuna auction they saw yesterday)

1876
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:11,090
(Cutting)

1877
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:12,920
The knife went in.

1878
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,390
- It went in.
- All right.

1879
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:16,730
Last part. Hee Won.

1880
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:18,030
(A sound effect to announce the cutting)

1881
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:24,340
(Boldly cutting with their hearts bursting)

1882
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:25,800
- Let's take a look at the color.
- Let's see.

1883
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:27,200
I'm looking forward to this.

1884
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,710
(What will the inside of the Yubari melon look like?)

1885
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:32,080
(He takes a sneak peek.)

1886
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:33,710
(Curious)

1887
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,410
(Taking another peak)

1888
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:37,280
Is it similar in color?

1889
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,620
The interior structure is different.

1890
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:41,290
The interior structure.

1891
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:43,650
(It looks like the inside of a ripe pumpkin.)

1892
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:45,420
Gosh, that's fascinating.

1893
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:46,690
- It's kind of...
- It's like...

1894
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:48,060
- like a pumpkin.
- a pumpkin.

1895
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:49,590
- Smell it.
- I can smell it from over here.

1896
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:51,400
- Smell it.
- I can smell it here too.

1897
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,460
- As soon as you cut it open...
- Amazingly,

1898
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:53,560
the moment you cut it open, Dong Il,

1899
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,630
- I could smell it over here.
- You could, right?

1900
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:56,600
(The scent of the Yubari melon spreads as soon as they opened it.)

1901
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:58,040
That's amazing.

1902
01:22:58,370 --> 01:23:00,000
This one must feel bad.

1903
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,810
(Actually, both melons are very popular kinds.)

1904
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,310
(Hearts bursting from his eyes)

1905
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:05,010
You can literally smell it just like this.

1906
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:06,780
All right.

1907
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:09,850
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes, this is really precious.

1908
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:13,080
(What would they have done if they left without eating it?)

1909
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,150
It's so beautiful.

1910
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:17,720
(Falling off)

1911
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:18,695
Gosh, it must hurt.

1912
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,460
- For the melon?
- Yes, the melon.

1913
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:23,030
(The magical melon makes them laugh just by cutting it.)

1914
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:26,200
Okay, as for the internal clean-up, that's Hee Won's job.

1915
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,500
He's the original knife-wielder.

1916
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:29,300
- Should I bring a small knife?
- What?

1917
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,530
- Hee Won, why did you have to...
- I'm ready.

1918
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:32,540
- For the internal clean up.
- wear black gloves?

1919
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:33,640
Black gloves...

1920
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,040
(The black crow's warmup routine is quite flashy too.)

1921
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,440
That looks scary at night.

1922
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:41,180
(I should take a photo of this historic moment.)

1923
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:42,280
It's beautiful.

1924
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,820
(As close to the edge as possible)

1925
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,950
You cut off way too little. You're trying not to waste anything.

1926
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,050
- The skin is...
- He's not wasting anything.

1927
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:51,460
You went too far, Hee Won.

1928
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:55,490
I can hold the skin and bite it off, Hee Won.

1929
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,030
Scrape off the fruit.

1930
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:58,560
(Excited)

1931
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,060
Like that, and...

1932
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:01,630
Chop.

1933
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,770
(Reborn beautifully at the crow's hands, making plates unnecessary)

1934
01:24:03,770 --> 01:24:04,900
Try it.

1935
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:06,440
(Reborn beautifully at the crow's hands, making plates unnecessary)

1936
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:08,810
- Thank you.
- Gosh, it's really...

1937
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:11,240
- All right.
- Take a fork and try one each.

1938
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:15,110
I seriously recommend this.

1939
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:17,650
Try it, Hee Won.

1940
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:19,920
(Seung Hyun feeds a piece to Hee Won as he's cutting.)

1941
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:22,390
(Opening wide)

1942
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:24,790
- It melts away, right?
- You can't help but exclaim.

1943
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:26,060
I haven't tried it yet.

1944
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:27,127
Try it.

1945
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,990
(No need for words)

1946
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,000
(The most exciting moment)

1947
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,800
(Slurping)

1948
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,550
Gosh, this...

1949
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:40,600
Just like how melon ice cream melts in your mouth,

1950
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,410
- this melts away too.
- Even without chewing.

1951
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:43,640
Even without chewing.

1952
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:44,710
All right.

1953
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:51,320
(His hand goes limp.)

1954
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,450
So, this is a melon.

1955
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,820
No, it's a Yubari melon.

1956
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,620
What have I been eating until now?

1957
01:24:57,790 --> 01:24:58,790
- Until now, just melons.
- Jun Han.

1958
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:00,160
- What have I been eating until now?
- Don't be so serious.

1959
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,530
You've had melons so far,

1960
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:03,090
and this is a Yubari melon.

1961
01:25:03,090 --> 01:25:04,900
(Jun Han has fallen in love with the Yubari melon.)

1962
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,330
Still, he's older than you. Don't be so strict about...

1963
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,770
(Dong Il has also lost his mind from the Yubari melon's taste.)

1964
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:12,170
(The messenger of love)

1965
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:16,240
Gosh, this tastes funny.

1966
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,019
For real.

1967
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:19,510
(Two pieces with her small mouth?)

1968
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:22,110
- The texture is similar to bananas.
- Yes.

1969
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:23,344
It's just...

1970
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:26,150
(With a soft texture, the strong melon juice fills your mouth.)

1971
01:25:26,150 --> 01:25:27,180
Gosh, this is nice.

1972
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,090
- It really melts away.
- Right?

1973
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,290
Try eating a long piece whole now.

1974
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:34,630
- Let's try the Furano now.
- Yes, me too.

1975
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,860
- This one is actually...
- It looks like a mango.

1976
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:37,860
- Is this it?
- very rare too.

1977
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,630
He wasn't able to find one.

1978
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:46,340
There is a difference. A huge difference.

1979
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:48,210
- There is a pretty big difference.
- There is.

1980
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:51,240
This one has a deeper scent.

1981
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:54,750
It kind of feels like the base of the taste is in water.

1982
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:57,580
It's like the melon flavor was added to water.

1983
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:00,420
- This one is just the melon flavor.
- As if the melon's...

1984
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:02,790
- Like it was condensed. Right.
- entire flavor was condensed.

1985
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:06,090
- This one is good too.
- It is.

1986
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:07,590
It's very watery.

1987
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:08,930
I have nothing to say about this.

1988
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:11,130
- Really. I'm at a loss for words.
- It was so good.

1989
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:12,630
It made me feel solemn.

1990
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,100
- So, this is what a melon is.
- So, this is what a melon is.

1991
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:18,900
- Hee Won.
- Oh, goodness.

1992
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,000
This must be how parents feel.

1993
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,810
- Eating the leftovers...
- Father.

1994
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:23,840
Okay.

1995
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:26,380
(Father, you should give it to me.)

1996
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:30,410
(What kind of laughs await the family tomorrow?)

1997
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:31,580
This is delicious.

1998
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,220
(Leaving the city,)

1999
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:37,350
(the family of three heads to a remote place.)

2000
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:40,990
(I feel nervous for some reason.)

2001
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:45,100
(They spot wild animals here and there.)

2002
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:48,470
(Like so, in the wild forest,)

2003
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:50,430
(they spot a wild Ryu Hye Young!)

2004
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:53,940
(Dong Il's punk daughter Hye Young comes to House on Wheels!)

2005
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:58,740
(With Hye Young who is bursting with excitement with no time to rest,)

2006
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:01,410
(the family of three falls more deeply in love with her.)

2007
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:04,920
(And happening in the vast nature of Hokkaido)

2008
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:08,950
(A fishing competition with their pride on the line!)

2009
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:11,590
(Mission: Catch rainbow trout)

2010
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:14,020
(Team Siblings: Na Ra, just trust me.)

2011
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:16,430
(Team Father and Daughter: Dad, just trust me.)

2012
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:18,230
(I will catch one, no matter what.)

2013
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,500
(She caught a guide instead of a trout.)

2014
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,500
(Staggering)

2015
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,370
(I will teach them a lesson.)

2016
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,400
(He teaches an innocent tree a lesson instead.)

2017
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:28,870
(This is why I hate fishing.)

2018
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:31,940
(The return of fishing king Hee Won...)

2019
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,650
(and Hye Young who turned out to be a fishing genius?)

2020
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,550
(Who will be the winner of this intense competition?)

2021
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,390
(Sung Dong Il)

2022
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:44,620
(Kim Hee Won, Jang Na Ra)

2023
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:52,460
(House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean)
