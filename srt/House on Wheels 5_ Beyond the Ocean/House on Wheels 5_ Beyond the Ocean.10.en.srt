1
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,590
(Sung Dong Il)

2
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,130
(Kim Hee Won, Jang Na Ra)

3
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,970
(House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean)

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,940
We're really surrounded by nature.

5
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,380
(The members went on a forest tour together.)

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,379
(They only have the climax of the tour left.)

7
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,850
This must be the observatory.

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,120
(An elevated boardwalk)

9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,820
(It's surrounded by electric fencing...)

10
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,030
(to keep bears away!)

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,430
So it's really safe from this point on.

12
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,469
(And before everyone's eyes...)

13
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,570
This is it.

14
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,109
(Shiretoko's majestic landscape)

15
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,179
So pretty.

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,379
(Shiretoko's majestic landscape)

17
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,149
The chroma we can see in this weather is so pretty.

18
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,349
- Right, the colors.
- The colors...

19
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,679
The colors are unbelievable.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,220
(In the distance, you can see the ocean.)

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,259
(Even deer love this spot for grazing.)

22
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,389
So nice.

23
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,160
(This spot has a great view.)

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,929
This morning,

25
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,360
a mama bear and her baby were spotted from here.

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,469
- On a walk...
- We didn't get to see them.

27
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,640
Look closely now.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,569
(Looking around)

29
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,640
(This is the perfect spot to see bears...)

30
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,780
(Sad)

31
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,079
This doesn't feel real.

32
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,640
We can't see bears if there aren't any.

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,550
It wouldn't be weird for one to suddenly come out.

34
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,650
Totally.

35
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,931
I think I'm allergic to bears. I don't think I should go.

36
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,420
Once I'm out of here...

37
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,230
We can't jump down or anything.

38
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,459
(They have arrived at the end of the wild forest tour.)

39
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,130
This is the end of the tour.

40
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,999
More important than the bears,

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,470
do people who did the tour...

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,340
get discounts in the gift shop?

43
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,040
Sadly, there are no discounts.

44
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,940
(I'm just joking.)

45
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,849
Let's check it out.

46
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,209
(Entering the gift shop for their guests)

47
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,919
Sun Bin hasn't had proper ice cream yet.

48
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,949
Ice cream?

49
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,389
- There are bear paws here.
- It's over there, Sun Bin.

50
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,189
- Oh, my. Yes?
- Sun Bin. There's ice cream.

51
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,190
Oh, ice cream.

52
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,820
- Proper ice cream.
- Oh, you're right.

53
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,330
What is this?

54
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,460
- This one? Pudding.
- Pudding.

55
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,359
There's a big one here.

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,700
- There's a big one here.
- Yes, a big bell.

57
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,416
- The sound is different too.
- This one is nice.

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,640
The one earlier sounded a bit frivolous.

59
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,139
Sun Bin, this is a nice souvenir.

60
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,640
The bird here...

61
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,209
is the mascot of Hokkaido,

62
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,080
and the sound is much deeper than mine.

63
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,549
What do you think? Isn't this pretty?

64
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,889
I feel like it'll draw in ghosts.

65
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,319
- I think the small size is cuter.
- Really?

66
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,719
- One like yours.
- If you hang this...

67
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,089
on your front door, it'll ring when guests come...

68
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,559
- No?
- It's scary.

69
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,290
- Is it?
- What if no one’s there?

70
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,500
That can't happen.

71
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,530
- It's scary.
- I wanted to get that for you.

72
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,500
- Get me a small one, then.
- This one?

73
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,170
(Na Ra is in front of a mirror.)

74
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,749
- Mi Ran.
- Yes?

75
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,780
Come over here.

76
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,350
(Yes?)

77
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,150
- Video.
- Video.

78
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,460
(Recording precious moments)

79
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,960
"Sensei!"

80
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,499
Have some ice cream...

81
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,540
(He can't speak Japanese.)

82
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,040
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

83
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,739
(Glancing over)

84
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,810
Do you know...

85
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,580
- In the village... Local...
- Local restaurant.

86
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,649
- Popular restaurant.
- Popular restaurant?

87
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,279
- Yes, popular restaurant.
- I see, a popular restaurant.

88
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,680
A popular restaurant. Yakiniku?

89
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,819
- I like yakiniku.
- Yakiniku!

90
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,650
- Jingisukan.
- I really like it.

91
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,920
- Jingisukan.
- Could we get an address?

92
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,290
Why, Dong Il?

93
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,429
- To take the next guests?
- No...

94
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,459
(Exploding with jealousy)

95
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,069
An acquaintance messaged me saying they were close by.

96
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,769
They asked me to find some good restaurants.

97
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,339
- What?
- It's true.

98
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,369
I thought you'd take me...

99
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,886
- to have Jingisukan.
- Hee Won. Look this up.

100
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,309
- Look this up.
- He pushed me with his arm.

101
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,339
- No.
- Na Ra.

102
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,380
- It looks authentic.
- What?

103
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,279
- Let's look this up.
- Yes.

104
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,380
Hey, they're leaving.

105
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,579
- I can't believe this.
- Is it famous? The best?

106
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,950
(She's so cute.)

107
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,660
I got him to buy a fox charm for my phone, at least.

108
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,029
It's so cute.

109
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,876
(I'll let this pass since this charm is so cute.)

110
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,199
- Na Ra.
- Mi Ran.

111
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,429
- Don't go.
- You have another day to go.

112
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,299
I hope it's not too tough.

113
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,140
Don't go. You two.

114
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,200
Thank you so much for coming such a long way.

115
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,840
I'm sad.

116
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,509
Come over.

117
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,279
I seriously don't do anything during breaks.

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,450
Sounds good.

119
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,849
- Message me.
- Goodbye.

120
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,079
- See you later.
- Let's definitely meet up.

121
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,950
Sounds good. We'll get going now.

122
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,849
- We'll get going now.
- See you.

123
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,589
- Stay in touch. Bye.
- We'll get going now.

124
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,959
- Bye, Mi Ran.
- Bye.

125
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,460
(Looking at their guests' leave)

126
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,099
They have a long trip ahead of them.

127
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,130
(- Worried, - Tearing up)

128
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,930
The guest is coming here, right?

129
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,939
Really?

130
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,670
(So soon?)

131
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,439
To be honest, I'm excited...

132
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,669
to meet the next guest.

133
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,479
They're coming here?

134
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,509
(Changing their attitudes 1 minute after saying bye)

135
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,579
- They'll be here soon.
- They're on their way now.

136
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,280
(Breathing out)

137
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,650
(We understand why...)

138
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,820
What time are they getting here?

139
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,260
- I was told 5:15pm.
- What time is it now?

140
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,089
What? In five minutes?

141
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,189
(It's almost time for the new guest to arrive!)

142
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,660
(Looking around)

143
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,900
(Who will join our members here?)

144
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
- I'm so relieved because...
- Who is that?

145
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,399
- Wait.
- Who is that?

146
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,469
(Someone is walking over from far away.)

147
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,539
- There they are.
- Yes.

148
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,816
(Someone is walking over from far away.)

149
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,839
(A standing ovation for their precious guest)

150
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,140
Do a big bow.

151
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,680
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Oh, wait...

152
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,326
You have come such a long way.

153
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,950
(Our last guest, Kim Seol Hyun)

154
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,990
(In the drama, "Light Shop")

155
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,730
(Flinching)

156
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,400
(She plays a mysterious woman.)

157
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,640
(Hee Won and Seol Hyun met as director and actress.)

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,300
(The reason he casted her)

159
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,839
(She looked like someone from the countryside.)

160
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,910
(Laughing)

161
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,310
(She showcased many sides of her, from her simple, pure side, )

162
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,850
(to her captivating, heart-wrenching side, )

163
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,590
(as actress Kim Seol Hyun after meeting Hee Won.)

164
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,760
You said the house was close, right?

165
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,890
(It was close for me...)

166
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,230
You want to go together?

167
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,860
Yes...

168
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,070
Together...

169
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,699
(Seol Hyun ended up coming all by herself.)

170
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,940
Hello.

171
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,169
- This is Na Ra.
- Nice to meet you.

172
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,439
- Hello.
- Hello.

173
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,080
(She's meeting Na Ra for the first time.)

174
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,379
- Thank you so much.
- It's nothing.

175
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,449
Give me your bag.

176
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,649
- It's okay.
- We can take your bag.

177
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,519
- It's okay.
- It's fine.

178
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,989
- I can take it.
- My backpack is heavy.

179
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,290
- It's not at all.
- We can't let you carry that.

180
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,719
Oh, gosh. Hey.

181
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,000
(It's heavier than he expected.)

182
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,510
How many hours did it take from the airport to here?

183
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,259
(Sapporo New Chitose Airport, Shiretoko)

184
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,269
(It took her about 9 hours.)

185
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,270
You came the longest way.

186
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,070
Thank you.

187
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,110
- It was more 5 to 6 hours...
- It was such a long trip.

188
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,609
- I really enjoyed my trip here.
- Really?

189
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,650
- Yes.
- Why?

190
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,920
It was so pretty.

191
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,180
- She's such a sweet person.
- Did you enjoy the view?

192
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,890
(It's nothing.)

193
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,990
I got excited on the way here, looking at the ocean.

194
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,790
I really appreciate her words.

195
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,559
She's trying to make us feel less bad.

196
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,860
I was really excited.

197
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,140
We met on the set of "The Great Battle."

198
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,570
She's so positive.

199
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,769
The motif of our trip is positivity.

200
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,869
- Really?
- Really.

201
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,209
Seol Hyun is really the Positive Queen.

202
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,309
- I really am.
- The queen.

203
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,650
The Positive Queen.

204
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,050
- What do you want to eat?
- Right. What would you like?

205
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,180
What do you want to eat?

206
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,589
I like things like that.

207
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,120
The tastiest thing in this area.

208
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,560
Do you like Jingisukan?

209
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,330
- Pardon?
- Jingisukan?

210
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,899
I haven't had that.

211
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,430
- They also have beef.
- That sounds nice.

212
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,429
A local from this area...

213
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,500
recommended it to us. We didn't find it ourselves.

214
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,339
- That sounds nice.
- We can grill some meat.

215
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,409
Let's chat while we eat.

216
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,979
- Let's go there quickly.
- Since you must be tired.

217
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,380
- You must be so tired.
- Oh, gosh.

218
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,180
- Have you been camping?
- I haven't.

219
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,220
- Oh, you haven't.
- You're the same as Na Ra.

220
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,790
I like doing new things.

221
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,890
- New challenges.
- Yes.

222
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,689
I figured not many people have come here before.

223
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,730
Of course.

224
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,759
- She's really so positive.
- She really is.

225
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,676
(Being around the Positive Queen is recharging our energy!)

226
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,570
I heard there were bears here.

227
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,340
So, around here...

228
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,840
They're even spotted around where our tent is.

229
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
What?

230
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,310
You haven't seen any, right?

231
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,379
(Messing with the new guest)

232
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,480
- We haven't.
- It's a real bear!

233
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,280
- We haven't.
- It's a real bear!

234
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
A bear on the road!

235
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,520
- There!
- It's a real bear!

236
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,349
A bear on the road! Take some pictures!

237
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,389
(Two black silhouettes crossing the road)

238
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,430
Quick! Take some pictures!

239
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,660
(They're real bears.)

240
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,260
A bear on the road! Take some pictures!

241
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,630
- Where? Are you serious?
- Quick. Take some pictures.

242
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,870
(Suddenly, they saw...)

243
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,080
(a mama bear and her baby.)

244
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,210
(One hour ago on the boardwalk)

245
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,110
(This morning, )

246
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,750
(a mama bear and her baby were spotted here.)

247
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,349
(A mama bear and her baby were spotted this morning...)

248
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,860
(in the national park.)

249
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,830
(Are they the same bears?)

250
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,430
(After looking at us for a moment, )

251
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,270
(they quickly disappeared into the forest.)

252
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,999
- Where did they go?
- Here.

253
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,520
- They went in here.
- In here, right?

254
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,140
They went in here.

255
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,739
- I saw them.
- Me too!

256
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,910
- I saw bears.
- Oh, my.

257
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,910
(Surprised and in awe)

258
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,919
Be careful what you say.

259
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,720
Bears appeared as soon as you mentioned them.

260
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,989
Oh, my. We saw a baby bear with its mama.

261
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,960
(Dumbstruck)

262
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,430
Did you get a video?

263
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,300
- I don't think I got it.
- Oh, no.

264
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,499
- I see them there.
- You're right.

265
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,570
(Just a short shot of the baby bear's butt...)

266
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,139
- Dong Il.
- Two bears passed by...

267
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,639
- in front of us.
- Exactly. It was a surprise.

268
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,580
It was a mama bear and her baby.

269
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
You saw it, right, Na Ra?

270
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:11,279
- Gosh.
- It's so cool.

271
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,980
So bears actually do appear.

272
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,419
After you mentioned bears, Seol Hyun,

273
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,820
- Right?
- they decided to show up.

274
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,920
- For real.
- Goodness.

275
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,759
And to imagine we'd be on the road...

276
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,736
- when they were crossing the road.
- I know, right?

277
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,399
Also, Dong Il, we wanted to see bears in the car...

278
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,129
- because we were scared.
- Yes.

279
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,569
- Since we were scared.
- Yes.

280
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,699
- I forgot we said that.
- And we were in the car.

281
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,870
(What a relief.)

282
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,999
We were able to scream only because we were in the car.

283
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,069
- Exactly.
- If not, we would've frozen.

284
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,109
- That would've happened to me.
- Right?

285
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,309
It was a lot more dangerous because of the baby.

286
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,409
- Yes.
- The mother was on edge.

287
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,319
- She was on edge.
- Thinking we were a threat?

288
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
- Yes.
- I see.

289
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,126
(Be aware that mother bears are around their babies.)

290
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,020
Here... That's a fox!

291
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,760
- Did you see a fox?
- Yes.

292
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,589
(Hi, Seol Hyun.)

293
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,590
A deer.

294
00:12:00,591 --> 00:12:02,860
- Is it?
- It's a deer, right?

295
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,600
You're seeing everything, like an assorted gift set.

296
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,099
- You are the Positive Queen.
- The Positive Queen.

297
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,640
- Really, being positive is...
- I got goosebumps.

298
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,080
As the last highlight, you get to enjoy the sunset with the ocean.

299
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,180
- Gosh.
- How beautiful.

300
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:19,249
You get to see everything.

301
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,809
- Really.
- Enjoy the sunset.

302
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,049
(When the wonders of the wild turn into an afterglow)

303
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,350
How nice.

304
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,789
It's like all my worries are gone.

305
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,790
I know, right?

306
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,789
My gosh, it's the ocean!

307
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,630
(With the ocean's sunset, it's a perfect day!)

308
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,999
Looks like this area has nothing to do with bears,

309
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,159
judging by how many people are out here.

310
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,699
I see, for real.

311
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,229
- Wait, it must be this place.
- Okay.

312
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,200
- We're here.
- The place is newly opened.

313
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,209
- We're here.
- I'm on cloud nine.

314
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,540
- Great job.
- For real.

315
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,939
- Let's get out.
- I witnessed everything...

316
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,609
on our way here, from deer, foxes, to bears.

317
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,780
You totally did. You can go home now.

318
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,049
- It was a shocker.
- Goodness.

319
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,419
(Heading to the restaurant with the afterglow)

320
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,950
- Something smells really delicious.
- Right?

321
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,219
The place is packed with people. It's a full house.

322
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,266
(A Jingisukan restaurant recommended by a local guide)

323
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,689
- Na Ra will...
- Yes.

324
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,800
Dong Il will treat you to anything on the menu.

325
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,329
- Ta-da.
- Okay.

326
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,040
Here. I recommend the salt Jingisukan.

327
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,140
I want that too.

328
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,140
- Okay.
- Good.

329
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,540
Potato salad. This area is famous for potatoes.

330
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,679
- Shall we have potato salad?
- Okay.

331
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,079
Let's order potato salad...

332
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
- Okay.
- and assorted vegetables.

333
00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:25,379
- Can I order rice?
- Yes.

334
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,009
- Of course.
- Order anything, Seol Hyun.

335
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,450
(Order anything you'd like!)

336
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,889
Can I also drink draft beer?

337
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,089
- You want draft beer?
- Yes.

338
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,519
- Go ahead.
- We two are going to drink.

339
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,840
(Smiling at her passionate order)

340
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,530
Since bears are the symbol here, this right here is...

341
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,860
The bell.

342
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,729
- Yes.
- Yes.

343
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,200
We're quick to adapt.

344
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,640
- Four.
- Four?

345
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,139
This is your first time meeting, right?

346
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,170
- Yes.
- Yes.

347
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,409
We never bumped into each other, did we?

348
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,740
- No.
- Right?

349
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,850
It's our first time.

350
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,049
I really enjoyed "Light Shop."

351
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,050
- Really?
- Yes.

352
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,919
- He was the director.
- Right.

353
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,750
(The two feel shy for some reason.)

354
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,859
- You're right.
- Right?

355
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,919
(Feeling happy)

356
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
- Yes.
- Here.

357
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:12,589
- Cheers.
- Nice to meet you.

358
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,389
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks.

359
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,000
- No problem.
- Soy sauce for me.

360
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,470
Excuse me.

361
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,899
(The assorted vegetables are served first!)

362
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
Vegetables.

363
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,040
The vegetables are placed around it.

364
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,710
It's really good.

365
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,080
It looks like a lot, but it wilts in no time.

366
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,280
(Jingisukan is grilled together with vegetables.)

367
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,589
(After the vegetables are placed)

368
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,160
(Gulping)

369
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,620
And this is salted Jingisukan.

370
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,310
- It looks good.
- Salted Jingisukan?

371
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,430
(A photo is a must!)

372
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,640
(Lamb ribs with brilliant colors)

373
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,110
(Placing the meat on top of the heated round grill)

374
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,240
(This is Jingisukan, Hokkaido's specialty dish.)

375
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,950
(As there's little fat, lamb ribs taste clean yet flavorful!)

376
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,820
(Together with the well-kept meat juice and tender texture)

377
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,319
It looks amazing.

378
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,329
- Try it.
- Is this rare?

379
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,330
(A feast for the eyes)

380
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,500
(Shining)

381
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,270
(Blowing on it)

382
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,240
(Eating it as a whole)

383
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,680
Is this how you eat lamb?

384
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,749
(This is what I'm talking about!)

385
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,220
Try it. Give it to Hee Won.

386
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,120
I will.

387
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,990
It's really tender. Try it.

388
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,320
It doesn't smell at all.

389
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,989
- Right?
- It's really good.

390
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,020
Incredible.

391
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,690
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

392
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,029
- What a relief.
- Not bad.

393
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,030
It doesn't smell.

394
00:15:55,031 --> 00:15:56,460
- It doesn't smell at all.
- Right?

395
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,170
(Sprinkling seasoning on it this time)

396
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,139
(Devouring)

397
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,170
This is no joke.

398
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,580
(Finally, Na Ra takes a bite.)

399
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,650
It's good.

400
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,910
Isn't it?

401
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,890
(A clean taste even lamb beginners can enjoy)

402
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,020
(The next dish to be served is...)

403
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,329
What's this?

404
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,990
(the so-called hot stone garlic rice.)

405
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,299
(This is what Koreans call hot stone pot rice.)

406
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,900
Is it something like hot stone pot rice?

407
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,070
(I couldn't take a photo!)

408
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,370
Sorry.

409
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,310
(Mixing the raw meat and rice inside the stone pot)

410
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,210
The remaining heat must be cooking the ingredients.

411
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,819
I have a feeling young people will like it,

412
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,019
- Totally.
- especially how it's served.

413
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,260
(The youngster is loving it.)

414
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:01,160
(Mixing)

415
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,760
- What's inside is lamb meat.
- Right.

416
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,999
The rice alone would've been a bit plain,

417
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,370
- so I ordered kimchi.
- Good.

418
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,269
The seasoning... I like it.

419
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,270
- Me too.
- I really do.

420
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,709
Isn't it really good?

421
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,710
(Impressed)

422
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,750
Na Ra eats a lot.

423
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,290
She eats nonstop.

424
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,250
Does she?

425
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,459
Won't she find out by tomorrow?

426
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,990
(Choking up)

427
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,090
You'll find out tomorrow morning when you wake up.

428
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,030
It's love. Care.

429
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,129
Really, what a big love.

430
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,399
(A big love and parade of food for Seol Hyun is coming soon.)

431
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,040
Thank you.

432
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,540
Were you able to eat?

433
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,809
I ate a ton.

434
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,140
- I'm relieved.
- Good.

435
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
I'm really full.

436
00:17:49,241 --> 00:17:52,710
(A meal that filled both her stomach and heart)

437
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,310
I'm full.

438
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,049
- Let's go.
- Okay.

439
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,050
(Off with a full stomach)

440
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,989
- Let's go, Dong Il.
- Yes.

441
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,990
All right.

442
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:03,389
(Heading to the house in the dark)

443
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,589
We're here.

444
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,960
- Over there?
- Yes, over there.

445
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,730
(A destination that's not the house?)

446
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,200
Get off here.

447
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,900
(Where are they?)

448
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,270
Hi.

449
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,970
- Hi.
- Hi.

450
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,540
(A mysterious man greets them as they enter.)

451
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,719
Each of you is to use this.

452
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,879
(Handing out the gears)

453
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,890
Each of us.

454
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,020
- Where do I sit?
- I'll sit here.

455
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,519
Okay, I'll sit here.

456
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,760
(They get on a mysterious car?)

457
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,159
You should put your safety belts on.

458
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,330
(What are they trying to do?)

459
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,170
Can you ask what kind of animals we'll get to see?

460
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,000
(They'll see animals again?)

461
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,640
(Did you know?)

462
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,780
(When the sun goes down, they become more active.)

463
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,220
(Hokkaido's nocturnal animals)

464
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:07,190
(To meet the rare animals that can only be seen at night)

465
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,560
(For those who wish to see the nights of Shiretoko)

466
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,629
(The so-called...)

467
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,530
(night safari)

468
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,030
(And...)

469
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,640
(The most special animal of all)

470
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,610
(Called the deity crying at night by the Hokkaido natives)

471
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,039
(The animal in legends)

472
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,550
(Ural owl)

473
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,990
(Will the members be able to meet the animal in legends tonight?)

474
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,420
(This man is tonight's night safari guide!)

475
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,990
(With excitement, )

476
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,430
(they head into the night forest.)

477
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,900
(At that moment)

478
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,120
- It's a mink.
- What is it?

479
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,629
A mink.

480
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,439
(A mink?)

481
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,340
(Summoning the flashlight)

482
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,639
(On the dark road, )

483
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,840
(something passes by.)

484
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,850
(It's hard to see, )

485
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,390
(but the animal that passed by the members' eyes...)

486
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,620
(is a mink of the mustelids.)

487
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,530
(It's a nocturnal wild animal that can be seen commonly in Hokkaido!)

488
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,529
- Where?
- Where?

489
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,130
A mink passed by just now.

490
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,729
It went inside.

491
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,800
Did it run away?

492
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,640
There was a mink just now.

493
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,069
- Where?
- Where?

494
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,810
A mink passed by just now.

495
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,540
It crossed the road just now.

496
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,339
It crossed the road in front of us.

497
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,750
(Blinking out of disappointment)

498
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,909
(Passing the mink that's gone into hiding)

499
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,020
I'll try to look for one starting here.

500
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,620
(See you next time!)

501
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,689
The possibility of animals appearing in this area is clearly higher.

502
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,690
- Yes.
- True.

503
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:54,330
The likelihood is the highest here.

504
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,559
(Not knowing when and what might appear, )

505
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,170
(the night safari is full of tension.)

506
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,200
I'm seeing a bear sign.

507
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,609
(The closer they get to the forest, the more...)

508
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,810
(Beware of brown bears)

509
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,709
(Beware of deer)

510
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,470
(signs of wild animal warnings can be seen.)

511
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,979
Isn't this the road we took earlier?

512
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,209
- Yes.
- Right?

513
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,450
The place we saw.

514
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,350
There will be no lights from here on out.

515
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,690
Electricity only runs until this road.

516
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,719
(Surprised)

517
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Cool.

518
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,760
(Passing the road full of bright lights)

519
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,359
There's no electricity.

520
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,299
(Entering the world of wildness...)

521
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,430
(that has no electricity)

522
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,339
From now on,

523
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,210
use the flashlight to spot the animals.

524
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,240
Try to point the light deep into the forest.

525
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,150
(The animal they will try to look for from now on is...)

526
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,820
Owls are usually on top of trees.

527
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,349
(Ural owl, the animal in legends)

528
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,890
If you see anything weird on the tree, let me know right away.

529
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,430
(Na Ra's camera)

530
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,359
(Looking for the Ural owl living on trees)

531
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,660
(Hee Won's eyes are open wide.)

532
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,400
Even if we find one, it'll look scary since it's white.

533
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,970
A white body with red eyes wide open.

534
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,509
(With eyes wide open like an owl, )

535
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,940
(they start to look for the animal.)

536
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,740
Good luck. Wait, a deer.

537
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,110
I already found one.

538
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,850
(Really?)

539
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,589
- It's over here.
- I already found one.

540
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,920
- It's a deer.
- Yes.

541
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,390
(The animal caught by Dong Il's sharp eyes)

542
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,990
That's a male deer.

543
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,189
He's having a late-night snack.

544
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,829
He's busy eating grass.

545
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,500
(Late-night snack time)

546
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,199
He's devouring it without caring...

547
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,299
- about us.
- I know, right?

548
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,340
For real.

549
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,870
(Getting absorbed into the eating show)

550
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,340
Wouldn't that be considered quite big?

551
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,979
It's considered big.

552
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,010
(You're right.)

553
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,210
- Even his antlers.
- Right?

554
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,619
The antlers are beautiful, like a painting.

555
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,789
- Right now...
- Yes?

556
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,526
(The antlers are beautiful, like a painting.)

557
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,819
It's different from when we saw deer during the day.

558
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,860
Right?

559
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,860
It feels a lot more secretive.

560
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,659
- I'm getting a wilder vibe.
- Exactly.

561
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,669
(The night scenery is more mesmerizing.)

562
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,970
(It's interesting.)

563
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,440
This night tour is fun.

564
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,569
(Full of excitement)

565
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,239
We were smiling brightly as if it won't come out.

566
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,110
- But if one shows up, - Right?

567
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,610
It'd be great.

568
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,679
(Night safari book: Male deer)

569
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,949
I'll find another one.

570
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,550
(After finding one, )

571
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,220
(their eyes have somewhat become accustomed to the night.)

572
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,889
- It's over there.
- Where?

573
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,930
- Over there on the right.
- I see.

574
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,129
- Over there.
- Our eyes met.

575
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,960
(Peeking out in the dark)

576
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,729
The eyes shine...

577
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,800
- when I point the light at him.
- Right.

578
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,500
Look at his eyes. Don't they look like CG?

579
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,470
The eyes are golden.

580
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,879
(The eyes look more magical up close.)

581
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,910
Over there.

582
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,709
- He won't stop looking at us.
- Right?

583
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,426
(The attention can be felt even from afar.)

584
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,479
How cool.

585
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,750
- Did you take a photo?
- Yes.

586
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,949
(Night safari book: 2 male deer)

587
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,459
(They already spotted 2 male deer.)

588
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,859
We're seeing male deer in a row, but normally,

589
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,330
there are way more female deer.

590
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,560
(I see.)

591
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,159
There are two over there.

592
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,760
- Right?
- Yes.

593
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,129
- Where?
- Over there.

594
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,540
(Where are they?)

595
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,470
There are two deer.

596
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,009
(This time, they find a mother and a daughter deer...)

597
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,670
(enjoying dinner.)

598
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,440
They're adorable.

599
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,350
Right? Look at their bottoms.

600
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,750
Gosh, they look like baby bottoms.

601
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,479
No wonder the Korean name...

602
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,420
- for lion's mane comes from that.
- Yes.

603
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,190
(They look the same.)

604
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,490
The female and male deer give off different vibes.

605
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,459
- The male deer are bigger.
- Yes, much bigger.

606
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,560
(Night safari book: 2 deer)

607
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,300
(While they've become confident after spotting 4 deer in a row)

608
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,969
- Let's go, sir.
- Okay.

609
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,139
- Okay.
- Okay.

610
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,069
- We're done. Let's go.
- Right.

611
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,340
(We've seen enough deer.)

612
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,210
(However...)

613
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,310
(We still have a mission to accomplish.)

614
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,950
(The mythical animal isn't showing itself easily.)

615
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,550
(We must spot the Ural owl.)

616
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,890
I'll drive us to the spot where many owls show up.

617
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,429
Okay. There's no turning back.

618
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,659
Okay, no turning back.

619
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,700
(Full of confidence)

620
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:29,600
There will be owls sitting on trees around this area.

621
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,509
(Determined, )

622
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,310
(the members try to find the owl.)

623
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,380
- Wait.
- Did you see something?

624
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,449
(Did you see something?)

625
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,019
No, I'm not sure.

626
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,919
But I think there was something...

627
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,496
- between the trees just now.
- Were there any shining eyes?

628
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,430
Am I hallucinating? Seriously.

629
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,290
She's not feeling well today.

630
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,960
(Unfortunately, there aren't any.)

631
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,030
(Come out, owl.)

632
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,310
(Focused again, they look around.)

633
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,510
How high up the tree must we look?

634
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,340
What kind of trees must we look at?

635
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,350
Are there people who saw nothing?

636
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,449
(Despite her passion, )

637
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,150
(no owls can be spotted.)

638
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,020
Won't animals show up more if we play some music?

639
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,530
Like a deer?

640
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,759
In movies, things turn up...

641
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,630
when scary background music is on.

642
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,029
Do you think it's "Korean Ghost Animal Kingdom?"

643
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,316
- "Korean Ghost Animal Kingdom?" - "Korean Ghost Animal Kingdom."

644
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,500
Is it "Korean Ghost Stories" or "Animal Kingdom?"

645
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,670
(You know what I'm talking about.)

646
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,440
(30 minutes into the road of the "Korean Ghost Animal Kingdom")

647
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:50,280
I want to see an owl, but it's hard to find one.

648
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:55,090
Not many animals are showing up today.

649
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,559
I don't think we'll be able to see owls tonight.

650
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,329
They're in between trees.

651
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,589
(Here!)

652
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,630
Here.

653
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,700
Here. Is it a bee?

654
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,130
Is it a bee?

655
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,270
It's a bee.

656
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,270
(Scared)

657
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,910
(The uninvited guest came in when the windows were wide open.)

658
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,949
Is there a bee inside?

659
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,680
- Yes.
- Yes, it's a bee.

660
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,280
Wait a moment.

661
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,249
(An urgent stop to chase the bee away)

662
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,920
- Find the bee.
- It's right here.

663
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,559
- Is it a wasp?
- What a surprise.

664
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
It looks quite big.

665
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,189
- Over there.
- It's over there.

666
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,689
Turn off the lights. It'll fly over to where the light is.

667
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,360
- Turn the lights off.
- Okay.

668
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:42,000
(Flying freely around the members' heads)

669
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,270
He's attracting the bee with the torchlight.

670
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:50,440
(Scared, but still taking a video)

671
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,309
He's having a hard time.

672
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,110
(Meanwhile, the person trembling in fear)

673
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,549
(Attracting the wasp calmly)

674
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,550
(It left!)

675
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:00,690
Okay, done.

676
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,390
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

677
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,530
(Thanks to the guide, the case is closed.)

678
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,130
(He stopped trembling as well.)

679
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,630
In the end, we spotted a bee.

680
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,699
We've seen everything down to a bee.

681
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,099
(Night safari book: Bee)

682
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,446
(Spotted a wasp instead of the mythical animal)

683
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,739
Not one person on the night safari...

684
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,340
has spotted a wasp before.

685
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,309
- Is that so?
- Yes, we're the first ones...

686
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,150
to spot a wasp.

687
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,990
What happens when you get stung by a wasp?

688
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,850
You get paralyzed.

689
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,840
The possibility of dying is quite high.

690
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,520
- It's poisonous.
- It can paralyze you.

691
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,220
Wasps can coagulate blood.

692
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,190
It's very dangerous.

693
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,989
That's when you must eat duck.

694
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,300
- Grilled duck.
- Yes, grilled duck.

695
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,669
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

696
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,670
I see.

697
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:49,269
(That's cool.)

698
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,139
So you have to eat grilled duck...

699
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,740
when stung by a wasp?

700
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,469
- I'm joking.
- Don't take it seriously.

701
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,739
(Answering right away)

702
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,610
It's totally useless information.

703
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,349
- But you said it was true.
- Hee Won and I...

704
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,579
- Listen, duck...
- talk without thinking.

705
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,819
(Trying to fool her again)

706
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,520
(Failed to stop from laughing)

707
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,790
But still, thanks.

708
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,989
You're the only one in Korea...

709
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,630
who takes anything Hee Won and I say that seriously.

710
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,599
At first, Hee Won said it was true.

711
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,659
(The Positive Queen got fooled by fake news.)

712
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,369
Of course, we must take it far.

713
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,690
(The comic duo takes things far.)

714
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,740
(They're unstoppable.)

715
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,440
Unfortunately, there weren't any owls today.

716
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:33,110
(Even so, thank you.)

717
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,709
(Wrapping up the fun tour...)

718
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,780
(despite not spotting any owls)

719
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,990
- We can enjoy this.
- Goodness.

720
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,550
Incredible.

721
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,189
(Suddenly exclaiming)

722
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,290
Incredible.

723
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,730
Stars.

724
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,090
- Gosh.
- There are plenty of stars.

725
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,900
It's pretty tonight.

726
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:54,829
Look.

727
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,339
(Looking up at the night sky)

728
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,840
The stars are beautiful.

729
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,740
We're surrounded by stars.

730
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,370
There are so many of them.

731
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,580
You can see the Big Dipper.

732
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,680
Do you see that over there?

733
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,950
(Going wild at the laser pointer)

734
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,919
(Following the laser pointer...)

735
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,849
- The Big Dipper.
- That's the Big Dipper.

736
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:18,219
(The Big Dipper can be clearly seen with the naked eye.)

737
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,630
And what appears as white is the Milky Way.

738
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,700
That's the Milky Way?

739
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,569
(Milky Way that's in Hokkaido's night sky)

740
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,770
- "Milky Way?" - Yes.

741
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,769
(Though they couldn't spot any owls, )

742
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,840
The stars are...

743
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,239
The stars are picturesque.

744
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
(the members return home with an unexpected gift.)

745
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:45,550
(The last night in Hokkaido passes.)

746
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,490
(The sun has risen, but it's quiet at House on Wheels.)

747
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,129
(Having returned late in the night, )

748
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,030
(the members are still deep in sleep.)

749
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,500
(Good morning.)

750
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,469
(Na Ra is the first one to get up.)

751
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,640
(Gently as not to wake up Seol Hyun)

752
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,179
(More quietly than a wild animal)

753
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,950
(She goes to wash up while listening for any sounds.)

754
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,180
(Click)

755
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,120
(Startled)

756
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,690
(Na Ra, where are you going?)

757
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:30,459
(She hurries to follow Na Ra.)

758
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,700
(She hurries to follow Na Ra.)

759
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,370
(Feeling refreshed after washing the face)

760
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,970
- Seol Hyun.
- Yes?

761
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,439
She's making coffee like a professional.

762
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,156
(While Seol Hyun is making coffee for the morning)

763
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,049
You're dressed like...

764
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,050
- Yes?
- an owner...

765
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:53,150
of a cafe.

766
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,019
You look like you're working at a cafe.

767
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,190
- You look pretty.
- Really?

768
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,860
- I'm a certified barista.
- That's amazing.

769
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,829
This is the sweet and nutty kind.

770
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,560
Thank you. I appreciate it.

771
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,370
This is so good.

772
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,670
- Is it good?
- Yes.

773
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,399
It has a tinge of acidity.

774
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,800
(Even the sweet coffee lover falls for the barista's touch.)

775
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,739
You seem to have so many talents.

776
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,956
(Seol Hyun seems to have so many talents.)

777
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,879
I realized how active she was...

778
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,120
by looking at her nails.

779
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,119
- How so?
- She cuts her nails very short.

780
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,850
- I see.
- Yes, I cut them very short.

781
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,619
Her nails told me that she uses her hands a lot...

782
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,420
- and that she's diligent.
- Right.

783
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,659
(Let me see.)

784
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,190
- Na Ra also cut them short.
- It's the same for Na Ra.

785
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,360
With long nails, I can't clench my fists tightly.

786
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,629
She has a lot of anger.

787
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,000
(Clenching her fist)

788
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,069
(Sweet yet violent Na Ra)

789
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,069
- It's to clench your fists.
- Otherwise, I can't clench them.

790
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,839
(Her nail care in case of emergency)

791
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,509
I was kidding. Actually, I have to massage...

792
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,310
and give medicine to my cat.

793
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,780
If my nails are long, they could hurt my cat.

794
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,249
Do you always prefer...

795
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,650
to do something that you've never done before?

796
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,820
When I get a chance to do something new,

797
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,990
I get a release of dopamine.

798
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,430
I absolutely want to go and see the whale.

799
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,629
(Whale?)

800
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,570
I hope that we'll be able to see the whale today.

801
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:21,039
We made a reservation for the whale watching.

802
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,680
- What time is it now?
- It's 9:30am.

803
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,210
(What's the whale that they made a reservation for?)

804
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,949
(Hokkaido)

805
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,350
(A natural haven of wild nature, Hokkaido)

806
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,690
It's a deer.

807
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,029
(Until now, the members have encountered...)

808
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:45,400
(the wildlife of Hokkaido's land.)

809
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,699
We get to see the general wildlife.

810
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,340
(They leave the land of Hokkaido that was like one giant safari.)

811
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:58,740
(Today, we head to meet the wildlife in the sea of Hokkaido.)

812
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,319
(The sea of Hokkaido is home to countless marine creatures.)

813
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,820
(The sea of Hokkaido is home to countless marine creatures.)

814
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,490
(Among them, there's a special friend found only in the deep sea.)

815
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:18,700
(Whale)

816
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,039
(Killer whale)

817
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,099
(Never seen in coastal waters, a giant of Hokkaido's ocean)

818
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,309
(Humpback whale)

819
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,116
(Never seen in coastal waters, a giant of Hokkaido's ocean)

820
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,240
(Sperm whale)

821
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,579
(A paradise for nearly 20 species of whales, Hokkaido)

822
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,620
(Minke whale)

823
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:42,249
(An extraordinary experience in the vast cradle of ocean life)

824
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:47,890
(An extraordinary experience in the vast cradle of ocean life)

825
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,229
That sounds awesome.

826
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,429
(A whale tour at the far east of the sea in Hokkaido)

827
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:54,230
It would be fascinating to watch.

828
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,399
- A sperm whale?
- Yes.

829
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,769
Isn't it enormous? Is it the size of about three buses?

830
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:01,209
I heard that it's the biggest type of whale.

831
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,639
(What will they get to see in the vast sea of Hokkaido?)

832
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,540
We have to drive over 60km from here to watch the whales.

833
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,819
Even if I drink, sing, and dance

834
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:17,490
My heart is filled only with sadness

835
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,090
Bye.

836
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,369
(From the front yard to the whale watching)

837
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,230
(A drive of 60km to the spot for whale watching)

838
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,770
(A spectacular finale to take place at the end of Hokkaido)

839
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,410
Whatever Seol Hyun wants to eat,

840
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,930
let's have her eat as much as possible before we go.

841
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,390
Food at the rest stop is also good.

842
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,689
(A spot to satisfy their hunger before the whale watching)

843
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,260
Let's pick out delicious food at the rest stop.

844
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,330
They sell coffee and hamburgers. That must be it.

845
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,560
(A restaurant that looks clean and cozy)

846
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:01,830
I see.

847
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:04,400
We'll get one of each.

848
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,940
Also,

849
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,410
teriyaki chicken pizza, please.

850
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,040
- Do you have oolong tea?
- Yes.

851
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,249
- Two oolong tea. Yes.
- Two?

852
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,856
(While Food Lover Na Ra carefully plans their meal...)

853
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,619
(You have a new message.)

854
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,590
(Dong Il receives a text on his phone.)

855
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,460
(What message did Dong Il receive?)

856
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,240
Hey.

857
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,839
- What?
- What should we do?

858
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,870
What's wrong?

859
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,279
(We're informing you about the Shiretoko Whale Watching.)

860
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,409
"Hello, we're the whale watching company."

861
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,849
"The tour you reserved today at 1:30pm has been canceled..."

862
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,879
"due to high waves as the vessel will not operate."

863
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,790
(The tour you reserved today at 1:30pm has been canceled...)

864
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,829
(The whale watching was canceled due to high waves.)

865
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,930
(I see...)

866
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,069
(They don't want to believe it.)

867
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,069
(CPR)

868
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,239
(They don't want to believe it.)

869
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,239
- That hit me hard.
- Seriously?

870
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,380
I got a text.

871
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,650
(Checking with his own eyes)

872
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,280
Forget it.

873
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,449
How dare you throw down my phone?

874
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,010
I'll do it again. Please film it again.

875
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,330
Forget it.

876
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,660
- What should we do?
- What should we do?

877
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,559
(It's a big problem.)

878
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
What should we do?

879
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:40,630
(It's a big problem.)

880
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,939
(He takes a look again, but the whale watching is canceled.)

881
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,000
Dong Il.

882
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,540
- I have an idea.
- What?

883
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,740
What shall we do?

884
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,679
(Throbbing)

885
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,510
I'm very sorry. The whale...

886
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,319
It would have been amazing to watch the whales.

887
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,350
(Drawing a blank)

888
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,849
- The waves are too big.
- What should we do?

889
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,570
I don't understand. The weather looks fine.

890
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
(Their schedule gets canceled due to the waves.)

891
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,189
(All the whale watching companies...)

892
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,429
(canceled their schedule.)

893
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,629
Seol Hyun said that she wanted to see them no matter what.

894
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,129
I know. Me too. I've never seen whales before.

895
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,269
Me neither.

896
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,346
(Positive Seol Hyun smiles despite feeling disappointed.)

897
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,040
(The members are ill at ease.)

898
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,669
(Your orders are available.)

899
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,780
Seeing whales is not an easy thing.

900
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,350
This is...

901
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,479
(Their breakfast starts in a depressed mood.)

902
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,420
- Gosh, this is insane.
- It's frustrating.

903
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,990
Let's eat before discussing.

904
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,460
Seol Hyun...

905
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,230
Goodness.

906
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,190
Gosh, are you okay?

907
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,529
- I'm sorry.
- As we can't see whales anymore...

908
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,599
(Making matters worse)

909
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,900
Hee Won spilled his drink and is making a mess.

910
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,540
Oh, no.

911
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,569
(It feels like today will be a rough day.)

912
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,110
- Na Ra, sit down.
- Okay.

913
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,849
- Let's enjoy the food first.
- Okay.

914
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,979
(Today's breakfast, 1 rice bowl per person)

915
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,250
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

916
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,490
What should we do now?

917
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,430
(What?)

918
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,090
(Secretly)

919
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,730
- Is it good?
- It's close to being raw meat.

920
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,830
Is it venison?

921
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,340
- It could be since it's red.
- It must be venison.

922
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,609
(Checking the menu)

923
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,040
(Checking on her phone)

924
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,409
Right. It's venison.

925
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,680
(It's venison.)

926
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,119
Yes, the color...

927
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,580
It's red. The venison sausage was red too.

928
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,819
(It's definitely venison that Hee Won detested.)

929
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,860
- In the end...
- Am I the only one who ordered it?

930
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
We ordered one of each.

931
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:50,429
(Pork cutlet rice bowl, beef loin rice bowl, chicken rice bowl, )

932
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,760
(and venison rice bowl)

933
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,100
Why was it me?

934
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,240
You said that you wanted this by looking at the photo.

935
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,440
This looks delicious.

936
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
Hey.

937
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,579
When did I say that?

938
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,350
(Playing dumb)

939
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,350
(I'll try to enjoy it.)

940
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,189
(Anyway, as they keep eating...)

941
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,420
Suddenly, we have a big problem.

942
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:20,090
(They're very worried about how their schedule got canceled.)

943
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,830
If we can't go whale watching,

944
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,900
what other activities are there?

945
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Other activities?

946
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:31,440
There's a hot spring waterfall.

947
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,969
And... It's a hot spring and a waterfall.

948
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,009
(A hot spring waterfall?)

949
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,010
That place...

950
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,709
(Leaving the sea behind...)

951
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,450
(where the whales they longed to see reside)

952
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,120
(Another option that's nearby)

953
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,460
(Hot spring waterfall tour)

954
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,829
(A long river that stretches endlessly...)

955
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:01,070
(along the mountain ridge cascades into a waterfall.)

956
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:06,340
(The essence of Hokkaido's nature, blessed by hot geothermal heat)

957
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:12,480
(The entire flowing river is warm hot spring water.)

958
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:17,650
(By walking along the hot spring stream)

959
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:25,890
(You can enjoy the hot spring waterfall with your whole body.)

960
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:33,530
(If you wish, you can also enjoy a hot spring bath.)

961
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,199
(It might be a better option.)

962
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,769
We can soak our feet in the hot spring water.

963
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,339
Taking a walk could also be a good option.

964
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,946
(Changing the itinerary to visiting the hot spring waterfall)

965
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,940
What's important is that you like it.

966
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,479
- I like it.
- Do you?

967
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,310
- Yes.
- You're very positive.

968
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,849
(The whale tour, Positive Queen Seol Hyun's 1st choice...)

969
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:54,290
(Leaving behind the whale tour...)

970
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,860
It's possible to rent water shoes.

971
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,590
- Water shoes?
- You already have them.

972
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,789
I'm already wearing my water shoes.

973
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,929
- Exactly. You're foresighted.
- Yes.

974
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,600
(Note: He's been wearing them for 10 days.)

975
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,499
- Doesn't this mean...
- Maybe he knew.

976
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,946
That he knew everything from the start?

977
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,669
Did you release bears because you wanted to go there instead?

978
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,739
Yes, and I asked for big waves.

979
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,880
(Their breakfast ends with a small joke.)

980
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:23,480
(The members set out for the hot spring waterfall.)

981
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,649
We won't get to do whale watching,

982
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,190
- but what's the motif of our trip?
- Being positive.

983
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,490
Let's go.

984
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,719
Here we go.

985
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,030
(They head to the hot spring filled with positivity.)

986
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,230
(The hot spring waterfall is about 20 minutes away.)

987
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,400
There's no road anymore.

988
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,339
(An unpaved road appears as soon as they get out of the center.)

989
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,210
Look, it's another spot for bears.

990
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,709
- There's a sign.
- It says not to feed them.

991
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,230
(Habitat for bears, do not feed them.)

992
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,849
There are many spots for bears.

993
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,020
(The waterfall is also located where bears could come out.)

994
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,530
Don't you think it's more likely that bears show up here?

995
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,520
(A thick forest that bears would like)

996
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,360
(He feels nervous for no reason.)

997
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,440
Cars keep going out.

998
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,310
No car is going in.

999
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,210
Gosh.

1000
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,179
(No car is going in.)

1001
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,649
What if a bear is waiting for us when we arrive?

1002
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,250
(There are only cars that are getting out.)

1003
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:40,860
(While they head to the waterfall with little anxiety)

1004
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,930
What is it? We can't go farther?

1005
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,100
(When they get closer, the members are stopped.)

1006
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:55,440
They saw a mother bear and a baby today.

1007
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,810
What they saw today...

1008
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:00,250
(The person in charge announces that bears appeared.)

1009
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:03,110
(At the same time, the parking lot by the waterfall)

1010
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,379
(The parking lot is closed.)

1011
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,090
(Even the parking lot is closed as bears appeared.)

1012
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,160
In case of a fatal accident, there's no one to handle it.

1013
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,529
Within 30 minutes, everyone...

1014
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,010
(All the tour guides have evacuated.)

1015
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:19,829
Because of the bears...

1016
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:20,929
Okay.

1017
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,599
We should stay safe until the last day.

1018
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,600
I agree.

1019
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:28,670
(Due to the bears, they decide to return home.)

1020
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,310
I forgot about it.

1021
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,340
It could've caused a misunderstanding.

1022
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:37,120
Water shoes. My size is 260mm.

1023
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,520
- Your size?
- Yes, yours is 280mm.

1024
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,019
Should I try them on before returning them?

1025
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,066
- Are you going to use it?
- We have to return them.

1026
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,559
(They return them without even using them.)

1027
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,790
Why did we even rent them?

1028
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,229
You never got to go or try them on.

1029
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,470
I never got to try them on. Look.

1030
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,140
(Sighing)

1031
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,209
(On their way to return the water shoes with sadness)

1032
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:03,240
Is it over there?

1033
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,780
Here's the bear.

1034
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,510
I don't want to encounter it.

1035
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,679
(The reason why they couldn't go to the hot spring waterfall)

1036
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,880
(A finger flick)

1037
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,950
Excuse me. I'd like to return it.

1038
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,790
(Returning water shoes that he never put on)

1039
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,430
- We just returned the water shoes.
- Yes.

1040
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:26,560
The entrance was closed because bears appeared.

1041
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,506
They said that we couldn't go in because it was dangerous.

1042
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,200
Does it happen frequently?

1043
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,409
Yes, it closes when bears appear.

1044
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:39,110
How many times a month does it happen?

1045
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,950
There's a calendar back there.

1046
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,820
It's the number of bear appearances this month.

1047
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,849
Isn't that right? Until the 31.

1048
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,489
It's what we saw yesterday.

1049
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:53,460
It's because of the bear that we saw yesterday.

1050
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,629
(Yesterday's date)

1051
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:59,530
(Closing and reopening times of the bear alert area)

1052
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:04,400
(A system where safety is secured by closing the facility and tours)

1053
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:09,370
Yesterday, we saw a mother bear and her baby.

1054
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,339
(Did the bears from yesterday appear again?)

1055
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,340
I'm not sure.

1056
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,550
It was them again.

1057
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,019
- Up over there?
- They're frustrating us.

1058
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,020
- My goodness.
- I know.

1059
00:46:20,021 --> 00:46:21,489
(The troublemakers turned out to be...)

1060
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:23,920
(the bear family that they saw yesterday.)

1061
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,890
(The ones who made the members feel relieved yesterday...)

1062
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:33,260
(They stood in the way of the hot spring waterfall today.)

1063
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,269
So it was really them.

1064
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:38,169
I see. I was just curious.

1065
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,140
Excuse me again, but...

1066
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,439
I returned them without putting them on.

1067
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,980
Can I get a refund on the water shoes?

1068
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,650
It's possible.

1069
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:49,779
I think so.

1070
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:50,949
A refund?

1071
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,019
(He smiles big at the long-awaited good news.)

1072
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,890
- She'll give us a refund.
- I see.

1073
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:56,390
Thank you.

1074
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,959
Nice to meet you.

1075
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,520
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1076
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:01,389
Let's buy ourselves ice cream.

1077
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,006
Yes, let's buy ice cream with that money.

1078
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,429
- Right.
- Okay.

1079
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,229
I'll buy you ice cream...

1080
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,330
- with the refund.
- Ice cream.

1081
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:11,069
(They go back with a sad heart.)

1082
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,139
Let's go back.

1083
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,610
The environment is really beautiful here.

1084
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,580
(Primeval nature is preserved in Shiretoko.)

1085
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:26,350
(People live here with animals in nature.)

1086
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,650
(It's not just for human beings. It's a shared space.)

1087
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,189
(They return to the front yard with their disappointment behind.)

1088
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,190
(Sad)

1089
00:47:34,191 --> 00:47:36,431
(We entered the lawn with permission from the campsite.)

1090
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,460
I'm sorry.

1091
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,530
Seol Hyun, I'm sorry.

1092
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,469
I'm sorry too.

1093
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,040
I'm very sorry.

1094
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,840
(Going mad)

1095
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,510
Gosh, what a mess. Everything closed.

1096
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,809
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1097
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:58,150
Please understand us.

1098
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,279
Please understand us.

1099
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,450
(Tilting and arriving listlessly)

1100
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:03,759
- I'm sorry.
- Goodness.

1101
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,760
(Well done)

1102
00:48:04,761 --> 00:48:06,859
- Thank you for driving.
- Thank you.

1103
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,989
- Just think of it as a drive.
- Well done, everyone.

1104
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:09,990
Okay.

1105
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,130
This campsite looks nice.

1106
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,099
- I know.
- The campsite is amazing.

1107
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,570
- I agree.
- Right?

1108
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,969
(The same spot as this morning)

1109
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:22,470
(They returned exactly where they were this morning.)

1110
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,910
I'm sorry.

1111
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,740
(It's okay.)

1112
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,410
It's strange how familiar it is.

1113
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,450
(In despair)

1114
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:37,189
It's Hee Won who invited you here.

1115
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,990
Let him tell you what you want to hear.

1116
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,260
(Staring with bright eyes)

1117
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,330
- Na Ra, step back a little.
- Okay.

1118
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:48,230
(Turning)

1119
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,440
(I'm sorry...)

1120
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:57,210
(House on Wheels' family motto: Those who can survive must survive.)

1121
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,440
- I'm sorry.
- Step back a little.

1122
00:48:59,441 --> 00:49:03,050
(This is the weight on the host.)

1123
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:05,179
(Seol Hyun, you know how I feel, don't you?)

1124
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,190
Things like that can happen.

1125
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,950
Anyway, Dong Il.

1126
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:11,720
We have a secret weapon.

1127
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,929
- What?
- We have a secret weapon.

1128
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:14,930
Really?

1129
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:19,030
You've never disassembled it, have you?

1130
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,670
Right, it's actually very amazing.

1131
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,369
She likes doing things that she's never done before.

1132
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,769
Doing things that she's never done before.

1133
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:31,509
- So that was your secret weapon.
- Take a look.

1134
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,510
(Hee Won is so smart.)

1135
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,210
Like this.

1136
00:49:34,211 --> 00:49:35,250
(Struggling)

1137
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,380
And turn it like this.

1138
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,479
- It's going up.
- The car is going up.

1139
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,519
Yes.

1140
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,520
- Try turning it yourself.
- Okay.

1141
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:43,490
- Counterclockwise.
- Try it.

1142
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,959
(Like she's possessed, the guest turns the lever.)

1143
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,660
(Giggling)

1144
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:50,329
- Okay.
- It fell out.

1145
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:51,660
It's because of you, Seol Hyun.

1146
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:53,760
- It fell out, right?
- Yes.

1147
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:56,700
What's next is the most important. You use the drill.

1148
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,380
- This is how you turn it on.
- Okay.

1149
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,510
Place it here.

1150
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,410
- You insert it.
- Okay.

1151
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,309
(Drilling)

1152
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:07,140
Gosh, this is crazy.

1153
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:09,450
- Tell Seol Hyun to try it.
- Insert it.

1154
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,449
Drill it.

1155
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:13,380
(She even drills it like she's possessed.)

1156
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,919
(Welcome to House on Wheels.)

1157
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,919
Okay, it's done.

1158
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,920
(Feeling proud)

1159
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:19,920
It's done.

1160
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,429
(Before the guest comes back to senses)

1161
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:25,030
- Seol Hyun.
- Yes?

1162
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,740
- Let's go grocery shopping.
- Okay.

1163
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:29,100
- Have fun.
- Okay.

1164
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,999
Buy her everything that she wants.

1165
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Okay.

1166
00:50:33,001 --> 00:50:34,640
(While Hee Won goes out with the guest)

1167
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:38,480
- A little bit...
- I had a mental breakdown.

1168
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,409
- Wasn't it unbelievable?
- Right.

1169
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:43,409
It almost didn't feel real.

1170
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:44,579
(They share their honest feelings when the guest isn't around.)

1171
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,650
I know. The entire national park was...

1172
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:50,019
closed.

1173
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,290
Because of the mother bear and her baby.

1174
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,030
We even saw them.

1175
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,430
We saw them.

1176
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:58,676
(They lost the hot spring waterfall as they saw the bears.)

1177
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,530
(Some days are like this.)

1178
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:05,200
I'll cook braised aged kimchi first.

1179
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,839
(While Dong Il cooks braised aged kimchi, )

1180
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,840
(the menu that never fails...)

1181
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,240
(Suddenly standing up)

1182
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,850
(Na Ra takes a zipper bag?)

1183
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,250
(She puts a broth tablet and garlic into it.)

1184
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,790
(She takes a foam roller?)

1185
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:35,930
(Startled)

1186
00:51:35,931 --> 00:51:37,200
(Glancing at him)

1187
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:39,770
(Bang)

1188
00:51:39,771 --> 00:51:41,251
- What are you doing?
- Well, this...

1189
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:43,909
Give me a moment.

1190
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:45,879
You might crack the floor.

1191
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,239
- This...
- Garlic?

1192
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,379
I didn't expect it to be so weak.

1193
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,380
- Hold on.
- It's okay.

1194
00:51:49,381 --> 00:51:51,320
I'll go find somewhere with a flat ground.

1195
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,289
- Here. Put it on the cutting board.
- Oh, thank you.

1196
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,520
- In the middle. It's sturdy here.
- Okay.

1197
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:58,390
That's it.

1198
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,630
(He retreats quickly.)

1199
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,560
I don't think they'll be crushed easily since the roller is soft.

1200
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,660
I don't think... Does it work?

1201
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,099
That's it.

1202
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,840
(It works well, I see.)

1203
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:15,669
I'm making good use of this in an unexpected way.

1204
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:16,670
(Satisfied)

1205
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:23,150
(A brutal scene)

1206
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:26,950
(Flinching)

1207
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:29,819
(Banging)

1208
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,660
Who are you thinking of as you're smashing it?

1209
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,159
(Who do you think?)

1210
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,190
No.

1211
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,200
What are you thinking about?

1212
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,859
I hope it's not me.

1213
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,299
- It's not.
- I'm serious.

1214
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,330
It's not.

1215
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:47,169
I'll use the leftover ingredients...

1216
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,170
Yes.

1217
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:50,509
- to make rabokki.
- That sounds great.

1218
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,939
Do we have the rice cake...

1219
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,979
- for tteokbokki?
- That's why I'll use ramyeon.

1220
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,980
That's nice.

1221
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:57,050
- So everyone can have some.
- That's nice.

1222
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,479
That's nice.

1223
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,680
(His positive self is back.)

1224
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,389
Right, you like tteokbokki.

1225
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,390
Yes.

1226
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,120
It's time to show off your true skills. Tteokbokki.

1227
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,829
(Pouring out coarse chili powder)

1228
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,559
(She adds fine chili powder too.)

1229
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,230
(Pouring out a lot)

1230
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,570
(She makes the sauce without any hesitation.)

1231
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,110
It looks delicious.

1232
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,380
(In the unhesitating hands of the tteokbokki master, )

1233
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,550
(the sauce is getting ready.)

1234
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,880
(In the peaceful front yard...)

1235
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,290
Many people ride bicycles.

1236
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,660
- Sorry?
- Many ride bicycles.

1237
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,230
- Here?
- Yes.

1238
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,200
- Those people are bicycle campers.
- I see.

1239
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,300
Bike campers.

1240
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,470
They set up the tents in an instant.

1241
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:59,239
There are suddenly...

1242
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,250
- so many tents.
- What's happening?

1243
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,510
- They look like students, right?
- Yes.

1244
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,919
(The House's front yard is very different from yesterday.)

1245
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,960
Hey.

1246
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:15,529
(The members who went grocery shopping return.)

1247
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:16,690
What are you doing?

1248
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,730
- Is there anything I can help?
- No, you should rest.

1249
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,430
Don't do anything.

1250
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:25,139
Sit down there.

1251
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,439
- Okay.
- You can't do any work.

1252
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,870
There's nothing for you to do.

1253
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:29,440
There's nothing you can do.

1254
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,239
Don't move.

1255
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,309
(The guest is kicked out of the kitchen.)

1256
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,980
(In that case...)

1257
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,220
(Sighing)

1258
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,450
(Squatting down)

1259
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:45,319
(She plops down.)

1260
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,290
(What is she doing?)

1261
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:52,860
(She stares at something intensely.)

1262
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,369
(Considering)

1263
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:55,800
I have a feeling they have one.

1264
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:02,940
It'd be nice if I could find a four-leaf clover.

1265
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,250
(For the members who kept feeling bad for her, )

1266
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:11,579
(she starts looking for a four-leaf clover...)

1267
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,750
(which will bring luck to House on Wheels.)

1268
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:17,660
(Smiling)

1269
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,560
(Searching hard)

1270
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:30,000
(Extremely focused)

1271
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:36,510
I told you, didn't I?

1272
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,050
(She found a four-leaf clover!)

1273
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:42,949
It's a four-leaf clover.

1274
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:45,650
(The first luck of the House today!)

1275
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:47,620
I found another one.

1276
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,990
(Charging the House with luck)

1277
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,200
I found a five-leaf clover.

1278
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:05,000
(That's a sign of some insane luck!)

1279
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,640
She's having so much fun on her own.

1280
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,540
What is she doing?

1281
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,310
Are you looking for a four-leaf clover?

1282
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,209
- Yes.
- Did you find it?

1283
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,680
- I found it.
- That's amazing.

1284
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,550
Look for it under a shade.

1285
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,759
There are a lot of four-leaf clovers where there's a lot of sunlight.

1286
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,520
- Really?
- Yes.

1287
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:33,100
(While Lucky Hyun brings luck to House on Wheels)

1288
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,670
(Staring)

1289
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:40,269
A lot of Japanese dye their hair.

1290
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,669
- What?
- A lot of them dye their hair.

1291
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,710
Dyed yellow and red.

1292
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,849
Are they students?

1293
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:49,510
(People with dyed hair?)

1294
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:53,480
(Laughing happily, )

1295
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,250
(a group of locals walk in front of House on Wheels.)

1296
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,320
Are they high schoolers?

1297
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,390
- They clearly look young.
- Really?

1298
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,760
I'll ask if they're students.

1299
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:11,600
(Sauntering)

1300
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,740
(Hey...)

1301
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,340
Excuse me.

1302
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:16,610
(Bowing)

1303
00:57:16,611 --> 00:57:18,440
Excuse me. High school?

1304
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:20,239
- University.
- University.

1305
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,910
You're university students?

1306
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,220
You're all stylish and handsome.

1307
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,650
You look amazing.

1308
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:31,220
(They seem to have understood.)

1309
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,419
Cycling club?

1310
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,460
(They're from a cycling club.)

1311
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,699
As a summer camp,

1312
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,860
we're cycling around Hokkaido for two weeks.

1313
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,299
For two weeks?

1314
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,300
There are a lot of bears. It's dangerous.

1315
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,770
Has anyone of you seen bears?

1316
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,370
Bear?

1317
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:52,280
I saw it.

1318
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,910
That's a lie.

1319
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,080
It's true.

1320
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,119
When did he see it?

1321
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,560
(It really is a scary neighborhood.)

1322
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,790
(Meanwhile...)

1323
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:06,220
(Hee Won was observing from afar.)

1324
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,899
- They're university students.
- You make them line up like this,

1325
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,420
so it looks like you're scolding them.

1326
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,540
Excuse me.

1327
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,470
(A new frontier of the first encounter)

1328
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:25,140
What will you have for dinner?

1329
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,280
We'll cook ourselves.

1330
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,250
You'll cook yourselves?

1331
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:33,660
(At the news that the young students will cook themselves...)

1332
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,189
- Who likes kimchi?
- Kimchi.

1333
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:37,549
(He asks if they like kimchi.)

1334
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,690
Then...

1335
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,030
One of you come out and take it.

1336
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:46,860
Give me money.

1337
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,129
(I'll respond to your joke.)

1338
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,300
Thank you.

1339
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:56,810
(A rather fierce aged kimchi giving ceremony)

1340
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:58,840
They startled me.

1341
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:01,910
Things are strange over there.

1342
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,550
Why are they suddenly...

1343
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,649
building camaraderie?

1344
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:10,610
(It's a fascinating scene for introverted Na Ra.)

1345
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:14,460
Dong Il can make friends with anyone.

1346
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,200
He could become friends with a raccoon too.

1347
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,199
- Thank you.
- You can do it.

1348
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,669
(In the front yard they're staying for a short while, )

1349
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:24,700
Go.

1350
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,939
I was once like that.

1351
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:30,170
(they made new and unexpected bond.)

1352
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:33,239
- Dong Il. Did you become friends?
- Yes?

1353
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,180
That's what a trip does.

1354
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,779
You looked like a boss.

1355
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,280
(After a pleasant meeting...)

1356
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:44,120
I think we need another shelf.

1357
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:45,820
Na Ra.

1358
00:59:45,821 --> 00:59:47,119
(What's inside the box?)

1359
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,090
- What's this?
- Here.

1360
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,589
This is crazy.

1361
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,129
- It is. Look.
- Isn't this very expensive?

1362
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,540
- Is it alive?
- Yes, it's alive.

1363
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:57,110
(Something is alive in the box?)

1364
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,180
(Crabs?)

1365
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,119
(Hokkaido is surrounded by three seas.)

1366
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,350
(East sea, Pacific ocean, and Okhotsk sea)

1367
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,490
(It's a treasury of various fishery resources!)

1368
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,130
(Among them, Hokkaido is most famous for...)

1369
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:20,600
(Crabs.)

1370
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:24,200
(Out of the many Hokkaido crabs, )

1371
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:28,440
(there's a special kind of crab?)

1372
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:31,740
(This extraordinary-looking crab...)

1373
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:35,150
(is a hair crab.)

1374
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:39,450
We got a beautiful hairy crab. Just check that out right there.

1375
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:42,490
(Golden innards!)

1376
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,360
(Ethereal)

1377
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,129
Pass me that.

1378
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:49,760
(To cook the hair crabs properly, )

1379
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,859
(he brings the cypress steamer.)

1380
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:53,900
That... Yes.

1381
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:57,399
(He picks up one hair crab.)

1382
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,400
They're famous for this.

1383
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,710
(It's very hairy.)

1384
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,020
- It's live hair crab.
- That...

1385
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:07,580
- Look. Touch it.
- I'm sorry.

1386
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:08,910
You can't touch it?

1387
01:01:08,911 --> 01:01:10,810
(Although it doesn't look very pretty...)

1388
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:13,649
It's very valuable.

1389
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:15,170
(It's very valuable and hard to find.)

1390
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,960
(Placing it down gently)

1391
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:23,230
I came here to see the nature, but I'm eating nature.

1392
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:25,560
You're eating nature.

1393
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,069
- Do they fit?
- They can all fit in.

1394
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:31,070
(Hair crab, the best Hokkaido ingredient)

1395
01:01:31,071 --> 01:01:32,200
Nothing is impossible.

1396
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,309
Here, Hee Won.

1397
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:37,190
(Place them one by one in the cypress steamer.)

1398
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:41,310
(Bringing it back into the House)

1399
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:43,049
- Is there the lid there?
- Yes.

1400
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,310
(See you later.)

1401
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:46,850
Pass me that and urchin roe.

1402
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:49,349
The rice is cooked nicely.

1403
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:50,750
(The members start to cook dinner.)

1404
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:53,259
Today, for Seol Hyun...

1405
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,460
(Today's dinner concept is...)

1406
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:56,359
House on Wheels omakase.

1407
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,360
(House on Wheels' do-what-I-want restaurant for Seol Hyun)

1408
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,070
(From the cancellation of the whale watching...)

1409
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,440
(Out of the frying pan into the fire)

1410
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,839
- We saw it yesterday.
- We saw it yesterday.

1411
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,680
(Today was just out of one bear into another bear.)

1412
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,350
(At least for dinner, we'll serve you well.)

1413
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:17,650
Seol Hyun.

1414
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:18,679
(Seol Hyun is looking forward to it too.)

1415
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,950
- Isn't it great?
- Yes.

1416
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,990
Hee Won.

1417
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:24,990
The small rice bowl.

1418
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:26,859
- You know?
- Yes?

1419
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,636
The small rice bowl, the one like a soup bowl.

1420
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:32,029
Right. It's hot. Can you get three bowls...

1421
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:33,106
(Sushi King suffers yet again today.)

1422
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:34,359
of rice using those bowls...

1423
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,720
(He fails to hold back his laugh.)

1424
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:38,670
(I've never seen him like this.)

1425
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,070
In Shaolin Temple, they dip their hands in sand.

1426
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:44,270
It's hot.

1427
01:02:44,271 --> 01:02:45,309
(Dipping his hands in sushi rice until his bones and skin wear out)

1428
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:46,380
It's hot.

1429
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,809
- Do it after the rice cools down.
- It's hot. Sorry?

1430
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:53,120
After it cools down? He wants me to give it to him fast.

1431
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,920
It's hot.

1432
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,519
I love you very much.

1433
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,589
(We should serve the guest quickly.)

1434
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:58,620
It's hot.

1435
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:02,789
Get a chair and sit here.

1436
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:04,329
In an omakase restaurant, they serve you one by one...

1437
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:05,900
right next to you.

1438
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,070
I feel like I should play some classy music.

1439
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,239
And it's an omakase for one person.

1440
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,276
(Luxurious House on Wheels' Do-What-I-Want Restaurant)

1441
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,140
Since I only have one guest to attend to,

1442
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:19,339
- I feel very comfortable.
- I agree.

1443
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,810
(1 customer, 3 chefs)

1444
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:22,849
Hokkaido has clear water.

1445
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:24,126
(The first dish of our luxurious restaurant)

1446
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:25,249
Look at this.

1447
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:28,290
(Fresh urchin roe that you must have in Hokkaido)

1448
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:30,350
My gosh.

1449
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:34,420
(Ranked number 1 in review scores, sea urchin rice bowl)

1450
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:39,260
(Gulping)

1451
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:42,170
I've never crushed...

1452
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:44,740
sesame seeds with my hands for other guests.

1453
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,040
(Hand-rubbing technique)

1454
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,610
(It smells very savory.)

1455
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,680
If the seat is uncomfortable,

1456
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:56,549
you can wait comfortably over there.

1457
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:58,579
- Shall we move over there?
- Don't sit in front of the fire.

1458
01:03:58,580 --> 01:03:59,580
It's dangerous.

1459
01:03:59,581 --> 01:04:01,180
(Impressive hospitality)

1460
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:03,319
I'm getting the VIP treatment.

1461
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,000
Sitting in front of the fire is dangerous.

1462
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,689
- I recommend this.
- Okay.

1463
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:08,760
Try it.

1464
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:11,260
(Sniffing)

1465
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,500
(She's going to add some soy sauce first.)

1466
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:16,870
If you add too much, it'll ruin the essence of the food.

1467
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:19,440
- Here.
- Should I try just a mouthful?

1468
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,610
Try just a mouthful.

1469
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:25,279
(Pop the egg yolk...)

1470
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,610
(and mix it gently with urchin roe.)

1471
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,650
(She takes a nice, big mouthful.)

1472
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:41,490
It's so delicious.

1473
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:44,290
We've barely started.

1474
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:46,200
This is insane.

1475
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,670
(She eats...)

1476
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:55,210
(and eats.)

1477
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,940
(Completely lost in food)

1478
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:04,580
(But...)

1479
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:08,220
You've had this, right?

1480
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:11,250
No, we don't need to eat.

1481
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:14,990
Can I eat this myself?

1482
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:17,330
It's your day.

1483
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:19,429
It's Seol Hyun's day.

1484
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:20,700
(Today is Seol Hyun's day.)

1485
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:23,730
(The second dish for Seol Hyun)

1486
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,399
(It even has the torch performance.)

1487
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,570
Look at this.

1488
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:31,339
(Ranked Number 1 in performance, open-flame beef rice bowl)

1489
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,210
This is crazy!

1490
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:36,880
For our omakase,

1491
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:39,719
have the meat while it's still warm,

1492
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,850
and pop the egg yolk and dip the meat in it.

1493
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:43,919
Dip it in and eat it.

1494
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,059
(I want to eat quickly.)

1495
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,120
I recommend it.

1496
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,036
- Thank you for the food.
- No problem.

1497
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:50,060
Don't use the same spoon from the dish before.

1498
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,030
- The spoon starts here.
- Okay.

1499
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,430
(He kicked up a fuss for this beef rice bowl.)

1500
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:02,610
(When she takes a big bite)

1501
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:06,209
- How is it?
- It's so delicious.

1502
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:07,580
- It's delicious, right?
- Yes.

1503
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:11,449
- Make the scallops flat...
- I shall.

1504
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:12,810
So they can be placed on the rice.

1505
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:20,320
(Ranked Number 1 for its chewiness, grilled scallop sushi)

1506
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,729
(Put it on top.)

1507
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,830
- Is the rice ready?
- Yes, it's ready.

1508
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,729
Give me that. Place it on top.

1509
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:31,070
(Placing it gently)

1510
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,370
- What's wrong?
- Oh, dear.

1511
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,140
- Come on, Dong Il.
- You got flustered. You missed it.

1512
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,579
- I'm sorry.
- Don't act frivolously...

1513
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:39,939
when the guest is here.

1514
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:40,940
It's embarrassing.

1515
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,880
(It's fun to watch.)

1516
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,949
Shape it like a canoe.

1517
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:47,219
I just need to do this for both ends.

1518
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,250
Come on.

1519
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:50,890
Look. Like this.

1520
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:53,790
But look at yours. It's a rice ball.

1521
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:55,430
Compare them.

1522
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:58,929
Look at this. It's all stuck together.

1523
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:00,829
It's supposed to scatter like this.

1524
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:02,870
You need some air inside for the texture.

1525
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:05,339
- I got it.
- I taught you for 20 years,

1526
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,340
and there's still no improvement.

1527
01:07:06,341 --> 01:07:08,540
- Here. Do this.
- Okay.

1528
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:12,980
(I'll just eat sushi.)

1529
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,640
If you squeeze it tight, there won't be air left.

1530
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:19,650
- I put in some air.
- When?

1531
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,249
- It's so soft.
- Is it okay?

1532
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,389
- Yes.
- Is it good?

1533
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:26,960
- Yes.
- Because I made it. Look.

1534
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,930
From this state, the air...

1535
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,629
- Na Ra.
- Yes?

1536
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,360
- Come here and have some too.
- Come here.

1537
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:34,380
- Na Ra, come here.
- Have some sushi.

1538
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:37,930
Give Na Ra one. Don't make it so flat and wide.

1539
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:39,869
I made it well.

1540
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:41,100
(Darn it.)

1541
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,940
- I said canoe shape.
- Yes, canoe shape. Like this.

1542
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:46,180
- Like this.
- That's a ship.

1543
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:47,609
When can I eat?

1544
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:50,150
It's done. Here, Na Ra.

1545
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:53,349
- Let us have a plate too.
- Of course.

1546
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:55,189
(The chefs fight, but the food is good.)

1547
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:56,220
It's very delicious.

1548
01:07:57,090 --> 01:07:58,489
I think you can move on...

1549
01:07:58,490 --> 01:07:59,689
- to the next course.
- We can.

1550
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:00,760
(The awaited next course)

1551
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:03,990
(Apply oil on the griddle.)

1552
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,700
(Place thick pork belly.)

1553
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:20,540
(Sprinkle the magical powder you can't miss out.)

1554
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:23,479
I need to stir-fry kimchi with this.

1555
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,480
(Aged kimchi summoned.)

1556
01:08:24,481 --> 01:08:25,550
Put it here.

1557
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:27,950
There's a lot of rice, so add more.

1558
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,760
(Add a generous amount of kimchi.)

1559
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:37,430
(Aged kimchi sizzles in the pork belly oil.)

1560
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:39,899
Is it kimchi pork belly fried rice?

1561
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:40,900
That's right.

1562
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,520
(Griddle kimchi pork belly fried rice)

1563
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:44,770
I should torch it a bit.

1564
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,970
(Adding smoky flavor using the torch)

1565
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:53,140
The smoky flavor will be amazing, Hee Won.

1566
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:57,350
(The best griddle dish with all the delicious ingredients!)

1567
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:01,720
(Her expectations are getting higher.)

1568
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:07,420
Those Japanese guys must think I'm the best chef in Korea.

1569
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:09,960
They're all gathered and watching me.

1570
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:14,730
They came here to have fun, but they're just watching us.

1571
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,300
I should show off skills like cooking without looking.

1572
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:23,110
(A spatula performance without looking)

1573
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:26,710
(They're laughing!)

1574
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,150
(How cute.)

1575
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,520
I'm a cool...

1576
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,250
Korean chef.

1577
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:39,890
- Oh, my.
- Cool Korean chef.

1578
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,829
They gave you thumbs ups.

1579
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:43,830
(Smiling)

1580
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,360
I should let them taste this.

1581
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:50,230
Wait a minute.

1582
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,440
Korean fried rice.

1583
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:58,040
One bowl. I give you.

1584
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,280
(Clapping)

1585
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,080
(Laughing)

1586
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,620
This is the reaction you get.

1587
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,749
Your Japanese improved so much.

1588
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:11,366
(In just 10 days of being in Hokkaido, his Japanese improved.)

1589
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:13,119
- Let's put rice into it.
- Rice?

1590
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,666
(House on Wheels got unexpected guests.)

1591
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:18,090
(Quickly adding rice)

1592
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,100
(Covering the rice with pork belly...)

1593
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:26,000
(and kimchi)

1594
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,210
(He presses it brutally with the flippers.)

1595
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:34,410
(He spreads the smell of fired rice, )

1596
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:38,720
(and more friends gather around.)

1597
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:42,750
Are the hair crabs ready?

1598
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:44,290
(Still waiting for the order)

1599
01:10:44,291 --> 01:10:46,760
The hair craps are... Dong Il?

1600
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:48,090
Medium heat?

1601
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:50,329
- Eighteen minutes.
- Just turn on the heat.

1602
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:51,330
Just turn on the heat.

1603
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:53,329
It's 18 minutes after the water boils.

1604
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:55,370
(Turning on the heat)

1605
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:58,230
(Checking the time!)

1606
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,670
(Meanwhile, the fried rice...)

1607
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:04,070
(now looks mouth-watering.)

1608
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:07,310
(For the guests who waited a long time for it, )

1609
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:11,449
(he quickly serves the kimchi fried rice.)

1610
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:12,520
Okay.

1611
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:15,990
One bowl of kimchi fried rice.

1612
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:19,489
(Running)

1613
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:20,520
Thank you.

1614
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:23,960
(He looks at it.)

1615
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:27,529
(That looks incredible!)

1616
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:29,430
Please get a spoon.

1617
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,940
(Wild reaction)

1618
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:38,740
(They try it.)

1619
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:42,810
It's good.

1620
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:45,320
- Is it good?
- It's good.

1621
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:47,849
(Suspicious)

1622
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,320
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

1623
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:51,620
I want to ask if it's not too spicy.

1624
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,590
- It's perfect.
- It's not spicy.

1625
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:57,330
It's spicy for me.

1626
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:07,200
(But they all enjoy it.)

1627
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:10,570
It must be good.

1628
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:12,510
They are going for more.

1629
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:15,310
(It makes him happy too.)

1630
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:18,620
(Scraping the bowl)

1631
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,050
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1632
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:25,149
Thank you.

1633
01:12:25,150 --> 01:12:27,350
(They say good bye to the young people full of energy.)

1634
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:29,289
- They loved it.
- Did they?

1635
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:30,290
Yes, they loved it.

1636
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:31,606
(Meanwhile, inside the house, Na Ra...)

1637
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:33,529
(is protecting the hair crab and rabokki.)

1638
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:37,970
(Checking the steamer time)

1639
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,799
The hair crab is ready.

1640
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,440
- Is it ready?
- It's steamed.

1641
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,810
Did the water boil?

1642
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,609
Has it been 18 minutes since the water boiled?

1643
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:47,050
(18 minutes after the water boiled?)

1644
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:49,210
It needs to be steaming like crazy.

1645
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:52,050
- It needs to steam?
- Like when Mi Ran cooked.

1646
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:54,019
It needs to steam.

1647
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:55,079
(Yesterday, Mi Ran made steamed seafood.)

1648
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,990
(Steaming)

1649
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,760
(This is how it should look.)

1650
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:03,760
Wait. Should we...

1651
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:06,299
press down the lid?

1652
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,130
Should I put this on top?

1653
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:09,969
(He presses the lid with a bottle and seals it completely.)

1654
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:11,530
Then it will steam.

1655
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:15,070
We should just leave it like this. It will steam...

1656
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:16,370
while we eat rabboki.

1657
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:20,180
(How does the rabboki broth taste?)

1658
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,810
(I love it.)

1659
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:24,980
(She's excited to eat Na Ra's rabboki.)

1660
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,350
(She doesn't need scissors.)

1661
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:29,850
Let's add in the noodles.

1662
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:33,089
In they go.

1663
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:34,536
(She adds ramyeon noodles to the rich sauce.)

1664
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,530
(She adds the crumbs too.)

1665
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:38,260
Three.

1666
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:42,030
I thought we had some leftover seafood.

1667
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,600
There's nothing.

1668
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:48,099
(She pushes the noodles into the sauce.)

1669
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,540
I think it might be bland because there are too many noodles.

1670
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:54,310
(It smells delicious.)

1671
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,349
(When it boils, Na Rabokki is done.)

1672
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:58,610
Cheer up, Superpower

1673
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:00,379
Are you almost done, Na Ra?

1674
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,549
- Yes.
- Okay.

1675
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:02,590
(Shall we serve the food?)

1676
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:04,619
It's all done. I just need to serve it.

1677
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:05,620
Right.

1678
01:14:05,621 --> 01:14:07,701
(Kimchi pork belly griddle fried rice for Seol Hyun)

1679
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:10,790
(She takes photos from time to time.)

1680
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:14,699
Let's try this. It's aged kimchi.

1681
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:19,040
(Dong Il's aged kimchi stew)

1682
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,439
(It makes her mouth water.)

1683
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,510
(Goodness)

1684
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:28,850
(He added a very generous amount of pork just for Seol Hyun.)

1685
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:31,880
(She holds her breath and watches Dong Il move kimchi.)

1686
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,920
(I will eat you up, kimchi stew.)

1687
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:37,690
Rabboki looks amazing.

1688
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,219
(Spicy Na Rabokki is already boiling nicely.)

1689
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:41,620
Okay. It's done.

1690
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:44,689
(He turns back and looks at it.)

1691
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,560
That looks really good.

1692
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:50,430
(Rabboki would be good as it is, )

1693
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:54,900
(but she will add the pre-shredded Hokkaido string cheese to it!)

1694
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:56,270
You need the scoop, don't you?

1695
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:58,779
No, we are done outside.

1696
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:00,109
- Really?
- Yes.

1697
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:03,410
(She finishes it up by adding a generous amount of cheese.)

1698
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:05,619
(Na Rabokki keeps stopping him from leaving.)

1699
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:07,280
- What's that? Cheese?
- It's... Yes.

1700
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:14,720
(It's going to make everyone eat rabboki for dinner.)

1701
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:17,329
Should we eat standing up? Or should we sit down?

1702
01:15:17,330 --> 01:15:18,536
- Eat standing up?
- Sounds good.

1703
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,959
Na Ra, put it in the front.

1704
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,759
(A huge pot of Na Rabokki is served.)

1705
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,400
Okay. Goodness. Look at that rabokki.

1706
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,100
Amazing.

1707
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,169
Enjoy.

1708
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:29,210
(Enjoy, everyone.)

1709
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:34,110
(The spicy Na Rabokki will stimulate their appetite.)

1710
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:42,949
(Then they will cleanse their mouths with the red aged kimchi stew...)

1711
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:44,020
(and fried rice combo.)

1712
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:47,719
- Thank you for this.
- Thank you for this.

1713
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,006
(Today, they stand around the griddle and enjoy the feast.)

1714
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:51,690
- Let's try it.
- It's good.

1715
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,560
Is it good? Eat it with kimchi. Shred the kimchi first.

1716
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:55,930
Take one each.

1717
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:57,970
I know.

1718
01:15:57,971 --> 01:16:00,199
(She puts down her phone and hurriedly takes a bite.)

1719
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,200
(Yum)

1720
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:03,410
The fried rice is so flavorful.

1721
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,439
- Is it?
- The more you chew it,

1722
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,520
the more flavorful it gets.

1723
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:08,379
- It's so good.
- Is it?

1724
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:10,010
So flavorful.

1725
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:13,749
This is salty, so it goes well with the fried rice.

1726
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:14,780
Shred it and eat it.

1727
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,550
(She eats a big piece of kimchi stew.)

1728
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,030
(Happy)

1729
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,699
(She eats a big chunk of meat in one bite too.)

1730
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,729
What do you think?

1731
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:29,430
(Cheek full of food)

1732
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:31,700
That's so much rabokki.

1733
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:34,339
I want to share it with everyone.

1734
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,700
(The string cheese melted nicely.)

1735
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:37,069
(Cheese stretching)

1736
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,840
- You put cheese on top.
- Yes.

1737
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:41,140
Okay.

1738
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:42,780
(The cheese touches the light.)

1739
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:44,950
(The cheese put out the light.)

1740
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:49,420
(Blackout)

1741
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:52,520
What?

1742
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:53,960
(Flustered)

1743
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,529
I am sorry.

1744
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:56,530
(Coming to her rescue)

1745
01:16:57,090 --> 01:17:00,560
(The Hokkaido cheese was hiding its great power.)

1746
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,930
(Let me try some too.)

1747
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:05,100
(Stretch, cheese.)

1748
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:06,570
(When will it stop stretching?)

1749
01:17:06,571 --> 01:17:08,500
Goodness.

1750
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,170
(It's a very tough one.)

1751
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:13,979
- Let's cut it.
- You got it.

1752
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:15,039
I did it.

1753
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,050
(They worked together.)

1754
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:20,180
(She gets ready to eat Na Rabokki.)

1755
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:26,460
(Slurping neatly)

1756
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,620
(She goes for more Na Rabokki.)

1757
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:31,529
- It's so good.
- It's good.

1758
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:34,300
(Spicy rabokki sauce with stringy and flavorful cheese)

1759
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,900
(Na Rabokki was a huge success.)

1760
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:40,799
We didn't get to eat any Korean street food here.

1761
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:41,800
Right.

1762
01:17:41,801 --> 01:17:43,610
(Na Rabokki is very popular.)

1763
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:48,710
(You're supposed to eat it in one mouthful.)

1764
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:51,510
(Blowing on it)

1765
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,489
It's hot.

1766
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:58,410
(They eat the aged kimchi and rabokki together.)

1767
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:00,059
Gosh, this is good.

1768
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,289
(She finished one bowl in no time.)

1769
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:03,290
It's good.

1770
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:05,229
It pairs perfectly with kimchi stew.

1771
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:07,030
- I know.
- It's perfect.

1772
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,399
It's so good.

1773
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,680
(It's the perfect collaboration of the three red dishes.)

1774
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,699
(Na Ra suddenly goes into the house.)

1775
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:14,840
It's hot.

1776
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,239
(What is Na Ra up to?)

1777
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,240
It's hot.

1778
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:21,409
It's 53 minutes.

1779
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:23,080
(It's the hair crab steamer.)

1780
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:24,510
(Earlier)

1781
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:26,680
(Checking)

1782
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:28,250
It's starting to steam.

1783
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:30,590
- Let's set the timer now.
- Okay.

1784
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:33,959
It's 38. Plus 18 is...

1785
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,089
(Current time is 38 minutes. He will add 18 minutes to it.)

1786
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:36,229
- If we add 18 minutes...
- It will be too hard...

1787
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:37,359
if we over-steam it.

1788
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,666
Let's steam it for 15 minutes then.

1789
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:41,599
That's 38 minutes plus 15 minutes.

1790
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,600
(What's 38 minutes plus 15 minutes?)

1791
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,600
- That's 53 minutes.
- That's 53 minutes.

1792
01:18:43,601 --> 01:18:45,441
Okay. We will turn the heat off at 53 minutes.

1793
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,200
It's 53 minutes.

1794
01:18:47,201 --> 01:18:50,070
(The grand reveal)

1795
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:52,310
(Here is the Hokkaido hair crab.)

1796
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:58,990
(Moved by the hair crab)

1797
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:00,460
No way.

1798
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:02,390
We still have the main course.

1799
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:04,329
It looks most incredible.

1800
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:05,529
(The elegant-looking Hokkaido hair crabs are nice and steaming.)

1801
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:07,730
This is the beginning. The feast starts now.

1802
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,300
Come.

1803
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:13,640
(Seeing the hair crab for the first time, they get excited.)

1804
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,410
- Is this the hair crab?
- Hair crab.

1805
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:18,170
- Right.
- Amazing.

1806
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:19,410
There you go.

1807
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:21,010
Look at that steam.

1808
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:24,510
(Fascinated)

1809
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,319
It's the Hokkaido delicacy.

1810
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,619
(It's got the hair sticking out as the name "hair crab" suggests.)

1811
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:30,550
- It's very spiky.
- Yes.

1812
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:33,890
- It's more like a spine.
- Like a spine.

1813
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:37,590
This is extravagance.

1814
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:41,299
I think we've always been extravagant.

1815
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,969
(Thanks to the guests, the family always eats good food.)

1816
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:44,890
I had never had that much urchin roe in my life.

1817
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:46,839
It's the same for me.

1818
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,269
- I had never eaten that much of it.
- Me either.

1819
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:50,969
I had never eaten that much urchin roe...

1820
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:52,540
- in one bowl.
- Right.

1821
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,239
- They are very spiky.
- I know.

1822
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,649
It's fine if you wear gloves.

1823
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:57,980
(They look spiky and scary.)

1824
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:00,300
(Hee Won will have a one-on-one with the hair crabs.)

1825
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:01,920
(Determined)

1826
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:04,589
(He grabs the hair crab's leg and flips.)

1827
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:06,859
No. If you flip it, you will spill all the juice.

1828
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:09,019
- Will I?
- Just leave it like this,

1829
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:10,629
- and crack it open.
- How?

1830
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:11,660
(Crack it open?)

1831
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:14,099
Just grab it and crack it open. It will open easily.

1832
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,299
(It's his very first time doing it.)

1833
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:16,369
It's hot, isn't it?

1834
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:18,130
Pull the mouth.

1835
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,160
- Move these.
- How do you do it again?

1836
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,370
Here.

1837
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:24,109
(Curious)

1838
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:25,370
- That's it.
- This.

1839
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:27,840
I've never done something like this before.

1840
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,650
You can do it. That's it.

1841
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,719
He's using the principle of the lever.

1842
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,820
(He tries hard for the guest.)

1843
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,120
(Watching him closely)

1844
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:41,160
I got this, Dong Il.

1845
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:44,360
(He opens the hair crab!)

1846
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:46,399
- My goodness.
- It's open.

1847
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,500
Keep the juice.

1848
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:50,600
You should drink that.

1849
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:52,470
It's hot, isn't it?

1850
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,370
- Give it to Seol Hyun to drink.
- Here.

1851
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:58,070
- The juice.
- Drink it from the shell.

1852
01:20:58,410 --> 01:21:01,139
And scrape the sides using this.

1853
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:04,910
But actually, shouldn't we give her the best one?

1854
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:07,080
That's for you.

1855
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:08,550
- It's hot.
- Let's...

1856
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,519
cut it like this.

1857
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,860
- Do you want me to hold it?
- Look at that meat.

1858
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,619
- It's nice and fat.
- I know.

1859
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,029
(He cuts it so it's easier to eat.)

1860
01:21:16,030 --> 01:21:18,230
Show them the cross-section.

1861
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,000
(Surprised)

1862
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,329
(The packed meat makes you want to take a bite right away.)

1863
01:21:23,330 --> 01:21:24,629
- It's incredible, isn't it?
- What now?

1864
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,840
- How do you eat it?
- You should dig into it.

1865
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:28,839
(Na Ra puts on a glove and appears.)

1866
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,640
(Fearless)

1867
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:33,739
You have to cut the joint.

1868
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:35,780
(She easily cuts the claw by aiming for the joint.)

1869
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:36,910
(She even cuts it partly to make it easier to eat.)

1870
01:21:36,911 --> 01:21:38,249
Right. Like that.

1871
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,619
- You're making a cut.
- Yes.

1872
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:41,620
This way, it's easier to eat.

1873
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:42,850
Thank you.

1874
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,189
I will put it here.

1875
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:47,060
Should I crack open another one?

1876
01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:50,260
You can just use your hands.

1877
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,530
Really?

1878
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:53,170
Make sure you don't hurt your hands.

1879
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:57,630
(She easily opens it with her bare hands.)

1880
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:00,400
She's good. Goodness.

1881
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,270
(Impressed)

1882
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:04,709
Did you work at a crab restaurant?

1883
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:06,680
(The hair crabs are handed over to the guest.)

1884
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:08,279
(She cuts the hard shell easily too.)

1885
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,749
- She opens it well.
- I know.

1886
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:12,010
(She cuts the legs easily.)

1887
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,949
(She prepares the crabs very skillfully.)

1888
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:16,150
She's good.

1889
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:20,360
How can she be so good at cutting the crabs?

1890
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:22,960
You're an expert.

1891
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:24,990
You cut it really well.

1892
01:22:25,730 --> 01:22:27,100
She must've eaten a lot of crabs.

1893
01:22:28,730 --> 01:22:29,899
You must've eaten a lot of crabs.

1894
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,399
You should stop cutting and eat it while it's still warm.

1895
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,000
- Let's stop after that.
- Okay.

1896
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:35,740
What do you think?

1897
01:22:35,741 --> 01:22:38,309
I think it would be better if you dip the meat in tomalley.

1898
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:39,410
- Really?
- Yes.

1899
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,179
It's packed with flavor and just salty enough.

1900
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:44,180
Is it?

1901
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:46,450
- Is it good?
- Is it good?

1902
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,179
Dong Il, have some.

1903
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:50,290
(She removes the shells like an expert.)

1904
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:52,820
Nice.

1905
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:57,430
I feel like we need to shave the hair first.

1906
01:22:57,660 --> 01:22:59,190
(She's happy.)

1907
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:00,730
How can the meat be so soft?

1908
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:02,099
- I know.
- It's good, isn't it?

1909
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,800
(So this is how soft the hair crab is.)

1910
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:05,629
It smells like the sea urchin.

1911
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:06,939
(The hair crab meat is as creamy as sea urchin.)

1912
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,740
- It's good, isn't it?
- It's nice and soft.

1913
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:12,070
It's so good. It's nice.

1914
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:13,979
- It's so good.
- Look at this.

1915
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:14,980
(Surprised)

1916
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,709
(It's fun to scoop out the meat packed in the shell.)

1917
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:19,049
This is unbelievably good.

1918
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:21,279
(Na Ra enjoys the crab to the max.)

1919
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,320
Look at the meat. There's so much meat.

1920
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:26,420
(Happy)

1921
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:30,730
(Everyone is busy eating the hair crab.)

1922
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:32,999
It's so good.

1923
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,576
(Seol Hyun is in love with the flavor of the hair crab.)

1924
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:35,659
(When Seol Hyun meets the hair crab)

1925
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:38,230
(Separating the meat in her mouth)

1926
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:40,940
(She sucks out everything.)

1927
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:43,730
(She flips her baseball cap and digs in even more passionately.)

1928
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:44,870
(Eating one more bite)

1929
01:23:44,871 --> 01:23:46,740
(She can't stop eating the hair crab.)

1930
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:49,980
(Drinking the hair crab juice!)

1931
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:53,980
(She drinks it to the last drop.)

1932
01:23:55,650 --> 01:23:57,749
(He's happy seeing her eating well.)

1933
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,420
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

1934
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:00,619
It's incredible, isn't it?

1935
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:02,490
(They are happy that they met the hair crab.)

1936
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:06,129
I think I became a better cook.

1937
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:07,450
(Why is he suddenly saying that?)

1938
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:10,470
There are so many sauces that could splatter, you know.

1939
01:24:10,970 --> 01:24:12,970
But my t-shirt is clean.

1940
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,040
- Expert.
- I'm the expert now.

1941
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:18,610
Really.

1942
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:20,310
Isn't it surprising, Hee Won?

1943
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:22,680
There's crab on your mouth.

1944
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:24,550
I can't manage my mouth yet.

1945
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:27,120
(She wipes her mouth too.)

1946
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,450
That was a great meal.

1947
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:30,620
Let's drink some honey tea.

1948
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:33,119
Should we go and stare at the fire together?

1949
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,190
Sounds great.

1950
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:37,229
I made one beautiful fire.

1951
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:38,259
You sure did.

1952
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:39,699
It's perfect.

1953
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:40,900
(Thank you.)

1954
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:44,000
I'm sad that we didn't...

1955
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:46,340
get to see the whale.

1956
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:49,470
But it turned out well because we got to...

1957
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:51,840
talk to each other more.

1958
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:53,279
- I had a good rest.
- You...

1959
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,079
were trying to find a clover.

1960
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,279
- You were going around.
- That was...

1961
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,410
- That was lovely.
- That was so cute.

1962
01:24:58,710 --> 01:25:01,019
Did you really find the five-leaf clover?

1963
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:02,320
- Did you?
- A five-leaf clover?

1964
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:04,619
Yes. I found a five-leaf clover.

1965
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:06,560
It's my first time too.

1966
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:09,289
It's ridiculous, you know. For a clover to have five leaves.

1967
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:10,629
(She didn't get to see a whale, )

1968
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:12,690
(but she found the five-leaf clover.)

1969
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:17,030
(And they met the local students.)

1970
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,269
(Thanks to the whale, they made precious memories...)

1971
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:22,870
(and gained friends unexpectedly.)

1972
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:29,039
- Na Ra. How was...
- Right.

1973
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,580
- traveling with us?
- Right.

1974
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:33,550
It was an amazing experience.

1975
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,619
- Was it?
- Yes.

1976
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,519
What was so amazing about it?

1977
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:38,620
Crossing the ocean...

1978
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:42,990
is tough for everyone.

1979
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:44,630
It's tough for everyone,

1980
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:50,070
but it's like we went up a huge mountain together,

1981
01:25:50,530 --> 01:25:54,399
gave a big shout together, and came down. That's how it felt.

1982
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,669
(In a foreign land, she depended...)

1983
01:25:55,670 --> 01:25:56,990
(on the family as they traveled.)

1984
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,679
I think I will remember it for a long time,

1985
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,410
and it will help me in life.

1986
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:03,410
- That's what I thought.
- Right.

1987
01:26:04,210 --> 01:26:05,250
Now you can't complain...

1988
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:08,179
when we go back to Seoul.

1989
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:09,819
(You meant you enjoyed it too, right?)

1990
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:11,619
I will see you in Seoul.

1991
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:14,520
I am sorry.

1992
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:16,430
(He's naughty.)

1993
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,869
I want to go home now.

1994
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:24,670
I am sick of aged kimchi.

1995
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,069
Seeing anything yellow resembling sea urchin makes me sick.

1996
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:29,540
I'm so tired of it.

1997
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:32,240
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

1998
01:26:32,241 --> 01:26:34,509
Let's get up and go.

1999
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:36,710
(House on Wheels is always fun when they are together.)

2000
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,520
(Sung Dong Il)

2001
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:55,890
(Kim Hee Won, Jang Na Ra)

2002
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:03,700
(House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean)
