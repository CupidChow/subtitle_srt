00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,440
(Sung Dong Il)

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,980
(Kim Hee Won, Jang Na Ra)

3
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,820
(House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean)

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,189
(Last night in Shimonoseki)

5
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,130
This is our last day in the southern part.

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,600
We need to go to Hokkaido.

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,930
In kilometers...

8
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,299
It takes three and a half hours by plane.

9
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,300
- Oh, my.
- Really?

10
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:48,110
It takes three and a half hours, even though it's within Japan.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
- That's far.
- Goodness.

12
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:53,109
We need to travel 1,830km.

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,609
(Our house will travel approximately 1,830km!)

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,680
So it's goodbye to these two.

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,079
I guess.

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,679
(Joking)

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,620
- Good job, youngster.
- Thank you.

18
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,289
Watch the Sapporo episodes later.

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,319
- Okay.
- Yes.

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,290
(Time to say goodbye to friends we grew close to...)

21
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,359
(and take our house to a new place!)

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,629
(Front yard, Maizuru Port, Tokyo)

23
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:18,369
(After driving for 6 hours and 30 minutes)

24
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,099
(Otaru Port, Sapporo, Hokkaido)

25
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,779
(House on Wheels crosses the ocean another time.)

26
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,380
(House on Wheels crosses the ocean another time.)

27
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,320
(We arrived in a new world.)

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,360
(Have you been well?)

29
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,689
(I am...)

30
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,960
(doing well.)

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,139
(The setting of the movie "Love Letter")

32
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:00,210
(The setting of the movie "Love Letter")

33
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,820
(A place where romance piles up during the snowy season)

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:16,190
(A well-loved winter destination)

35
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,800
(Hokkaido)

36
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,409
(But...)

37
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,310
(when the snow melts and summer comes to Hokkaido...)

38
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,019
It's already cool here.

39
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,420
(Under the cool blue breeze...)

40
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,490
(are new sides to Hokkaido.)

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,730
(This colorful summer,)

42
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:56,500
(we'll explore the special live of the Hokkaido people.)

43
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,739
The nature here is very well preserved.

44
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,770
(The other owners of this place, the wildlife)

45
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,079
- There's a fox on the road.
- This is so cool.

46
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,110
I don't think I've ever seen a fox in nature.

47
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,679
I see deer.

48
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,150
- Where?
- Oh, I see them.

49
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,580
- Here.
- Deer!

50
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,150
Hi!

51
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,520
(Things from the ocean)

52
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,289
(Gifts from the bountiful land)

53
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,790
Try this lamb chop.

54
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,300
(We meet the "flavor of Hokkaido," the epitome of gastronomy.)

55
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,499
(Our first summer in Hokkaido)

56
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,940
This is so nice.

57
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,410
It's just pure nature.

58
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,780
It looks more magical to me because of the fog.

59
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,880
It'd be nice to put up the tent here.

60
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,179
(House on Wheels’ trip...)

61
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,150
(to our neighboring country really begins now.)

62
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,630
(9:30pm, Otaru Port, Hokkaido)

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,770
(Our house arrived in Otaru, the treasure of Hokkaido.)

64
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,239
(Now, we head to the western coast of Hokkaido.)

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,270
Let's go.

66
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,410
Let's go. Our trip is beginning.

67
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,810
Go.

68
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,550
The ocean is right next to us.

69
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,420
- Gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

70
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,690
(Next to the vast ocean)

71
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,589
It feels nice because the ocean is so close.

72
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,630
(A long coastal road)

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,199
It's right below there.

74
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,700
This is a real coastal road.

75
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,470
(Past the green forest road,)

76
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,679
(we head to another magnificent view.)

77
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,080
One thing I love about Hokkaido...

78
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,579
is the wide-open view.

79
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,420
(Hokkaido's landscape has a wide-open view.)

80
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,150
The scenery here is so...

81
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,060
What is this?

82
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,929
(The view, weather, and mood.)

83
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,460
(Everything is perfect today.)

84
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,559
(Let's keep this nice mood.)

85
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,899
Let's only say positive things.

86
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,970
Sounds good.

87
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,539
Na Ra. Say lots of positive things on this trip.

88
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,540
Okay.

89
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,870
- Let go of our anger.
- Yes.

90
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,339
Sounds good.

91
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,609
- Me too.
- Yes.

92
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,010
This is nice.

93
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,750
Positive.

94
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,650
- A positive mind.
- Yes.

95
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,149
- Sounds good.
- Sounds good.

96
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,189
Yes.

97
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,420
(This positive trio...)

98
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,059
(will drive through Hokkaido...)

99
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,930
(and spread the power of positivity.)

100
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,069
(Where are the going on their first day in Hokkaido...)

101
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,299
(with lots of optimism on board?)

102
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,410
There are great walking paths...

103
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,140
with beautiful views of the ocean.

104
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,480
Apparently, they're going to be waiting for us.

105
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,020
(Someone is waiting for our members?)

106
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,950
- You haven't met yet, right?
- Right.

107
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,490
They're so nice.

108
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,559
That's why we liked them so much.

109
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,989
Their face just says...

110
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,600
- "I'm nice," right?
- Yes.

111
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,700
They have such kind eyes.

112
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,070
Also,

113
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,070
they are good-looking.

114
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,739
- We...
- They're really tall, right?

115
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,740
Their DNA is different from ours.

116
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,210
I'm jealous.

117
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,439
Don't stand next to them, Na Ra.

118
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,809
Stand next to us.

119
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,149
I'll stand about 10m away.

120
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,120
Standing next to them hurts my pride.

121
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,249
Hee Won is similar. Hee Won is tall.

122
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,290
Right.

123
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,220
I'm not that tall.

124
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,459
(Pleased)

125
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,890
They really like our house.

126
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,799
Just a few days after,

127
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,970
they went to the army.

128
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,569
I'm curious.

129
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,540
(On our way to meet the mysterious guest)

130
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,370
I wonder if they look different.

131
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,140
- They must look the same.
- Really?

132
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,739
We're here.

133
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,110
(Our first guest in Hokkaido is waiting for us here.)

134
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,149
- Okay. Let's go meet them.
- Nice.

135
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,219
(We arrived at the walking path with the nice view!)

136
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,320
Perfect.

137
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,390
Look at this view, Na Ra.

138
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,589
It's like a movie.

139
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,490
(Right next to our house)

140
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,699
I guess you take those paths.

141
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,730
(A vast, green walking path)

142
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,569
- Feel the wind.
- It's nice.

143
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,900
- Isn't it so refreshing?
- It is.

144
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,870
This is so nice.

145
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,840
- This side is pretty too.
- Seriously.

146
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,409
How is this real?

147
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,910
(They love the Hokkaido scenery.)

148
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,179
What is this?

149
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,849
- Are you a fox?
- Where?

150
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,180
(Hello.)

151
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,690
It's a fox.

152
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,019
It's a fox.

153
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,020
(A wild fox roams around like a village dog.)

154
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,129
Oh, my goodness. Hey.

155
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,490
(You can hear the sounds of crows all over.)

156
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,030
(While our members are distracted by the owners of Hokkaido,)

157
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,739
(today's guest is forgotten...)

158
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,740
They're looking at a fox.

159
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,980
(Will they just forget about him?)

160
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,980
(I can feel someone's eyes on me...)

161
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,950
But where is he?

162
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,120
Did he go to the bathroom? I see a bathroom there.

163
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,859
Is he coming out of the bathroom?

164
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,090
(The members finally begin to look for our guest.)

165
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,499
(And behind them,)

166
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,200
(a small dot starts to move.)

167
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,070
(With his hat pulled down,)

168
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,810
(he starts to show himself.)

169
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,940
Really?

170
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,010
(Dong Il happened to look back.)

171
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,079
Hey, isn't that him with his head down intentionally?

172
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,250
- Who?
- With the hat.

173
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,789
(Running away)

174
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,020
Oh, he's going around.

175
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,260
Is it not him?

176
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,460
- I guess not.
- I guess he's not here yet.

177
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,199
What time is it now?

178
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,300
- It's nine...
- No, I told you. It's him.

179
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,970
(It looked as if he was about to pass by them on the path.)

180
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,039
(U-turn.)

181
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,670
(Quietly walking over)

182
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,309
(He was about to stand up again.)

183
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,169
No, I told you. It's him.

184
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,180
Oh, no!

185
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,279
No, I told you. It's him.

186
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,809
(Dong Il caught him.)

187
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:18,819
Oh, no!

188
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,619
(Today's guest!)

189
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,650
(Laughing)

190
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,359
Of course, I recognize his walk.

191
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,620
(Hee Won and Dong Il are both happy to see...)

192
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,429
(our first guest in Hokkaido,)

193
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,829
(Gong Myoung)

194
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,499
- Dong Il!
- Oh, gosh.

195
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,770
Oh, our youngest.

196
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,070
Where were you?

197
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,140
(Dong Il's favorite youngster)

198
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,670
This is seriously the best.

199
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:44,739
(Hee Won, watch out.)

200
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,079
(Bee!)

201
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
(Got you.)

202
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,150
(Look at this guy.)

203
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,549
(He can even warm up to chic Hee Won.)

204
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,579
- What?
- I got it.

205
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,090
(Our ex-youngster, Gong Myoung)

206
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,930
(Myoung is so good with his words...)

207
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,589
(Even the guests fell in love with him.)

208
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,099
(A hug from behind... Laughing)

209
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,030
(Even the guests fell in love with him.)

210
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,429
(Once you enlist,)

211
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,970
(you must feel so...)

212
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,340
(Myoung went to the army at the end of the season.)

213
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,680
Long time, no see.

214
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,080
(He is back and cooler than ever!)

215
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,780
(He played his first villain role in "Mercy for None.")

216
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,089
What are you doing?

217
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,759
("Love Untangled," a teen romance)

218
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
(He worked with Eun Soo.)

219
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,860
(Deeply emotional acting in "Citizen of a Kind")

220
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,160
(Gong Myoung busily expanded his acting range.)

221
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,230
(I'm sorry I'm so late.)

222
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,940
(I'm here!)

223
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,939
(It's nice to see you, Myoung!)

224
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,940
Hello.

225
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,849
You seem a bit displeased.

226
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,649
- I don't like you that much.
- Don't be like that.

227
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,680
(Acting cool)

228
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,019
Here. Say hello.

229
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,719
- Hello.
- It's your first time meeting.

230
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,620
- We show off about you a lot.
- I heard so much about you.

231
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,889
They kept talking about you.

232
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,990
(I heard so much about you!)

233
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,160
Did you already take a way up there?

234
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,730
No, I just walked up...

235
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,570
- to here.
- To look cool?

236
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,770
- Yes.
- I see.

237
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,040
- I wanted a pretty entrance.
- I see.

238
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,270
(For his pretty entrance, Myoung...)

239
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,110
(tried this...)

240
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,350
(and this.)

241
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,579
- I told you. It's him.
- Oh, no!

242
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,789
(He was caught so easily.)

243
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,850
I caught you... Hey.

244
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,520
I caught him right away. It was obviously his walk.

245
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,060
- I have good senses.
- But how did you...

246
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
You were walking up here...

247
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,459
Four years... It's been four years.

248
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,159
It's been 3 years... and 8 or 10 months.

249
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,229
Right, it's been 3 years and 8 months.

250
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,299
Really?

251
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,170
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Me?

252
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,939
(Feeling around)

253
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,040
- Do I look the same?
- Yes.

254
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,210
Hey. Since he went to the military...

255
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,840
(Grabbing his arm)

256
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,909
(Feeling shy)

257
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,979
(But flexing!)

258
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,650
Dong Il. This is impressive.

259
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,419
- Since you went to the military...
- You're totally different.

260
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,249
(You're totally different!)

261
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,119
You became much more manly.

262
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,320
Seriously. He's much stronger.

263
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,060
Wait. Why...

264
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,760
(Flexing one more time!)

265
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,259
(So cute.)

266
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,229
What do you think about our new youngest member?

267
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,300
(How do you feel meeting Nara for the first time?)

268
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,870
You're very...

269
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,069
- small and cute.
- Thank you.

270
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,070
(Gasping)

271
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,539
(Inching over)

272
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,950
Relax, Na Ra.

273
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,080
He's so big...

274
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,890
Oh, my. He's very tall. Goodness.

275
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,920
- Oh, my goodness.
- You...

276
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,860
(Na Ra was quite surprised at his height.)

277
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,890
I told her not to stand next to you. That's why she's standing there.

278
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,260
She normally doesn't talk...

279
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:54,700
- about things like that.
- I feel like a thumb.

280
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,200
(161cm, A thumb?)

281
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,899
She normally doesn't talk...

282
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,339
- about things like that.
- I feel like a thumb.

283
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,639
- Na Ra. Don't worry.
- Yes?

284
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,840
(He's so sweet.)

285
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,810
I...

286
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,150
I'm a bit jealous.

287
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,490
I'm a guest?

288
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,559
Seriously. Before he went to the military, he told us...

289
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,790
- to keep his spot open.
- Right, he did ask us that.

290
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,959
(You need to keep this spot open...)

291
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,130
(until I am discharged!)

292
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,230
(Who will be the next youngster?)

293
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,770
(Don't you dare come...)

294
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,109
Then I saw the next season...

295
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,370
(I'm sad.)

296
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,140
(The current season's youngster can't do anything but laugh.)

297
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,339
You three can sleep in the car.

298
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,340
I'm glad you're here.

299
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,419
- Seriously. I wanted to see you.
- I'm really glad you're here.

300
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,749
- Let's go.
- Okay.

301
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,590
(Let's walk up the path!)

302
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,589
You became so much cooler.

303
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,790
- Me?
- Right? You became so...

304
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,190
This is impressive.

305
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,890
- He really came back as a man.
- Totally.

306
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,900
- Which way do we go?
- To the left here.

307
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,129
(Which place in Hokkaido will they check out first?)

308
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,070
This place has operating hours too.

309
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,970
- Oh, from 8am...
- I see.

310
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,840
I guess you can see the ocean well from up there.

311
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,550
(What scenery awaits them over that hill there?)

312
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,350
This hill must be nothing for you, Myoung.

313
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,089
- Right?
- Yes.

314
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,589
(Yes, of course!)

315
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,160
While we take about 20 steps,

316
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,930
I think you only need to take about 12 steps.

317
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,830
(That's what our self-proclaimed Thumb said.)

318
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,510
How did it feel when you decided to come to House on Wheels again?

319
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,610
For me...

320
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,609
This isn't an emotion I've personally felt yet...

321
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,680
How can I put it?

322
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,549
It's like visiting my family after getting married.

323
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,589
(Happily laughing)

324
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,390
- Really?
- Yes, that familiar...

325
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,859
I just came thinking I wanted to see you all soon.

326
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,260
Also, Myoung went to the military as soon as that was over.

327
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,599
Yes, almost right after.

328
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,530
- Right away, right?
- Yes.

329
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,800
So you were extra sad.

330
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,200
You two teased me so much.

331
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
- To go to the military soon?
- Yes.

332
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:15,010
(You two teased me so much...)

333
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,169
Myoung, you can just be quiet and leave.

334
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,080
(They had fun teasing Myoung before he joined the military.)

335
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,580
(Be quiet and leave?)

336
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,420
- To go to the military soon?
- Yes.

337
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,979
How does it feel now that you're done?

338
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,819
(Myoung finished military service without any issues.)

339
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,660
Now that I'm done,

340
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,459
- I feel so comfortable.
- You feel so?

341
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,759
Yes, I feel so comfortable.

342
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,960
Time goes by so fast, right?

343
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,399
I felt...

344
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,230
the time went by so slowly while I was there.

345
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,330
Now that I'm out, it flies by so fast.

346
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,839
You became more handsome and healthy. It's nice to see.

347
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,140
(Myoung's time flows faster than others.)

348
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,479
- You haven't had breakfast, right?
- You haven't eaten yet, right?

349
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,580
- That's right.
- I see.

350
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,850
- I came a bit earlier.
- Right. Why?

351
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,419
My brother is performing in Japan right now.

352
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,320
Your real younger brother? Right, your brother is a singer.

353
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,320
- I see.
- Right. His brother is famous too.

354
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,329
The member of NCT named DOYOUNG...

355
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,230
is my younger brother.

356
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,600
He's an idol group member.

357
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,730
I think I've heard that name.

358
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,670
Has your brother gone to the military too?

359
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,669
- You're asking about him now?
- This year...

360
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,410
- He'll go this year. Yes.
- He should soon.

361
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,409
Your military-related questions even went to your brother.

362
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,580
(After checking in on each other for the first time in a while...)

363
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:32,450
So my parents are in Japan right now.

364
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,020
- I see.
- Over there.

365
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,090
- Are they traveling there?
- No.

366
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,489
This is insane.

367
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,260
(Gasping)

368
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,429
Oh, my. This is cool.

369
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,860
(The view over the hill...)

370
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,770
(makes everyone exclaim.)

371
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,100
- Oh, my. This is pretty.
- Oh, my!

372
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,170
(What is the first place in Hokkaido they wanted to see with Myoung?)

373
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,479
- Oh, my.
- This is so cool.

374
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,910
(Over the bendy road...)

375
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,250
(is the vast, blue Hokkaido ocean.)

376
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,130
(The tall, rocky cliffs above the waves welcome us.)

377
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:21,330
(Where is this place, the start of our Hokkaido journey?)

378
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,199
(Sapporo, Hokkaido)

379
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,900
(The end of the western coast of Hokkaido)

380
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,509
(A hidden treasure of Hokkaido, Shakotan Peninsula)

381
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,580
- This is pretty.
- Oh, my.

382
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,180
Oh, my. This place is so...

383
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,550
This is so cool.

384
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,590
This is so cool.

385
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,020
Oh, my.

386
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Oh, my goodness.

387
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,889
Hey, Na Ra. Look over there.

388
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,990
(A small trail placed on nature)

389
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,099
This is so pretty.

390
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,770
(This path on the cliff feels like you're walking on waves.)

391
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,599
(What's at the end of this path?)

392
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,039
This is so cool.

393
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,270
(What's at the end of this path?)

394
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,670
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, my.

395
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,680
(When they stop walking and look around,)

396
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,849
(they see a refreshingly blue ocean.)

397
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,919
This is so pretty.

398
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,290
(they see a refreshingly blue ocean.)

399
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,419
(In Japan, they call this color...)

400
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,530
(Shakotan blue!)

401
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,199
(Shakotan blue ocean makes them speechless.)

402
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,529
This is nice.

403
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,900
(The Shakotan blue ocean makes them speechless.)

404
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,470
(Taking his camera out right away!)

405
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,439
Oh, my. Amazing.

406
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,540
(He can't help but take pictures of this coloring.)

407
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,350
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, my.

408
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
This feels exactly like Seongsan Ilchulbong.

409
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,719
It feels like Jeju Island.

410
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
Right?

411
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,090
Na Ra, doesn't this place really feel like Jeju Island?

412
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,759
- They're very similar.
- Exactly.

413
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
(Hee Won is kind of right...)

414
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,299
This island was formed...

415
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,500
from volcanoes, wind, water, and things like this, right?

416
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,240
- Right. It's all natural.
- Right. Exactly.

417
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,769
(Seongsan Ilchulbong, Shakotan Peninsula)

418
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,070
(They have peculiar rocks at the tip and similar topographies.)

419
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,680
(They both also have majestic views.)

420
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,279
- It's so nice and cool.
- This breeze is nice.

421
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,949
- The wind is so nice.
- Right, Na Ra?

422
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,020
- Right? Isn't it nice and cool?
- It is.

423
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,750
Hee Won, I think this is a place...

424
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,590
to come with close friends and family.

425
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,059
You shouldn't come with strangers.

426
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,060
How come?

427
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,189
- You know...
- What?

428
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,460
- You could get pushed over.
- Come on, no way.

429
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,930
(Trembling)

430
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,340
(Next to the railing is a cliff.)

431
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,309
Only come with people you're close to.

432
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,339
(Na Ra’s terrifying one-line review)

433
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,410
(Closing in)

434
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,619
But still, this place is beautiful.

435
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,789
- It's gorgeous.
- Right?

436
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,689
(Only come with people you're close to.)

437
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,420
Isn't it like some painting?

438
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
Exactly.

439
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,689
(Terrifying at times, and painting-like at other times)

440
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,430
Are there no dolphins here?

441
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,560
Jeju Island had some.

442
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,129
The dolphins were right in front of me back on Jeju Island.

443
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,670
(Shakotan Peninsula feels familiar yet unfamiliar.)

444
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,339
After getting discharged, you were in about two works, right?

445
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,340
Yes.

446
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:22,509
You look really kind and handsome,

447
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,250
just like me when I was young.

448
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,480
If only I were a little younger.

449
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,820
But you can't defy the passing of time.

450
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,619
Really, you've become quite robust.

451
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,290
I'm different from Hee Won. From what I see, he won't last long.

452
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,459
(Already tired)

453
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,029
Had I been a little younger,

454
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,730
all of your roles would've been mine.

455
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,639
- When you grow older...
- Yes?

456
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,310
You should know, since you've worked out.

457
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,780
I realized I should make it a habit when I'm a day younger.

458
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,940
With that, I lost about 10kg in 2 months.

459
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,650
I started before the shoot began.

460
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,850
Take care of yourself.

461
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,949
Seriously, you should.

462
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,190
(A whole bundle of stories they've wanted to share)

463
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,320
- How nice.
- Oh, no.

464
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,829
- The breeze feels cold, right?
- Yes.

465
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,129
Looking down gave you a shock, right?

466
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,960
I wasn't thinking about it, so I was taken aback.

467
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,899
- You're fine.
- The floor is perforated.

468
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,429
We're not that far from the ground, so it's okay.

469
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,669
- Right?
- Yes.

470
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,399
(It's open below.)

471
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
It's okay.

472
00:21:19,401 --> 00:21:20,839
(She says it's okay,)

473
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,140
(but a guardrail hangs over a cliff.)

474
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,080
(Glancing)

475
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,280
(Na Ra is moving to the side despite saying she's fine?)

476
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,990
(Walking awkwardly)

477
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,450
(Glancing)

478
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,820
(Laughing)

479
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:43,929
Na Ra, aren't you walking too cautiously?

480
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,660
No, it's just slippery here.

481
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,900
(Right next to the guardrail is the ocean.)

482
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,899
(Glancing)

483
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,099
Aren't you scared because the bottom is hollow?

484
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,210
No.

485
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,040
This much is... Come on, Hee Won. This is no biggie.

486
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,849
(And yet, she keeps her eyes straight.)

487
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,980
(Just come with people you're close to.)

488
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,449
(The sea breeze hits from all sides.)

489
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,690
It feels really nice.

490
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,019
It's like the AC is on.

491
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,730
The temperature...

492
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,299
during the trip before this one was in the mid-30s,

493
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,669
so we had to take breaks.

494
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,670
(Yesterday in Shimonoseki: 33°C, Today in Hokkaido: 26°C)

495
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,270
- Unbelievable.
- How picturesque.

496
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,870
Look at the color of the ocean, Dong Il.

497
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,109
Goodness, look at the ocean.

498
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,810
- The color of the water is...
- Na Ra, look at the ocean.

499
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,549
Goodness. You can see through the ocean.

500
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,550
Right?

501
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,990
The color of the water...

502
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,159
- is really green, isn't it?
- Yes.

503
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,300
(Shakotan Peninsula's clear ocean color)

504
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,260
(Neither blue nor green,)

505
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,770
(it's between emerald and cobalt blue.)

506
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,270
(The more they walk, the more beautiful the scenery gets.)

507
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,420
You get a different feeling from Seongsan Ilchulbong, right?

508
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,549
Exactly.

509
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,620
(Shakotan Peninsula's ocean color is similar yet different.)

510
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,319
(What's Dong Il's one-line review?)

511
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,190
We should definitely try the urchin roe caught here.

512
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,289
- Urchin roe caught here?
- I'm in.

513
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,389
- Do you like urchin roe?
- Yes.

514
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,430
Okay.

515
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,359
I'll have you eat urchin roe by the bucketful.

516
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,669
(Let's have a Hokkaido urchin roe party.)

517
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,670
Or by the scoopful.

518
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,970
What might we see at the top, Dong Il?

519
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,469
- The ocean.
- Will we see the endless ocean?

520
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,780
(They want to know what's at the end of the hill more than ever.)

521
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,110
Hee Won, you're swaying too much.

522
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,079
I'm at my limit.

523
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,320
(The last crisis)

524
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,450
You can do it, Na Ra.

525
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,390
Okay.

526
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:52,920
(Cheering each other on)

527
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,659
We're here.

528
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,790
(They finally reach the end of the hill!)

529
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,200
In technical terms, this is what you call the open ocean.

530
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Really.

531
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,100
This place is beautiful.

532
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,169
(The wind is blowing from all sides.)

533
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,600
This must be the sound of the wind.

534
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,169
Yes, you're right.

535
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,680
(The wind is blowing from all sides.)

536
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,580
It's a bummer that our House can't make it this far.

537
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,380
- It's the perfect place, isn't it?
- Yes.

538
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,820
But the house might fly away in the sea breeze.

539
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,419
- Yes, it would.
- Right?

540
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,420
Who? Me?

541
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,520
- Forget it. Don't mind us.
- I meant our House.

542
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,420
- Our House?
- Yes.

543
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,500
(If it had come, it would've ended up like this?)

544
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,970
(Heading to the very end of the hill)

545
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,340
(Amazing!)

546
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:49,580
(What did Myoung see from the edge of the hill?)

547
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,150
(The end of the Shakotan Peninsula)

548
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,990
(The candlestick rock waiting for Myoung)

549
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,430
Look at Myoung acting all cool alone over there.

550
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,929
(They haven't spotted the candlestick rock yet.)

551
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,829
- Myoung has become manly.
- He's tall with a small face.

552
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,370
He's become more manly.

553
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,739
Myoung has become so cool.

554
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,540
(The observing trio)

555
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:21,410
(But why, when they've come all the way to the end?)

556
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,350
Stay right there.

557
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,079
Is it different?

558
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,819
(What's there to act all cool about?)

559
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,090
(Thumbs-up)

560
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,620
Which side? That side?

561
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:35,389
I think people come here to see that rock.

562
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,730
So there's a rock. I see.

563
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,400
That rock?

564
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,399
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

565
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,229
People come here to see that rock.

566
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,429
(Massive from the front)

567
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,470
They come to see the rock.

568
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,540
What a cool rock.

569
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,010
Gosh, it's so cool, Myoung.

570
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,780
That's the only rock standing straight up.

571
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,610
The bottom looks like a stand of some sort.

572
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,949
- It's above the water. Right?
- It's like a stone statue.

573
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,150
It looks like a steppingstone.

574
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,849
- Like that?
- I see it.

575
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,660
The rock after it is too small, so it stopped halfway.

576
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,330
Right? It can't jump on it.

577
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,960
The small rocks look like islands.

578
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,160
- Right.
- Yes.

579
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,499
The color of the ocean is just so pretty.

580
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,930
- The color?
- Yes.

581
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,900
It reminds me of gummies.

582
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,769
I'm glad we came here. It's refreshing.

583
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,539
- Exactly.
- Yes, the breeze.

584
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,010
(We’d have missed it without Myoung!)

585
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,620
(What did Dong Il spot at the end of the Shakotan Peninsula?)

586
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,560
This must be where you make a wish. Look at all the money.

587
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,060
There's a pile of money.

588
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
Money?

589
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,270
(Coins are thrown even at tourist spots in Japan!)

590
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,669
- Shall we try?
- Yes. Do you have coins?

591
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,970
- Here.
- Really?

592
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,310
(It's challenging in both height and distance!)

593
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,090
I really want to succeed.

594
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,389
Me too. You should make a wish first.

595
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,420
Oh, right.

596
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,230
(Her competitiveness took over. She makes a wish.)

597
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,629
(After making a wish)

598
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,630
All right.

599
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,930
- There are no takebacks.
- Come on.

600
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,610
Here. Bye.

601
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,779
(Goodbye, dear wish.)

602
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,749
- Myoung.
- Shall I go first?

603
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,750
Make a wish first.

604
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:42,349
Make a wish for the 4 of us to appear in Season 6.

605
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,419
(Wishing for Season 6 of House on Wheels)

606
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,449
Okay, let's see how skilled our former soldier is.

607
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,989
It's crazy windy right now.

608
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,720
Take it into consideration mathematically.

609
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,459
It's that thing.

610
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,459
The drone? Give him space.

611
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,499
(Can he return as the youngest?)

612
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,500
Go ahead.

613
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,810
(Failed to return as the youngest)

614
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,450
- Come on.
- You can't even aim at the rock?

615
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,150
Hee Won always surprises people.

616
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,519
I'll succeed right away.

617
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,550
Right away? Go ahead.

618
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,789
(The proud sharpshooter)

619
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,790
Look at him.

620
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,790
Please let me live a cheerful and fun life.

621
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,629
(Ever since they departed, he wished to stay positive.)

622
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,000
(Hee Won, the Optimism Evangelist)

623
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,569
(With a calm mind,)

624
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,940
(he throws the coin!)

625
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,180
Didn't it land where mine did?

626
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
I'll start living pessimistically from now on.

627
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,119
Keep that in mind.

628
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,020
(He's turned evil.)

629
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,289
- Nobody has succeeded yet, right?
- No.

630
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,290
(There's only one person left!)

631
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,689
(As if you'll succeed when we haven't.)

632
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,889
Make your wish, Dong Il.

633
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,960
- My wish?
- Yes.

634
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,770
Please keep House on Wheels going.

635
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,469
All right, please keep House on Wheels going.

636
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,570
(Can it continue?)

637
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:12,370
(The eldest of House on Wheels)

638
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,419
(The eldest did it!)

639
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,620
And right at the center.

640
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,289
And right at the center.

641
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,190
(She can't close her mouth!)

642
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,100
You saw that, right?

643
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,130
House on Wheels will continue because of you.

644
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,999
- But...
- My coin is right in the center.

645
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,439
Exactly. That was no joke.

646
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,610
(How did this happen on the first day in Hokkaido?)

647
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,109
House on Wheels will keep going.

648
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,410
(We can keep going!)

649
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,280
It just landed.

650
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,080
How did you...

651
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,189
- I try my best not to...
- Yes?

652
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,789
show this side of me...

653
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,289
because people make me do it.

654
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,690
(The king of bragging)

655
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,460
I should've asked you to make my wish.

656
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,499
So that Dong Il will ask for it on your behalf?

657
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,899
- Yes, have him make all the wishes.
- It's right at the center.

658
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,769
But how did it land right there?

659
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,970
I know, right? That's amazing.

660
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,670
The wind stopped when Dong Il threw his coin.

661
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,410
Nonsense.

662
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,340
You even controlled the wind, didn't you?

663
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,479
Remember what I told you?

664
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
I told you to calculate it mathematically.

665
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,749
- It...
- Gong Myoung...

666
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,689
is slowly showing his true colors.

667
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,560
Back then, he used to sneakily throw shade at us.

668
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:37,660
And to think that the coin would land right in the center. Seriously.

669
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,429
- It did not even bounce out.
- I know, right?

670
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,029
I calculated everything...

671
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,430
mathematically, including the weight.

672
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,670
Even the wind and all that.

673
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,970
Of course.

674
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,569
Nice.

675
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,179
Of course.

676
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,980
- We haven't eaten anything, right?
- No.

677
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,810
- Myoung's favorite, no matter what.
- Yes.

678
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,949
He loves urchin roe.

679
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,950
- Nice.
- Urchin roe.

680
00:31:00,951 --> 00:31:02,719
- You do?
- He told me.

681
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,089
Whether we buy some or just get it to go,

682
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,459
- let's head down first.
- Okay.

683
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,059
Did you really serve in the army?

684
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,229
You've become so cool.

685
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,889
- Did I not change?
- His skin is just too nice.

686
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,059
It was nice even back then.

687
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,229
You're supposed to get tanned in the military.

688
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,199
My skin became like this after serving in the military.

689
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,230
Goodness.

690
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
It used to be better.

691
00:31:20,241 --> 00:31:22,540
You've had that skin since your first birthday.

692
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,669
- Since his first birthday?
- Yes.

693
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,810
(Did I?)

694
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,440
This place...

695
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,909
That rock is especially meaningful to me.

696
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,910
- Exactly.
- Right?

697
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:32,010
It'll last for a lifetime.

698
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,980
What if we really end up going all over the world?

699
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:40,260
(But this was only the beginning.)

700
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,230
(Like nothing we had ever witnessed,)

701
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:49,629
(Hokkaido's wild nature)

702
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,430
I heard bears come out here.

703
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,340
Bears here...

704
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,670
Either way, there's one in our tent.

705
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,040
What?

706
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,140
But you haven't seen it, have you?

707
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,340
No.

708
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,110
A bear. It's a real bear!

709
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,279
- Where?
- Take a photo.

710
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
- For real?
- Right there.

711
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:05,380
It ran away.

712
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,449
- Where?
- Deer!

713
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,619
(Unexpected events?)

714
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,189
There's a fox on the street.

715
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,859
- A fox?
- So it was foxes.

716
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,660
(Will House on Wheels' luck continue?)

717
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,589
Off we go.

718
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,299
(Leaving their first luck behind,)

719
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,360
(they officially set off on the trip.)

720
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,430
Is the place we're going...

721
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,599
- like an urchin roe market?
- It's a market.

722
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,870
Yes, a market.

723
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,410
Nice.

724
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,109
It sounds good.

725
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,409
(Excited at the thought of eating urchin roe)

726
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,680
(Gulping)

727
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,350
If I can eat it raw, I will eat everything I can on the spot.

728
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,579
(Laughing)

729
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,649
Let's calculate after we eat it.

730
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,650
I'm in.

731
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:49,659
(Off to the urchin roe market with an ambitious plan)

732
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,889
(Hokkaido: Shakotan, Otaru, Sapporo)

733
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:57,200
(Our House is heading to Otaru from the Shakotan Peninsula.)

734
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:01,039
(The blue water is flowing outside the windows of our House.)

735
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,470
It's a sight here.

736
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,309
- It's marvelous.
- Right?

737
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,039
All the places we go to are pretty.

738
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,240
(Driving along the emerald ocean for an hour)

739
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,520
(Our House has entered a village.)

740
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,020
(The place that'll be our House's front yard today...)

741
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,359
(Yoichi, Hokkaido)

742
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,060
(is Yoichi, between Shakotan and Otaru.)

743
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,570
(Where all the seafood comes together)

744
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,199
(The urchin roe market in Yoichi)

745
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,640
- Is this the seafood market?
- Yes.

746
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,509
It looks like the seafood market.

747
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,670
- Is that so?
- It seems like it.

748
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,839
- Great work.
- You too.

749
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,439
Thank you for the ride.

750
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,179
- Pack our money, Na Ra.
- Okay.

751
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,380
(Let's go have a taste of the ocean.)

752
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,180
(Looking around)

753
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,790
It smells almost exactly like Korea.

754
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,890
(The urchin roe market is full of the ocean scent.)

755
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,460
My goodness.

756
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,700
Boil it and it'll be...

757
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,530
How much is that?

758
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,769
It looks good.

759
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,870
(A collection of fresh seafood)

760
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,880
(This place leaves them in awe just by looking.)

761
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,250
(But what the members want is...)

762
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,080
Tuna? Here it is.

763
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,349
It was here.

764
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,649
(What they want to treat Myoung to)

765
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,849
- These must be fresh.
- Urchin roe.

766
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:29,160
(Urchin roe, Hokkaido's specialty)

767
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,629
Why is there a color difference?

768
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,599
Exactly, maybe it's a different type.

769
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,199
(Now that they mention it,)

770
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,830
(the colors of the urchin roes are different.)

771
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,109
(From Russia, Otaru,)

772
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,869
(Hakodate, Nemuro)

773
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,140
(The color and shape vary depending on the origin!)

774
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,750
(From Hakodate: Bright yellow, in season from June to August)

775
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,150
(From Rishiri: Deep orange, in season from June to August)

776
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,760
(From Yoichi: Light yellow, in season from June to August)

777
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,730
(The urchin roes from 5 origins have gathered in 1 place!)

778
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,570
(They look closer to decide what to purchase.)

779
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,300
It's 6,000 yen.

780
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,900
(Look at that.)

781
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,009
- That's 60 dollars.
- It's really expensive.

782
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,209
It sure is expensive.

783
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,180
(From Nemuro: 250g costs 6,000 yen, about 56 dollars)

784
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,579
This one is about 50 dollars.

785
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,410
(From Yoichi: About 48 dollars, From Rishiri: About 61 dollars)

786
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,120
(From Otaru: About 48 dollars)

787
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:34,560
(The price varies depending on the origin, but they aren't cheap.)

788
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,260
This one's a little more expensive.

789
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,090
It's 5,100 yen and 4,500 yen.

790
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,159
(A few days later)

791
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,259
- You're right.
- Did you see that earlier?

792
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,569
The urchin roe rice bowl was 93 dollars.

793
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,170
- Right.
- It was for one portion.

794
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,599
(In Otaru, the neighboring city,)

795
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,470
(the sea urchin rice bowl is about 90 dollars.)

796
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,309
(A bite of the urchin roe starts from 6.50 dollars!)

797
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,009
They also sell urchin roe, Dong Il.

798
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,580
(As Hokkaido urchin roe is famous in Japan)

799
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,649
- That's expensive.
- It's 72 dollars.

800
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,189
(One plate of urchin roe is an average of 70 to 80 dollars.)

801
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,090
Urchin roe is indeed expensive.

802
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:10,230
(Imported in Korea, the same amount goes over 200 dollars!)

803
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,429
(It's cheaper here, since this is the place of origin.)

804
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,770
The one with the cleaner color is more expensive.

805
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,270
- Right?
- But why is it so expensive?

806
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,100
Buy two plates,

807
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,910
and it's 100 dollars.

808
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,009
- It's too expensive.
- For real.

809
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,810
(However, the members don't know yet.)

810
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,479
(Thinking hard)

811
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,550
But you promised we would get to eat in spoonfuls.

812
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,180
I did say that.

813
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,080
Use chopsticks.

814
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,290
Imagine how good urchin roe caught here would be.

815
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,820
Eat spoonfuls of urchin roe from a whole plate.

816
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,330
I'm serious.

817
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,130
On top of rice? We don't do that here.

818
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,130
I'll have you fill up with urchin roe.

819
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,169
Do you want to eat spoonfuls of it?

820
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,169
(It's too expensive to eat a plentiful amount.)

821
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,670
But that's too little.

822
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,510
It's too expensive.

823
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,509
How about we buy that...

824
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,980
and just have a piece each with rice?

825
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,180
(But Myoung came all the way to Japan.)

826
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,380
Okay.

827
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,919
I'll buy a plate just for you.

828
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,120
(I'll buy an expensive one just for you.)

829
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,829
(Dong Il wants to treat him to good food.)

830
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,759
- This one right here.
- No, let's share it.

831
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,130
No, we’ll buy two of these and share them.

832
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,270
(A cheaper one for us)

833
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,400
Is this… Sir?

834
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,270
Which one is the most delicious urchin roe?

835
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,910
Which one is the freshest?

836
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,140
- This one?
- Yes.

837
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,180
It's from Yoichi.

838
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,850
(The one recommended by the worker...)

839
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,289
(is urchin roe from Yoichi, in season.)

840
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,290
This one right here?

841
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,790
At least this one is 48 dollars.

842
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,260
How about one plate per person?

843
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,129
- Per person?
- No, I'm...

844
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,659
- It's too much.
- I can't finish it.

845
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,300
- What?
- I can't eat that much.

846
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,799
(We're okay.)

847
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,199
- But...
- Let's share.

848
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,639
Hokkaido urchin roe is really famous. And since we're here...

849
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,869
When else would we try it?

850
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,940
We can't have it once we travel further.

851
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,680
Today is the last chance.

852
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,250
One plate per person? Okay?

853
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,020
Four, please.

854
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,649
There are only two left.

855
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,850
There are only two left?

856
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,519
Those are the last ones.

857
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,890
(Being in season at its origin, it's really popular!)

858
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,790
How about securing those two right now?

859
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,530
These...

860
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:28,360
(The last ones from Yoichi)

861
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,560
These two?

862
00:38:29,561 --> 00:38:31,099
(As 2 isn't enough...)

863
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,100
(Recommending the one from Otaru)

864
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,170
This one? I see.

865
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,870
Okay. Good.

866
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:38,970
Any discounts?

867
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,010
No?

868
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,610
Everyone says no here.

869
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,510
These three. All set?

870
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,219
(Satisfied)

871
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,220
All good.

872
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,819
- Salmon.
- Salmon.

873
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,560
(Let's see.)

874
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,559
(What else can we feed Myoung?)

875
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,630
Salmon roe.

876
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,060
What's here? It's the butcher's.

877
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,499
(They spot the meat section, Myoung’s favorite.)

878
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,730
- Liver.
- It looks good.

879
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:08,670
(Meat)

880
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,509
(Thinking)

881
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,769
Wagyu steak?

882
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:13,979
- Steak?
- Steak.

883
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,840
(Ordering wagyu steak for Myoung)

884
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:17,950
Welcome.

885
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,890
(He brings out a hunk of beef.)

886
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,250
(In awe)

887
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,090
(He loves the size of the meat.)

888
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,790
This is nice.

889
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,029
(He likes the meat, but...)

890
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,100
One...

891
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,899
- Two?
- Two.

892
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,900
(Please give me two chunks.)

893
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,900
I removed one of them.

894
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:39,099
(I spent a lot of money on urchin roe.)

895
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,570
- You're worried about the cost.
- I removed one.

896
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:46,980
(Two big chunks of wagyu are getting cut.)

897
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,510
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

898
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,680
- It looks delicious already.
- I agree.

899
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,580
It's delicious when the pieces are thick.

900
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,420
How much do you expect it to be?

901
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,620
I think...

902
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,259
it'd be about 130 dollars.

903
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,329
- You think it's 130 dollars?
- Did you say 130?

904
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,330
- What about you, Hee Won?
- Or 150 dollars.

905
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,260
I think the two chunks cost about 70 dollars.

906
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,499
- Seventy dollars?
- I was expecting that much too.

907
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,730
- Seventy dollars?
- Eighty or ninety dollars.

908
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,040
(Hee Won: 70 dollars versus Dong Il: 150 dollars)

909
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:22,610
(How much will two chunks of wagyu beef cost?)

910
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,679
I was exactly right. It's 70 dollars.

911
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,619
- That's amazing.
- Okay.

912
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,680
(Hee Won's prediction of 70 dollars was exact.)

913
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,119
- It looks so good.
- It's cheaper than I thought.

914
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
You're right.

915
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,190
This costs less than 36 dollars.

916
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,660
Right.

917
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,360
One more, please.

918
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,160
One more.

919
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,599
- One more.
- One more?

920
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,100
One more of this, please.

921
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,599
- One more.
- He seems very excited.

922
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
Thank you.

923
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,909
How could this be so cheap?

924
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,170
(The affordable price raises his happiness level.)

925
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,340
Next, kelp.

926
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,850
Kelp. How do we say kelp in Japanese?

927
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,749
- Kelp.
- Isn't it the same as in Korean?

928
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,850
Okay, I'll try.

929
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,590
Kelp, please.

930
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:08,620
(Describing kelp with his hands)

931
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,689
Oh, thank you.

932
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,530
(While Dong Il struggles to find kelp)

933
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,330
This is perfect.

934
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,870
This is what we need.

935
00:41:18,871 --> 00:41:19,900
- This one?
- Yes.

936
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,200
Is it 2.5 dollars?

937
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,910
Isn't it a big quantity?

938
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,310
- I'd like to buy this.
- What is it?

939
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,340
They look like peanut rice crackers.

940
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,910
(3 minutes ago)

941
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,020
(She stopped at the snack stand that drew her attention.)

942
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,490
(Ruffling)

943
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,790
(Trotting after grabbing a bag of snacks)

944
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,659
(That's how she brought it.)

945
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,999
- What is it?
- Peanut rice crackers.

946
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,200
(Peanut rice crackers)

947
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:50,970
- Do you want it?
- Yes.

948
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,969
- You can't have it.
- Come on.

949
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:53,999
You can.

950
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,539
(It goes directly into the shopping basket.)

951
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,610
I think we got everything.

952
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:00,539
(In front of the checkout)

953
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,979
I'll take that.

954
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,880
(Defending her precious peanut rice crackers)

955
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,520
(Holding it tightly in one hand until the end)

956
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:15,820
(Rustling)

957
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,360
(Opening)

958
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,499
(As soon as they set off, she goes for the peanut rice crackers.)

959
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,560
Have some rice cracker.

960
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,199
Rice cracker? Let's share this.

961
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,669
(Sharing with each family member)

962
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,870
It has peanuts inside.

963
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,370
- Split it between you two.
- Okay.

964
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,540
(She finally takes a bite.)

965
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,679
- There are raw peanuts inside.
- It has real peanuts inside.

966
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,520
(There are raw peanuts inside.)

967
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,290
Na Ra, you love to snack, don't you?

968
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,890
Yes.

969
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:48,460
(I love to snack.)

970
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,159
It seems that way.

971
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,660
(However, in the front seat...)

972
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,300
(A visitor came to see Myoung after a long time.)

973
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:03,170
(Here came Mr. Drowsiness.)

974
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:06,540
(Speaking of Myoung...)

975
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:11,379
(Even 3 years ago, he dozed off.)

976
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,379
(He dozed off.)

977
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,420
(He dozed off again.)

978
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:25,130
(He hasn't changed since then.)

979
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,430
(Yawning)

980
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,930
(Yawning)

981
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,570
Myoung keeps yawning a lot.

982
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,169
(Smiling)

983
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,770
He always dozed off whenever he got in the car.

984
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,279
That's right.

985
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,510
His mother told us about it on the phone.

986
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,110
I remember it all.

987
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,880
(With a member who eats whenever she's in the car)

988
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,459
This time, we're mostly visiting campsites.

989
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,690
I'm excited to see what each one looks like.

990
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,700
- There are many beautiful places.
- Right.

991
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,060
Of course.

992
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:06,399
(Glancing)

993
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,099
This area must grow a lot of produce.

994
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,340
Right. On our way here,

995
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:11,869
I saw a vineyard.

996
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:14,339
They were the small type of grapes.

997
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,410
Each grape was small.

998
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,279
It was that type of vineyard.

999
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,020
(Are all these vineyards?)

1000
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,789
(Along the golden rice fields)

1001
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,789
There are many vineyards.

1002
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,690
(There are rows of grapevines.)

1003
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,930
(It's no surprise.)

1004
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,129
(Hokkaido is called...)

1005
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,300
(Hokkaido is called Japan's pantry.)

1006
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,470
(Fertile soil)

1007
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,370
(The clean sea)

1008
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:47,310
(A blessed climate)

1009
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,740
(Grown in the rich soil)

1010
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,150
(Its crops are top-notch in Japan.)

1011
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,149
(Its dairy products are also number 1 in Japan.)

1012
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,720
(Hokkaido)

1013
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,260
(Its seafood is also number 1 in Japan.)

1014
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,359
(Hokkaido itself is a symbol of quality.)

1015
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,190
(Made in Hokkaido)

1016
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,230
(And in Yoichi, which is our front yard today)

1017
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:17,270
(It's one of the prime fruit-growing regions in Hokkaido.)

1018
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:22,010
(Our neighborhood today is abundance itself.)

1019
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,610
- I think it's right over there.
- Here?

1020
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,109
- Are we here?
- Yes.

1021
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:27,179
- We're here.
- We're here.

1022
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,049
- Goodness.
- We're here.

1023
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:32,750
(They're getting close to their home in today's front yard.)

1024
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:36,460
It feels like we're in a forest.

1025
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,500
(Greeted by the green scenery)

1026
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:46,030
(Our home is tucked away among the dense trees.)

1027
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,800
It'd be nice to walk around here.

1028
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:52,169
- Yes, for a walk.
- Yes.

1029
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,010
(There's a road in the forest that's nice to walk.)

1030
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,950
I can't wait...

1031
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,919
to see what kind of place it is.

1032
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,380
(How will our front yard look?)

1033
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:08,819
(Our front yard is starting to appear.)

1034
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:12,130
(Our front yard is starting to appear.)

1035
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,860
(In awe)

1036
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,030
(There are tents here and there.)

1037
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:24,310
(A place where children and dogs run around)

1038
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,040
(A family campsite loved by residents in Yoichi)

1039
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,179
(Our house)

1040
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:37,950
(The abundance of Yoichi, our neighborhood)

1041
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:43,219
(Laid-back peacefulness welcomes them.)

1042
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,330
(Laid-back peacefulness welcomes them.)

1043
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:56,500
(Where real local camping takes place)

1044
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:01,580
There are many campers here.

1045
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,680
- There are many.
- My gosh.

1046
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,990
Gosh, this is what I dreamed of.

1047
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:22,530
(Where Myoung's dream will come true)

1048
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:27,570
(After Myoung delivers the ingredients,)

1049
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,510
(is he casually gearing up?)

1050
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,070
(Experienced)

1051
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,640
(The guest is more like the owner than the owner himself.)

1052
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,320
(The house owners are watching him.)

1053
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,880
I knew it.

1054
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:45,250
Let's keep him with us.

1055
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,990
We got everything now that Myoung is with us.

1056
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:49,420
He has...

1057
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:51,860
a lot to offer us.

1058
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,560
- Gosh, the sun is so strong.
- What?

1059
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:59,299
The sun is scorching hot.

1060
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,470
(Even in cool Hokkaido, no one can't avoid the sun at noon.)

1061
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,470
(This time)

1062
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:06,769
Here?

1063
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,410
(The current house owner, Na Ra picked up the hammer.)

1064
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,810
(Will she be able to do it?)

1065
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:13,550
Think about Hee Won.

1066
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,880
(Why me out of the blue?)

1067
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,990
Take your anger out on it.

1068
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:20,860
Hee Won.

1069
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:23,060
(She plays along.)

1070
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,190
- Hee Won! Did I hit it too much?
- No.

1071
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,900
You practically nailed it in the ground.

1072
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,960
(Tight)

1073
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,000
Hit it while thinking about Dong Il.

1074
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,800
(In that case)

1075
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,310
Na Ra.

1076
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:41,079
It's me.

1077
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,010
(Hitting repeatedly while thinking about Dong Il)

1078
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,450
Gosh, it got much stronger than before.

1079
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,679
Goodness.

1080
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,719
(He can't believe it.)

1081
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,720
Hey, Na Ra.

1082
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:52,220
(I was only working hard.)

1083
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:54,090
Is it done?

1084
00:48:54,091 --> 00:48:56,119
- All right.
- She hit it one more time.

1085
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,159
She nailed it all the way so you can't see the head.

1086
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,230
She nailed it all the way so you can't see the head.

1087
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,900
- Seriously.
- This?

1088
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,599
- I see.
- Pull it so that it's tight.

1089
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,729
(She nailed the peg deeply while thinking of the family.)

1090
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:07,800
Okay.

1091
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:10,570
There's a huge difference when there's a shade.

1092
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,869
- Is it done?
- It's done.

1093
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,810
(Thanks to the new and old youngest, our house is ready.)

1094
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,109
- We bought some kelp.
- Oh, yes.

1095
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:21,419
Cut the kelp as big as the rice cooker and cover the rice with it.

1096
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,450
- As big as the rice cooker?
- Yes.

1097
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,890
(As Dong Il suggested, she rinses the kelp thoroughly.)

1098
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,530
(Fitting it in after cutting it big enough)

1099
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:38,100
(How will the kelp rice turn out?)

1100
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,729
Any questions that you have.

1101
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,269
- We haven't seen you in a while.
- How things were...

1102
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,210
when you weren't on the show. You lead the discussion.

1103
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:46,310
Myoung's Ten-Minute Talk.

1104
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,110
Be yourself and be honest.

1105
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:51,909
"Honestly, I hate Jang Na Ra who replaced me."

1106
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:56,150
(A suggested comment)

1107
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:58,820
(That's just an example.)

1108
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:01,990
(Hesitating)

1109
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,260
Why did you decide to join the show?

1110
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,029
Why did you decide to join the show?

1111
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:13,370
(Is that what you wanted to know?)

1112
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,309
(The older guys who can't stop laughing)

1113
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:21,280
(The current landlady whose head is spinning)

1114
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,939
I'd really like to know.

1115
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,809
(He looks very curious.)

1116
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:27,080
Hey, be careful with what you ask.

1117
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,119
She gets angry easily. Her mouth is open.

1118
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,850
I'm sure that he wants to know.

1119
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,420
(Please tell me.)

1120
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:38,690
This is how it started. The director wrote me...

1121
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:43,300
a long letter saying that there will be good ice cream here.

1122
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,670
(Surprised)

1123
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,600
Also, I heard about Dong Il and Hee Won.

1124
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:53,509
People told me that it'd be good to travel with them.

1125
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,740
Myoung must have been curious...

1126
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:57,980
- Right.
- why you joined the show.

1127
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:00,010
Now, there's something I'd like to know.

1128
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,280
When he invited you to the show, did he not mention the ice cream?

1129
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:05,690
- No.
- Goodness.

1130
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:09,590
(That's harsh.)

1131
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:12,230
- It's okay. You did a good job.
- He didn't say anything about it.

1132
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,660
When he invited you here as a guest, did he not bring up the ice cream?

1133
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,830
- No.
- I see.

1134
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:21,669
To be honest, it's rare to get a letter that says...

1135
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,000
you'll be given ice cream.

1136
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:25,970
Right?

1137
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:27,979
What's your next question?

1138
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,480
(Next question)

1139
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,279
(Towards Na Ra)

1140
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,249
- Na Ra, so...
- There's definitely something.

1141
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,479
- No.
- He has something against her.

1142
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,850
He found something to pick on.

1143
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,959
- Are you okay?
- With what?

1144
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,090
With the two of them.

1145
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,360
(Why are you getting us involved?)

1146
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,700
- They're great.
- I'm glad to hear that.

1147
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,699
(Smiling)

1148
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,799
- He wished her a hard time.
- No.

1149
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,100
- That's why he asked her.
- That's not true.

1150
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:57,369
I've been in her position before.

1151
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:59,440
So I'm naturally worried about her.

1152
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,210
What exactly makes you worried?

1153
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:04,210
(What makes you worried?)

1154
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,279
He's saying that he had a hard time.

1155
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,149
- No, that's not what I'm saying.
- All right. Let's change.

1156
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,990
I'm not saying that I had a hard time.

1157
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,620
Let's change. I'll lead the discussion.

1158
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:15,090
(Should I flip this over?)

1159
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,290
Be careful with your words.

1160
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:19,989
- All right. Let's change.
- No, I'm not...

1161
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:22,399
- saying that I had a hard time.
- I'll lead the discussion.

1162
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,899
So I took on your position.

1163
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,399
What was the most difficult part that made you ask that question?

1164
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,670
- What I mean is...
- Tell us honestly.

1165
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,679
When I was on the show,

1166
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,779
they made me do difficult tasks.

1167
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,780
Hey.

1168
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:39,210
(Losing his temper)

1169
00:52:39,211 --> 00:52:40,520
I was worried that they would make you...

1170
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:43,620
(Youngest, what are you talking about?)

1171
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,349
- Wait, they find it unfair.
- When did we...

1172
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:46,989
- order you around?
- Why do you think that it's unfair?

1173
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,089
You didn't order me around. I volunteered to do it.

1174
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:50,960
Hold on.

1175
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,389
Both of them opened their mouths to speak.

1176
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:55,329
- Right.
- Tell us why...

1177
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:56,730
you think that it's unfair.

1178
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:59,530
I don't know about Dong Il, but I set myself as an example.

1179
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,340
You set yourself as an example.

1180
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,769
(He gets attacked by young members everywhere.)

1181
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,370
Dong Il also did a lot on his own.

1182
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:08,780
- Right.
- Right.

1183
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,750
Do you find anything unfair?

1184
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:15,280
Who gave you food?

1185
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:21,290
(If you ask me who gave me food)

1186
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:26,530
(It has to be him.)

1187
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:28,700
- Who gave you food?
- You're right.

1188
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,570
- Isn't that good enough?
- You're right.

1189
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,139
What's the matter with you? We were having a discussion.

1190
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,039
- We're going to be positive, right.
- That was irrelevant.

1191
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,840
- You're right.
- That's fine.

1192
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,109
Myoung, is rice cooked yet?

1193
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,480
(The members got closer than before.)

1194
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:45,009
- It's keeping the rice warm.
- Okay, flip over the rice.

1195
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:46,410
(The rice is cooked.)

1196
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:50,620
(Did the kelp rice turn out well?)

1197
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:58,190
(Kelp in charge of the umami taste is taken out.)

1198
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,930
- Is the rice cooked?
- Yes, it turned out well.

1199
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,470
(Picking)

1200
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,500
(Delicious)

1201
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,940
(The rice passes the test.)

1202
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:15,310
(It's time for the head chef to step up.)

1203
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,650
- Myoung, from the fridge, - Yes?

1204
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,250
hand me the urchin roe.

1205
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,280
- Here you go.
- The urchin roe.

1206
00:54:22,281 --> 00:54:24,089
(Presenting the precious urchin roe from Hokkaido)

1207
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,190
- Okay, you can go outside now.
- Okay.

1208
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:29,520
I'll take care of it.

1209
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,789
(Urchin roe...)

1210
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:36,330
(and Chef Sung)

1211
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:40,070
(Chef Sung guaranteed it with confidence.)

1212
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:43,970
(Add an entire tray of top-notch urchin roe.)

1213
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:47,880
(I'll make you eat as much urchin roe as you want.)

1214
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,450
(What's the first Hokkaido dish made with urchin roe?)

1215
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:57,390
(Preparing green onion topping first)

1216
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,349
(The next topping is...)

1217
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:02,620
(kelp from the rice?)

1218
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:03,990
Otherwise, it'd go to waste.

1219
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,860
I should use it.

1220
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:08,730
(Frugal)

1221
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,769
It will give more texture.

1222
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:12,369
(Adding a chewy texture with kelp)

1223
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:16,400
(Once the radish sprout is lined up)

1224
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:19,569
(A set of 3 toppings is ready.)

1225
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,680
(Where will they go?)

1226
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:31,190
(Filling the bowl with rice that became glossy with kelp)

1227
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,059
(And it's finally appearing.)

1228
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,089
Okay.

1229
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,360
(Today's main ingredient, Hokkaido urchin roe from Yoichi)

1230
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:43,360
(Pouring out seawater used to preserve freshness)

1231
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:50,270
(As promised, a huge pile on the rice)

1232
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:53,239
(He adds urchin roe.)

1233
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,839
(He adds more...)

1234
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,610
(and more.)

1235
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:03,880
(Emptying out the container)

1236
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:09,990
(A luxury we can enjoy because it's our house)

1237
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,560
(That's not all.)

1238
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:19,400
(Adding a lot of urchin roe that they bought in Otaru)

1239
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:24,840
(Today's meal includes two types of clean Hokkaido urchin roe.)

1240
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:31,210
(Rice bowl with a lot of Hokkaido urchin roe)

1241
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,619
(All he has to do is put on the toppings.)

1242
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,520
I don't know if this is right.

1243
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,860
I don't know if this is right.

1244
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:49,100
(Tilting his head)

1245
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,470
I don't think this is it.

1246
00:56:57,070 --> 00:56:58,370
This isn't the right sauce.

1247
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:00,170
We bought the wrong sauce.

1248
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,610
This isn't the right sauce.

1249
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,410
We bought the wrong sauce.

1250
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:12,249
Let's take a look at the sauces. Steak sauce.

1251
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:13,390
(This morning at the supermarket)

1252
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:15,460
Isn't the steak sauce next to the pork cutlet sauce?

1253
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,760
Usually, yes.

1254
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,590
I'll go and ask.

1255
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:20,530
We don't have that sauce here.

1256
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,129
Steak?

1257
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:26,399
(He bought the sauce that was recommended by the clerk.)

1258
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,500
Okay, we'll buy this.

1259
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:29,970
Shall we?

1260
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,540
(It's not the taste that he wanted.)

1261
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:36,580
(What should I do?)

1262
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:40,079
(Telling the truth)

1263
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,579
- You know what?
- Yes?

1264
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,580
Stay seated and listen.

1265
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,889
We needed a sauce for rice bowls,

1266
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:49,690
but this is for bulgogi. It doesn't go well with urchin roe.

1267
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:55,360
(What should I do?)

1268
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:58,830
(Dong Il thinks about it for a long time.)

1269
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:02,970
(Suddenly, he rummages through the shelf.)

1270
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,170
(He takes out something.)

1271
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:09,410
(And one more thing?)

1272
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:13,610
(He pours the two into small dishes.)

1273
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:16,820
(Dong Il's solution will be revealed soon.)

1274
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,620
(Like nothing happened,)

1275
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:23,360
(he sprinkles sesame seeds over the sea urchin rice bowl.)

1276
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,729
(He places 3 toppings in order.)

1277
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:33,500
Who wants raw egg yolk and who doesn't?

1278
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:35,300
I want it.

1279
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:40,980
(Place it gently.)

1280
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:43,440
It smells good.

1281
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,579
Everything Dong Il cooks is delicious.

1282
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,880
I agree wholeheartedly.

1283
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:51,250
(The scent of rice spreads.)

1284
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,820
(He walks toward it as if enchanted)

1285
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,500
Look at how pretty it is.

1286
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,000
- It's no joke.
- My goodness.

1287
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,839
- Hold on, this...
- Amazing. What's this?

1288
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,070
It's so pretty.

1289
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:12,309
He could sell this.

1290
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:15,439
(It looks amazing. What about its taste?)

1291
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,179
I'll bring you some aged kimchi.

1292
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,009
What completes our dishes?

1293
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,580
- The visuals.
- That's right.

1294
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:24,619
(Sprinkle sesame seeds, which are officially in charge...)

1295
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,719
Here.

1296
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,060
(of House on Wheels' visuals.)

1297
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:32,529
(He cooked it quickly and easily.)

1298
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,760
How can it look this good?

1299
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,599
This...

1300
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,869
(A meal with plenty of urchin roe is complete.)

1301
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,669
Did he take away the food from somewhere?

1302
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,940
(What about the sauces?)

1303
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:44,710
- Na Ra.
- Yes?

1304
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,310
For the final topping,

1305
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:48,680
sprinkle some dried seaweed your mother gave.

1306
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,040
Okay.

1307
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:54,450
The last topping. Add it gently.

1308
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,580
- A bit?
- A bit. That's enough.

1309
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,250
That's enough.

1310
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,589
It looks tasty.

1311
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:03,989
- It looks tasty, right?
- Yes.

1312
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,790
(A bowl that contains the sea of Hokkaido)

1313
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,959
- Thank you for the food.
- Enjoy.

1314
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,699
(Very excited)

1315
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,999
- Sesame oil.
- This...

1316
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,570
Make sure you add soy sauce.

1317
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,299
(Soy sauce?)

1318
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,339
Okay.

1319
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,440
(Dong Il's next solution)

1320
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,139
(To the soy sauce in the House,)

1321
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:24,880
(he sprinkles sesame seeds to add the savory taste.)

1322
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:29,550
(Lastly...)

1323
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:33,049
And take sesame oil.

1324
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:34,420
(As the finishing touch, add sesame oil!)

1325
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:36,420
- Is it done?
- Yes.

1326
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:39,059
You can eat now.

1327
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,130
(In another words, it's the flavor of Korea.)

1328
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:42,600
It's dark soy sauce, so add just a bit.

1329
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:46,300
(A bit of soy sauce)

1330
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,699
Add sesame oil to your liking.

1331
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,440
(Next, a spoonful of sesame oil)

1332
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:54,579
Pop the egg yolk.

1333
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,009
(Will it go well with urchin roe?)

1334
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:57,239
Myoung knows how to eat.

1335
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,609
(Pop soft and sticky egg yolk and mix it well with the rest.)

1336
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:01,820
Try it.

1337
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:07,350
(Taking a big bite)

1338
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:09,690
(Nodding)

1339
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,789
(Amazed)

1340
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:15,629
(It's so good that it's annoying.)

1341
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,760
Try this.

1342
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:20,930
Yes, add a bit of mustard like Na Ra.

1343
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,639
You're eating food from House on Wheels...

1344
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,040
for the 1st time in 3 years and 8 months.

1345
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:29,309
(Impressed)

1346
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,680
Pop the egg yolk.

1347
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,049
It's really delicious.

1348
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:34,479
(He immediately takes another bite.)

1349
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,550
Right?

1350
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:38,120
And...

1351
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:41,490
- It's so delicious.
- It's very good.

1352
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,019
(Na Ra takes a big bite of it with a pile of urchin roe.)

1353
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:45,490
Add sesame oil to your liking.

1354
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,260
(She savors it for a long time.)

1355
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:51,569
It's so good.

1356
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:52,600
- It is, right?
- Yes.

1357
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:58,640
(He doesn't even have the time to put down his chopsticks.)

1358
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:02,140
- It's very delicious.
- Is it?

1359
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,210
It's good.

1360
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:09,280
(Only then does Chef Sung take a bite.)

1361
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,589
- It's so good.
- It's so good.

1362
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:13,950
- I told you so.
- It's very good.

1363
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:15,690
(Surprised)

1364
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:19,389
The taste of urchin roe remains in my mouth.

1365
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:21,400
(The taste of urchin roe remains in my mouth.)

1366
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,659
This is so...

1367
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,229
(Light and deep flavor of premium urchin roe from a Hokkaido sea!)

1368
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:26,830
How is this taste possible?

1369
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:32,740
(Dong Il's good thinking to add the tastes familiar to Koreans!)

1370
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:36,580
(Looking for something)

1371
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,110
Urchin roe.

1372
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:39,780
What do you need?

1373
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,619
Can you pass me the dried seaweed?

1374
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,990
- Water?
- Dried seaweed, please.

1375
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:49,490
- I want to try and make a wrap.
- You're right.

1376
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,189
- Adding mustard to it.
- Yes. I want to make a wrap.

1377
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:54,060
You and I think alike.

1378
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,030
Do you use two pieces to wrap?

1379
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:00,969
(Since my mom got it for us, I'll take two.)

1380
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:02,270
I didn't think of that.

1381
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,610
(Plentiful)

1382
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:11,249
(Looking intently)

1383
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,949
I think it's a lie when you say you eat little but often.

1384
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,350
You eat a lot and often.

1385
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:18,950
- I'm eating well here, aren't I?
- Yes.

1386
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,260
(Into her mouth)

1387
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:29,359
(An impressed thumbs up)

1388
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,030
It's really...

1389
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,799
I'll use two pieces to wrap the rice too.

1390
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,100
(I'll use two pieces to wrap the rice too.)

1391
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,909
(Taking a big bite)

1392
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:40,940
(Humming)

1393
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,840
(Humming)

1394
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:47,950
If you add a small piece of aged kimchi in it...

1395
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,550
(It makes him clap.)

1396
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:57,930
(No words are needed to describe it.)

1397
01:03:58,290 --> 01:04:02,760
(Myoung tries the wrap using dried seaweed too.)

1398
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:08,400
(Clapping because he's deeply moved)

1399
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,940
- This rice bowl is incredible.
- I'm not the only one who thinks...

1400
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:19,410
This is really good.

1401
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,190
It sure is fresh.

1402
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,619
- It's just...
- It's so delicious.

1403
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:31,630
I can taste the urchin roe as is.

1404
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:33,359
- It's not fishy or anything.
- You're right.

1405
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,390
Right?

1406
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:35,999
I first tried urchin roe...

1407
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,700
on the previous season of this show last time.

1408
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,700
This is my second time eating it.

1409
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:45,170
(The second urchin roe of Hee Won's life)

1410
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,770
- It's too expensive to eat.
- It's way too expensive.

1411
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,609
They won't serve you enough urchin roe...

1412
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:51,980
to scoop up a spoonful in restaurants.

1413
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:53,710
Right?

1414
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,749
Look at that. There's more urchin roe than rice on the spoon.

1415
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,290
(A lot more urchin roe than rice)

1416
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:00,489
Do you like it?

1417
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:02,390
(Nodding)

1418
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:04,590
You could open a rice bowl restaurant.

1419
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:07,160
- Me?
- Yes.

1420
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,099
It went under once.

1421
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,100
(Goodness)

1422
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:12,070
I was conned.

1423
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:13,269
(Eyes trembling)

1424
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:15,839
Why would you bring that up on such a good day?

1425
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,069
(She unintentionally brings up his painful past.)

1426
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:19,140
- I went through so much trouble.
- There's bigger dried seaweed too.

1427
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:21,069
The phrase "opening a restaurant..."

1428
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:22,140
is banned on House on Wheels.

1429
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:25,850
(Glancing)

1430
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:27,610
It's delicious.

1431
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:30,419
- It is.
- It is.

1432
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,050
(It is.)

1433
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:33,789
- That was a good meal.
- That really was.

1434
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:36,060
(Thank you Chef Sung for making sea urchin rice bowl!)

1435
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,030
(Current time: 2pm)

1436
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:42,530
(Shaking)

1437
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,329
I'm full, and the weather is nice.

1438
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:46,069
- It's very good.
- Yes.

1439
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:47,070
(Very satisfied)

1440
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:49,040
That was so delicious.

1441
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,870
Out of all the rice bowls, bibimbap, and fried rice...

1442
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:56,409
I've had recently, that was the best.

1443
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,610
- Really?
- Yes.

1444
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:59,180
This is why you need good ingredients.

1445
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,620
(In one sentence...)

1446
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:03,879
- It's really delicious.
- Your cooking is like that...

1447
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,620
of famous restaurants.

1448
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,449
(Covering her mouth)

1449
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:10,120
This is how you do it. I should learn from you.

1450
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:12,759
(As they walk along the path)

1451
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,229
- Oh, dear.
- Is that what you saw...

1452
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:16,429
- Yes.
- in the morning?

1453
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,599
- I think it's a baby.
- It's so cute.

1454
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,069
- Isn't it this dog?
- I think it is.

1455
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:20,229
It must be this dog.

1456
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:23,100
We saw them walk the dog in the morning.

1457
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:27,839
(The reception greets the campsite guests.)

1458
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:28,980
Nice to meet you.

1459
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:32,409
(While the younger members pay attention to the dog...)

1460
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:33,849
- Seriously.
- It's wet.

1461
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:35,019
This is...

1462
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,880
(Pointing)

1463
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,850
I'd like to ask something.

1464
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:42,189
I hear there's a place...

1465
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:46,090
where locals buy fruits at a cheap price.

1466
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:54,800
There's a farm owned by this guy.

1467
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:58,440
We can buy them if we go to the farm?

1468
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:03,380
You can eat unlimited amount of fruit.

1469
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:06,210
What?

1470
01:07:06,211 --> 01:07:07,610
(You can eat unlimited amount of fruit.)

1471
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:09,920
- Let's go now.
- Yes.

1472
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:12,049
- Hey, young one.
- Yes?

1473
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:15,719
Can I have the address?

1474
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,220
Address.

1475
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:19,230
Address, please.

1476
01:07:19,231 --> 01:07:22,629
Say Korean in a strange way, and they understand.

1477
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:23,930
(He understood Dong Il and is looking up the address.)

1478
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,569
(She writes down the address of his acquaintance's farm.)

1479
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:27,929
I got it.

1480
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:29,799
Let's go.

1481
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,040
(They set off right away.)

1482
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:34,709
(As soon as they leave the campsite...)

1483
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:36,410
It's peach-shaped.

1484
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:39,510
This must be it. They sell fruits.

1485
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:41,920
There are cherries too.

1486
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,249
- Cherries?
- Yes.

1487
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:47,490
(Fruit banners lined up by the side of the road?)

1488
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:49,819
Cherries.

1489
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:51,090
(Cherries)

1490
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:56,000
(In Yoichi, our front yard today,)

1491
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,770
(there is Fruit Road.)

1492
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:04,040
(The road of fruits)

1493
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:09,440
(On each side of the road are many orchards and direct outlets!)

1494
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:13,680
(At the direct outlet right next to the road,)

1495
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:17,220
(you can buy freshly-picked fruits.)

1496
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:22,260
(You can pick your own fruits in the orchard on the roadside.)

1497
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,260
(They're abundant in fruits all year round except winter.)

1498
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:34,070
(They even have a fruit calendar for each season!)

1499
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:39,210
(Which fruit will the members find today?)

1500
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,039
Of course, Dong Il.

1501
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,109
- It's comfortable.
- You're speeding.

1502
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:45,050
First of all, my legs don't cramp up.

1503
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:47,780
(Glancing)

1504
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,680
- Na Ra.
- Yes? They're different.

1505
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:53,750
Aren't you eating too much? Is this a dessert?

1506
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:55,019
- Later...
- They're different.

1507
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:56,159
We're going to get fruits.

1508
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,219
That's different too.

1509
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,260
- That's different too?
- They each have their own places.

1510
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:02,860
(There are different stomachs for meals, snacks, and fruits.)

1511
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:06,370
(He's impressed.)

1512
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:08,170
You're just like my daughter.

1513
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:12,770
(The person who eats whenever she's in a car...)

1514
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:16,309
(and the person...)

1515
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:17,939
(who sleeps whenever he's in a car)

1516
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:20,980
(Used to it)

1517
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:23,920
(When you drive a bit more with them...)

1518
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,520
Isn't that a greenhouse?

1519
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,989
- Where?
- In front there.

1520
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:29,419
Is that the place?

1521
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:30,760
- I think so.
- Yes.

1522
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:33,889
(The fruit greenhouse is within their sight.)

1523
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:35,660
Gosh, a bit more.

1524
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:38,970
- Isn't this a vineyard?
- It's a vineyard.

1525
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,269
- They're bearing fruits.
- Are they?

1526
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:42,699
There are plenty of fruits.

1527
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:43,740
(A bunch of grapes hanging from the entrance)

1528
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,369
I'll park here.

1529
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,469
(Will we be eating grapes today?)

1530
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:50,040
- Thank you for driving.
- Thank you.

1531
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:52,479
It's pretty. Here we are.

1532
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,810
(They arrive at the orchard of the front yard village.)

1533
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:55,819
- Can we really eat them?
- Hello.

1534
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,549
- Hello.
- Hello.

1535
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:58,590
(Excited to eat unlimited fruits)

1536
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,890
- What's this?
- Prunes?

1537
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:06,559
- They're peaches.
- Blueberries.

1538
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,089
Blueberries and grapes.

1539
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:09,930
- Grapes.
- Grapes.

1540
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:11,599
- Peach.
- Peach.

1541
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,400
I see.

1542
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:17,240
(Are these all?)

1543
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,069
Really? Let's check that side too.

1544
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:21,070
(Let's check that side too.)

1545
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:24,840
(Nothing much here either)

1546
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:26,180
Goodness.

1547
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:27,449
(Taking one)

1548
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:28,520
I...

1549
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:31,479
- The cucumber is so crooked.
- I eat?

1550
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,620
This is for sale.

1551
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:34,889
- The cucumber...
- I need to pay?

1552
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:37,160
These are for sale.

1553
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:38,430
Exactly.

1554
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,230
(Is the all-you-can eat over?)

1555
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:45,269
Is that the map?

1556
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:48,670
This is the map of the whole farm. Now, you're at the entrance.

1557
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,970
That's where we are now.

1558
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,079
You can pick them in the farm yourselves...

1559
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,139
(Orchard owner)

1560
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:57,180
and eat.

1561
01:10:58,610 --> 01:11:01,009
- Is he saying we can pick them?
- I think so.

1562
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:02,249
We can experience it?

1563
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,279
We really can.

1564
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,250
(Scissors for picking placed on one side)

1565
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:08,120
You can eat them and bring them back home with you.

1566
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:10,659
(If you sign up for the picking, you can eat as much as you want...)

1567
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:11,729
(and take the fruits home!)

1568
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,430
The basket is cute.

1569
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:16,400
- One per person?
- One per person?

1570
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,529
- This? Let's go.
- Okay, let's go. Let's start.

1571
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:20,830
(Let's go pick the fruits.)

1572
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:22,769
(Walk up the orchard trail.)

1573
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:24,970
- Beautiful.
- It's nice and cool.

1574
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:27,739
(What's the first fruit they come across?)

1575
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:29,610
It's delicious.

1576
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:32,050
It's delicious?

1577
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:33,909
The color...

1578
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:35,020
(What's this?)

1579
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,720
(Dark purple fruits?)

1580
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:39,850
This...

1581
01:11:39,851 --> 01:11:41,620
(Taken aback by the unfamiliar fruit)

1582
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:44,360
Can I try it?

1583
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,490
- Okay.
- Right now?

1584
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,429
You can eat whatever you pick.

1585
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:49,460
(There's no limit to how much you eat as you pick!)

1586
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:50,800
It's okay?

1587
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:52,429
(He tries it cautiously.)

1588
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:54,070
It's very dark.

1589
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:56,040
- It's so sweet.
- This?

1590
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:57,970
- You know I'm not a fan of fruits.
- Hurry up and try it.

1591
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:01,310
(Na Ra tries too.)

1592
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:02,940
It's so sweet.

1593
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,580
- You know I'm not a fan of fruits.
- Hurry up and try it.

1594
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:08,820
(What's this fruit that captivated the members?)

1595
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:11,120
- It's so sweet.
- This?

1596
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:12,990
- You know I'm not a fan of fruits.
- Hurry up and try it.

1597
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:16,290
(Na Ra tries too.)

1598
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:19,630
- It's so sweet. What fruit is this?
- Hurry up and try it.

1599
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:25,070
(What's this fruit that captivated the members?)

1600
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:30,870
(European plums)

1601
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,970
(A type of plum that's commonly known as prune!)

1602
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:38,409
(Koreans have it mostly as juice...)

1603
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:41,250
(or dried prunes,)

1604
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:47,250
(but in Yoichi, you can have it raw!)

1605
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:52,330
(It's very sweet!)

1606
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:55,600
It turns my taste buds into a fool.

1607
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:59,630
(The mouth is full of its sweetness!)

1608
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,670
- You don't really like fruits.
- I don't eat them all year round.

1609
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:08,310
(He already ate his 3 years' worth of European plums.)

1610
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,540
(Putting it in his mouth)

1611
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:12,749
It's so delicious.

1612
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:13,780
(He can't stop eating it.)

1613
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:15,850
I got it.

1614
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,320
Ripe ones are soft when you press it.

1615
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:22,719
Like sponge cake. That's ripe. See? It's soft.

1616
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,720
(Soft plums are tasty.)

1617
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:26,060
Look.

1618
01:13:26,061 --> 01:13:27,090
(He spots Na Ra picking fruits.)

1619
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:30,200
Na Ra. When you press it, the well ripe ones will be soft.

1620
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:32,869
(He just demonstrates to her and puts it in his mouth.)

1621
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:33,870
Yes.

1622
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:35,570
(Smacking her lips)

1623
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:40,570
(I pick what I eat.)

1624
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,080
(Wiggling her eyebrows)

1625
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:49,450
It's so delicious.

1626
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:51,789
(She needs to leave some room for other fruits.)

1627
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:52,850
Should I eat one more?

1628
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:58,320
(But...)

1629
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:02,530
Try this. I recommend this. Try it.

1630
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,399
(Why are they all eating...)

1631
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,799
It's completely ripe, right?

1632
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,470
(Why are they all eating...)

1633
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:12,639
(and not collecting?)

1634
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,540
(Empty baskets)

1635
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:20,280
(They filled up their stomachs. It's time to fill up the baskets!)

1636
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:22,380
- How many should I pick?
- All of them.

1637
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,589
Why ask?

1638
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:27,189
(Getting greedy over fruits for the first time in his life)

1639
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:28,520
You should know it already.

1640
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:31,590
I'm going to stop here. I want to pick grapes.

1641
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,790
- Grapes.
- Me too.

1642
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:35,899
(After European plums is...)

1643
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,300
Grapes are the main fruit today.

1644
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:40,230
The main fruit is the grapes.

1645
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,300
Grapes. There they are.

1646
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,970
(They walk until they arrive at the vineyard!)

1647
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,539
(They walk under the vines.)

1648
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:53,050
Which are the ripe ones?

1649
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:54,610
You need to use scissors to pick grapes.

1650
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:56,450
Which ones should we pick?

1651
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:01,650
(The darker, the tastier.)

1652
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:04,420
They're all dark.

1653
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,600
I'm wearing sunglasses, so they all look dark.

1654
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:13,500
Let's pick the fresh ones.

1655
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:17,200
(With his eyes which can see a lot brighter now,)

1656
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:21,010
(grapes lover Hee Won starts picking grapes.)

1657
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:22,380
This...

1658
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:24,940
This has so many grapes.

1659
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:30,280
(Hee Won's strategy: Pick a bunch if it's big.)

1660
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:34,190
(Placing it carefully so the grapes won't be damaged)

1661
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:37,319
- This looks fine.
- Taste it before picking it.

1662
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,320
(Focused)

1663
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:42,230
It clearly looks delicious, Dong Il.

1664
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:46,300
(You don't have to taste it to know it'll be delicious.)

1665
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:48,530
(He places it proudly in the basket.)

1666
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:52,770
(It goes over the basket limit.)

1667
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:55,409
I just put two in.

1668
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:56,709
(The basket is smaller than they thought.)

1669
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:57,780
Right?

1670
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:01,380
(Myoung copies Hee Won and cuts a bunch.)

1671
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:03,420
My gosh.

1672
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,120
My gosh.

1673
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,090
You can't fit much in it.

1674
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,260
- Exactly.
- One already fills up the basket.

1675
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:17,400
(He goes over the limit with just one bunch.)

1676
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:19,870
I should eat it first.

1677
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:23,440
I think it's better to eat first and pick later.

1678
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:32,510
(Myoung plans to fill up his stomach instead of the basket.)

1679
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:35,550
(Dong Il was observing everything from the sideline.)

1680
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:39,650
(How can he maximize the basket space?)

1681
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:42,360
(I see!)

1682
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:46,160
(Dong Il realizes something.)

1683
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:47,330
Sir.

1684
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:50,260
Can you choose one and give it to me?

1685
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,000
A delicious bunch.

1686
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:53,469
If you don't know, always ask.

1687
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:54,730
(He immediately asks help from the orchard owner.)

1688
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:56,339
- Maybe...
- Maybe?

1689
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,740
(Maybe this.)

1690
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,539
(He picks the grapes recommended by the owner.)

1691
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:01,069
This one? Okay.

1692
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:02,340
(He picks the grapes recommended by the owner.)

1693
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:05,850
(He tries a grape.)

1694
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:07,180
I knew it would be delicious.

1695
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:08,980
This one.

1696
01:17:08,981 --> 01:17:13,449
(Dong Il's strategy: Whatever the owner picks is right.)

1697
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:14,520
I must try this.

1698
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:16,620
Master.

1699
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,490
Master.

1700
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,260
This. One more. Your choice.

1701
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:22,960
- Okay.
- You have to ask him.

1702
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:26,200
Master.

1703
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,430
One more. Last one more.

1704
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:33,440
(He called the master 684,214 times more.)

1705
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:36,239
(Fruit-lover Na Ra)

1706
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,810
- Okay.
- Try it before you pick it.

1707
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:40,909
These grapes are so good.

1708
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:41,950
Aren't they?

1709
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,549
I don't eat one fruit in a year.

1710
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:45,550
I know.

1711
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:47,650
These grapes are so good.

1712
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:51,220
Thank you.

1713
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:53,990
Thank you.

1714
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,260
You came at the perfect time, Myoung.

1715
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:59,299
Are we heading to that wine place?

1716
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,630
Yes, the wine place.

1717
01:18:00,730 --> 01:18:03,840
(Where's the wine place?)

1718
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:05,939
(The campsite owner introduced them to an orchard earlier.)

1719
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:06,970
Thank you.

1720
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,080
This place is...

1721
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:10,710
- Wine.
- Wine?

1722
01:18:10,711 --> 01:18:12,479
Wine? Winery?

1723
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,880
There are several wineries in Yoichi.

1724
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:18,579
- Wine? It's good?
- It's good.

1725
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:19,650
- Is it good?
- It's good.

1726
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:22,189
- Is it the best?
- It's the best.

1727
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:23,190
Okay.

1728
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:24,190
(Our local wine is good.)

1729
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,190
(The campsite owner strongly recommended the winery.)

1730
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:29,929
I want to try a glass of this white wine.

1731
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:31,059
That has to be good.

1732
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:32,070
(They are going to drop by a local winery in Yoichi.)

1733
01:18:32,370 --> 01:18:33,700
Since Myoung is here,

1734
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:36,140
we should buy some wine,

1735
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,739
directly from the winery.

1736
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,169
I love that.

1737
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:41,170
(They're going all the way to the winery to buy the wine.)

1738
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:42,809
(That makes the wine very precious.)

1739
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:43,840
I will savor it.

1740
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:45,410
We will buy the cheapest bottle.

1741
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:47,480
The cheapest bottle!

1742
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:49,319
(He hasn't changed a bit.)

1743
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,550
(Laughing)

1744
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:54,190
- I think it's over there.
- There?

1745
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:56,760
It must be there.

1746
01:18:57,390 --> 01:18:58,659
Thank you for driving.

1747
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:00,860
(What would the Hokkaido wine from the local winery be like?)

1748
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:02,060
(Excited)

1749
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,430
(They head to the winery with excitement.)

1750
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:07,400
(Amazed)

1751
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:11,240
(From a distance, from the middle of a vineyard,)

1752
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:17,640
(something races towards them.)

1753
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:20,080
(What is that?)

1754
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:23,920
(Why is there a KartRider in the vineyard?)

1755
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:26,649
He rode something cute.

1756
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:27,719
(Cute)

1757
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,060
I want that.

1758
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:33,830
(The one who got the campsite owner's call and came is...)

1759
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,329
Hello.

1760
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:36,330
(I heard you were coming.)

1761
01:19:36,331 --> 01:19:38,329
- Are you the father?
- Are you the father?

1762
01:19:38,330 --> 01:19:39,899
- Father?
- Father.

1763
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:42,769
(Yes. I am the father of the grapes.)

1764
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:47,070
- You make the wine yourself?
- Yes.

1765
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:49,579
(They are completely surrounded by the grapes.)

1766
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:50,640
Big size.

1767
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:52,310
This whole place is a vineyard.

1768
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:54,580
Do you want to see the vineyard?

1769
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:01,650
(A cozy winery nestled on the oak-covered hill.)

1770
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:06,560
(Vines densely covering the hillside in neat rows)

1771
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:08,789
- Grapes?
- Grapes.

1772
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:11,499
(It's a grape haven!)

1773
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:14,770
We grow grapes specifically for wine production.

1774
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,469
I guess grapes for wine are somehow different.

1775
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:19,940
(A vineyard devoted solely to wine.)

1776
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:23,340
This is a white grape variety called Pinot Gris.

1777
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,480
It looks pretty.

1778
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:29,350
- How fascinating.
- How fascinating.

1779
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:31,379
(I want to try it.)

1780
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:32,420
You can try it.

1781
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:36,120
- Pinot Gris?
- Pinot Gris. Yes.

1782
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:39,490
(Sour shock)

1783
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:42,499
(It's so sour.)

1784
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,560
It wouldn't be too sweet yet.

1785
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:46,230
Delicious.

1786
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:48,300
It's making me salivate.

1787
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:50,440
Are you okay?

1788
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:52,040
My mouth is watering.

1789
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:54,610
That was sour.

1790
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:59,179
(How sour can the grapes be?)

1791
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:01,350
(It is sour.)

1792
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,649
Your reactions are too different.

1793
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:04,650
(Everyone is reacting so differently now.)

1794
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:06,190
(Frowning)

1795
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:08,450
(Na Ra carefully tries it too.)

1796
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:12,830
(Calm)

1797
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:15,260
- It's so good.
- Is it?

1798
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:18,500
You eat it so well.

1799
01:21:19,130 --> 01:21:22,900
When you bite into it, when you chew the meat,

1800
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,740
and when you get the juice, they all taste different.

1801
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:27,140
It's so good.

1802
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:29,880
(That sounds convincing.)

1803
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:33,080
But it's got that rich fruit flavor...

1804
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:35,719
and intense sweetness.

1805
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,620
(Nodding)

1806
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:38,750
Pinot Gris?

1807
01:21:38,751 --> 01:21:41,020
(The sourness pops because it's not the harvest season yet.)

1808
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:44,960
(But when it's harvest time, they become sweet wine grapes.)

1809
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,889
It's clearly different.

1810
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:47,890
(It's not like the grapes we eat.)

1811
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:50,129
- It's fascinating.
- It's fascinating.

1812
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:51,200
(The world of wine is interesting.)

1813
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,429
Most grapevines...

1814
01:21:54,430 --> 01:21:56,139
- grow overhead.
- Right. Sideways.

1815
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:57,469
Why are they standing upright?

1816
01:21:57,470 --> 01:21:58,569
(Why do wine grapes grow vertically?)

1817
01:21:58,570 --> 01:22:00,039
They are different trees too.

1818
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,210
(Most grapes hang overhead like a roof.)

1819
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:02,540
The wine grapes are grown that way...

1820
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:06,380
(To concentrate the flavor and nutrients in each grape,)

1821
01:22:06,850 --> 01:22:10,420
(it’s important to expose them evenly to sunlight and wind.)

1822
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:12,350
That's why we grow them vertically.

1823
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:15,760
(I see.)

1824
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:19,090
In winter, snow piles up to here.

1825
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:23,160
- No way.
- This much?

1826
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,860
It comes all the way up here.

1827
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,270
(This green grapevine...)

1828
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:32,670
(turns into a white snow field in winter.)

1829
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:38,910
(It's the owner riding a snowboard at the vineyard.)

1830
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:43,020
(It may be a stunning winter scene of Hokkaido,)

1831
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:46,220
(but for the grapes, it’s a brutal struggle to survive.)

1832
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:47,520
What do you do then?

1833
01:22:47,950 --> 01:22:50,560
When that happens, I untie the strings,

1834
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,559
and bury them in the snow.

1835
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,330
(What?)

1836
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,070
(Bury them alive?)

1837
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:01,400
It's warmer inside the snow.

1838
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:04,070
(What is he talking about?)

1839
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:07,570
- No way.
- It's much colder outside.

1840
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:10,440
- It's warmer inside the snow.
- Is it?

1841
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,650
(They are the grapes that survive in the snow!)

1842
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:16,179
(The average temperature of winter Hokkaido is -25°C.)

1843
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:18,020
(But...)

1844
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:22,220
(Within the snow, the temperature stays above a certain level.)

1845
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,330
(So they lean the trees in winter...)

1846
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,899
(and let them get through the winter buried in the snow.)

1847
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,570
(Just like Haenam winter cabbages!)

1848
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:36,639
(How would the wine...)

1849
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:39,940
(made with the grapes that have endured...)

1850
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:43,439
(the harsh winter of Hokkaido taste?)

1851
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,680
I'm really curious.

1852
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,079
Can we taste the wine?

1853
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,749
Yes. You can.

1854
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,750
- We can? Thank you.
- Yes.

1855
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:53,450
(They head to the winery next to the vineyard for tasting.)

1856
01:23:53,451 --> 01:23:55,089
- Is this the winery?
- Winery. Yes.

1857
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:57,120
It's the winery. Goodness.

1858
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:01,260
(Surprised)

1859
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:03,500
It's so cool in here.

1860
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:04,760
The smell.

1861
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:08,229
- Oak? Oakwood.
- Oak.

1862
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:09,670
(A winery full of wine-scented oak barrels)

1863
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,670
That's the wine I made last December.

1864
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:14,240
In 2024.

1865
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,209
That's still new then.

1866
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:17,280
(It's been aging for 8 months now.)

1867
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:20,509
- Orange.
- Orange?

1868
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:21,550
- Orange wine?
- Orange wine.

1869
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:26,849
The color is neither red nor white.

1870
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:27,950
(It's neither red nor white.)

1871
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:29,920
Do you smell orange?

1872
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,729
(Na Ra who can't drink only smells.)

1873
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:33,760
I can't tell.

1874
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:37,560
(How would the orange wine taste?)

1875
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:42,900
(Tasting carefully)

1876
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:45,670
- Are you gargling?
- This is how you drink wine.

1877
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:47,939
- You put air into it.
- Is that right?

1878
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:49,640
- To smell the aroma.
- You feel it.

1879
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:53,950
It's got a very clean taste.

1880
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:57,450
It tastes like a high schooler who ran away from home.

1881
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:59,989
Like a young person who's full of passion.

1882
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:02,250
(Maybe it’s the taste of youth, bold and bursting with life...)

1883
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:05,560
(Tasting)

1884
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:09,599
(It does have that rebellious teen vibe.)

1885
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,729
When this orange wine matures a little more,

1886
01:25:13,730 --> 01:25:14,900
it will taste like mushroom, like truffles.

1887
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:16,899
That would be so good.

1888
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,200
(It's going to be so good.)

1889
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:23,080
(Aged Hokkaido wines are consumed almost entirely within Japan,)

1890
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:26,880
(as the region rises as one of Japan’s prominent wine producers.)

1891
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:29,919
(They get one precious bottle each.)

1892
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:30,950
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1893
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:34,390
(He's thrilled.)

1894
01:25:35,150 --> 01:25:39,630
When you go up the vineyard, there's a great place.

1895
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:41,960
Let's go.

1896
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:46,199
(Before heading back, they check out the owner’s view spot.)

1897
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,170
Since when have you been running this vineyard?

1898
01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:50,170
It's been about nine years.

1899
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:55,309
I'm sure you don't run it all by yourself.

1900
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:56,310
Right. That's too hard.

1901
01:25:56,410 --> 01:25:58,810
My wife and I are running it together.

1902
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:01,649
The two of you are running this whole place?

1903
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:03,150
- Just the two of you?
- That's romantic.

1904
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:06,819
They are living happily, managing this big land.

1905
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:07,849
Right.

1906
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:08,889
(How would it feel to live with this scenery?)

1907
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:10,060
We will get there shortly.

1908
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:15,329
What is that?

1909
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:16,960
(Beyond the vineyard hills we couldn’t see from below...)

1910
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:19,000
I see the ocean.

1911
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:24,070
Really?

1912
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,839
It's like a place from an animation.

1913
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:29,980
(It looks like the scenery straight out of an animation.)

1914
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:34,380
(Na Ra films the scenery for those she wants to share it with.)

1915
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:36,850
(Myoung records the moment too.)

1916
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:38,749
This is unbelievable.

1917
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:40,589
(Hee Won captured within Myoung's view of the scenery)

1918
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:43,319
This place is super pretty.

1919
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,989
- It's almost like...
- What?

1920
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:48,430
- a calendar photo of Europe.
- I know. It's so pretty.

1921
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:51,060
It's so pretty.

1922
01:26:51,061 --> 01:26:53,699
We should've brought the house here.

1923
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:54,999
(A precious landscape one would wish to call their front yard)

1924
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,570
- This place is beautiful, isn't it?
- It is.

1925
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,670
I want to bring my wife here and have wine and cheese.

1926
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:04,110
I want to drink grape juice, not wine.

1927
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:09,949
I'm so glad we came here.

1928
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:11,779
(They are happy to have come to Hokkaido.)

1929
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:13,390
What do you think, Myoung? Aren't you glad you came?

1930
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:14,849
I'm so glad.

1931
01:27:14,850 --> 01:27:15,919
It's incredible, isn't it?

1932
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,319
(What else will happen here in Hokkaido?)

1933
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:18,819
I'm so happy right now.

1934
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:20,930
(What else will happen here in Hokkaido?)

1935
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,860
(Hokkaido’s Summer-Only Route)

1936
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,929
(It's a place every tourist coming to Hokkaido visits.)

1937
01:27:24,930 --> 01:27:28,699
(It's a small city full of romance.)

1938
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:30,500
(They are going to Otaru.)

1939
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,440
(There's so much to do within half a day.)

1940
01:27:35,010 --> 01:27:38,240
(So, Dong Il prepared the pinpoint tour.)

1941
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,579
You can see the downtown of Otaru.

1942

1943
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:46,890

1944
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:50,290
(Only in Hokkaido’s summer)

1945
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:53,159
(Even a limited-time event!)

1946
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:56,160
(Baby squirrel)

1947
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:57,430
My goodness.

1948
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,700
(I can't hide the joy.)

1949
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:01,930
(Encouraged by the customers’ cheers,)

1950
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:05,139
(Passionate mode on!)

1951
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,240
(Are you eating it or not?)

1952
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,040
Gosh.

1953
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:11,210
(His knees gave in.)

1954
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:15,550
(Overloaded with love, and they can’t digest it all!)

1955
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:18,820
(Dong Il Tour stuffed with love. How will it end?)
