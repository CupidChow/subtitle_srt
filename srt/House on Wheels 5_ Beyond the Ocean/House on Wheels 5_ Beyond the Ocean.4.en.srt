1
00:00:31,593 --> 00:00:33,263
I'm so glad we came here.

2
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,363
I'm so happy.

3
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,533
(After a day in bountiful Yoichi...)

4
00:00:42,403 --> 00:00:46,543
(The Hokkaido summer sun has set.)

5
00:00:47,443 --> 00:00:49,812
(Winery, Front yard)

6
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:52,153
(Our family heads home too.)

7
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,823
(After driving down a forest road thickly lined with trees)

8
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:59,453
- I think we're here.
- I think so.

9
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:02,092
(They got home safely.)

10
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:03,123
Okay.

11
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,432
(Our yellow house warmly welcomes us home.)

12
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:06,592
- Let's get out.
- Okay.

13
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:08,133
- This should be fine, right?
- Yes.

14
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,733
It's chilly.

15
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,542
- It's chilly, right?
- Yes, I think we need long sleeves.

16
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,719
(Even in the middle of summer, Hokkaido evenings are chilly.)

17
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:20,513
(The front yard feels different from how it did during the day.)

18
00:01:21,483 --> 00:01:24,553
- Let's get ready. He's hungry.
- Ready.

19
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:26,782
(Rummaging around)

20
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:27,823
This.

21
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:30,082
- I'll bring a large plate.
- Yes, a large plate.

22
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,152
Yes.

23
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:32,329
(All of the things on the table...)

24
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:35,693
(are from Hokkaido.)

25
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:40,263
(Thanks to the spacious, fertile land, )

26
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:46,473
(Hokkaido is Japan's best food pantry.)

27
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:54,183
(During their first day in Hokkaido, )

28
00:01:54,813 --> 00:02:00,923
(our members acquired these foods themselves.)

29
00:02:01,523 --> 00:02:03,622
- With that, it's one dollar.
- One dollar with this?

30
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,752
- Yes.
- Okay, one dollar.

31
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:07,862
(Hokkaido's clean ingredients)

32
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:13,133
(Hokkaido's clean ingredients)

33
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,603
(Made with fresh, local ingredients)

34
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:20,173
(It's time for our first dinner in Hokkaido.)

35
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,502
- The cucumber and eggplant.
- I'll give those a rinse.

36
00:02:22,503 --> 00:02:23,863
(While Na Ra goes to the water...)

37
00:02:25,073 --> 00:02:27,683
(with things to rinse, )

38
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,313
(Hee Won comes into the kitchen.)

39
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,723
(Rummaging around)

40
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:39,153
(What is he doing alone in the kitchen?)

41
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:43,323
(He's even washing the pot...)

42
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:48,563
Wait. What should we do? We have rice, right?

43
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:49,833
We have rice.

44
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:53,173
Should I try mixing the rice?

45
00:02:54,543 --> 00:02:56,302
- The rice?
- With that sauce?

46
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:57,403
Oh, you should.

47
00:02:58,373 --> 00:03:00,242
If you add too much of that, it becomes too sour.

48
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:01,613
(Hee Won is cooking?)

49
00:03:01,943 --> 00:03:05,283
(Then he grabs a packet...)

50
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:07,553
(Oh, that's it.)

51
00:03:07,953 --> 00:03:10,523
(We use this at home.)

52
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:13,653
(And what is this?)

53
00:03:15,193 --> 00:03:17,192
(Sushi powder)

54
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:20,163
(You put it on rice.)

55
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:23,633
(When you make sushi, you need sushi vinegar made with...)

56
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:26,032
(sugar, )

57
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,772
(vinegar, )

58
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:30,943
(and salt.)

59
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:34,243
(These ingredients are boiled to make sushi vinegar.)

60
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:37,413
(This is a type of sushi vinegar powder!)

61
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:43,183
(It has sugar, vinegar, and salt all in one packet!)

62
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:47,123
(The fact that they bought this sushi powder means...)

63
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:48,762
Are you going to make sushi?

64
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:50,592
(Are you going to make sushi?)

65
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:52,292
(Sushi)

66
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:56,233
(The History of Sushi on House on Wheels)

67
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:59,073
(May 2020, Goseong)

68
00:03:59,503 --> 00:04:02,273
(With his flashy hand movements)

69
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:03,772
How is it?

70
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:06,143
(His first try at making sushi was a huge success.)

71
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:08,559
(August 2020, Geojedo, Every time he made sushi...)

72
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,583
(Oh, my!)

73
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:11,552
(He received explosive responses.)

74
00:04:11,553 --> 00:04:13,583
(Hee Won looks so young.)

75
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:17,383
(Dong Il became the Sushi King.)

76
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:20,823
(And...)

77
00:04:21,223 --> 00:04:24,393
(Hee Won has been watching this the whole time.)

78
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:28,063
(Hee Won...)

79
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:31,933
(will attempt to make sushi today!)

80
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,072
(Getting some rice for sushi)

81
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,143
Wait.

82
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,243
(What?)

83
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:40,493
Dong Il.

84
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:43,942
(He's not very sure of himself.)

85
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:45,037
- Dong Il.
- Yes?

86
00:04:45,883 --> 00:04:46,883
Rice.

87
00:04:46,884 --> 00:04:47,982
(Please confirm the amount of the rice.)

88
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:50,452
- Yes, the rice looks good.
- There's just a bit left there.

89
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:53,093
- Should I just use it all?
- You should taste it.

90
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:54,993
- The rice?
- Yes.

91
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:56,823
Taste the rice.

92
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:01,133
It tastes good.

93
00:05:01,663 --> 00:05:03,603
Then it's good. Is it a bit tangy?

94
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:05,902
No, I haven't done it yet.

95
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:07,223
(I haven't added the powder yet.)

96
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:10,703
(He just ate plain rice.)

97
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:13,272
- Now I have to mix it.
- That's important.

98
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:14,953
(I'll really add the sushi seasoning now.)

99
00:05:15,313 --> 00:05:19,653
(Sprinkle on some sushi powder.)

100
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:21,522
This is sour.

101
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:22,922
(The sour smell takes over the room as soon as he sprinkles some on.)

102
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:23,953
This sauce?

103
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:26,553
This is the right way, right?

104
00:05:26,554 --> 00:05:27,593
(Nervous...)

105
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:30,022
If you press too hard, everything will clump together.

106
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:31,363
Oh, right.

107
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:35,303
(After massaging it for a while)

108
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:39,333
Sushi King.

109
00:05:41,443 --> 00:05:43,543
(Flinching)

110
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:47,843
(I want the throne...)

111
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:51,283
(The aspiring Sushi King's first question)

112
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:54,153
Don't we need vinegar to make sushi?

113
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:57,353
It must be in that powder, right?

114
00:05:57,553 --> 00:05:58,952
That must be why it smells sour.

115
00:05:58,953 --> 00:05:59,992
Oh, is that it?

116
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,473
(That's what is in the sushi powder.)

117
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:04,833
(Let's see...)

118
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:07,532
Do we need to add something...

119
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,603
like vinegar? Or water or oil?

120
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:11,673
Let's ask.

121
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:13,073
Ask Dong Il.

122
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:15,172
Dong Il.

123
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:16,243
- Dong Il.
- Yes?

124
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:18,713
When mixing the rice,

125
00:06:19,243 --> 00:06:21,512
do I just add that seasoning? Nothing else?

126
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:22,513
Don't add anything else.

127
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:23,882
- That's all you need.
- Okay.

128
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,289
(Words from the master, Don't add anything else.)

129
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:26,413
Give this rice a taste.

130
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,083
- The rice? Shall I?
- Try a bit of this rice.

131
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:38,993
(Does it really taste like sushi with just the powder?)

132
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,333
- Oh, my.
- It's good, right?

133
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,833
It's good. This is nice.

134
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:47,432
Nice. All ready.

135
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:49,393
(He completed his first task without any issues.)

136
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:53,343
(Dong Il was prepping ingredients in the yard.)

137
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:56,982
I don't feel like I'm traveling.

138
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,982
I feel like a food truck guy here to make food.

139
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:01,053
A food truck guy.

140
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:04,353
(Our food truck guy is at the griddle again, )

141
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:07,353
(and he has many things to do on top of making sushi.)

142
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:11,093
- All preparations are complete.
- Look at this meat. It's insane.

143
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:12,433
(A reaction machine)

144
00:07:16,063 --> 00:07:17,432
Look at this.

145
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:18,903
(First, the wagyu steak for Myoung.)

146
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:23,873
(Lay it on the heated griddle, )

147
00:07:25,943 --> 00:07:30,083
(and the snowflake-shaped marbling melts with the sizzling sound.)

148
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:34,983
I should've used this thing starting from season one.

149
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:38,053
Failure is the mother of success.

150
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,123
You're so well educated.

151
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:44,792
- I've read some books.
- Right.

152
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:46,162
Not everyone can be a director.

153
00:07:46,163 --> 00:07:47,609
(This master and student duo really get along.)

154
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,833
Dong Il. What about the magic powder?

155
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,803
- Oh, it's already here.
- I see.

156
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:54,402
(Sprinkle on some magic powder they bought on the first day.)

157
00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:55,973
Myoung, look at this meat.

158
00:07:57,773 --> 00:08:00,313
- The smell is insane.
- That's all I have to do.

159
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:02,442
(The sound that comes along with the smell of the meat)

160
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:03,483
(Tap, tap)

161
00:08:04,013 --> 00:08:05,082
(Dong Il chopping onions)

162
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,412
- These onions...
- Right.

163
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:09,852
- We bought these there.
- I see.

164
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:10,952
It's truly organic.

165
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:12,729
(They acquired Yoichi onions from the farm they visited today.)

166
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:14,152
(The eggplants are from Yoichi too!)

167
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:16,823
This is really all natural, right?

168
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:19,433
This feels like such a healthy meal.

169
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,962
- Yes, it is.
- Right?

170
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:21,963
(Fresh, local produce)

171
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:26,973
(Grill the eggplants and onions on one side.)

172
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:30,373
(Golden brown)

173
00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:33,343
(The sight makes them exclaim.)

174
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,253
I'm doing my best for you, Myoung.

175
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:40,713
Thank you.

176
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:44,052
(And Hee Won)

177
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:46,153
(Looking underneath)

178
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:48,992
Only the two middle ones are on, Dong Il.

179
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:50,062
Yes, I need to adjust the fire.

180
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,103
(I want to know everything about Master Dong Il...)

181
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,632
I'll leave these here on the side to rest.

182
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:56,303
(Resting the meat on the warm side)

183
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:59,873
(While the wagyu becomes tastier, )

184
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,503
(the master gets ingredients ready to make sushi.)

185
00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:08,043
(The main ingredient for sushi is...)

186
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,613
(savory and rich Hokkaido tuna.)

187
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:17,383
(I, your student, will learn from you.)

188
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:21,192
(Fatty and tender tuna)

189
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,223
There we go.

190
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:26,763
(Make nice, thick slices.)

191
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:28,903
That looks so nice, Dong Il.

192
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,733
(Sneaking in some flattery)

193
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:34,203
(The second ingredients goes on the griddle.)

194
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:38,213
(Plump scallops from the Hokkaido ocean)

195
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:41,243
(Dong Il's secret to grilling scallops...)

196
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,482
(A pot lid)

197
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:47,453
(Steam as you grill to keep the scallops moist.)

198
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:51,053
(This is a high-level technique!)

199
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:54,993
(The main sushi ingredients are now ready.)

200
00:09:55,623 --> 00:09:56,992
We put the rice here...

201
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:58,292
- and make sushi, right?
- That's right.

202
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:00,133
(It's time to make sushi.)

203
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,503
- You learned that.
- Learned what?

204
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,102
How many grains of rice do you use to make sushi to go with alcohol?

205
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:08,903
(How many grains of rice do you use to make sushi to go with alcohol?)

206
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:13,543
(How do you know that?)

207
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,383
- It's 280 grains, right?
- Yes.

208
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,752
- How about when it's a meal?
- About 320 grains.

209
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:20,813
That's right.

210
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:23,653
(This is actually...)

211
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:27,353
(When a sushi master makes sushi, they use 320 grains of rice!)

212
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,463
(This is actually something they learned from a drama.)

213
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:34,333
(They just love dramas.)

214
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,403
(After getting a sense of his student's knowledge...)

215
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,133
Try making some sushi.

216
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:45,813
(You're finally giving me a chance!)

217
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,519
How many grains of rice do you use to make sushi to go with alcohol?

218
00:10:48,543 --> 00:10:50,183
- I use 280 grains of rice.
- Okay.

219
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,183
(Nervous)

220
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:58,423
That small cutting board there. Bring it over.

221
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:00,492
(A special 1-on-1 lesson with the sushi master)

222
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,863
Grab 280 grains of rice.

223
00:11:03,323 --> 00:11:04,422
(Teaching 1: Grab 280 grains of rice and make a ball.)

224
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:05,632
Make it round.

225
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:08,103
(Teaching 1: Grab 280 grains of rice and make a ball.)

226
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:11,063
(Flashy)

227
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:13,173
And then...

228
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:14,533
(Make the rice into a ball...)

229
00:11:14,803 --> 00:11:16,703
Get a bit of this...

230
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,443
and put it here.

231
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,819
(Teaching 2: Get wasabi on your finger and put it on the fish.)

232
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:24,143
(On the middle of the tuna)

233
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:25,913
And you press down.

234
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,623
Push down so that the rice spreads a little.

235
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:32,793
(The sushi made by the teacher...)

236
00:11:33,553 --> 00:11:36,423
(is the standard pretty sushi.)

237
00:11:36,623 --> 00:11:38,733
(And...)

238
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:43,503
(his pupil tries to make sushi for the first time.)

239
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,073
(Taking a bit of rice)

240
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:49,542
Make it round.

241
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,373
(Squeezing)

242
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:53,913
Don't lump it too hard. Don't do that.

243
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,012
There should be air in the rice.

244
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:57,683
That's a rice ball. You eat that.

245
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:00,682
- Sorry.
- The rice needs air.

246
00:12:00,683 --> 00:12:01,683
Roll it lightly.

247
00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:03,452
After that, lift it up.

248
00:12:03,453 --> 00:12:04,453
(Absorbed)

249
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,022
- Dab some wasabi.
- Dab some wasabi.

250
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:08,023
(Dab some wasabi...)

251
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:10,363
(and put it on the rice?)

252
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:12,293
No, on the sashimi.

253
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,932
Not the rice.

254
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,563
(Scolding him without hesitation)

255
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:18,402
I wouldn't blame you if you quit today.

256
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:20,533
Once you place it on the rice, press it down.

257
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,142
(Pressing down with the thought of quitting)

258
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,143
Okay?

259
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,143
Let me see.

260
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:27,873
(How's Hee Won's sushi made with all his might?)

261
00:12:28,343 --> 00:12:29,982
- Good.
- Good, right?

262
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,812
- You're good.
- You pass.

263
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:33,483
(He gets complimented at times.)

264
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:35,483
- We have to hurry up.
- What?

265
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,182
- Hurry up.
- I'm sorry.

266
00:12:37,183 --> 00:12:38,253
(But it's very rare.)

267
00:12:38,553 --> 00:12:40,793
(It's the real deal now!)

268
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:43,963
(As taught by his teacher, this pupil...)

269
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,492
(rolls 280 pieces of rice together.)

270
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:47,763
- Try it, Myoung.
- Okay.

271
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:50,503
The knife?

272
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:54,472
A bad knife makes it hard to do well.

273
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,772
(Squeezing)

274
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:56,773
Just go with it.

275
00:12:56,773 --> 00:12:57,773
(Squeezing)

276
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:01,882
(Placing a tuna on top)

277
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,343
(Pressing down)

278
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,283
(Disappointed)

279
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:08,682
I might've rolled too much rice.

280
00:13:08,683 --> 00:13:10,552
Hee Won, the rice is getting bigger.

281
00:13:10,553 --> 00:13:11,553
I know, right?

282
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:13,452
We'd get full from just that.

283
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:15,063
(These are tuna rice balls.)

284
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:18,663
Hee Won, the rice is getting chubbier.

285
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,963
I can't even tell if I'm squeezing hard or not.

286
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:25,272
- I see that.
- It's that light.

287
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:27,373
(It may look big, but it's all air.)

288
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:31,673
Okay. And then...

289
00:13:33,143 --> 00:13:34,843
Give me a piece of meat, Myoung.

290
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:37,082
Put it here. Place it here.

291
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,483
(A piece of wagyu is done resting.)

292
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:44,123
(The inside is juicy.)

293
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:47,223
(Try it.)

294
00:13:47,523 --> 00:13:48,523
Sorry.

295
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:50,923
Sorry.

296
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:52,863
- It went in my pocket.
- Really?

297
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:54,363
It survived.

298
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:57,433
- Keep it.
- Keep it?

299
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:00,272
(Amazed)

300
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,273
Come here, Na Ra.

301
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:03,342
(Na Ra also tries a piece.)

302
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,973
This is just...

303
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:08,743
(Her half-closed eyes show how good it is.)

304
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,783
Your mouth moves first, even before I give you food, Hee Won.

305
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:15,222
I didn't want you waiting.

306
00:14:15,223 --> 00:14:18,123
(Wagyu's taste is hard to wait for.)

307
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:20,993
Seriously, these look good.

308
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:23,393
Imagine it with aged kimchi.

309
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:28,162
In my opinion, this could be the best.

310
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:29,283
(Recommended by Kim Hee Won)

311
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,372
Dong Il, if we place aged kimchi on this...

312
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:33,973
(With well-cooked wagyu steak)

313
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:36,903
- Aged kimchi on top.
- Good.

314
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:39,273
With aged kimchi, no wasabi is needed.

315
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,112
I really want to see Myoung get shocked...

316
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:44,683
after trying this aged kimchi.

317
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:48,153
The aged kimchi is too big for the meat to stick.

318
00:14:48,683 --> 00:14:50,383
(Laughing)

319
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:52,153
Just place it on top.

320
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:54,223
There's no need to stick it on.

321
00:14:55,163 --> 00:14:56,163
(With tuna and aged kimchi wagyu sushi)

322
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:57,324
- Is that aged kimchi?
- Yes.

323
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:01,093
(With well-cooked scallops)

324
00:15:01,663 --> 00:15:04,063
(Even scallop sushi)

325
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,303
We don't have enough rice.

326
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,102
- Right? Okay. The griddle.
- Yes?

327
00:15:09,103 --> 00:15:11,003
- Warm both up.
- Okay.

328
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,543
Why?

329
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:14,343
That's it. Give it to me.

330
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,412
- Okay.
- It might be hot. Go slowly.

331
00:15:17,413 --> 00:15:18,652
(The master's trump card)

332
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:20,113
This is the highlight.

333
00:15:20,513 --> 00:15:22,553
The hot stone is super hot, Dong Il.

334
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,722
(On top of the hot stone)

335
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,653
- Goodness.
- Move it around.

336
00:15:30,123 --> 00:15:33,433
(He places the Hokkaido wagyu steak on top.)

337
00:15:35,363 --> 00:15:36,763
- What a waste.
- That's a bummer.

338
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:38,133
Seriously.

339
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,473
- It's okay. No, don't, Dong Il.
- Stop.

340
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,853
Think of how much a piece costs.

341
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:47,143
- Move it around.
- Be careful.

342
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:52,183
(Carefully placing the second steak)

343
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:55,183
It's sizzling.

344
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:57,223
All done.

345
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:59,423
Give me the eggs. Hurry.

346
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:02,723
Don't drop it. Don't break the yolk.

347
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:04,863
Break it lower. Be careful.

348
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:06,933
- Like this?
- Yes, well done.

349
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:10,963
You've become lenient, Dong Il.

350
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:15,442
What was our trip's motto again?

351
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:16,923
- Stay optimistic.
- Stay optimistic.

352
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:19,242
- All done.
- Hurry up and dig in.

353
00:16:19,243 --> 00:16:20,272
All right.

354
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:21,913
(Trump card 2: Fried eggs made with love)

355
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,883
(Place it on the dining table, )

356
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:31,053
(and today's feast is ready.)

357
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:33,252
Look at it sizzling on top.

358
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,613
(Sizzling on top of the hot stone)

359
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:35,862
Nice, right?

360
00:16:35,863 --> 00:16:39,063
(Hokkaido wagyu steak with eggplants and onions)

361
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:41,332
(Tuna and beef with aged kimchi)

362
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,933
It's a masterpiece.

363
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,502
This is crazy.

364
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:49,073
Gosh, it's...

365
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:50,842
(3 types of sushi by Hee Won)

366
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,773
I swear it's delicious.

367
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,483
(Local fruits picked by the members)

368
00:16:57,243 --> 00:16:59,052
(Made with ingredients from Hokkaido)

369
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:01,352
This is the best feast...

370
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,453
we can prepare for you, Myoung.

371
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,222
(Simply put, a table full of Hokkaido!)

372
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:07,223
- Sit.
- It looks good.

373
00:17:07,223 --> 00:17:08,223
Let's sit already.

374
00:17:08,623 --> 00:17:10,222
Let's dig in before they turn cold.

375
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:11,892
- A round of applause.
- A round of applause.

376
00:17:11,893 --> 00:17:13,632
(Clapping for Chefs Hee Won and Dong Il)

377
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,362
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

378
00:17:15,363 --> 00:17:16,433
Let's dig in.

379
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:19,133
Personally, I think...

380
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,842
it'd be best if you dip...

381
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:24,642
- the wagyu steak in the yolk.
- I see.

382
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:25,643
(Steak with egg yolk)

383
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:37,152
The yolk of viable eggs is great as a dip.

384
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:38,153
(Viable eggs from the farm)

385
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:39,952
- Unbelievable.
- Just pop it.

386
00:17:39,953 --> 00:17:40,953
(An unbelievable taste)

387
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:44,062
(Dipping all sides with the viable egg yolk)

388
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,533
Look at how juicy it is.

389
00:17:46,593 --> 00:17:49,763
(The melting flavor spreads in his mouth.)

390
00:17:50,063 --> 00:17:52,073
(Gulping)

391
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:56,643
(Swallowing hard, Myoung takes a bite.)

392
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,443
(This is it.)

393
00:18:02,843 --> 00:18:05,512
(Na Ra also dips into the yolk.)

394
00:18:05,513 --> 00:18:07,083
Look at how juicy it is.

395
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:11,622
(Her widened nostrils tell the truth.)

396
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:12,623
(As expected, )

397
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,323
(you're a gourmet!)

398
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:18,363
The yolk is amazing as a dip.

399
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:19,562
- Isn't the yolk good?
- Yes.

400
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:21,863
- Try it as a dip.
- Personally, I...

401
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:28,643
(The perfect harmony of fresh yolk and flavorful wagyu)

402
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:31,202
It's the best with egg yolks.

403
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:32,613
(Dong Il soaks it with egg yolk.)

404
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:37,583
- The meat is really tender.
- Right?

405
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:41,922
There are 4 eggplants. Have 1 each.

406
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:42,923
- Eggplants?
- Okay.

407
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:45,192
Dip the eggplant into the yolk.

408
00:18:45,193 --> 00:18:47,753
(Fresh eggplants from the nearby farm)

409
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,033
(It was simply grilled with Hokkaido butter.)

410
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:58,093
What should I dip the eggplant in?

411
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:00,333
Just eat it as is. It's already seasoned.

412
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,372
(Eating in sync)

413
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:04,403
It's delicious.

414
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:08,142
Buying the eggplants was the right choice.

415
00:19:08,143 --> 00:19:09,619
(The taste of farm-to-table freshness)

416
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:12,353
(Next to him, Na Ra tries the grilled onion.)

417
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:18,553
(Another bite right away)

418
00:19:20,223 --> 00:19:22,363
The onions next to the meat are great too.

419
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:23,463
Is it?

420
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:26,362
- On here, a piece of onion.
- This is really the best.

421
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:28,193
(Grilled onion, yolk, and beef)

422
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:33,703
(A delicious three-ingredient combo is complete.)

423
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,043
What they all have in common is that they're fresh.

424
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,143
Exactly.

425
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,413
(All fresh from Hokkaido)

426
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:41,043
Today's...

427
00:19:42,343 --> 00:19:43,983
tuna looked amazing.

428
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:52,052
(Hee Won's debut as a chef! 3 types of sushi set)

429
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:54,693
(Tuna, wagyu with aged kimchi and scallops)

430
00:19:55,323 --> 00:19:58,393
(The tuna sushi is first to be tasted.)

431
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:01,332
Don't lump it too hard. Don't do that.

432
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,463
(The training wasn't easy.)

433
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:08,773
(He desperately wanted to quit.)

434
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:12,613
(Will the pupil...)

435
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,612
(get his teacher's stamp of approval?)

436
00:20:15,613 --> 00:20:17,683
(Gulping)

437
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:20,282
(Taking a piece of tuna sushi)

438
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:21,283
Tuna sushi.

439
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:27,593
(The sushi master eats it.)

440
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:34,793
(Hold on, this tastes like...)

441
00:20:35,163 --> 00:20:36,163
(Attention, everyone.)

442
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:42,773
I seriously recommend the tuna sushi.

443
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:44,203
Na Ra.

444
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:47,073
The tuna melts in your mouth.

445
00:20:47,173 --> 00:20:48,843
- This right here?
- Try it.

446
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:50,983
Hey, Hee Won.

447
00:20:51,843 --> 00:20:53,413
- It's really good.
- Is it?

448
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:55,383
Try it.

449
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:58,223
(Trying the sushi he made)

450
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:00,223
What do you think?

451
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,722
Isn't it really tender?

452
00:21:02,723 --> 00:21:04,722
- The tuna is super tender.
- It melts in your mouth.

453
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,233
I'm serious. Try it, Myoung.

454
00:21:06,793 --> 00:21:08,153
The tuna just melts in your mouth.

455
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,903
Chew on it slowly.

456
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:13,532
(Chewing on it spreads...)

457
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,643
The tuna melts, doesn't it?

458
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:20,273
(the harmony of the sour rice and flavorful tuna.)

459
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,682
(And on top of that, )

460
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:26,913
(the rising star of the sushi industry's effort)

461
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:29,152
Isn't it really tender?

462
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:30,193
(Na Ra also eats a piece.)

463
00:21:31,283 --> 00:21:32,523
Right, Na Ra?

464
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,392
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

465
00:21:35,393 --> 00:21:37,523
(Both in name and reality, a new sushi king is born!)

466
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:41,333
(Feeling proud)

467
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:43,863
(His confidence has gone up.)

468
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,002
Here, Dong Il.

469
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:49,642
(Try the scallop sushi, dear teacher.)

470
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:50,702
Is it good?

471
00:21:50,703 --> 00:21:52,843
(I highly recommend it.)

472
00:21:53,943 --> 00:21:55,712
The scallop sushi is delicious.

473
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:56,783
(Let's see.)

474
00:21:58,113 --> 00:21:59,883
(As expected, it's good.)

475
00:21:59,983 --> 00:22:01,913
(Let me try as well.)

476
00:22:04,753 --> 00:22:07,053
(Impressed)

477
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:09,493
- The scallops are amazing.
- Right?

478
00:22:11,393 --> 00:22:14,292
(The scallop sushi is right up Myoung's alley.)

479
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:16,563
(Chewing)

480
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,273
- Dig in, Myoung.
- I will.

481
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:20,803
(Eating)

482
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,843
(Even the scallop sushi got a pass.)

483
00:22:25,003 --> 00:22:26,473
Personally, this...

484
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:28,982
- This right here.
- The aged kimchi?

485
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:30,713
I'm dying to try the one with aged kimchi.

486
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:34,012
Jokes aside, I'm certain it'll be good.

487
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:35,553
(Hee Won's aged kimchi wagyu sushi)

488
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:39,293
(Will his unbeatable record continue?)

489
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:41,553
(Amazed)

490
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:46,293
- How is this possible for meat?
- I know, right?

491
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:49,503
(Then...)

492
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,403
- Myoung.
- Yes?

493
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:55,032
Try one of these.

494
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:56,042
(I highly recommend it to you.)

495
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:57,872
- It may not look pretty.
- But still...

496
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:01,073
(Today's recommendation by the chef: Aged kimchi wagyu sushi)

497
00:23:01,643 --> 00:23:03,343
(Sour)

498
00:23:04,543 --> 00:23:05,612
It's good, right?

499
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:07,052
No, you have to dip it.

500
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,152
- Dip it?
- Yes.

501
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,383
- Dip it?
- Yes.

502
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,582
(It's good, but very sour.)

503
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:12,652
Dip it in a lot.

504
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:13,722
(Nobody notices.)

505
00:23:13,723 --> 00:23:14,723
Try it.

506
00:23:14,724 --> 00:23:16,092
(It's a lonely fight.)

507
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:17,623
No, that's too big.

508
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:19,633
It's incredible.

509
00:23:20,163 --> 00:23:22,232
(The new sushi king doesn't know anything.)

510
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:23,833
It's really good.

511
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,572
- Eat up.
- Make sure to dig in, Na Ra.

512
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:26,603
Okay.

513
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:29,142
I love it when you dig in.

514
00:23:29,143 --> 00:23:31,203
- What if I become a pig?
- I agree with him.

515
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,913
- Good.
- What would happen if you dug in?

516
00:23:34,143 --> 00:23:35,442
What if I become a pig?

517
00:23:35,443 --> 00:23:37,542
No, you don't have the face of one.

518
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:38,682
(You don't have the face of one.)

519
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,053
I can read faces, you know.

520
00:23:40,683 --> 00:23:42,323
He can literally do anything.

521
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:45,122
The aged kimchi is delicious.

522
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:46,483
(The new sushi king is satisfied.)

523
00:23:46,753 --> 00:23:48,893
Yesterday and today's meals were a big success.

524
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:51,892
And in Japan, not even in Korea.

525
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:52,933
Right?

526
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,362
Overseas, it's rare, but some restaurants...

527
00:23:55,363 --> 00:23:57,502
are much better than those in Korea.

528
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:58,563
Totally.

529
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:00,002
And that's here.

530
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:02,773
(And it's our House.)

531
00:24:03,173 --> 00:24:05,372
Honestly, the food that we get outside is good,

532
00:24:05,373 --> 00:24:07,572
- like the food we had in Japan.
- I see.

533
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:09,243
I was impressed by all of it.

534
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,882
But after I eat meals made by you, Dong Il,

535
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,283
they always end up being the best.

536
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:16,253
- Right?
- I can't recall the previous meals.

537
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:17,483
Exactly.

538
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,493
So, Myoung? Wasn't coming here right?

539
00:24:20,253 --> 00:24:24,023
Three of your seniors made this meal for you.

540
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:28,693
(Singing)

541
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:32,003
(To repay the members, )

542
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,502
His coffee is unforgettable.

543
00:24:35,503 --> 00:24:36,873
(Myoung made coffee.)

544
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:41,843
(What Na Ra is peeling with love...)

545
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:47,153
(are peaches, plums, and grapes that the members picked.)

546
00:24:47,513 --> 00:24:49,083
- It's good.
- Right?

547
00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:52,953
There's a reason this place is famous.

548
00:24:54,353 --> 00:24:55,452
The current time is...

549
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:56,622
- It's around 9.
- It's 9:14pm.

550
00:24:56,623 --> 00:24:58,423
It's nine? Let's wash up quickly.

551
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:01,992
(It's time to decide where to sleep.)

552
00:25:01,993 --> 00:25:03,432
(Girl 1, Guy 1)

553
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:05,533
(Guy 2, and Guy 3)

554
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:08,733
(The number of people sleeping indoors is quite odd.)

555
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:11,272
(Will Na Ra sleep indoors alone?)

556
00:25:11,273 --> 00:25:14,513
(Or will it be the three guys?)

557
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:19,953
(Just looking around)

558
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,303
Why is everyone suddenly silent?

559
00:25:26,453 --> 00:25:28,133
- Right?
- I'm fine with the tent, really.

560
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:31,163
(I'm fine with sleeping in the tent.)

561
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:34,332
(What? Na Ra will sleep in the tent?)

562
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,132
But the tent will be quite cold.

563
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:38,233
I can just bundle up.

564
00:25:38,363 --> 00:25:40,032
- I don't think it'll be that cold.
- True.

565
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,672
- Right?
- It's not that cold.

566
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,373
Yes, and it's been a while since he came over.

567
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:45,912
You want us three to sleep together?

568
00:25:45,913 --> 00:25:47,172
(Na Ra is being considerate for the three who united in a while.)

569
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:49,242
- Us three sleep together?
- You can chat and stuff.

570
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:50,443
Three in the house?

571
00:25:51,543 --> 00:25:52,552
Let's do that.

572
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:53,553
(Accepts right away)

573
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,823
- I bet it'll be nice.
- I agree.

574
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:58,122
I might end up crying when Myoung leaves.

575
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,592
(We should all sleep together.)

576
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:02,823
(No one can stop him.)

577
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:05,963
What?

578
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:08,333
Don't think I'm a hypocrite.

579
00:26:09,103 --> 00:26:10,962
I didn't say a thing, Hee Won.

580
00:26:10,963 --> 00:26:12,272
But your eyes are saying that.

581
00:26:12,273 --> 00:26:13,902
What about my eyes?

582
00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:15,503
I'm the one who suggested it.

583
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:17,573
I feel wronged.

584
00:26:20,543 --> 00:26:22,543
- What?
- I really like you.

585
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:26,382
Look at me with those eyes you had earlier.

586
00:26:26,383 --> 00:26:28,882
(House on Wheels is full of love.)

587
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:30,553
All set?

588
00:26:30,653 --> 00:26:32,352
Are you fine outdoors, Na Ra?

589
00:26:32,353 --> 00:26:33,852
- Are you okay with it?
- Are you fine with it?

590
00:26:33,853 --> 00:26:34,853
Yes.

591
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:36,662
- Seriously.
- Yes, I'm totally fine with it.

592
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:37,763
- Are you?
- Yes.

593
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:39,692
But your eyes are saying otherwise.

594
00:26:39,693 --> 00:26:41,163
I'm totally fine with it.

595
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,803
- Good.
- Good.

596
00:26:44,363 --> 00:26:45,932
- Let's gather up after we wash up.
- Okay.

597
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:47,333
- Okay.
- Let's get up.

598
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:52,073
(Today is Na Ra's first night sleeping in a tent, )

599
00:26:52,313 --> 00:26:56,883
(and also Hee Won's first night indoors!)

600
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,912
- Myoung.
- Yes?

601
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:01,383
Sleep in the far end. I'll sleep at this end.

602
00:27:01,783 --> 00:27:02,853
Okay.

603
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:08,722
(While Hee Won gives the warm spot to Myoung, )

604
00:27:08,723 --> 00:27:13,633
(Na Ra heads to her tent with the flashlight on.)

605
00:27:13,963 --> 00:27:18,463
(But why are there 2 tents?)

606
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:19,773
Goodnight.

607
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:21,172
- Na Ra.
- Yes?

608
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,902
- I'm sleeping in this tent.
- Okay.

609
00:27:22,903 --> 00:27:24,473
(There's no need to be scared.)

610
00:27:24,973 --> 00:27:26,842
(Worried that it's Na Ra's first night in a tent, )

611
00:27:26,843 --> 00:27:28,843
(Dong Il also decided to sleep outdoors.)

612
00:27:30,413 --> 00:27:32,353
- Goodnight, Dong Il.
- Goodnight.

613
00:27:34,713 --> 00:27:38,023
(Feeling a bit more relieved, Na Ra heads inside her tent.)

614
00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:40,152
I love it.

615
00:27:40,153 --> 00:27:42,253
(Her first impression of the tent.)

616
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:46,363
- Na Ra.
- Yes?

617
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:48,592
- It's not bad, right?
- No, it's nice.

618
00:27:48,593 --> 00:27:50,763
Okay. Goodnight.

619
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:53,132
- Goodnight.
- Night.

620
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:54,433
(Goodnight, Na Ra.)

621
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,173
- Myoung, goodnight.
- Yes?

622
00:27:58,373 --> 00:27:59,712
Sleep tight.

623
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:01,873
(Myoung, goodnight. Sleep tight.)

624
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:09,053
(That's how the first night in Hokkaido's summer passed.)

625
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:15,093
(Dawn breaks in silence.)

626
00:28:16,963 --> 00:28:21,363
(The foot of the mountain is covered with a light fog.)

627
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:26,002
(On the first night...)

628
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:30,542
(in the house and the tent, everyone sleeps peacefully.)

629
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,813
(Rustling)

630
00:28:35,743 --> 00:28:38,482
(As expected, Dong Il wakes up first.)

631
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,812
(He stretches, enjoying the fresh morning air.)

632
00:28:40,813 --> 00:28:43,583
(Is Na Ra sleeping well?)

633
00:28:43,883 --> 00:28:47,753
(After checking on the other members, )

634
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:53,463
(Dong Il sets off for his morning walk.)

635
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:59,703
(Rustling)

636
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:08,913
(Good morning.)

637
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:12,112
Good morning.

638
00:29:12,113 --> 00:29:14,852
(Who is she talking to?)

639
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:18,383
(Na Ra tidies her tent first thing in the morning.)

640
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:21,853
(Struggling)

641
00:29:22,793 --> 00:29:25,323
(She peeks outside.)

642
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:31,263
(The nearby campers are already preparing breakfast.)

643
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:33,802
(Na Ra's breakfast...)

644
00:29:33,803 --> 00:29:37,242
(is snacks?)

645
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:39,612
(Munching)

646
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,643
(Looking deep inside her tent, )

647
00:29:41,743 --> 00:29:43,012
(there's a pack of milk.)

648
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:44,283
(Why was it in there?)

649
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:51,483
(Her morning routine is quite different.)

650
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,453
Na Ra, Jang Na Ra.

651
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:55,893
Dong Il.

652
00:29:56,363 --> 00:29:58,393
Hi. What is that?

653
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:01,233
What are you eating as soon as you woke up?

654
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:05,433
From yesterday's?

655
00:30:06,033 --> 00:30:08,173
The variety of snacks?

656
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:10,873
Did you sleep well?

657
00:30:11,873 --> 00:30:14,773
I was quite scared when I first lay down.

658
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,013
But soon after,

659
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:20,382
I heard snoring from really close by.

660
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:21,653
So I snored.

661
00:30:22,013 --> 00:30:23,023
(Snoring)

662
00:30:25,353 --> 00:30:26,353
(Snoring)

663
00:30:28,553 --> 00:30:29,562
(Relieved)

664
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:32,393
(Thanks to it, Na Ra slept well.)

665
00:30:32,793 --> 00:30:34,732
(In her best condition)

666
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:36,363
(Sipping)

667
00:30:36,763 --> 00:30:39,573
You usually eat a lot, right, Na Ra?

668
00:30:40,073 --> 00:30:42,703
(No.)

669
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:44,272
I remember you eating...

670
00:30:44,273 --> 00:30:46,813
almost all the time on this trip, except when talking.

671
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:49,282
Here's the funny part.

672
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:51,342
I have been eating quite a lot during this trip.

673
00:30:51,343 --> 00:30:52,343
But...

674
00:30:52,983 --> 00:30:56,983
if you add up everything I eat in a day,

675
00:30:57,253 --> 00:30:59,253
it's not that much. I don't eat a lot.

676
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:01,122
Besides what you’ve digested.

677
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:02,123
(For real? Yes!)

678
00:31:02,124 --> 00:31:03,662
- Really?
- Yes. But I've been eating...

679
00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:04,923
a lot in Japan.

680
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:08,492
But how do you not get fat with all that food?

681
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:09,933
You're even eating right now.

682
00:31:10,503 --> 00:31:13,333
You're the one fattening people up, Dong Il.

683
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:16,773
You fatten us up with delicious food...

684
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:18,702
and then work out all by yourself.

685
00:31:18,703 --> 00:31:19,773
(You work out alone.)

686
00:31:20,843 --> 00:31:22,073
Isn't that harsh?

687
00:31:23,543 --> 00:31:24,643
Don't you think, Dong Il?

688
00:31:24,943 --> 00:31:25,952
When you get to my age,

689
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:27,852
you'll see how bitter it feels to see others succeed.

690
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,752
(I give extra treat to those I dislike.)

691
00:31:29,753 --> 00:31:31,683
Then next time,

692
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:33,892
make a special with people you hate.

693
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,692
(A special on making people he hates gain weight?)

694
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,263
I've been bringing him along.

695
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,462
- This is our fifth trip together.
- No, that's love.

696
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:43,462
(The 5th House on Wheels, he's been feeding Hee Won.)

697
00:31:43,463 --> 00:31:44,503
Is that love?

698
00:31:46,273 --> 00:31:48,733
(Beloved Hee Won appears.)

699
00:31:49,443 --> 00:31:52,043
- Did you sleep well, Na Ra?
- Good morning.

700
00:31:53,473 --> 00:31:54,573
I like the tent.

701
00:31:54,973 --> 00:31:56,212
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

702
00:31:56,213 --> 00:31:57,533
- Was it okay to sleep in?
- Yes.

703
00:31:58,013 --> 00:32:00,583
(Including Myoung, everyone got up.)

704
00:32:00,783 --> 00:32:03,722
- You slept well? How do you feel?
- I slept very well.

705
00:32:03,723 --> 00:32:05,122
- You did?
- Yes.

706
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,123
Was it nice?

707
00:32:07,053 --> 00:32:08,123
Was it nice?

708
00:32:08,323 --> 00:32:10,862
Did you enjoy sleeping indoors? I slept outside.

709
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:12,662
(Did you enjoy sleeping indoors? I slept outside.)

710
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:14,063
- Really?
- Yes.

711
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:17,302
I'm glad to hear that. This is our last trip together anyway.

712
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:18,562
(His endless affection to Myoung)

713
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:20,703
(Don't say that.)

714
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,503
(All the members are up.)

715
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:26,373
- The sun is very strong.
- I know.

716
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:29,143
It's so strong that it could pierce the sunglasses.

717
00:32:31,043 --> 00:32:32,442
(Leaning back)

718
00:32:32,443 --> 00:32:33,952
(They move quickly for the shade.)

719
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:35,713
(Leaning forward)

720
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:40,322
How is it? At a campsite in the Japanese countryside,

721
00:32:40,323 --> 00:32:42,603
you never imagined drinking coffee at this hour, did you?

722
00:32:43,323 --> 00:32:45,762
I keep blocking the sun for you.

723
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,793
I'm following you.

724
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:49,062
(Powerful and confident)

725
00:32:49,063 --> 00:32:51,462
But I keep putting you in the shade.

726
00:32:51,463 --> 00:32:53,933
- Try leaning back.
- Right.

727
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:55,932
There we go.

728
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,702
Gosh, you want to stay in the shade.

729
00:32:57,703 --> 00:32:58,983
(Adjusting himself in the shade)

730
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:00,373
(Exclaiming)

731
00:33:03,243 --> 00:33:04,312
Here you go, Dong Il.

732
00:33:04,313 --> 00:33:05,442
(Kim Hee Won, 54 years old, human shade)

733
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:08,003
Now that I got you in the shade, have a conversation with Na Ra.

734
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,553
(Comfortable)

735
00:33:13,153 --> 00:33:14,153
That's love.

736
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:16,293
It's love.

737
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:20,963
(House on Wheels is full of love at the start of the day.)

738
00:33:22,463 --> 00:33:25,903
(After getting a lot of love from Hee Won)

739
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:27,902
By the way, Na Ra...

740
00:33:27,903 --> 00:33:32,473
(He begins to fall into anguish.)

741
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:34,743
At 7:30am.

742
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,412
Then it'll be 8:30am. That's perfect.

743
00:33:37,413 --> 00:33:39,553
We will arrive at 9am. At 9am, we can go...

744
00:33:39,953 --> 00:33:42,983
directly to the observatory. Doesn't it open at 9am?

745
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:44,252
(Observatory?)

746
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:45,283
Yes.

747
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,092
Here's what we're doing today.

748
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,573
(Dong Il seems to have an itinerary.)

749
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,163
For the first time in Otaru,

750
00:33:53,593 --> 00:33:55,562
we're going to a place with a pub-like vibe.

751
00:33:55,563 --> 00:33:57,032
Gosh.

752
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:59,103
(Gosh)

753
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:04,902
(Otaru)

754
00:34:04,903 --> 00:34:11,283
(The city of white snow, Otaru)

755
00:34:12,113 --> 00:34:14,883
(Located on the western side of Hokkaido)

756
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:19,222
(From Sapporo, Hokkaido's main city, )

757
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,893
(it's about 1 hour away.)

758
00:34:21,423 --> 00:34:24,062
(Otaru, a small city that embodies...)

759
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:27,833
(the winter romance of Hokkaido)

760
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:33,033
(This is a crowd of tourists.)

761
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:36,973
(Renowned for its beautiful scenery around the canals, )

762
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,202
(this place is overflowing with...)

763
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,073
(an array of food and sights.)

764
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:52,053
(Introducing Otaru on a special midsummer day)

765
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:53,452
So you can count on me.

766
00:34:53,453 --> 00:34:56,093
(So you can count on me?)

767
00:34:56,593 --> 00:34:57,662
Let's go.

768
00:34:57,663 --> 00:34:59,433
(The host of today's itinerary in Otaru)

769
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:03,263
(Sung Dong Il)

770
00:35:03,703 --> 00:35:07,032
There's Otaru above Sapporo. It snows a lot there.

771
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:09,173
Most people go there for the snow, but actually,

772
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:12,242
spring and summer are the perfect seasons to visit.

773
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,683
It's cool because it's in the north.

774
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:15,512
(He knows the charms of Otaru in the summer inside out.)

775
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,953
It's similar to Gunsan in Korean as they have many fisheries.

776
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:19,682
They turned the city into a tourist attraction.

777
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:22,452
I did a lot of research on Otaru before the trip.

778
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,559
(Dong Il even did research on Otaru.)

779
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:26,392
These are the photo spots in a row.

780
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:27,453
It's a waterway.

781
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:29,422
These are warehouses.

782
00:35:29,423 --> 00:35:32,762
(Photo spot, history)

783
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:33,733
This is really good.

784
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:35,992
(Desserts)

785
00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:37,073
Na Ra, you must be excited.

786
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:39,972
(Carefully selected by Dong Il)

787
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:41,702
- Let's hurry up.
- Okay.

788
00:35:41,703 --> 00:35:43,972
We need to set out early. Myoung has to leave.

789
00:35:43,973 --> 00:35:47,113
(What kind of Otaru in the summer will Dong Il show us?)

790
00:35:48,257 --> 00:35:51,267
The weather doesn't disappoint us.

791
00:35:51,897 --> 00:35:52,897
I know.

792
00:35:53,297 --> 00:35:54,497
How many kilometers from here?

793
00:35:55,437 --> 00:35:56,767
It will take 25 minutes.

794
00:35:58,437 --> 00:36:01,507
(Otaru located next to Sapporo)

795
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:06,417
(From our front yard, it takes about 25 minutes.)

796
00:36:06,717 --> 00:36:07,747
Isn't that place...

797
00:36:08,347 --> 00:36:10,216
It's very popular internationally.

798
00:36:10,217 --> 00:36:11,687
- Right?
- Yes.

799
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:13,457
What makes it so popular?

800
00:36:13,817 --> 00:36:16,016
There are charming canals.

801
00:36:16,017 --> 00:36:19,397
It's full of cute things to eat. It's also clean.

802
00:36:19,797 --> 00:36:21,756
There are fancy cafes and dessert places.

803
00:36:21,757 --> 00:36:23,567
They also have amazing fish cakes.

804
00:36:24,427 --> 00:36:25,697
It's the center for everything.

805
00:36:26,837 --> 00:36:29,366
It must be the downtown.

806
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:30,507
- What?
- Downtown.

807
00:36:30,707 --> 00:36:32,506
It's downtown Otaru.

808
00:36:32,507 --> 00:36:33,536
(Guide Sung plans to select the best places.)

809
00:36:33,537 --> 00:36:35,377
(Confident)

810
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:37,976
Thankfully, there's no one.

811
00:36:37,977 --> 00:36:40,077
(They finally arrive.)

812
00:36:40,317 --> 00:36:41,416
Thank you for driving.

813
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:44,947
(The first item on Dong Il's top-tier tour)

814
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:48,716
See that? When we come up here,

815
00:36:48,717 --> 00:36:51,187
we can see the view of Otaru. Look at the sea.

816
00:36:51,927 --> 00:36:52,957
We can see it.

817
00:36:54,357 --> 00:36:57,166
This is the highest point in Otaru.

818
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:58,766
(They can already see the view of the ocean.)

819
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:02,037
We'll take a cable car and go up.

820
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:04,307
From here.

821
00:37:05,837 --> 00:37:07,237
- Do you have the wallet?
- Yes.

822
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:09,076
(Dong Il Tour)

823
00:37:09,077 --> 00:37:12,747
(Everyone follows Dong Il, the tour guide.)

824
00:37:13,017 --> 00:37:15,276
During my family trip in Japan,

825
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:17,346
- I wanted to come here.
- But you couldn't?

826
00:37:17,347 --> 00:37:19,486
We didn't have enough time. This is also my first time here.

827
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:24,157
(This is also my first time here.)

828
00:37:24,987 --> 00:37:26,697
(Then today...)

829
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:28,696
(Dong Il's top-tier tour...)

830
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:30,467
(that he doesn't know well either)

831
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:32,596
(The 4 1st-timers enter the ticket office.)

832
00:37:32,597 --> 00:37:35,237
Is no one in the office? All right.

833
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,706
(Automated ticket machine)

834
00:37:37,707 --> 00:37:38,707
Adult, round trip.

835
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:40,706
How many people?

836
00:37:40,707 --> 00:37:42,136
(Adult, round trip. How many people?)

837
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:44,007
- What should I do?
- I don't know.

838
00:37:44,107 --> 00:37:46,047
Isn't this right? Round trip...

839
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:49,487
I don't know.

840
00:37:50,517 --> 00:37:52,517
(It feels oddly familiar.)

841
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:56,056
(However, there's something different about Dong Il Tour.)

842
00:37:56,057 --> 00:37:57,897
Look at the others and see what they're doing.

843
00:37:58,557 --> 00:37:59,726
Here?

844
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:00,926
(Cheating)

845
00:38:00,927 --> 00:38:02,196
- Master.
- Master.

846
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:06,796
(Cheating)

847
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:08,267
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

848
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:09,806
(He asks the local.)

849
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:12,767
Is it... I see. Okay.

850
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:13,977
Okay.

851
00:38:14,277 --> 00:38:15,537
When you don't know, just ask.

852
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:19,847
(Guide Sung isn't hesitant. What will be the result?)

853
00:38:20,017 --> 00:38:21,076
(The tickets are printing. Thank you.)

854
00:38:21,077 --> 00:38:23,037
We have to pay. It's over once we hear thank you.

855
00:38:25,317 --> 00:38:28,186
(The guide feels proud.)

856
00:38:28,187 --> 00:38:29,217
Four tickets.

857
00:38:29,857 --> 00:38:31,056
Okay, let's go upstairs.

858
00:38:31,057 --> 00:38:33,627
(It's his first time, but the guide seems quite reliable.)

859
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:36,127
We have to wait in line.

860
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:39,497
(What they see when they come to get on the cable car)

861
00:38:40,437 --> 00:38:42,437
The first item on Dong Il Tour is...

862
00:38:42,837 --> 00:38:43,837
riding the cable car.

863
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:49,076
Your tour seems scientific, which isn't surprising.

864
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,077
What type of science?

865
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:52,646
Cable cars are based on science.

866
00:38:52,647 --> 00:38:53,947
- They are.
- Right.

867
00:38:54,217 --> 00:38:56,746
The science of straight lines and circles.

868
00:38:56,747 --> 00:38:58,707
(Kim Hee Won, "Cable cars are based on science.")

869
00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:00,317
Okay.

870
00:39:01,217 --> 00:39:04,387
(They move to get on the scientific cable car.)

871
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:07,257
(They enter with excitement.)

872
00:39:07,857 --> 00:39:09,657
To see the city, it's good to be in the back.

873
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:12,747
- Is this the back?
- Come and sit here, Na Ra.

874
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:15,467
- Dong Il, is this the back?
- Yes, this is the back.

875
00:39:16,137 --> 00:39:18,866
You can see the city in the back.

876
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:19,987
Aren't we going up this way?

877
00:39:20,607 --> 00:39:22,877
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- It's that way.

878
00:39:25,307 --> 00:39:27,646
(The 1st-class seat with the top view)

879
00:39:27,647 --> 00:39:29,787
Let's take the seat when we come down.

880
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:33,587
(Towards the peak while looking at the top)

881
00:39:36,857 --> 00:39:37,926
We're here.

882
00:39:37,927 --> 00:39:39,127
You're right.

883
00:39:40,597 --> 00:39:42,697
Everyone, don't lose your ticket.

884
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,197
- We have to show it again.
- Okay.

885
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:50,867
(Guide Sung leads the way as soon as they come up.)

886
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,237
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

887
00:39:54,377 --> 00:39:56,747
This place is amazing.

888
00:39:59,207 --> 00:40:02,616
(Beyond the glass wall, you can see...)

889
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:07,457
(the view of the green cityscape.)

890
00:40:11,357 --> 00:40:15,727
(It's so captivating that it makes you reach for the camera shutter.)

891
00:40:17,397 --> 00:40:18,767
Most people come to Otaru...

892
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:22,267
on a day trip while visiting Sapporo.

893
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:25,436
Those who come to Otaru for one day don't usually come here.

894
00:40:25,437 --> 00:40:27,306
(Otaru Observatory)

895
00:40:27,307 --> 00:40:31,007
(The observatory that's hard to visit during one-day trip)

896
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:37,487
(A place where you can enjoy colorful Otaru in a different way)

897
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:42,087
(As the view at night is especially magnificent, )

898
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:45,456
(it draws countless people who want to capture its beauty.)

899
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:46,527
All of this is...

900
00:40:48,097 --> 00:40:49,896
little and cute, don't you think?

901
00:40:49,897 --> 00:40:51,273
(What he wanted to show them before visiting the city)

902
00:40:51,297 --> 00:40:53,037
This is where...

903
00:40:53,437 --> 00:40:55,497
"Love Letter" was shot.

904
00:40:55,797 --> 00:40:57,837
"First Love" was also shot here.

905
00:40:58,337 --> 00:40:59,677
Is this where they shot the film?

906
00:41:01,477 --> 00:41:04,076
- Seriously?
- I think so.

907
00:41:04,077 --> 00:41:06,437
(The secret of Otaru that will be revealed on Dong Il Tour)

908
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:10,517
(Traces of the film are everywhere in the city.)

909
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:14,157
(Are you doing well?)

910
00:41:14,587 --> 00:41:17,987
(The uphill road in the movie "Love Letter")

911
00:41:18,487 --> 00:41:22,097
(The romantic path to work on a snowy day was also filmed in Otaru.)

912
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:26,067
(Also in the comic "Shota no Sushi" that's also popular in Korea)

913
00:41:27,267 --> 00:41:32,467
(The beautiful canal of Otaru also appears.)

914
00:41:32,937 --> 00:41:34,336
(Humming)

915
00:41:34,337 --> 00:41:35,977
This is lovely.

916
00:41:37,877 --> 00:41:38,947
(Exhaling in awe)

917
00:41:39,717 --> 00:41:42,016
Otaru isn't a big city.

918
00:41:42,017 --> 00:41:44,147
- You're right.
- It's small.

919
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:48,157
(We'll visit the places in the movie in Otaru today.)

920
00:41:49,727 --> 00:41:50,787
Let's go outside.

921
00:41:52,027 --> 00:41:54,697
(Why is he taking them outside after seeing the view?)

922
00:41:54,897 --> 00:41:56,127
What's this?

923
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:59,326
(A suspicious green structure that they see far away)

924
00:41:59,327 --> 00:42:03,107
Are there chipmunks over there?

925
00:42:04,237 --> 00:42:05,237
Inside that thing.

926
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:07,407
Am I wrong?

927
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:11,477
Chipmunks?

928
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:14,777
(Are there chipmunks inside the suspicious green structure?)

929
00:42:14,977 --> 00:42:17,217
They're going in. There are chipmunks here.

930
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:19,116
Right?

931
00:42:19,117 --> 00:42:21,087
(I looked it up. There are chipmunks here.)

932
00:42:21,657 --> 00:42:25,326
Come in. Close the door after you so the chipmunks don't get out.

933
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:26,927
- To keep the chipmunks inside.
- I see.

934
00:42:26,957 --> 00:42:29,196
(A special tour prepared by Dong Il)

935
00:42:29,197 --> 00:42:30,466
Chipmunks.

936
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:31,527
(Chipmunk Park)

937
00:42:32,527 --> 00:42:35,397
(Open only in the summer when it doesn't snow)

938
00:42:35,497 --> 00:42:39,367
(A special tourist spot in Otaru available only in the summer)

939
00:42:40,207 --> 00:42:43,177
(Last night, Dong Il looked it up and prepared it.)

940
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:45,276
(Limited summer edition of Dong Il Tour)

941
00:42:45,277 --> 00:42:47,216
- It's 300 yen for food.
- It's for the food.

942
00:42:47,217 --> 00:42:48,816
- Shall we buy 1?
- Let's buy 1.

943
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:50,946
(A special tour at Chipmunk Park)

944
00:42:50,947 --> 00:42:52,616
- For the chipmunks...
- It's their tasty restaurant.

945
00:42:52,617 --> 00:42:54,217
Chipmunks also have their popular spots.

946
00:42:54,587 --> 00:42:58,027
(Buying food for the chipmunks)

947
00:42:59,657 --> 00:43:01,997
- They're sunflower seeds.
- Sunflower?

948
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:05,866
(The members share the sunflower seeds.)

949
00:43:05,867 --> 00:43:07,196
- Here you go.
- That's a waste.

950
00:43:07,197 --> 00:43:08,367
One seed is okay.

951
00:43:08,997 --> 00:43:11,607
Like us, chipmunks don't eat food on the ground.

952
00:43:13,337 --> 00:43:14,377
That's enough for me.

953
00:43:15,077 --> 00:43:16,977
- It's over there.
- There?

954
00:43:18,147 --> 00:43:19,816
This is delicious.

955
00:43:19,817 --> 00:43:21,346
(Na Ra picks it up.)

956
00:43:21,347 --> 00:43:22,676
(Then...)

957
00:43:22,677 --> 00:43:24,546
In the past, when we were in school...

958
00:43:24,547 --> 00:43:28,457
(Is she eating it?)

959
00:43:32,457 --> 00:43:33,656
(Dong Il is also eating it.)

960
00:43:33,657 --> 00:43:34,856
This one isn't seasoned at all.

961
00:43:34,857 --> 00:43:36,297
Dong Il.

962
00:43:37,697 --> 00:43:40,397
(Eating is more important than looking at chipmunks.)

963
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:44,836
(What about the chipmunks?)

964
00:43:44,837 --> 00:43:45,907
Where are they?

965
00:43:47,977 --> 00:43:52,247
(Looking around)

966
00:43:52,347 --> 00:43:55,177
(Chipmunks aren't easy to find.)

967
00:43:57,717 --> 00:44:00,217
(I see.)

968
00:44:00,357 --> 00:44:02,816
(Did he find a chipmunk?)

969
00:44:02,817 --> 00:44:05,227
Goodness, it's so cute.

970
00:44:05,857 --> 00:44:08,327
(It made him pick up his camera right away.)

971
00:44:09,457 --> 00:44:11,927
(He found a cute, little creature.)

972
00:44:13,597 --> 00:44:15,797
Goodness, it's so cute.

973
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:25,926
(A small boy is feeding the chipmunk at the same time.)

974
00:44:27,173 --> 00:44:29,972
(The park is filled with people feeding chipmunks.)

975
00:44:29,973 --> 00:44:31,212
(Food)

976
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:34,242
(Either you sprinkle the food to attract them)

977
00:44:34,243 --> 00:44:35,382
(Here's your meal.)

978
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:38,453
(Or tempt them by showing it in front of them)

979
00:44:39,483 --> 00:44:41,753
(Do you want some?)

980
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:48,163
(Sometimes, you're lucky enough to have them on your palm.)

981
00:44:50,533 --> 00:44:53,362
(Will the members get chosen by the chipmunks?)

982
00:44:53,363 --> 00:44:55,863
It's so cute. When you do this, it comes near you.

983
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:00,273
I want to be chosen.

984
00:45:05,013 --> 00:45:06,043
I will stay like this.

985
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,113
Come and eat one.

986
00:45:16,223 --> 00:45:18,922
(Running away)

987
00:45:18,923 --> 00:45:21,923
(The chipmunk runs faraway from him.)

988
00:45:22,163 --> 00:45:24,462
It has a lot in its mouth.

989
00:45:24,463 --> 00:45:27,563
(Disappointed)

990
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:31,773
It's going to get full.

991
00:45:33,573 --> 00:45:36,173
(Feeling desperate to get chosen, Myoung spots this.)

992
00:45:37,243 --> 00:45:39,413
(People who are chosen)

993
00:45:40,713 --> 00:45:43,652
(Actually, there's a secret that Myoung doesn't know about.)

994
00:45:43,653 --> 00:45:46,653
(This is it.)

995
00:45:48,023 --> 00:45:50,723
(Chipmunks are naturally wary creatures.)

996
00:45:51,823 --> 00:45:54,663
(A necessary item to make them less wary)

997
00:45:55,793 --> 00:45:58,733
(It's a spoon.)

998
00:45:59,793 --> 00:46:02,803
(Chipmunks that are very wary)

999
00:46:03,873 --> 00:46:07,672
(They let down their guards in front of the spoon.)

1000
00:46:07,673 --> 00:46:10,313
(Comfortable)

1001
00:46:11,743 --> 00:46:13,442
(Without understanding how, Myoung just stares at them.)

1002
00:46:13,443 --> 00:46:14,683
(Jealous)

1003
00:46:15,783 --> 00:46:18,483
(While Myoung with bare hands is struggling)

1004
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:19,683
Maybe it's expired.

1005
00:46:19,783 --> 00:46:21,553
It's over there.

1006
00:46:21,983 --> 00:46:23,692
- Where?
- It's their popular place.

1007
00:46:23,693 --> 00:46:25,653
(The remaining members enter the chipmunk zone.)

1008
00:46:26,393 --> 00:46:28,622
We need to bring spoons. They were giving them out.

1009
00:46:28,623 --> 00:46:30,992
- Spoons?
- Bring four spoons.

1010
00:46:30,993 --> 00:46:32,233
(Does Dong Il know the secret?)

1011
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:37,173
(I looked up everything before coming.)

1012
00:46:37,873 --> 00:46:39,803
Na Ra, you have to feed them with a spoon.

1013
00:46:40,573 --> 00:46:41,872
- Use a spoon.
- Where are the chipmunks?

1014
00:46:41,873 --> 00:46:43,743
- They went right in here.
- Really?

1015
00:46:44,543 --> 00:46:46,313
They must be running around here.

1016
00:46:47,813 --> 00:46:50,042
If it went in here, it will come out.

1017
00:46:50,043 --> 00:46:52,553
The chipmunks are eating here. Here's one.

1018
00:46:52,913 --> 00:46:55,052
- Where?
- There's one right underneath.

1019
00:46:55,053 --> 00:46:56,082
Look over here.

1020
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:58,392
Baby chipmunk

1021
00:46:58,393 --> 00:47:00,963
- It's so cute. That's crazy.
- My goodness.

1022
00:47:01,993 --> 00:47:03,263
- Where did it go?
- It's here.

1023
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:04,792
It's so adorable.

1024
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:07,533
How is its mouth shaped like that?

1025
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,903
Excuse me. Please come and eat.

1026
00:47:11,773 --> 00:47:12,909
- My goodness.
- It's coming.

1027
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:15,503
It just looks adorable. Look at its paws.

1028
00:47:16,103 --> 00:47:18,212
- The fingers are cute too.
- You know what?

1029
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:19,789
It peels sunflower seeds better than me.

1030
00:47:19,813 --> 00:47:21,743
It's so deft with its fingers.

1031
00:47:22,343 --> 00:47:24,482
- Do you see how it's grabbing it?
- Yes.

1032
00:47:24,483 --> 00:47:27,182
Gosh, look how it's eating.

1033
00:47:27,183 --> 00:47:28,482
(Watching it eat food given with the fingers)

1034
00:47:28,483 --> 00:47:29,483
It's fast.

1035
00:47:29,484 --> 00:47:30,692
(Due to a lot of attention)

1036
00:47:30,693 --> 00:47:32,093
Take it already. My arm hurts.

1037
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:33,992
It doesn't want it.

1038
00:47:33,993 --> 00:47:34,993
(It runs away.)

1039
00:47:34,994 --> 00:47:36,523
It jumped up in one go.

1040
00:47:37,363 --> 00:47:38,363
(Munching)

1041
00:47:38,364 --> 00:47:41,802
(Devouring after finding a safe place)

1042
00:47:41,803 --> 00:47:42,832
(Munching)

1043
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:44,303
It's practically vibrating.

1044
00:47:44,803 --> 00:47:46,633
It holds the seed horizontally.

1045
00:47:47,003 --> 00:47:48,942
It munches on the seed.

1046
00:47:48,943 --> 00:47:50,542
It eats once every second.

1047
00:47:50,543 --> 00:47:51,572
(Moved from watching the chipmunk eat)

1048
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:53,242
After throwing it away, it keeps eating another one.

1049
00:47:53,243 --> 00:47:55,442
(Seeing Na Ra excited...)

1050
00:47:55,443 --> 00:47:58,313
(makes the tour guide satisfied.)

1051
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:00,152
(Dong Il gets satisfying reaction from the members.)

1052
00:48:00,153 --> 00:48:01,153
That's good enough.

1053
00:48:02,653 --> 00:48:03,693
Let's go.

1054
00:48:04,653 --> 00:48:05,653
All right.

1055
00:48:05,654 --> 00:48:07,463
(Announcing them to leave)

1056
00:48:08,963 --> 00:48:09,963
It's 10am.

1057
00:48:09,964 --> 00:48:11,563
(It's 10am now.)

1058
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:14,503
We have to move quickly. We need to go.

1059
00:48:16,233 --> 00:48:19,403
(Speed is key in Dong Il's top-tier tour.)

1060
00:48:20,373 --> 00:48:21,443
It's coming.

1061
00:48:21,943 --> 00:48:24,773
(Myoung is still absorbed in the chipmunks.)

1062
00:48:30,113 --> 00:48:31,113
Did they go out?

1063
00:48:36,483 --> 00:48:39,192
(He hurries to join the guide and his troop.)

1064
00:48:39,193 --> 00:48:42,323
This is a photo zone.

1065
00:48:42,823 --> 00:48:43,833
This is great.

1066
00:48:44,263 --> 00:48:46,503
- Which one would you like?
- Which one should I choose?

1067
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:47,833
(Relieved)

1068
00:48:47,834 --> 00:48:48,994
Could you take a photo of me?

1069
00:48:49,163 --> 00:48:51,302
Na Ra, could you pick the character for each of us?

1070
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,303
In that case...

1071
00:48:53,403 --> 00:48:54,443
Chipmunk.

1072
00:48:55,843 --> 00:48:57,212
- Who's the chipmunk?
- Should I...

1073
00:48:57,213 --> 00:48:58,653
- You want the chipmunk?
- Chipmunk.

1074
00:48:58,743 --> 00:48:59,863
Pick according to our image.

1075
00:49:00,613 --> 00:49:03,683
- Hee Won, you're the cable car.
- Cable car?

1076
00:49:04,753 --> 00:49:07,522
Okay. I'm the cable car, Dong Il.

1077
00:49:07,523 --> 00:49:08,523
Stand there.

1078
00:49:08,524 --> 00:49:12,822
One, two, three.

1079
00:49:12,823 --> 00:49:15,183
(A family photo with a suitable character for each of them)

1080
00:49:16,493 --> 00:49:17,933
- Hey, Na Ra.
- Yes?

1081
00:49:18,033 --> 00:49:20,232
- Why do I represent a cable car?
- Well, I...

1082
00:49:20,233 --> 00:49:22,203
- Am I scientific?
- No, not at all.

1083
00:49:23,063 --> 00:49:24,572
(Otaru expert's top-tier tour: 1. Tenguyama Observation Deck)

1084
00:49:24,573 --> 00:49:26,302
(A tour only in the summer where you can't come during a day trip)

1085
00:49:26,303 --> 00:49:29,643
(Rarity: 5 stars, Cuteness: 10 stars)

1086
00:49:30,313 --> 00:49:32,572
This is better than the countryside.

1087
00:49:32,573 --> 00:49:33,942
(Heading to downtown Otaru in a scientific cable car)

1088
00:49:33,943 --> 00:49:36,313
We need to hurry before lunchtime.

1089
00:49:37,453 --> 00:49:39,252
- We can't go in if there's a line.
- Okay, let's go.

1090
00:49:39,253 --> 00:49:40,253
We must hurry.

1091
00:49:40,723 --> 00:49:41,982
Let's go.

1092
00:49:41,983 --> 00:49:43,223
(They set out to have lunch.)

1093
00:49:44,223 --> 00:49:47,063
(Full of people and food)

1094
00:49:48,263 --> 00:49:53,533
(Otaru, the gourmet capital of Hokkaido)

1095
00:49:54,603 --> 00:49:56,103
It will be delicious.

1096
00:49:57,303 --> 00:49:59,672
(What food did Dong Il pick as the Otaru expert?)

1097
00:49:59,673 --> 00:50:01,143
Is it a famous restaurant?

1098
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:05,573
(This morning, Guide Sung...)

1099
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:08,182
(Researching locals' favorite restaurants in advance)

1100
00:50:08,183 --> 00:50:11,253
(The campsite owner got stopped during his walk.)

1101
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:13,283
Soy sauce ramen.

1102
00:50:14,853 --> 00:50:17,193
- Is this ramen the best?
- It's the best.

1103
00:50:19,523 --> 00:50:20,692
(After asking about the owner's favorite ramen restaurant)

1104
00:50:20,693 --> 00:50:22,423
When does it open?

1105
00:50:23,423 --> 00:50:26,533
(He also checks the hours meticulously.)

1106
00:50:27,263 --> 00:50:29,133
(Thank you.)

1107
00:50:29,433 --> 00:50:30,473
I'll call them.

1108
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:34,902
(Guide Sung planned everything out this morning.)

1109
00:50:34,903 --> 00:50:36,743
He told me...

1110
00:50:37,143 --> 00:50:39,572
about his favorite ramen restaurant in Otaru.

1111
00:50:39,573 --> 00:50:40,783
That sounds delicious.

1112
00:50:41,283 --> 00:50:45,183
(After a 10-minute drive from the observatory)

1113
00:50:45,953 --> 00:50:47,523
I think we're almost there.

1114
00:50:47,653 --> 00:50:49,323
I guess it's not in downtown.

1115
00:50:50,283 --> 00:50:51,292
Ramen.

1116
00:50:51,293 --> 00:50:55,593
It's in a residential neighborhood. It's not a tourist spot at all.

1117
00:50:56,623 --> 00:50:59,463
(They arrive at a quiet residential neighborhood.)

1118
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:02,203
- Do we go down this way?
- This is it.

1119
00:51:02,463 --> 00:51:04,872
(Fortunately, they arrived before the restaurant opened.)

1120
00:51:04,873 --> 00:51:05,873
It'll be delicious.

1121
00:51:05,874 --> 00:51:07,273
Is that a waiting line?

1122
00:51:07,403 --> 00:51:08,472
Is it where the line is?

1123
00:51:08,473 --> 00:51:09,773
All right. What line?

1124
00:51:10,913 --> 00:51:12,242
- Seriously?
- Oh, my.

1125
00:51:12,243 --> 00:51:13,843
- That could be it. That's it.
- Really?

1126
00:51:14,483 --> 00:51:15,582
Is it where the line is?

1127
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,583
(A long line before the opening of the restaurant)

1128
00:51:16,584 --> 00:51:17,952
Oh, my gosh.

1129
00:51:17,953 --> 00:51:19,953
(The queue is long even before the opening hours.)

1130
00:51:20,783 --> 00:51:24,293
(They quickly join at the end of the queue.)

1131
00:51:24,653 --> 00:51:27,163
(We thought we came pretty early.)

1132
00:51:28,063 --> 00:51:29,092
He's taking the orders.

1133
00:51:29,093 --> 00:51:30,223
This...

1134
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:32,333
- Soy sauce.
- Yes.

1135
00:51:32,733 --> 00:51:33,933
Soy sauce ramen.

1136
00:51:34,663 --> 00:51:35,802
(Guide Sung orders the dish he looked up in advance.)

1137
00:51:35,803 --> 00:51:36,832
- Yes.
- Soy sauce ramen.

1138
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:38,602
This one.

1139
00:51:38,603 --> 00:51:40,479
(Guide Sung orders the dish he looked up in advance.)

1140
00:51:40,503 --> 00:51:42,102
- Okay.
- They take orders in advance.

1141
00:51:42,103 --> 00:51:43,142
- Yes, in advance.
- This, four.

1142
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:45,743
- Four.
- Four, yes.

1143
00:51:46,113 --> 00:51:48,943
(The customers start entering one by one.)

1144
00:51:49,313 --> 00:51:50,453
- Okay.
- Okay.

1145
00:51:50,753 --> 00:51:52,393
- Do we go in already?
- Do we go in now?

1146
00:51:53,253 --> 00:51:55,322
- Really?
- They must've just opened.

1147
00:51:55,323 --> 00:51:56,383
- Is that so?
- My gosh.

1148
00:51:56,523 --> 00:51:58,692
It would've been bad if we came late.

1149
00:51:58,693 --> 00:52:00,122
(It would've been bad if they came just a bit later.)

1150
00:52:00,123 --> 00:52:01,193
Goodness, father.

1151
00:52:01,963 --> 00:52:03,193
Let's sit over here.

1152
00:52:04,393 --> 00:52:07,662
(They sit at one of the few tables left.)

1153
00:52:07,663 --> 00:52:10,133
(Exclaiming)

1154
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:11,973
We came just in time.

1155
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:14,402
(Guide Sung is happy to have made it at their opening time.)

1156
00:52:14,403 --> 00:52:17,002
We got lucky.

1157
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:18,772
I'm excited.

1158
00:52:18,773 --> 00:52:19,842
(Looking around.)

1159
00:52:19,843 --> 00:52:22,113
- It smells very savory.
- Right, the smell.

1160
00:52:25,553 --> 00:52:30,183
(Savory ramen broth smell spreads from the kitchen.)

1161
00:52:32,093 --> 00:52:36,523
(The interior looks old but neat.)

1162
00:52:37,463 --> 00:52:40,903
(And the queue that continues after opening)

1163
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,332
It smells savory.

1164
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:44,933
(It seems like we came to the right place.)

1165
00:52:45,503 --> 00:52:47,742
He introduced us to a very famous restaurant.

1166
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,772
Yes. He says he only goes to this restaurant for ramen.

1167
00:52:49,773 --> 00:52:52,443
Exactly. He introduced us to a genuinely famous restaurant.

1168
00:52:52,943 --> 00:52:54,612
- He's a regular here.
- Sorry?

1169
00:52:54,613 --> 00:52:56,282
The campsite owner is a regular here.

1170
00:52:56,283 --> 00:52:58,253
- They're here.
- They're here.

1171
00:52:58,353 --> 00:53:00,582
(The bowls of ramen they ordered finally arrive.)

1172
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:02,982
We added 1 more piece each. There are 2.

1173
00:53:02,983 --> 00:53:04,193
It's hot.

1174
00:53:04,423 --> 00:53:07,393
(Eyes fixed on them)

1175
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:14,033
(Tender pork and neatly-arranged toppings)

1176
00:53:16,033 --> 00:53:20,433
(Deep and warm flavor, soy sauce ramen)

1177
00:53:20,973 --> 00:53:23,242
(Many think of tonkotsu ramen, which uses pork broth...)

1178
00:53:23,243 --> 00:53:26,143
(and tastes thick and rich, when talking about Japanese ramen.)

1179
00:53:26,943 --> 00:53:30,083
(However, in Hokkaido, )

1180
00:53:30,513 --> 00:53:32,653
(there are the big 3 ramens as famous as that.)

1181
00:53:34,053 --> 00:53:38,323
(Strong soup using soybean paste as the base, soybean paste ramen)

1182
00:53:39,223 --> 00:53:43,963
(Clear soup seasoned with salt, salt ramen)

1183
00:53:44,663 --> 00:53:48,633
(And fragrant soup seasoned with soy sauce)

1184
00:53:49,103 --> 00:53:52,703
(Soy sauce ramen)

1185
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:55,472
(The ramen Dong Il ordered is soy sauce ramen.)

1186
00:53:55,473 --> 00:53:57,173
I'm looking forward to its first taste.

1187
00:53:58,773 --> 00:54:00,582
I'll try the soup first.

1188
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:02,383
- It looks good.
- This is clear soup.

1189
00:54:02,983 --> 00:54:05,413
Garlic. Add some garlic.

1190
00:54:06,353 --> 00:54:08,553
(Satisfied)

1191
00:54:09,883 --> 00:54:14,963
(Deep and flavorful broth tastes incredible!)

1192
00:54:17,193 --> 00:54:23,303
(What about the noodles?)

1193
00:54:25,903 --> 00:54:27,102
(It makes her eyes go wide!)

1194
00:54:27,103 --> 00:54:28,872
- Is it good, Na Ra?
- Yes, it is.

1195
00:54:28,873 --> 00:54:30,073
Do you mean it?

1196
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,423
(Humming)

1197
00:54:42,823 --> 00:54:44,583
Gong Myoung, you must be really enjoying it.

1198
00:54:45,923 --> 00:54:48,323
It would've been terrible if you'd left without eating this.

1199
00:54:48,823 --> 00:54:50,892
Exactly. I came to Japan, and I get to eat ramen too.

1200
00:54:50,893 --> 00:54:51,932
Right?

1201
00:54:51,933 --> 00:54:53,393
(It's worth his long trip to here.)

1202
00:54:54,203 --> 00:54:55,833
- It's so delicious.
- Right?

1203
00:54:56,703 --> 00:55:00,473
(Engrossed in slurping noodles)

1204
00:55:02,703 --> 00:55:06,113
(Taking a big bite of the pork topping)

1205
00:55:07,313 --> 00:55:09,443
The pork topping is very soft and tasty too.

1206
00:55:09,783 --> 00:55:10,852
Yes.

1207
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:12,452
It shreds easily like this.

1208
00:55:12,453 --> 00:55:14,183
(It shreds easily like this.)

1209
00:55:19,023 --> 00:55:22,623
(It melts in your mouth tenderly.)

1210
00:55:23,663 --> 00:55:27,463
(Myoung tries it too as he heard good things about it.)

1211
00:55:30,363 --> 00:55:32,302
(This is it.)

1212
00:55:32,303 --> 00:55:33,473
It's delicious.

1213
00:55:34,943 --> 00:55:36,772
This is the best ramen I've ever had.

1214
00:55:36,773 --> 00:55:37,773
Yes.

1215
00:55:37,774 --> 00:55:40,073
- Right?
- It's so good.

1216
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:43,943
(Wolfing down)

1217
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:46,283
(Guide Sung is feeling proud.)

1218
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:49,682
(He takes out something.)

1219
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:50,693
I...

1220
00:55:51,823 --> 00:55:54,892
(Wolfing down)

1221
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,693
(Guide Sung is feeling proud.)

1222
00:56:00,133 --> 00:56:01,203
I...

1223
00:56:01,363 --> 00:56:02,883
Anyone wants Cheongyang pepper powder?

1224
00:56:04,373 --> 00:56:05,772
(Cheongyang pepper powder?)

1225
00:56:05,773 --> 00:56:07,172
- This is...
- Cheongyang pepper powder.

1226
00:56:07,173 --> 00:56:09,042
Cheongyang pepper powder I brought from Korea.

1227
00:56:09,043 --> 00:56:10,919
(Sung's tip: When it feels greasy, add Cheongyang pepper powder.)

1228
00:56:10,943 --> 00:56:12,742
(Myoung gets curious and tries first.)

1229
00:56:12,743 --> 00:56:13,912
(Shaking)

1230
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:15,343
I feel like it will be very spicy.

1231
00:56:15,883 --> 00:56:16,983
It's spicy.

1232
00:56:17,653 --> 00:56:19,282
It'll be spicy if you add as much as Dong Il does.

1233
00:56:19,283 --> 00:56:20,822
(Adding a bit carefully)

1234
00:56:20,823 --> 00:56:22,323
This is enough for me.

1235
00:56:25,653 --> 00:56:29,063
(He tries it first!)

1236
00:56:29,263 --> 00:56:30,962
- Goodness. It changed.
- You startled me.

1237
00:56:30,963 --> 00:56:33,393
(It changed!)

1238
00:56:33,663 --> 00:56:35,302
- It changed.
- The taste?

1239
00:56:35,303 --> 00:56:36,363
(It's nice, right?)

1240
00:56:36,503 --> 00:56:38,433
- It changed?
- Adding it changed the taste.

1241
00:56:38,933 --> 00:56:40,943
(Really?)

1242
00:56:41,403 --> 00:56:42,573
It totally changed.

1243
00:56:42,773 --> 00:56:43,803
Yes.

1244
00:56:43,903 --> 00:56:45,872
(It's good, right?)

1245
00:56:45,873 --> 00:56:47,982
- Dong Il, I...
- Thank you.

1246
00:56:47,983 --> 00:56:49,782
- You need Cheongyang pepper powder.
- The taste...

1247
00:56:49,783 --> 00:56:52,413
- Add some.
- I added a bit,

1248
00:56:53,183 --> 00:56:54,523
and the taste changed.

1249
00:56:54,823 --> 00:56:57,993
(He adds a bit more of the powder.)

1250
00:56:58,993 --> 00:57:02,562
(Slurping)

1251
00:57:02,563 --> 00:57:04,092
It's the best.

1252
00:57:04,093 --> 00:57:05,192
(It's reborn into the best flavor.)

1253
00:57:05,193 --> 00:57:07,533
- Totally. Right, Hee Won?
- Yes.

1254
00:57:09,533 --> 00:57:12,002
(Soy sauce ramen, which can be heavy with its flavor)

1255
00:57:12,003 --> 00:57:14,273
(Korean spiciness is added to it.)

1256
00:57:15,603 --> 00:57:20,473
(It maximizes the cheerful flavor!)

1257
00:57:21,143 --> 00:57:22,282
(Myoung with his boosted appetite)

1258
00:57:22,283 --> 00:57:24,152
I think that's the case.

1259
00:57:24,153 --> 00:57:25,213
Is that so?

1260
00:57:25,453 --> 00:57:28,123
(Slurping)

1261
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:31,022
I've become a fool.

1262
00:57:31,023 --> 00:57:32,052
(Stuffing his face)

1263
00:57:32,053 --> 00:57:33,393
I don't know.

1264
00:57:34,593 --> 00:57:36,893
(He is about to put his face into the bowl.)

1265
00:57:37,893 --> 00:57:40,492
(Laughing)

1266
00:57:40,493 --> 00:57:42,033
You eat so well.

1267
00:57:43,603 --> 00:57:45,332
Myoung really eats so well.

1268
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:47,133
- He eats so well. It's nice to see.
- Yes.

1269
00:57:47,703 --> 00:57:49,173
Na Ra eats really well too.

1270
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:50,912
- I eat really well.
- I actually...

1271
00:57:50,913 --> 00:57:51,973
Now that I see her eat,

1272
00:57:52,073 --> 00:57:53,642
- she eats a lot too.
- I've been eating a lot here.

1273
00:57:53,643 --> 00:57:55,443
Yes, you eat a lot. It's so nice to see that.

1274
00:57:56,043 --> 00:57:58,012
- That's right.
- Yes.

1275
00:57:58,013 --> 00:57:59,682
- Me too.
- Good.

1276
00:57:59,683 --> 00:58:01,123
- Me too.
- Yes.

1277
00:58:03,923 --> 00:58:05,392
So far, this is the best ramen restaurant...

1278
00:58:05,393 --> 00:58:07,863
I've been to both in Korea and Japan.

1279
00:58:08,493 --> 00:58:09,522
I'm serious.

1280
00:58:09,523 --> 00:58:11,592
(Otaru expert's top-tier tour: 2. Soy sauce ramen restaurant)

1281
00:58:11,593 --> 00:58:12,762
(Refill the power of positivity...)

1282
00:58:12,763 --> 00:58:14,132
(in a restaurant recommended by a local!)

1283
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:16,633
(Taste, vibe)

1284
00:58:17,433 --> 00:58:20,303
(While Secretary Na Ra pays, )

1285
00:58:20,633 --> 00:58:22,642
(they take pictures outside as they wait for her.)

1286
00:58:22,643 --> 00:58:24,312
Look at the queue. It's a famous restaurant.

1287
00:58:24,313 --> 00:58:25,343
I know, right?

1288
00:58:26,143 --> 00:58:28,182
The queue was there since 10:30am,

1289
00:58:28,183 --> 00:58:31,112
and it will be there until 1 to 2pm, right?

1290
00:58:31,113 --> 00:58:33,183
He finished everything, rice and all.

1291
00:58:33,653 --> 00:58:35,022
- I'm full.
- Look at him.

1292
00:58:35,023 --> 00:58:37,182
(Blood sugar spike)

1293
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,322
Seriously.

1294
00:58:38,323 --> 00:58:42,322
(He tries to pull himself together.)

1295
00:58:42,323 --> 00:58:44,693
Did a bird poop on my shoulder?

1296
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:48,032
(Did a bird poop...)

1297
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:49,332
(on my shoulder?)

1298
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:50,763
That darn crow.

1299
00:58:51,603 --> 00:58:52,832
Bird poop...

1300
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,773
(Distinct white stain on his shoulder)

1301
00:58:55,243 --> 00:58:56,472
- Did you get hit by it?
- Oh, no.

1302
00:58:56,497 --> 00:58:57,667
(Look at this!)

1303
00:58:57,973 --> 00:58:59,212
You got hit by it.

1304
00:58:59,213 --> 00:59:01,082
I got hit by poop.

1305
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:02,442
- What poop?
- Darn you.

1306
00:59:02,443 --> 00:59:03,612
He needs to get changed.

1307
00:59:03,613 --> 00:59:05,252
- Why?
- A bird pooped on him.

1308
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:06,783
- A bird pooped on me.
- A dog?

1309
00:59:07,113 --> 00:59:08,753
- Bird poop.
- Bird?

1310
00:59:10,223 --> 00:59:11,693
You'll be blessed with good luck.

1311
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:13,453
Crow poop...

1312
00:59:13,553 --> 00:59:16,022
It's crow poop, not any other bird poop.

1313
00:59:16,023 --> 00:59:18,793
- Exactly. It's not easy to get.
- I felt something drop.

1314
00:59:19,363 --> 00:59:20,692
Look at this punk. He won't even come near me...

1315
00:59:20,693 --> 00:59:21,702
because of the smell.

1316
00:59:21,703 --> 00:59:23,363
I was looking...

1317
00:59:24,033 --> 00:59:25,473
from here.

1318
00:59:26,403 --> 00:59:28,873
I thought something'd dropped.

1319
00:59:29,443 --> 00:59:30,673
But it was poop.

1320
00:59:31,543 --> 00:59:33,142
- You know the exact location.
- Yes.

1321
00:59:33,143 --> 00:59:34,443
Where the poop dropped.

1322
00:59:35,843 --> 00:59:38,012
He must've been watching it closely.

1323
00:59:38,013 --> 00:59:39,683
He knows the exact location.

1324
00:59:40,683 --> 00:59:42,803
Am I going to pick up free money on the ground today?

1325
00:59:43,353 --> 00:59:44,422
(Is this good luck or bad luck.)

1326
00:59:44,423 --> 00:59:45,552
- It...
- If you rub it,

1327
00:59:45,553 --> 00:59:47,092
it'll smudge even worse.

1328
00:59:47,093 --> 00:59:48,399
(I don't care about it. I'm upset.)

1329
00:59:48,423 --> 00:59:49,493
Goodness.

1330
00:59:50,463 --> 00:59:52,183
- It doesn't show, right?
- No. It's clean.

1331
00:59:53,193 --> 00:59:54,303
My shoulder feels light.

1332
00:59:55,163 --> 00:59:56,432
It really does.

1333
00:59:56,433 --> 00:59:58,202
(Flapping)

1334
00:59:58,203 --> 00:59:59,833
It feels like I had a rehab.

1335
01:00:00,103 --> 01:00:01,783
Does crow poop really bring you good luck?

1336
01:00:02,873 --> 01:00:04,573
This is ridiculous.

1337
01:00:05,613 --> 01:00:06,942
It's a fun trip.

1338
01:00:06,943 --> 01:00:09,713
(What will this lead to in the future?)

1339
01:00:10,283 --> 01:00:11,312
Let's go.

1340
01:00:11,313 --> 01:00:13,252
Just follow me. I know the way.

1341
01:00:13,253 --> 01:00:15,453
Let's go. Come on, buddy.

1342
01:00:16,453 --> 01:00:18,492
(Into the swarming crowd)

1343
01:00:18,493 --> 01:00:21,462
- There are so many people.
- That's nice.

1344
01:00:21,463 --> 01:00:22,493
That's nice.

1345
01:00:22,793 --> 01:00:25,792
(They all look around busily.)

1346
01:00:25,793 --> 01:00:27,392
It's really like...

1347
01:00:27,393 --> 01:00:29,132
Dong Il, it feels like we're in Japan.

1348
01:00:29,133 --> 01:00:30,362
Finally it feels like Japan. I told you.

1349
01:00:30,363 --> 01:00:32,772
- Now...
- I'm in Japan.

1350
01:00:32,773 --> 01:00:34,973
I only realized this a week after I came here.

1351
01:00:35,043 --> 01:00:36,103
Seriously.

1352
01:00:37,043 --> 01:00:38,242
After a week in Japan.

1353
01:00:38,243 --> 01:00:40,642
Isn't this the most flashy place we've been to?

1354
01:00:40,643 --> 01:00:41,712
It is.

1355
01:00:41,713 --> 01:00:43,813
(Welcome)

1356
01:00:44,013 --> 01:00:45,683
- It's nice.
- This is a market.

1357
01:00:46,613 --> 01:00:47,982
- I see.
- All the way until there.

1358
01:00:47,983 --> 01:00:50,253
(You can taste seasonal seafood fresh and cheap.)

1359
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:54,523
(So both locals and tourists come to this market.)

1360
01:00:55,723 --> 01:00:57,893
- In its own way.
- Yes.

1361
01:00:58,633 --> 01:00:59,663
Right?

1362
01:01:01,103 --> 01:01:02,762
This is an unused railway.

1363
01:01:02,763 --> 01:01:03,902
(The next attraction, an unused railway)

1364
01:01:03,903 --> 01:01:06,073
- It's stopped now.
- Really?

1365
01:01:07,773 --> 01:01:10,742
(The railway crosses the middle of the road.)

1366
01:01:10,743 --> 01:01:11,743
The railway.

1367
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,673
Is this Galaxy Express 999?

1368
01:01:13,973 --> 01:01:15,843
They don't use it anymore.

1369
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:18,383
It's a stopped railway.

1370
01:01:18,783 --> 01:01:22,622
The train cuts across the darkness

1371
01:01:22,623 --> 01:01:27,453
(It's now become a trail and a hot spot for pictures!)

1372
01:01:28,323 --> 01:01:29,392
(Shall we take a photo to remember this moment too?)

1373
01:01:29,393 --> 01:01:30,462
A railway.

1374
01:01:30,463 --> 01:01:32,962
(He's moving on already?)

1375
01:01:32,963 --> 01:01:36,332
This is where I bought the glass art. It's very pretty.

1376
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:38,773
(The guide is rather impatient.)

1377
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:42,943
(Glass art?)

1378
01:01:43,443 --> 01:01:45,342
(Hee Won who was staying by Myoung's side...)

1379
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,072
(Moving quietly)

1380
01:01:47,073 --> 01:01:49,443
(Hee Won who was staying by Myoung's side...)

1381
01:01:50,143 --> 01:01:51,183
Hello.

1382
01:01:51,553 --> 01:01:52,812
Na Ra will like it.

1383
01:01:52,813 --> 01:01:53,852
(Dong Il wants to show them a lot of things in short time.)

1384
01:01:53,853 --> 01:01:55,323
- I bought it here.
- It's pretty.

1385
01:01:56,723 --> 01:01:59,352
Myoung. Do you need to buy a gift for anyone? Where is he?

1386
01:01:59,353 --> 01:02:01,593
(Myoung isn't here.)

1387
01:02:02,323 --> 01:02:06,363
(He is enjoying Dong Il Tour to the fullest on his own.)

1388
01:02:07,133 --> 01:02:10,433
(He must take a picture to remember this moment.)

1389
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:15,303
(I love Dong Il Tour.)

1390
01:02:16,043 --> 01:02:20,543
(Once satisfied, he goes to the members.)

1391
01:02:21,983 --> 01:02:24,212
They're famous for their glass too.

1392
01:02:24,213 --> 01:02:25,252
(They're leaving already?)

1393
01:02:25,253 --> 01:02:27,612
Otaru is famous for their glass art.

1394
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:29,282
(A characteristic of Dong Il Tour)

1395
01:02:29,283 --> 01:02:32,052
There's a much bigger shop over there.

1396
01:02:32,053 --> 01:02:33,752
(He has so many things to show that he doesn't give you time to see.)

1397
01:02:33,753 --> 01:02:36,222
When guides take you to shops like that,

1398
01:02:36,223 --> 01:02:37,322
it usually means they get some commission.

1399
01:02:37,323 --> 01:02:38,362
(Dong Il Tour)

1400
01:02:38,363 --> 01:02:39,363
Is that right?

1401
01:02:39,364 --> 01:02:40,533
(Laughing)

1402
01:02:41,433 --> 01:02:43,102
- It's the truth.
- When you go...

1403
01:02:43,103 --> 01:02:44,362
- on a group tour, right?
- Yes.

1404
01:02:44,363 --> 01:02:47,402
- It's the truth.
- Ice cream. This...

1405
01:02:47,403 --> 01:02:48,973
They're queued up for it too.

1406
01:02:50,073 --> 01:02:51,513
They queue here too.

1407
01:02:52,013 --> 01:02:54,513
You like milk. Four ice creams.

1408
01:02:55,183 --> 01:02:57,543
- It looks delicious.
- Thank you.

1409
01:02:58,253 --> 01:02:59,283
Vanilla ice cream.

1410
01:02:59,953 --> 01:03:03,183
(Made with fresh milk from Hokkaido)

1411
01:03:03,623 --> 01:03:06,392
(You must go to this ice cream shop if you're in Otaru.)

1412
01:03:06,393 --> 01:03:07,633
(It makes your eyes open wide.)

1413
01:03:07,793 --> 01:03:10,563
(Taking pictures is a must.)

1414
01:03:10,823 --> 01:03:13,232
- Okay. Vanilla.
- Vanilla.

1415
01:03:13,233 --> 01:03:14,233
- What about you?
- Mix.

1416
01:03:14,234 --> 01:03:15,502
Mix two, vanilla...

1417
01:03:15,503 --> 01:03:17,532
Sorry. Cone or cup?

1418
01:03:17,533 --> 01:03:18,802
- Cone.
- All cone?

1419
01:03:18,803 --> 01:03:19,833
- All cone.
- Cone.

1420
01:03:20,703 --> 01:03:22,772
Here's the ice cream. Whose is this?

1421
01:03:22,773 --> 01:03:24,473
- Mixed flavor is mine.
- Okay.

1422
01:03:25,413 --> 01:03:26,513
It looks tasty.

1423
01:03:26,773 --> 01:03:28,682
- Okay.
- Dong Il, ours is plain vanilla.

1424
01:03:28,683 --> 01:03:29,813
This is mixed.

1425
01:03:29,913 --> 01:03:31,889
Say it without getting angry. We're in an ice cream shop.

1426
01:03:31,913 --> 01:03:34,652
It's my sunglasses. I was smiling.

1427
01:03:34,653 --> 01:03:36,853
(He has a smiley face.)

1428
01:03:37,823 --> 01:03:40,793
(I can't wait anymore.)

1429
01:03:41,093 --> 01:03:44,693
(It makes him open his eyes wide.)

1430
01:03:45,163 --> 01:03:46,233
(Humming in amazement)

1431
01:03:46,293 --> 01:03:47,332
(Even the guide is excited.)

1432
01:03:47,333 --> 01:03:49,703
Thank you.

1433
01:03:50,433 --> 01:03:53,432
(Dessert lover Na Ra holds her precious in her hand.)

1434
01:03:53,433 --> 01:03:54,802
(Satisfied)

1435
01:03:54,803 --> 01:03:56,443
This is very savory, isn't it?

1436
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:00,172
(Creamy and thick milk)

1437
01:04:00,173 --> 01:04:01,913
It's really delicious.

1438
01:04:02,413 --> 01:04:04,042
- It's very good, right?
- This is insane.

1439
01:04:04,043 --> 01:04:05,113
- Right?
- Yes.

1440
01:04:06,783 --> 01:04:08,022
- I should eat it before it melts.
- Exactly. It melts faster...

1441
01:04:08,023 --> 01:04:09,523
because of the wind.

1442
01:04:10,323 --> 01:04:11,353
This...

1443
01:04:11,893 --> 01:04:14,123
You should stand still and eat.

1444
01:04:14,593 --> 01:04:16,693
It will melt in the sun. That will be a waste.

1445
01:04:17,993 --> 01:04:19,262
- This is good.
- It's good.

1446
01:04:19,263 --> 01:04:20,892
(Is Na Ra taking a picture of them?)

1447
01:04:20,893 --> 01:04:21,902
(Laughing)

1448
01:04:21,903 --> 01:04:25,072
You're wearing black, and three of you are wearing sunglasses.

1449
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:26,502
You eating ice cream like this makes you look like...

1450
01:04:26,503 --> 01:04:28,573
you're eating it while you're up to no good.

1451
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:30,603
She always says stuff like that.

1452
01:04:31,643 --> 01:04:33,943
People who do nice things eat ice cream too.

1453
01:04:34,813 --> 01:04:35,983
(Eating)

1454
01:04:36,713 --> 01:04:37,982
- This is good.
- It's delicious.

1455
01:04:37,983 --> 01:04:40,512
(Don't worry, they're eating after doing something good.)

1456
01:04:40,513 --> 01:04:41,623
It's so delicious.

1457
01:04:41,953 --> 01:04:42,953
Seriously though,

1458
01:04:44,453 --> 01:04:45,969
it's the type of ice cream you were looking for, right?

1459
01:04:45,993 --> 01:04:47,022
We found the right one.

1460
01:04:47,023 --> 01:04:49,793
(I really like Dong Il Tour.)

1461
01:04:50,263 --> 01:04:51,933
- Goodness.
- Na Ra is excited.

1462
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:54,232
My hands feel so cold.

1463
01:04:54,233 --> 01:04:56,393
(Her hands feel cold, but she can't stop moving them.)

1464
01:04:56,663 --> 01:05:01,133
(She finishes down to the final drop.)

1465
01:05:01,943 --> 01:05:03,943
- It was tasty.
- It was, right?

1466
01:05:04,443 --> 01:05:05,443
I liked it so much.

1467
01:05:05,444 --> 01:05:07,812
Really? There's more left. Cake and coffee.

1468
01:05:07,813 --> 01:05:08,842
Yes.

1469
01:05:08,843 --> 01:05:09,943
(We're eating again?)

1470
01:05:10,313 --> 01:05:14,213
(Otaru is full of things to see and play.)

1471
01:05:14,853 --> 01:05:17,853
(It's also called the paradise of taste.)

1472
01:05:18,753 --> 01:05:19,753
This tastes good.

1473
01:05:20,553 --> 01:05:21,593
This is delicious.

1474
01:05:22,493 --> 01:05:25,292
This place has a very famous thing.

1475
01:05:25,293 --> 01:05:26,363
Let's go there.

1476
01:05:26,733 --> 01:05:27,933
There aren't that many tables.

1477
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:29,862
Places like this...

1478
01:05:29,863 --> 01:05:32,349
(The best restaurants chosen by Dong Il will be revealed soon.)

1479
01:05:32,373 --> 01:05:34,102
- I saw it.
- This is nothing.

1480
01:05:34,103 --> 01:05:35,449
(I'm Sung Dong Il. Trust me and follow me.)

1481
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,272
(Dancing)

1482
01:05:37,273 --> 01:05:39,572
After eating the food,

1483
01:05:39,573 --> 01:05:41,783
Na Ra has become energetic.

1484
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:43,943
She's so energetic.

1485
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:47,952
- I can't hide my happiness.
- Exactly.

1486
01:05:47,953 --> 01:05:49,283
(Look forward to it.)

1487
01:05:49,723 --> 01:05:50,783
My gosh.

1488
01:05:51,423 --> 01:05:52,923
There are so many people.

1489
01:05:53,323 --> 01:05:56,293
Otaru is about one kilometer from here. That's it.

1490
01:05:56,623 --> 01:05:58,333
It's a very popular place.

1491
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:01,232
(He spots something in front of him.)

1492
01:06:01,233 --> 01:06:03,203
- What's that?
- What's what?

1493
01:06:04,633 --> 01:06:05,633
Isn't that a factory?

1494
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:07,402
That's a factory?

1495
01:06:07,403 --> 01:06:08,472
(Old-fashioned buildings can be seen in front of them.)

1496
01:06:08,473 --> 01:06:11,173
Don't they look like it? I think they're factories.

1497
01:06:12,543 --> 01:06:14,643
That's the photo spot.

1498
01:06:16,543 --> 01:06:18,113
Back in the days,

1499
01:06:18,853 --> 01:06:21,682
- they were warehouses.
- I see.

1500
01:06:21,683 --> 01:06:22,683
This is the waterway.

1501
01:06:22,684 --> 01:06:23,753
(Warehouses!)

1502
01:06:24,123 --> 01:06:25,193
This is the waterway.

1503
01:06:25,493 --> 01:06:28,163
They used ships to transport goods on the waterway.

1504
01:06:29,893 --> 01:06:31,333
Back in the days,

1505
01:06:31,993 --> 01:06:33,833
when they did shipping,

1506
01:06:34,093 --> 01:06:35,879
- They used this waterway?
- they used small boats...

1507
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,002
on the water.

1508
01:06:37,003 --> 01:06:39,502
It's not that deep either.

1509
01:06:39,503 --> 01:06:41,319
(A route that used to connect large cargo ships and the port)

1510
01:06:41,343 --> 01:06:43,502
(Canal and warehouses they built when Hokkaido was the economic hub)

1511
01:06:43,503 --> 01:06:45,342
(How the canal looked like before)

1512
01:06:45,343 --> 01:06:47,119
(Canal and warehouses they built when Hokkaido was the economic hub)

1513
01:06:47,143 --> 01:06:51,383
(They renovated the buildings that are no longer in use...)

1514
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:56,183
(and turned it into charming tourism resource!)

1515
01:06:59,823 --> 01:07:05,763
(At night, it is dyed in orange, which gives a nice vibe.)

1516
01:07:06,993 --> 01:07:13,173
(You can feel different charms for each season at Otaru Canal.)

1517
01:07:14,533 --> 01:07:18,072
Like Gunsan in Korea, they don't use this place anymore.

1518
01:07:18,073 --> 01:07:19,813
They were about to be gone. So...

1519
01:07:20,213 --> 01:07:23,513
they turned the old warehouses into tourist spots.

1520
01:07:24,213 --> 01:07:25,912
Like Seongsu-dong Cafe Street?

1521
01:07:25,913 --> 01:07:28,083
- That's right, something like that.
- I see.

1522
01:07:28,553 --> 01:07:31,922
Since it snows a lot here, they made this.

1523
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:34,793
- It has the Seongsu-dong vibes.
- Seongsu-dong.

1524
01:07:36,123 --> 01:07:37,193
And this place...

1525
01:07:37,493 --> 01:07:40,132
became a tourist spot that's famous worldwide.

1526
01:07:40,133 --> 01:07:42,632
- This is famous worldwide?
- Yes.

1527
01:07:42,633 --> 01:07:44,553
(The streets of Otaru are filled with tourists.)

1528
01:07:45,233 --> 01:07:46,272
Look at them by the waterway.

1529
01:07:46,273 --> 01:07:48,372
- There's nothing much.
- Gosh, all of them...

1530
01:07:48,373 --> 01:07:50,102
They're all there to see the small ferry that goes...

1531
01:07:50,103 --> 01:07:51,843
on the waterway.

1532
01:07:52,843 --> 01:07:53,872
Look at the people lined up.

1533
01:07:53,873 --> 01:07:55,442
(A photo spot)

1534
01:07:55,443 --> 01:07:57,182
- They're all there for the bridge?
- They stop at the bridge...

1535
01:07:57,183 --> 01:07:58,212
to look around and so on.

1536
01:07:58,213 --> 01:07:59,213
(It's known as the best photo spot in Otaru.)

1537
01:07:59,214 --> 01:08:00,353
There are so many people.

1538
01:08:07,193 --> 01:08:10,192
That's it. They're just here to take pictures...

1539
01:08:10,193 --> 01:08:11,692
- and look at the waterway.
- I see.

1540
01:08:11,693 --> 01:08:14,333
(They pass the photo spot for now.)

1541
01:08:15,433 --> 01:08:16,563
We're not going to see it?

1542
01:08:17,903 --> 01:08:23,373
(Due to the time limit, he moves on quickly.)

1543
01:08:23,773 --> 01:08:27,342
(Where does he lead the members to with his hurried steps?)

1544
01:08:27,343 --> 01:08:28,542
This alley is...

1545
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,712
(An alley?)

1546
01:08:29,713 --> 01:08:32,613
quite fun in its own way.

1547
01:08:33,613 --> 01:08:35,723
(I don't see an alley.)

1548
01:08:36,383 --> 01:08:40,052
(Where does he lead the members to with his hurried steps?)

1549
01:08:40,053 --> 01:08:41,392
This alley is...

1550
01:08:41,393 --> 01:08:42,393
(An alley?)

1551
01:08:42,394 --> 01:08:45,433
quite fun in its own way.

1552
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:48,532
(I don't see an alley.)

1553
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:50,802
For example, there's a cafe in the building,

1554
01:08:50,803 --> 01:08:51,923
but you must enter this way.

1555
01:08:52,073 --> 01:08:53,532
- The cafe...
- To here?

1556
01:08:53,533 --> 01:08:54,842
- Yes, the alley.
- Is it an alley?

1557
01:08:54,843 --> 01:08:55,873
Here.

1558
01:08:56,003 --> 01:08:57,843
- There aren't many tables.
- My gosh.

1559
01:08:58,513 --> 01:08:59,572
Places like this...

1560
01:08:59,573 --> 01:09:01,013
(There doesn't seem to be an alley.)

1561
01:09:01,243 --> 01:09:04,283
(When they follow Guide Sung, )

1562
01:09:04,543 --> 01:09:07,052
(he leads them to an alley...)

1563
01:09:07,053 --> 01:09:09,523
(that looks like only the select few would know!)

1564
01:09:09,753 --> 01:09:10,782
We're really going this way?

1565
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:13,093
(There's a cafe here?)

1566
01:09:13,553 --> 01:09:15,692
(She gets curious and rushes over.)

1567
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,092
(Surprised)

1568
01:09:17,093 --> 01:09:18,193
(What did she see?)

1569
01:09:18,693 --> 01:09:20,162
(When you go down...)

1570
01:09:20,163 --> 01:09:21,603
(the secret narrow alley, )

1571
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:23,502
Isn't this place cute?

1572
01:09:23,503 --> 01:09:25,933
(you run into a cute miniature-village-like world.)

1573
01:09:26,473 --> 01:09:27,473
What's this place?

1574
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:29,873
- This place is nice.
- How can it be so cute?

1575
01:09:31,073 --> 01:09:32,372
It's super cute.

1576
01:09:32,373 --> 01:09:35,743
(Na Ra and Myoung look around.)

1577
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:38,282
(There are cute things everywhere!)

1578
01:09:38,283 --> 01:09:39,483
So cute.

1579
01:09:40,483 --> 01:09:43,483
This is the place. They have good ice cream.

1580
01:09:44,153 --> 01:09:45,313
This place is nice, isn't it?

1581
01:09:45,653 --> 01:09:47,052
We can have it on a melon.

1582
01:09:47,053 --> 01:09:48,322
(Melon?)

1583
01:09:48,323 --> 01:09:50,062
- We can have it on a melon.
- Right.

1584
01:09:50,063 --> 01:09:52,183
- Is this where we're going?
- Yes, this is the cafe.

1585
01:09:52,293 --> 01:09:56,833
(The soft serve on melon looks like Santa's mustache.)

1586
01:09:57,063 --> 01:10:02,243
(Too cute not to post on social media!)

1587
01:10:02,603 --> 01:10:04,472
- That looks delicious.
- It's amazing.

1588
01:10:04,473 --> 01:10:05,812
- Let's go in.
- Let's go.

1589
01:10:05,813 --> 01:10:07,293
(They aren't just ordinary desserts.)

1590
01:10:08,173 --> 01:10:09,642
(The wooden rotating door full of retro vibes)

1591
01:10:09,643 --> 01:10:10,783
Are there seats available?

1592
01:10:13,253 --> 01:10:15,052
- This is good.
- The melon is...

1593
01:10:15,053 --> 01:10:16,382
(After securing seats, Na Ra takes the lead.)

1594
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:18,122
- There are...
- Different sizes.

1595
01:10:18,123 --> 01:10:19,592
- There are different sizes.
- Let's get the large one.

1596
01:10:19,593 --> 01:10:21,052
The large one? Just one large one then?

1597
01:10:21,053 --> 01:10:22,492
Get one large size.

1598
01:10:22,493 --> 01:10:24,262
- One?
- No, two.

1599
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:26,432
- What if we get one of this...
- The flavors are different.

1600
01:10:26,433 --> 01:10:29,163
- and one of this?
- That sounds good.

1601
01:10:29,363 --> 01:10:32,903
(We have to try the different kinds.)

1602
01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:35,572
(The melon soft serve is served.)

1603
01:10:35,573 --> 01:10:36,643
What's this?

1604
01:10:37,943 --> 01:10:39,013
Is it like shaved ice?

1605
01:10:39,413 --> 01:10:41,912
This is real melon.

1606
01:10:41,913 --> 01:10:45,413
(They look incredible with the yellow meat.)

1607
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:50,623
(The yellow melon is Hokkaido's regional delicacy!)

1608
01:10:50,823 --> 01:10:56,123
(You get to eat the two sweet things at once!)

1609
01:10:57,263 --> 01:11:01,132
(The melon soft serve place is Dong Il's top-tier tour pick.)

1610
01:11:01,133 --> 01:11:03,133
This is real melon.

1611
01:11:03,233 --> 01:11:05,903
I guess you eat the soft serve and then dig right into it.

1612
01:11:07,573 --> 01:11:09,373
- Like eating ice cream.
- Yes.

1613
01:11:09,743 --> 01:11:10,943
It looks so good.

1614
01:11:11,613 --> 01:11:12,613
(I need to take a photo.)

1615
01:11:12,614 --> 01:11:14,442
(Looking incredible)

1616
01:11:14,443 --> 01:11:15,713
It looks so good.

1617
01:11:17,613 --> 01:11:19,382
Na Ra, try it first. Lady first.

1618
01:11:19,383 --> 01:11:21,922
I'll have the first spoonful then.

1619
01:11:21,923 --> 01:11:22,923
Okay.

1620
01:11:22,983 --> 01:11:25,052
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

1621
01:11:25,053 --> 01:11:27,293
(She tries the soft serve first.)

1622
01:11:28,393 --> 01:11:30,322
- These two have different flavors.
- Right.

1623
01:11:30,323 --> 01:11:31,932
(There's melon-flavored soft serve on top of melon.)

1624
01:11:31,933 --> 01:11:33,032
Eat this too.

1625
01:11:33,033 --> 01:11:34,393
Is it because of the soft serve?

1626
01:11:34,493 --> 01:11:37,162
You can eat it with the melon.

1627
01:11:37,163 --> 01:11:39,072
The melon is really good.

1628
01:11:39,073 --> 01:11:40,303
- Right?
- Yes.

1629
01:11:40,503 --> 01:11:41,533
Let's dig it up first.

1630
01:11:41,643 --> 01:11:43,903
- This spoon is really nice.
- It is.

1631
01:11:44,573 --> 01:11:46,112
It digs nicely.

1632
01:11:46,113 --> 01:11:48,013
Doesn't it? This spoon is great.

1633
01:11:49,783 --> 01:11:52,082
- It's optimized for digging.
- It is.

1634
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:53,723
(It's designed for digging up the melon.)

1635
01:11:54,113 --> 01:11:55,123
(Humming in approval)

1636
01:11:55,153 --> 01:11:58,023
- It's nice, isn't it?
- It's nice. It's good.

1637
01:11:58,393 --> 01:11:59,393
(She turns the melon...)

1638
01:11:59,394 --> 01:12:01,023
(to get to the part with more meat.)

1639
01:12:01,663 --> 01:12:04,593
(Turning it to another side)

1640
01:12:04,993 --> 01:12:07,633
(Hee Won turns it too.)

1641
01:12:08,233 --> 01:12:10,833
(He might eat the skin too.)

1642
01:12:11,203 --> 01:12:12,272
(He finishes all the meat.)

1643
01:12:12,273 --> 01:12:14,403
(Exclaiming)

1644
01:12:14,703 --> 01:12:15,703
(It makes the guide happy.)

1645
01:12:15,704 --> 01:12:17,372
(Otaru, melon soft serve, Dong Il Tour, )

1646
01:12:17,373 --> 01:12:19,119
(When-did-I-eat-it-all, should've-taken-the-photo-earlier)

1647
01:12:19,143 --> 01:12:22,113
Shouldn't we skip dinner?

1648
01:12:23,143 --> 01:12:24,912
Let's just drink water for dinner.

1649
01:12:24,913 --> 01:12:27,982
We might actually roll back home.

1650
01:12:27,983 --> 01:12:28,983
Roll?

1651
01:12:29,853 --> 01:12:31,252
Rolling home wouldn't be the worst.

1652
01:12:31,253 --> 01:12:34,023
(Full to the max)

1653
01:12:34,523 --> 01:12:36,222
(Otaru expert's top-tier tour: 4. Melon soft serve)

1654
01:12:36,223 --> 01:12:37,822
(A must-visit spot that’s both tasty...)

1655
01:12:37,823 --> 01:12:39,462
(and Instagram-worthy.)

1656
01:12:39,463 --> 01:12:41,062
(Fullness gauge to the max)

1657
01:12:41,063 --> 01:12:42,602
Let's go to the main street.

1658
01:12:42,603 --> 01:12:44,033
- The main street?
- Yes.

1659
01:12:44,233 --> 01:12:46,503
We are going to start spending.

1660
01:12:46,773 --> 01:12:47,803
Let's go.

1661
01:12:49,603 --> 01:12:51,872
This is the main street, Na Ra.

1662
01:12:51,873 --> 01:12:53,242
(They enter the main street of Otaru!)

1663
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:57,913
This street has it all, from cute items to food.

1664
01:12:58,583 --> 01:12:59,703
This is where everything is.

1665
01:13:00,613 --> 01:13:02,122
It starts there.

1666
01:13:02,123 --> 01:13:05,522
(It's the start of the true dessert road.)

1667
01:13:05,523 --> 01:13:06,523
Here.

1668
01:13:07,853 --> 01:13:09,662
(They enter the street with amusement.)

1669
01:13:09,663 --> 01:13:12,932
Isn't it like being in a theme park?

1670
01:13:12,933 --> 01:13:14,892
Right. Like a spot in a theme park.

1671
01:13:14,893 --> 01:13:18,902
Right? Like a fake town inside a theme park.

1672
01:13:18,903 --> 01:13:19,932
Right.

1673
01:13:19,933 --> 01:13:21,249
(The street has the cute fairytale vibe of a theme park.)

1674
01:13:21,273 --> 01:13:24,572
There are lots of cute buildings.

1675
01:13:24,573 --> 01:13:25,573
I know.

1676
01:13:25,574 --> 01:13:27,719
(Pretty buildings and flashy sceneries are everywhere.)

1677
01:13:27,743 --> 01:13:29,713
I want to go there too.

1678
01:13:30,743 --> 01:13:32,783
- It'd be nice to come at night too.
- I know.

1679
01:13:33,553 --> 01:13:35,122
It would be really pretty...

1680
01:13:35,123 --> 01:13:36,452
- when the lights turn on.
- Right. At night.

1681
01:13:36,453 --> 01:13:38,493
(When the glass lamps softly light up the street, )

1682
01:13:39,153 --> 01:13:44,623
(taking a quiet stroll through the calm night feels romantic.)

1683
01:13:45,393 --> 01:13:48,362
When these light up at night, it would be beautiful.

1684
01:13:48,363 --> 01:13:49,363
I know.

1685
01:13:49,364 --> 01:13:51,339
(Hee Won and Myoung walk down the Otaru street amicably.)

1686
01:13:51,363 --> 01:13:53,972
(Where is the next destination of Otaru expert's top-tier tour?)

1687
01:13:53,973 --> 01:13:56,903
- Here. You know this place, right?
- I know this place.

1688
01:13:57,003 --> 01:13:58,003
This.

1689
01:13:58,473 --> 01:13:59,943
- This is it.
- Is this the place?

1690
01:14:00,043 --> 01:14:03,512
Yes. This is where people buy gifts.

1691
01:14:03,513 --> 01:14:04,883
(Gifts?)

1692
01:14:05,583 --> 01:14:08,153
You can only buy these here. Pick some.

1693
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,823
This looks good. What is it?

1694
01:14:12,353 --> 01:14:14,152
(Biscuit?)

1695
01:14:14,153 --> 01:14:15,793
We can only eat this here?

1696
01:14:16,663 --> 01:14:20,362
(It's where you can find all the local deserts in one place!)

1697
01:14:20,363 --> 01:14:22,403
(It's a must-visit place.)

1698
01:14:22,733 --> 01:14:26,503
(He already picked a bunch.)

1699
01:14:26,803 --> 01:14:28,773
Myoung. You already picked some.

1700
01:14:30,643 --> 01:14:31,643
(Taking a bite)

1701
01:14:31,644 --> 01:14:34,812
(She's taking a photo.)

1702
01:14:34,813 --> 01:14:36,083
Gosh, I was doing a squat.

1703
01:14:36,713 --> 01:14:38,213
Goodness, I did a squat.

1704
01:14:38,813 --> 01:14:39,882
I love it.

1705
01:14:39,883 --> 01:14:41,312
(Satisfied)

1706
01:14:41,313 --> 01:14:43,022
My husband likes photos like this.

1707
01:14:43,023 --> 01:14:44,159
(My husband likes photos like this.)

1708
01:14:44,183 --> 01:14:45,192
Send.

1709
01:14:45,193 --> 01:14:48,523
(She sends it to her husband.)

1710
01:14:48,763 --> 01:14:51,092
(Rustling)

1711
01:14:51,093 --> 01:14:52,193
- Na Ra.
- Yes?

1712
01:14:53,063 --> 01:14:54,792
This is a good one.

1713
01:14:54,793 --> 01:14:56,532
(What did he buy this time?)

1714
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:57,702
- Come, Hee Won.
- What is it?

1715
01:14:57,703 --> 01:14:59,072
(Curious)

1716
01:14:59,073 --> 01:15:00,802
This is my personal favorite.

1717
01:15:00,803 --> 01:15:02,042
(It's the dessert Dong Il strongly recommends.)

1718
01:15:02,043 --> 01:15:03,672
This is the best one from this place, in my opinion.

1719
01:15:03,673 --> 01:15:05,143
- It's like injeolmi.
- Right.

1720
01:15:06,173 --> 01:15:11,413
(It's rice cake that looks similar to injeolmi.)

1721
01:15:11,683 --> 01:15:13,253
Try it.

1722
01:15:13,683 --> 01:15:14,683
Here.

1723
01:15:14,684 --> 01:15:16,382
(Dong Il wants them to taste more things.)

1724
01:15:16,383 --> 01:15:17,722
Here, try it.

1725
01:15:17,723 --> 01:15:19,552
(The yellow soybean powder gives off delicious smell.)

1726
01:15:19,553 --> 01:15:22,523
This is my family's favorite.

1727
01:15:23,463 --> 01:15:25,233
- What is it?
- Try it.

1728
01:15:28,063 --> 01:15:29,102
It's really good, isn't it?

1729
01:15:29,103 --> 01:15:30,103
(It's Dong Il's favorite.)

1730
01:15:30,103 --> 01:15:31,103
(It's good!)

1731
01:15:31,533 --> 01:15:33,132
- It's just like injeolmi.
- Yes.

1732
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:34,332
(It's very similar to the Korean injeolmi.)

1733
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:35,872
(He tries one too.)

1734
01:15:35,873 --> 01:15:36,873
It's good.

1735
01:15:38,173 --> 01:15:40,443
What do you think? It's really good, isn't it?

1736
01:15:40,543 --> 01:15:42,413
- It's really good.
- It's really good.

1737
01:15:42,683 --> 01:15:44,683
Let's walk to digest all the food.

1738
01:15:44,783 --> 01:15:48,253
Let's go. On both sides, you will keep seeing food.

1739
01:15:49,483 --> 01:15:51,952
Another good street food is...

1740
01:15:51,953 --> 01:15:53,433
(Every other shop is a place to eat!)

1741
01:15:54,353 --> 01:15:55,422
This is good.

1742
01:15:55,423 --> 01:15:57,063
(He finds something.)

1743
01:15:57,493 --> 01:15:59,633
- It's like a dumpling.
- Dumpling?

1744
01:15:59,733 --> 01:16:00,893
This is really good.

1745
01:16:01,693 --> 01:16:03,032
Do we have to eat it?

1746
01:16:03,033 --> 01:16:04,832
No, let's just buy two and share them.

1747
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:05,833
Two?

1748
01:16:06,503 --> 01:16:09,573
(Round 1. Ramen with sides)

1749
01:16:10,273 --> 01:16:14,543
(Round 2. Ice cream)

1750
01:16:14,943 --> 01:16:18,483
(Round 3. Melon soft serve)

1751
01:16:18,913 --> 01:16:20,053
This is really good.

1752
01:16:21,153 --> 01:16:22,153
Let's buy two.

1753
01:16:22,154 --> 01:16:23,783
(Why is he recommending it so strongly?)

1754
01:16:24,123 --> 01:16:27,953
(I need them to taste it.)

1755
01:16:29,123 --> 01:16:32,262
I can't keep up with his energy.

1756
01:16:32,263 --> 01:16:33,939
(The guests are more tired than the guide.)

1757
01:16:33,963 --> 01:16:35,632
(The dumplings are out.)

1758
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:38,303
(He gets his share.)

1759
01:16:38,603 --> 01:16:39,932
(Standing far)

1760
01:16:39,933 --> 01:16:41,503
- Myoung.
- Yes.

1761
01:16:42,303 --> 01:16:44,543
You have to eat this before going back to Korea.

1762
01:16:45,203 --> 01:16:46,213
Try it.

1763
01:16:47,143 --> 01:16:48,572
This is really good.

1764
01:16:48,573 --> 01:16:50,459
(Didn't he say it was a dumpling? Why is the filling yellow?)

1765
01:16:50,483 --> 01:16:51,483
Try it.

1766
01:16:51,484 --> 01:16:53,752
(It's nice and warm.)

1767
01:16:53,753 --> 01:16:54,913
Before going back to Korea...

1768
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:57,223
Sweet potato?

1769
01:16:57,683 --> 01:16:58,752
There's red bean too.

1770
01:16:58,753 --> 01:17:00,823
(Red bean and sweet potato?)

1771
01:17:02,393 --> 01:17:03,393
It's really good, isn't it?

1772
01:17:03,394 --> 01:17:06,263
(Eyes wide open)

1773
01:17:06,363 --> 01:17:09,132
At a glance, I thought it was red bean and butter.

1774
01:17:09,133 --> 01:17:10,462
- It's not butter.
- It's much better...

1775
01:17:10,463 --> 01:17:11,502
- than butter.
- It's much better.

1776
01:17:11,503 --> 01:17:14,303
It's got sweet potato inside. It's really good.

1777
01:17:15,003 --> 01:17:19,142
(Even though they are full, they can still eat more?)

1778
01:17:19,143 --> 01:17:20,173
It's good, isn't it?

1779
01:17:21,073 --> 01:17:23,583
- It's good, isn't it?
- It's good.

1780
01:17:23,683 --> 01:17:26,163
- It's really good, isn't it?
- The sweet potato is delicious.

1781
01:17:26,683 --> 01:17:28,313
I tried everything, you know.

1782
01:17:28,983 --> 01:17:30,983
I picked it, you know.

1783
01:17:31,683 --> 01:17:32,723
Let's go.

1784
01:17:33,253 --> 01:17:36,223
(Current time: 2pm)

1785
01:17:36,623 --> 01:17:38,792
(Looking around)

1786
01:17:38,793 --> 01:17:40,633
Na Ra, they are selling fried chicken here.

1787
01:17:40,893 --> 01:17:42,733
- Fried chicken?
- Fried chicken.

1788
01:17:43,063 --> 01:17:44,333
(Not interested)

1789
01:17:44,563 --> 01:17:46,832
Skewers?

1790
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:48,303
Beef skewers.

1791
01:17:48,803 --> 01:17:50,172
(They can't eat anymore.)

1792
01:17:50,173 --> 01:17:53,343
You are not interested at all. This is good. Croquette.

1793
01:17:54,273 --> 01:17:55,583
- Dong Il.
- Here?

1794
01:17:55,843 --> 01:17:58,442
- Myoung is full.
- Myoung is full?

1795
01:17:58,443 --> 01:18:02,023
This place is...

1796
01:18:02,523 --> 01:18:04,783
another nice cafe.

1797
01:18:05,253 --> 01:18:06,552
(Where is it?)

1798
01:18:06,553 --> 01:18:08,722
- There.
- Isn't that a cheesecake shop?

1799
01:18:08,723 --> 01:18:09,763
It is.

1800
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:13,063
Their cheesecake is really popular.

1801
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:17,063
(LeTAO, the king of cheesecakes)

1802
01:18:19,003 --> 01:18:22,503
(There are 7 stores in Otaru downtown alone.)

1803
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,613
(They are the ones who turned Otaru into a dessert haven.)

1804
01:18:26,313 --> 01:18:30,583
(It's a must-visit dessert tour spot of Otaru.)

1805
01:18:31,313 --> 01:18:35,852
(It's like the Seongsimdang of Otaru.)

1806
01:18:35,853 --> 01:18:37,922
It's another great cafe.

1807
01:18:37,923 --> 01:18:38,952
(The dessert lover smiles again.)

1808
01:18:38,953 --> 01:18:41,423
It's called LeTAO. Do you want cheesecake or not?

1809
01:18:41,623 --> 01:18:43,622
I will go if you will go.

1810
01:18:43,623 --> 01:18:45,593
How about you?

1811
01:18:48,393 --> 01:18:49,462
What did he say?

1812
01:18:49,463 --> 01:18:50,802
(He's done digesting.)

1813
01:18:50,803 --> 01:18:52,972
Let's have a seat and have a cup of coffee.

1814
01:18:52,973 --> 01:18:54,033
Okay. Let's go in.

1815
01:18:54,603 --> 01:18:59,373
(Dong Il Tour members enter LeTAO cafe.)

1816
01:18:59,973 --> 01:19:04,843
(Among many desserts on display, )

1817
01:19:05,243 --> 01:19:07,912
This is the last feast we can give to you.

1818
01:19:07,913 --> 01:19:09,152
(they order the most popular ones.)

1819
01:19:09,153 --> 01:19:12,592
This is the most popular one here. Cheesecake.

1820
01:19:12,593 --> 01:19:13,629
(LeTAO's signature dessert is cheesecake.)

1821
01:19:13,653 --> 01:19:15,692
(Smacking his lips)

1822
01:19:15,693 --> 01:19:19,032
(How does Otaru's best cheesecake taste?)

1823
01:19:19,033 --> 01:19:20,163
Is it good?

1824
01:19:21,633 --> 01:19:22,803
It's good.

1825
01:19:23,263 --> 01:19:24,802
- Aren't you full?
- I'm full.

1826
01:19:24,803 --> 01:19:26,573
(He's full.)

1827
01:19:27,573 --> 01:19:28,702
(We are stuffed, but we still can eat it.)

1828
01:19:28,703 --> 01:19:30,902
It's really good. Their cheesecake is very popular.

1829
01:19:30,903 --> 01:19:32,143
(The mystery of the human body)

1830
01:19:32,743 --> 01:19:35,273
(Happy)

1831
01:19:35,643 --> 01:19:37,242
(That moment comes.)

1832
01:19:37,243 --> 01:19:39,253
Myoung's leaving.

1833
01:19:39,853 --> 01:19:41,482
(Myoung will be leaving in 30 minutes.)

1834
01:19:41,483 --> 01:19:42,722
How was it?

1835
01:19:42,723 --> 01:19:44,853
If I were to spend two nights here,

1836
01:19:45,923 --> 01:19:48,893
I should've adjusted my schedule.

1837
01:19:49,363 --> 01:19:50,892
(Dong Il had prepared a full tour for them.)

1838
01:19:50,893 --> 01:19:52,492
(It filled both their time and stomachs.)

1839
01:19:52,493 --> 01:19:54,732
You could just get on the tomorrow morning's flight.

1840
01:19:54,733 --> 01:19:55,932
What difference would that make?

1841
01:19:55,933 --> 01:19:59,173
But I have to get to the hair salon by 9am tomorrow.

1842
01:20:00,233 --> 01:20:03,843
(Overexplaining)

1843
01:20:05,373 --> 01:20:07,612
Because we keep begging him to stay longer,

1844
01:20:07,613 --> 01:20:09,082
he must think we don't want him to go.

1845
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:10,182
- Just go.
- He's right.

1846
01:20:10,183 --> 01:20:11,282
(They are hurt.)

1847
01:20:11,283 --> 01:20:12,982
Stay longer, even just for an hour.

1848
01:20:12,983 --> 01:20:14,083
(They are cute.)

1849
01:20:14,353 --> 01:20:18,152
Send him away to Uganda.

1850
01:20:18,153 --> 01:20:19,253
Uganda?

1851
01:20:19,823 --> 01:20:21,193
Uganda!

1852
01:20:21,453 --> 01:20:24,263
(Goodness.)

1853
01:20:24,523 --> 01:20:25,992
(He's not bothered at all.)

1854
01:20:25,993 --> 01:20:27,393
Uganda!

1855
01:20:27,993 --> 01:20:30,003
We should do this then.

1856
01:20:30,663 --> 01:20:32,433
We will go look at the steam clock.

1857
01:20:33,433 --> 01:20:35,432
You will go look at the steam clock?

1858
01:20:35,433 --> 01:20:37,642
It's a hundred years old.

1859
01:20:37,643 --> 01:20:40,172
But it's still run by steam engine.

1860
01:20:40,173 --> 01:20:41,612
(He wants Myoung to see it before leaving.)

1861
01:20:41,613 --> 01:20:43,213
Every hour,

1862
01:20:43,643 --> 01:20:45,983
the clock makes that steam engine sound.

1863
01:20:47,013 --> 01:20:48,552
- At every hour.
- Like this?

1864
01:20:48,553 --> 01:20:50,052
(They plan to send Myoung...)

1865
01:20:50,053 --> 01:20:51,822
Let's go look at the steam clock.

1866
01:20:51,823 --> 01:20:54,923
(to the sound of the clock chime.)

1867
01:20:55,663 --> 01:20:57,362
Is that the clock we've come to see?

1868
01:20:57,363 --> 01:20:58,722
- Where is it?
- That clock.

1869
01:20:58,723 --> 01:20:59,862
It's steam engine powered.

1870
01:20:59,863 --> 01:21:01,632
(Where is it?)

1871
01:21:01,633 --> 01:21:03,903
Do you see the tree chimneys?

1872
01:21:04,203 --> 01:21:06,433
Steam goes out through them...

1873
01:21:06,633 --> 01:21:08,303
and makes the sound.

1874
01:21:09,343 --> 01:21:11,442
It chimes at 45 minutes? We still have 5 minutes then.

1875
01:21:11,443 --> 01:21:12,642
(The steam clock will chime in 5 minutes.)

1876
01:21:12,643 --> 01:21:16,113
When the clock chimes, I will get in the car then?

1877
01:21:17,013 --> 01:21:18,812
When it chimes, I will be like, "Goodbye, everyone."

1878
01:21:18,813 --> 01:21:20,782
(When it chimes, he will leave.)

1879
01:21:20,783 --> 01:21:22,582
Like this?

1880
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:23,959
(It's the simplest way to go home.)

1881
01:21:23,983 --> 01:21:25,353
He's Gong-derella.

1882
01:21:26,153 --> 01:21:27,923
- He's Gong-derella.
- Right.

1883
01:21:28,393 --> 01:21:29,992
When the clock chimes...

1884
01:21:29,993 --> 01:21:31,499
(Gong-derella seems very sad to be going home.)

1885
01:21:31,523 --> 01:21:36,703
(You are sending me away in the end)

1886
01:21:37,203 --> 01:21:40,033
(Hee Won was listening to Gong-derella's song.)

1887
01:21:40,573 --> 01:21:42,343
- Myoung.
- Yes?

1888
01:21:43,173 --> 01:21:45,172
I have something to say to you too.

1889
01:21:45,173 --> 01:21:46,313
(Taking off his glasses)

1890
01:21:46,513 --> 01:21:48,153
Wait. Let me put in some eye drops first.

1891
01:21:48,773 --> 01:21:52,412
(Cracking up)

1892
01:21:52,413 --> 01:21:53,452
Hurry.

1893
01:21:53,453 --> 01:21:54,552
(His eyes are too dry.)

1894
01:21:54,553 --> 01:21:55,852
- Hurry.
- He's doing it now.

1895
01:21:55,853 --> 01:21:57,882
Nice.

1896
01:21:57,883 --> 01:21:59,822
Bye, Myoung. Go.

1897
01:21:59,823 --> 01:22:01,653
(Bye, Myoung)

1898
01:22:03,963 --> 01:22:07,793
(While crying and laughing, )

1899
01:22:08,233 --> 01:22:10,802
(it becomes 2:45pm.)

1900
01:22:10,803 --> 01:22:11,963
It's not chiming.

1901
01:22:13,903 --> 01:22:15,332
(It's past 2:45pm now.)

1902
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:17,043
- It's strange.
- It chimes at 3pm sharp.

1903
01:22:17,803 --> 01:22:18,803
(Hissing)

1904
01:22:20,043 --> 01:22:21,073
(Surprised)

1905
01:22:21,713 --> 01:22:23,783
(Hissing)

1906
01:22:24,413 --> 01:22:25,983
(Making a melody)

1907
01:22:26,653 --> 01:22:27,683
Really?

1908
01:22:28,483 --> 01:22:29,582
There it goes.

1909
01:22:29,583 --> 01:22:33,723
(The melody reminds them of their school days.)

1910
01:22:34,993 --> 01:22:38,193
(The end.)

1911
01:22:38,393 --> 01:22:39,533
Is that it?

1912
01:22:39,593 --> 01:22:43,732
(Na Ra was singing along.)

1913
01:22:43,733 --> 01:22:44,733
That's it?

1914
01:22:44,734 --> 01:22:46,803
(Flustered)

1915
01:22:47,103 --> 01:22:48,233
That's it?

1916
01:22:48,733 --> 01:22:50,042
- Go.
- That's it?

1917
01:22:50,043 --> 01:22:51,102
(Go.)

1918
01:22:51,103 --> 01:22:52,312
It's red light.

1919
01:22:52,313 --> 01:22:53,512
(Yes, that's it.)

1920
01:22:53,513 --> 01:22:55,643
- That's it.
- That's it?

1921
01:22:55,843 --> 01:22:56,913
Yes.

1922
01:22:57,513 --> 01:22:58,682
Unbelievable.

1923
01:22:58,683 --> 01:23:00,382
(Unbelievable?)

1924
01:23:00,383 --> 01:23:02,652
It's the school bell song.

1925
01:23:02,653 --> 01:23:04,023
It's shorter than that.

1926
01:23:06,453 --> 01:23:07,523
It changed.

1927
01:23:08,193 --> 01:23:09,963
- Bye.
- Is the car here?

1928
01:23:11,463 --> 01:23:13,762
You looked too happy when you said, "Bye!"

1929
01:23:13,763 --> 01:23:16,002
- You are leaving, so...
- The car should come first.

1930
01:23:16,003 --> 01:23:17,432
- Where is the car?
- He has to wait for the car.

1931
01:23:17,433 --> 01:23:18,932
She's mean.

1932
01:23:18,933 --> 01:23:20,132
(He was supposed to leave like Gong-derella.)

1933
01:23:20,133 --> 01:23:21,333
Na Ra is mean.

1934
01:23:21,773 --> 01:23:23,743
- It's a misunderstanding.
- She abandoned him.

1935
01:23:24,603 --> 01:23:26,612
I can cross the street now.

1936
01:23:26,613 --> 01:23:28,572
(It's time for him to leave.)

1937
01:23:28,573 --> 01:23:30,683
- You should go.
- We should see you go.

1938
01:23:30,913 --> 01:23:32,353
You are the youngest.

1939
01:23:32,613 --> 01:23:33,853
- Bye, Myoung.
- We...

1940
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:38,882
Good job coming all the way.

1941
01:23:38,883 --> 01:23:40,022
Seriously.

1942
01:23:40,023 --> 01:23:41,493
Good luck going home.

1943
01:23:41,723 --> 01:23:44,192
- Stay good until the end.
- Goodness.

1944
01:23:44,193 --> 01:23:45,892
(Myoung is a dear guest and family...)

1945
01:23:45,893 --> 01:23:48,093
(who came all the way across the sea.)

1946
01:23:49,563 --> 01:23:51,133
- Bye.
- I will give you a hug.

1947
01:23:51,903 --> 01:23:53,133
- Go, team!
- Go, team!

1948
01:23:54,133 --> 01:23:55,453
- Thank you, Myoung.
- Thank you.

1949
01:23:55,573 --> 01:23:56,902
- Call us.
- I will.

1950
01:23:56,903 --> 01:23:59,042
(They promise to meet again in Korea.)

1951
01:23:59,043 --> 01:24:01,143
He's gone.

1952
01:24:02,013 --> 01:24:03,243
That's life.

1953
01:24:05,443 --> 01:24:06,963
It feels empty now that Myoung's gone.

1954
01:24:07,953 --> 01:24:11,282
It's because you adored him a lot.

1955
01:24:11,283 --> 01:24:12,793
I had prepared more chores for him.

1956
01:24:12,953 --> 01:24:14,792
(He's funny.)

1957
01:24:14,793 --> 01:24:17,622
He's a nice person and a really cute person too.

1958
01:24:17,623 --> 01:24:19,233
He is super nice.

1959
01:24:19,293 --> 01:24:20,932
You don’t notice when one's around,

1960
01:24:20,933 --> 01:24:22,262
but you feel it when one's gone.

1961
01:24:22,263 --> 01:24:23,633
Now that Myoung is gone,

1962
01:24:23,833 --> 01:24:25,633
it's just the three of us.

1963
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:28,533
(They sent Myoung off well, but they feel empty.)

1964
01:24:28,803 --> 01:24:30,203
Habit is a scary thing.

1965
01:24:30,503 --> 01:24:32,043
This is another nice place.

1966
01:24:33,143 --> 01:24:35,412
Look here. This is it.

1967
01:24:35,413 --> 01:24:37,253
(Guide Sung takes the family feeling blues...)

1968
01:24:37,783 --> 01:24:39,652
(to the alley like Pimatgol, )

1969
01:24:39,653 --> 01:24:41,912
(where small bars and eateries are.)

1970
01:24:41,913 --> 01:24:44,383
- It's like the street bars we have.
- Right.

1971
01:24:44,953 --> 01:24:47,653
- It's like that.
- There are lots of shops.

1972
01:24:47,953 --> 01:24:50,263
We can take food and eat at the square.

1973
01:24:50,563 --> 01:24:51,662
It's not so much of a square.

1974
01:24:51,663 --> 01:24:54,232
- We sit there.
- We sit and eat there.

1975
01:24:54,233 --> 01:24:55,863
We can buy food from them?

1976
01:24:56,263 --> 01:24:57,702
We should sit here.

1977
01:24:57,703 --> 01:24:58,902
(They sit on the terrace.)

1978
01:24:58,903 --> 01:25:01,672
They are cooking meat on a frying pan. That looks good.

1979
01:25:01,673 --> 01:25:02,803
Look at it.

1980
01:25:03,443 --> 01:25:05,043
This one.

1981
01:25:05,573 --> 01:25:06,772
For three people.

1982
01:25:06,773 --> 01:25:08,013
- Three people?
- Three people.

1983
01:25:08,373 --> 01:25:13,053
(The meat dish that will fill their empty hearts is...)

1984
01:25:13,713 --> 01:25:18,453
(Jingisukan, Hokkaido-style grilled lamb)

1985
01:25:20,823 --> 01:25:22,022
(Let's put more.)

1986
01:25:22,023 --> 01:25:23,993
- You have to put them on the edges.
- Okay.

1987
01:25:24,693 --> 01:25:27,032
(Filling the grill as much as they miss Myoung)

1988
01:25:27,033 --> 01:25:28,933
(Then put some more!)

1989
01:25:29,303 --> 01:25:31,162
My hands are clean.

1990
01:25:31,163 --> 01:25:32,803
(Adding a handful of bean sprouts)

1991
01:25:33,403 --> 01:25:35,072
(Grilling bean sprouts instead of his longing heart)

1992
01:25:35,073 --> 01:25:37,473
(Do you mean it?)

1993
01:25:38,573 --> 01:25:45,243
(When you shed beef fat instead of tears, )

1994
01:25:46,283 --> 01:25:50,553
(you get a perfectly grilled plate of Jingisukan.)

1995
01:25:51,423 --> 01:25:53,652
(When you put a piece of lamb in your mouth, )

1996
01:25:53,653 --> 01:25:55,623
- This is nice, Na Ra. Try it.
- Okay.

1997
01:25:55,863 --> 01:25:56,892
Goodness.

1998
01:25:56,893 --> 01:25:58,723
(Humming in approval)

1999
01:26:02,363 --> 01:26:04,963
(Loving it)

2000
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:07,833
- The sauce is special.
- Yes.

2001
01:26:08,173 --> 01:26:09,772
- When you dip it in the sauce...
- The meat...

2002
01:26:09,773 --> 01:26:11,203
- is quite fresh.
- Is it?

2003
01:26:12,813 --> 01:26:18,013
(Guide Sung enjoys a pint after leading the tourists all day.)

2004
01:26:20,353 --> 01:26:22,282
(Myoung!)

2005
01:26:22,283 --> 01:26:23,582
- Really?
- It's really good.

2006
01:26:23,583 --> 01:26:24,683
Is it good?

2007
01:26:25,523 --> 01:26:27,892
It's sizzling. Dig in. It's not something too expensive.

2008
01:26:27,893 --> 01:26:29,362
(It's a perfect spot for a cozy family dinner.)

2009
01:26:29,363 --> 01:26:30,662
I love this vibe.

2010
01:26:30,663 --> 01:26:32,323
(Five stars)

2011
01:26:33,863 --> 01:26:37,303
(The last spot of Dong Il tour is...)

2012
01:26:38,863 --> 01:26:41,772
I think I like night lights.

2013
01:26:41,773 --> 01:26:43,072
(Otaru Canal is even more beautiful on summer nights.)

2014
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:45,773
It keeps moving like a living thing.

2015
01:26:47,443 --> 01:26:50,143
(There's something you have to do in front of a beautiful scenery.)

2016
01:26:50,443 --> 01:26:52,283
Dong Il,

2017
01:26:52,813 --> 01:26:54,582
- should we take a photo too?
- Let's take a photo.

2018
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:57,453
(It's to record family memories.)

2019
01:26:59,753 --> 01:27:05,723
(Who will be tomorrow's guest?)

2020
01:27:06,593 --> 01:27:08,993
(At the break of dawn, )

2021
01:27:09,803 --> 01:27:13,433
(the family heads somewhere.)

2022
01:27:14,203 --> 01:27:18,103
(From 6 to 6:08am. It goes on for just 8 minutes.)

2023
01:27:18,673 --> 01:27:20,972
(I hope we will buy something good today.)

2024
01:27:20,973 --> 01:27:24,542
(The ultimate Japanese seafood)

2025
01:27:24,543 --> 01:27:26,183
(It's me, mackerel!)

2026
01:27:26,313 --> 01:27:28,313
(Hokkaido fresh mackerel)

2027
01:27:28,613 --> 01:27:30,723
(The mighty tuna that wakes up the morning)

2028
01:27:30,953 --> 01:27:32,183
(My goodness!)

2029
01:27:32,483 --> 01:27:35,552
(Hokkaido special performance)

2030
01:27:35,553 --> 01:27:36,822
(Immersed to the max)

2031
01:27:36,823 --> 01:27:38,499
(I've never seen such a tuna cutting show.)

2032
01:27:38,523 --> 01:27:39,962
(I found my tuna.)

2033
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:40,963
(That's it!)

2034
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:42,263
(I found my tuna.)

2035
01:27:42,933 --> 01:27:46,403
(Who are the lucky ones who will be eating the tuna?)

2036
01:27:47,103 --> 01:27:50,573
(Na Ra's first guests will come.)

2037
01:27:50,903 --> 01:27:52,773
(For Na Ra's first guests, )

2038
01:27:53,313 --> 01:27:56,643
(Hee Won becomes the new sushi king.)

2039
01:27:56,743 --> 01:27:58,712
(Chef Sung, the head chef...)

2040
01:27:58,713 --> 01:28:04,322
(creates a full course meal with the best quality tuna.)

2041
01:28:04,323 --> 01:28:06,192
We have to eat everything we can eat in Hokkaido.

2042
01:28:06,193 --> 01:28:08,933
(We welcome you to the world of fresh gourmet delights.)
