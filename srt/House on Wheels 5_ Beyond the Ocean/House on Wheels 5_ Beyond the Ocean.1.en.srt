1
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,851
(Sung Dong Il)

2
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:22,234
(Kim Hee Won, Jang Na Ra)

3
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:28,139
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

4
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:41,053
(A sunny summer day)

5
00:00:42,553 --> 00:00:43,623
Oh, my.

6
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:50,333
(We have a new owner.)

7
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,403
Oh, my.

8
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:53,903
This is so pretty.

9
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:56,273
Oh, this door can be fully locked.

10
00:00:57,773 --> 00:00:58,773
That's so cool.

11
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:02,073
Oh, gosh.

12
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:03,973
(This energetic new owner of our House and Wheels...)

13
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:06,713
(is Jang Na Ra.)

14
00:01:07,483 --> 00:01:10,913
(Our first meeting with her)

15
00:01:13,753 --> 00:01:14,753
Oh, yes. Hello.

16
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:15,753
Oh, it touched...

17
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:16,923
(A mic issue)

18
00:01:17,223 --> 00:01:20,093
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, hello.

19
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:21,163
Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:22,233
(Bowing)

21
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:25,363
(How does it feel to be a new owner of House on Wheels?)

22
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:26,863
- So, I...
- Yes.

23
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:32,003
When I think about this, it feels like I'm losing blood...

24
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:33,073
- Really?
- Yes.

25
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:34,403
Why?

26
00:01:35,343 --> 00:01:36,643
I haven't done this before.

27
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:40,183
This is kind of camping.

28
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,413
It's also a TV show.

29
00:01:41,983 --> 00:01:43,013
But...

30
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,983
We're also living together for over ten days.

31
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:48,793
That makes me so confused.

32
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:51,523
So when I think about it,

33
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:53,323
I feel drained.

34
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:55,293
When I get back to my senses,

35
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:58,303
I think it would be fun.

36
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:01,433
Then, when I space out, I feel drained again.

37
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:02,773
That keeps repeating.

38
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:03,803
(Her feelings on this show changes dozens of times a day.)

39
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:05,803
My husband also said that it would suit me.

40
00:02:05,803 --> 00:02:08,043
(My husband also said that it would suit me.)

41
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:10,773
He said, "You made it."

42
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:14,683
I called him as soon as I got the news,

43
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:16,483
and he came back home in the evening...

44
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:17,653
- with a huge, toothy smile.
- Really?

45
00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:20,253
He said he was so proud.

46
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:23,723
A show like this, for me...

47
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:25,123
I don't know about others...

48
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:27,723
For me, this is almost like "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."

49
00:02:28,893 --> 00:02:29,963
It's very...

50
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:32,133
(Like that, Tom Sawyer Na Ra...)

51
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:36,673
(went to meet the group who she'll go on an adventure with.)

52
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:40,973
(Na Ra brought lots of stuff.)

53
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:43,713
(As soon as she arrives, she takes out her phone...)

54
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:48,453
(and takes a selfie to send to her husband.)

55
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:51,623
(Sending photo)

56
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:54,423
- Is it this place?
- Where?

57
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:57,923
It said 300m.

58
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:00,723
Is it this place?

59
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,033
This is the right place.

60
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:04,563
Hello.

61
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:05,863
(House on Wheels Brothers, Sung Dong Il and Kim Hee Won)

62
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:08,003
(Getting up)

63
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:09,103
(Bowing)

64
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:11,843
(Bowing again)

65
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:12,973
Hello.

66
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:14,073
- We haven't met before, right?
- Hello.

67
00:03:14,073 --> 00:03:15,073
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

68
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:16,073
(After energetically greeting them)

69
00:03:16,073 --> 00:03:17,813
Being active in the morning...

70
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:19,443
What's wrong?

71
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:21,083
- My foot got caught.
- I see.

72
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:22,983
- You got here first.
- Yes.

73
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:25,153
I got here early too, but I was waiting for him.

74
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:26,223
(Their first meeting is making her sweat...)

75
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:28,653
- You... You got married, right?
- I did.

76
00:03:29,553 --> 00:03:30,753
Is your husband in this industry?

77
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:32,423
- A camera director.
- A camera director?

78
00:03:32,423 --> 00:03:33,863
- Yes.
- A camera director?

79
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:35,433
- Yes.
- He's a camera director.

80
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:36,463
- Really?
- Yes.

81
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,003
- He's still doing it?
- Yes.

82
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:39,203
(Na Ra married a camera director who was working on her drama.)

83
00:03:39,663 --> 00:03:41,673
You fell for the camera director.

84
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:43,473
(Thinking about her husband makes her laugh.)

85
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,503
(Laughing)

86
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:49,113
- This tteokbokki restaurant...
- I actually...

87
00:03:49,113 --> 00:03:51,383
went to this school right out front here.

88
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:52,943
- I see.
- This neighbourhood?

89
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:54,243
(She's been coming to this place since she was in high school.)

90
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:57,183
So you've been eating here since you were young.

91
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:58,383
- Yes, I...
- Since high school?

92
00:03:58,383 --> 00:03:59,583
This is your hometown.

93
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,583
Yes.

94
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:02,223
(She asked them to meet here, )

95
00:04:02,223 --> 00:04:03,853
(a place that's like a hometown to her.)

96
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:06,693
I actually can't see without my glasses.

97
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:08,033
- Hello.
- Hello.

98
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:10,993
The jjajang gochujang mixed one. That's this place's...

99
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:12,603
- Is it spicy?
- signature dish.

100
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:15,103
- It's spicy.
- And it has a jjajang flavour.

101
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:16,173
Really? Nice.

102
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,043
Since it's...

103
00:04:18,543 --> 00:04:21,273
my first time meeting you, I brought presents...

104
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,613
- Presents?
- But it's our first time too.

105
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:25,643
- What does that make us?
- We didn't bring presents...

106
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:28,983
I brought things I use and eat.

107
00:04:28,983 --> 00:04:29,983
Did you do this yourself?

108
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:31,013
- Is it the same?
- You can just pick.

109
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:32,083
Sounds good.

110
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:33,653
- What is this?
- So those are...

111
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:35,653
- supplements I take.
- Supplements.

112
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:37,653
(Na Ra brought supplements for them.)

113
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:39,993
I've been taking those very diligently lately.

114
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:42,233
I need to take my medicine.

115
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:43,493
(She has a pouch just for her medicine.)

116
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:45,763
I really like supplements.

117
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:49,203
(Filling her mouth with pills)

118
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:51,543
- They're antioxidants...
- Antioxidants?

119
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:53,773
They're good for anti-ageing.

120
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:56,473
I'm taking them diligently.

121
00:04:57,643 --> 00:05:00,813
- No. Please hear me out.
- I mean, I...

122
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:02,983
I have three kids,

123
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:04,823
so I can take anti-ageing supplements.

124
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:07,953
This here is a gua sha.

125
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:09,053
- What?
- Gua sha.

126
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:10,853
- What's gua sha?
- Gua sha.

127
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,223
You use it for massages.

128
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:15,293
When you heat up, you can brush your head with this.

129
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:17,593
I made this at home.

130
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:20,603
- The presents... Oh, my.
- What is it?

131
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:21,633
Cookies.

132
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:24,103
(The last present, Na Ra's homemade cookies)

133
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:26,643
I made them with rice flour, so they should be...

134
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:28,713
This is so delicious.

135
00:05:29,673 --> 00:05:31,643
- It's so delicious.
- Doesn't it taste healthy?

136
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:34,513
- I love desserts the most.
- Desserts?

137
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:35,683
Also...

138
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,253
Actually, the producer...

139
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:41,993
wrote me a letter when they first asked me to join the show.

140
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:44,423
One line really jumped out at me.

141
00:05:44,423 --> 00:05:46,963
"Fresh ice cream made with milk."

142
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:51,703
I really wanted to eat that ice cream.

143
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,933
She's very simple when it comes to making decisions.

144
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,473
(New member Na Ra's special trait 3: She's simple.)

145
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:57,773
- So, the thing is...
- And she's gullible too.

146
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,973
- No!
- She's gullible.

147
00:06:02,973 --> 00:06:03,973
(Did you believe that?)

148
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:07,783
(You weren't fooled.)

149
00:06:08,213 --> 00:06:10,083
(She'll eat insane ice cream...)

150
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:11,883
(Oh, my!)

151
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:15,793
(She'll also eat other eye-opening desserts.)

152
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:21,023
(This is one of the reasons she decided to join this trip.)

153
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:22,593
(But the ice cream surely wasn't the only reason...)

154
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:23,833
I'm curious.

155
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,833
(But the ice cream surely wasn't the only reason...)

156
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,003
It was always male actors.

157
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:28,033
(All House on Wheels members have been men until now.)

158
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,503
How did you ultimately decide...

159
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:30,573
(Dong Il was curious how Na Ra decided to join the show.)

160
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:31,943
to join the show?

161
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:34,843
(Let me tell you how I got here...)

162
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:37,573
My whole life,

163
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:39,483
except for when I'm working,

164
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,553
I always go eat at the same places...

165
00:06:41,553 --> 00:06:44,353
Always the same places. She's just like us.

166
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:46,123
- I get you.
- I like that so much.

167
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:48,853
Doing the same things, going to the same places,

168
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:50,493
and eating the same things.

169
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:54,793
I got to this age,

170
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:57,263
and I wanted to try breaking out of that.

171
00:06:57,263 --> 00:06:58,363
(She suddenly thought she wanted to break out of her shell.)

172
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,003
It's only not going to Na Ra.

173
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:03,373
- Did it take it?
- It's very interesting.

174
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:05,403
I've never been to a place like this.

175
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:07,873
(Totally new experiences)

176
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:10,473
I saw so many things I wouldn't have gotten to see...

177
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:13,913
- if I didn't decide to do this.
- This spot is warm. It's so warm.

178
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:16,253
- I've never heard of this.
- Try it.

179
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:20,083
(She works up the courage to eat new things.)

180
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,253
This is unbelievable.

181
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:22,523
Thank you for everything.

182
00:07:22,523 --> 00:07:25,323
- It was so nice to see you.
- Let's meet again.

183
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:31,733
(House on Wheels' first female owner brought on some changes.)

184
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:37,173
(The new House on Wheels will change along with its new owner.)

185
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:38,373
I want to go home.

186
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:40,803
(How will The Adventure of Tom Sawyer Na Ra go?)

187
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:44,573
- Right. Did you get your license?
- I did.

188
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:47,843
- You really got a trailer license?
- I did.

189
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,583
- You really got it?
- Yes.

190
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,613
That's so impressive.

191
00:07:51,313 --> 00:07:54,353
I have to use my whole body to turn the steering wheel.

192
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:56,523
I'm short,

193
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:58,053
so my feet can't even reach.

194
00:07:58,053 --> 00:07:59,063
(Laughing)

195
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:00,163
I'm sorry for laughing.

196
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:02,263
I'll show you the video later.

197
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:04,863
I had the camera running.

198
00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:07,303
(Na Ra recorded herself practising.)

199
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:11,073
(Tap, tap, tap)

200
00:08:11,473 --> 00:08:13,973
(After turning the steering wheel to the right like a hamster wheel, )

201
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:18,383
(she turns her whole body to go left.)

202
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,883
(Sighing, Exhausted)

203
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:26,683
On the second day, my husband said to me,

204
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:29,123
"It'd be so cool for a woman..."

205
00:08:29,123 --> 00:08:31,053
- "to get that license." - Totally.

206
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,893
That made me crazy.

207
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:34,823
Because he said, "It'd be so cool,"

208
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:37,563
- I really wanted to get it.
- I get it.

209
00:08:37,563 --> 00:08:40,303
But the next day, I failed the test.

210
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:41,633
I had to practice for another two hours.

211
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:45,073
I got so angry,

212
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:48,073
so I went home, ate malatang, decided I must pass the next time,

213
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:49,243
and I passed.

214
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:51,983
She does anything if you make her angry.

215
00:08:53,143 --> 00:08:55,653
We should keep provoking her.

216
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:56,983
She gets angry easily.

217
00:08:57,553 --> 00:09:00,353
- Especially when she's working.
- No.

218
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:02,393
This is going to be fun.

219
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:04,823
This will be a whole new world for you.

220
00:09:05,923 --> 00:09:09,133
(House on Wheels)

221
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:12,563
Since we've already done four seasons,

222
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:15,303
I think we've seen enough of Korea.

223
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:17,333
You've travelled in all four seasons.

224
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,973
- Sea and mountain too.
- All four seasons...

225
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:21,573
and all regions of the country.

226
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:24,573
(There are still many places to go.)

227
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:26,113
This is so pretty.

228
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:29,313
(But we suddenly became curious about our neighbours.)

229
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:31,213
- This place is so pretty.
- Right?

230
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:32,753
(But we suddenly became curious about our neighbours.)

231
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:36,893
(We'll take our house overseas.)

232
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:38,293
I've never been...

233
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:39,593
- to a place like this before.
- Same.

234
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:42,963
(How did we pick the country?)

235
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:44,393
If we're able to...

236
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:47,833
Since we need to take the house, we need to be practical.

237
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,533
Somewhere close.

238
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:51,603
Somewhere similar to Korea.

239
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:54,443
Lately, the Japanese yen is cheap.

240
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:56,473
- Right.
- It's cheaper than Korea.

241
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:57,543
- It is.
- Yes.

242
00:09:57,643 --> 00:10:01,313
Japan has big traditional markets similar to ones we have.

243
00:10:01,313 --> 00:10:04,453
They don't really have many five-day markets like us.

244
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:06,523
Yes, it's different from Korea.

245
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,583
(Our neighbouring country we're curious about)

246
00:10:07,883 --> 00:10:08,893
I think...

247
00:10:09,823 --> 00:10:11,553
Japan would be nice because it's close.

248
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:12,663
(For this trip, we'll go to Hokkaido, Japan!)

249
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:13,693
What do you think?

250
00:10:16,393 --> 00:10:19,463
(House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean, Hokkaido)

251
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:23,633
When I see people going to Japan on TV,

252
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:26,903
I've mostly seen them going to big tourist cities.

253
00:10:26,903 --> 00:10:28,843
(We usually see trips to big cities, centered around tourist sites.)

254
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:32,383
(But what if the members took the House on Wheels to Japan?)

255
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:34,113
(They want to experience...)

256
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:36,653
(Japanese daily life, not that of tourists!)

257
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:37,813
(A popular restaurant?)

258
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:39,883
(A popular restaurant!)

259
00:10:40,283 --> 00:10:44,323
(Eating what the locals eat)

260
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:47,363
(Visiting neighbours' homes)

261
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:48,663
(You'll get bitten.)

262
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:51,903
(They can communicate to some extent.)

263
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:55,803
(Japanese fried chicken is different from ours!)

264
00:10:55,803 --> 00:10:59,673
(Similar, yet distinct from us)

265
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:02,943
(Come on, how is this kimchi?)

266
00:11:03,343 --> 00:11:06,113
(A trip to meet the people of Japan)

267
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:12,083
(Hokkaido)

268
00:11:15,993 --> 00:11:20,893
(Familiar at times)

269
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:31,773
(Unfamiliar sceneries welcome us.)

270
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:33,603
Good afternoon.

271
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:36,143
I'm greeting the deer.

272
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:37,813
It's a fox.

273
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:41,953
(Discovering new sides of ourselves through the neighbours)

274
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:45,983
(The cultural journey of House on Wheels begins.)

275
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:53,023
(House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean, Hokkaido)

276
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:56,793
(Incheon International Airport on the day of the trip)

277
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:59,903
(Normally, everyone would meet at Incheon International Airport.)

278
00:11:59,903 --> 00:12:03,073
(But today, the meeting point is Busan, not Incheon!)

279
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:07,343
(How will House on Wheels cross the ocean?)

280
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:10,573
(It has to ride a boat!)

281
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:12,143
(Today's meeting place:)

282
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:15,213
(Outdoor parking lot of Busan Port International Passenger Terminal)

283
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:18,253
It's scorching hot.

284
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:20,023
Goodness.

285
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:22,893
(Dong Il and Hee Won arrive first.)

286
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:24,193
Did you ever ride a boat to Japan?

287
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:26,293
No. How about you?

288
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:28,163
- No, not by boat.
- Right?

289
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:30,393
Why take a boat when there are planes?

290
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:32,833
We have no choice because of our house.

291
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:33,963
True.

292
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:37,233
(The two have yet to see the new house.)

293
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:38,503
Where do we go? Where is it?

294
00:12:39,703 --> 00:12:42,213
(Looking around)

295
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:43,373
Where's our house?

296
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:45,843
Where is it?

297
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,583
Where is it parked?

298
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,583
(No matter how hard they look, )

299
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:52,553
(it's hard to find the house in this vast parking lot.)

300
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:54,683
(At that moment, )

301
00:12:55,753 --> 00:12:58,423
(something moves in the parking lot.)

302
00:12:58,523 --> 00:13:02,433
(A mysterious yellow roof?)

303
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:04,933
- It's over there.
- Here it comes.

304
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:06,503
(Could it be that one?)

305
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:10,733
(Brand-new House on Wheels)

306
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,143
- So that's the one.
- They brought...

307
00:13:12,143 --> 00:13:14,903
(Brand-new House on Wheels)

308
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:17,643
The one who made it must be delivering it in person.

309
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:19,083
(Our house is moving closer.)

310
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,883
- It has gotten tiny.
- To think...

311
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:23,413
- it came all the way from Seoul.
- Hi.

312
00:13:23,413 --> 00:13:24,453
- What?
- What?

313
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:27,453
(A familiar voice greets them?)

314
00:13:28,283 --> 00:13:29,553
(Laughing)

315
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:30,923
Did you drive it over?

316
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:33,293
(The driver is...)

317
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:34,563
- Amazing.
- Did you drive it here?

318
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,933
- Did you drive it over?
- Yes, from over there.

319
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:36,933
I see.

320
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:38,963
- Did you come early and practice?
- Yes.

321
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:40,903
Like a driving course,

322
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,933
I drove it around and took it on the road.

323
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:44,873
You won't be driving it, Hee Won.

324
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:45,903
Right?

325
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:47,973
- Is it fun?
- Yes.

326
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:49,273
Do I turn it around?

327
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:50,543
(Giving parking a shot)

328
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:52,643
(Her lips are dry.)

329
00:13:52,643 --> 00:13:53,713
Should I back up a bit?

330
00:13:54,513 --> 00:13:56,983
- Should I back up?
- No, keep going. Go ahead.

331
00:13:57,313 --> 00:13:58,353
Really?

332
00:13:58,353 --> 00:14:01,283
(Trusting the members, she turns the wheel calmly.)

333
00:14:02,793 --> 00:14:03,823
She's good.

334
00:14:04,353 --> 00:14:06,923
- Yes, keep going.
- More.

335
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:08,123
Go straight.

336
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:11,333
- She's good at it.
- Yes.

337
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,633
Stop. Oh, dear.

338
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:14,963
Stop. Oh, dear.

339
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:18,373
(Feeling proud)

340
00:14:18,743 --> 00:14:22,013
(She's successfully parked the house.)

341
00:14:22,013 --> 00:14:23,713
- This is...
- The door isn't on this side.

342
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:25,043
No, it's over here.

343
00:14:25,043 --> 00:14:26,483
- The door is on the other side.
- Over here.

344
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:27,583
Here?

345
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:29,953
By the way,

346
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:32,823
- The door is on this side.
- we used to drive around a house.

347
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:34,853
Now, it's a bungalow.

348
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:35,893
I know, right?

349
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:39,993
(Usable floor area from Season 1 to 4: 13.82m²)

350
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:42,993
(The house was big enough even for five people.)

351
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:45,333
(The big house...)

352
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,463
(became this tiny.)

353
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,303
(Why did the house become so small?)

354
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:51,303
Don't...

355
00:14:51,703 --> 00:14:53,373
we have to reduce the size by 30 percent?

356
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:54,973
- Weight and everything.
- Yes.

357
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:56,913
- Either way, the road is...
- Narrow.

358
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:58,113
Yes, it's too narrow.

359
00:14:58,713 --> 00:14:59,813
In Korea,

360
00:15:00,013 --> 00:15:01,913
- there are many new towns.
- Yes.

361
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:03,753
- That's why the roads are wide.
- Yes.

362
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:05,083
But foreign countries don't have new towns,

363
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,423
including Japan and Europe.

364
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:07,683
(Japan is still using narrow roads...)

365
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:08,923
(built 100 years ago.)

366
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:11,893
(It's even quite tight for bikes.)

367
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:13,193
Isn't it about 4m wide?

368
00:15:13,193 --> 00:15:14,823
Yes, it's a little under 4m.

369
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:19,233
The house had to be downsized to go abroad.

370
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:20,303
(And so came our tiny house.)

371
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:21,903
(That's why...)

372
00:15:21,903 --> 00:15:23,503
She's the real owner of the house.

373
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:28,103
(even the inside of the house...)

374
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:31,343
(is small.)

375
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:33,713
(Once they step inside...)

376
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:36,213
(The kitchen is 3 Hee Won steps long.)

377
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:39,453
(Beyond it is the living room slash bedroom.)

378
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:42,523
(The room is about 10m².)

379
00:15:42,993 --> 00:15:45,823
(That's all there is inside the house.)

380
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:47,923
Dong Il, the house is really...

381
00:15:49,463 --> 00:15:51,493
The house has become cute.

382
00:15:52,263 --> 00:15:54,133
(Thinking)

383
00:15:54,263 --> 00:15:56,233
Check if the beddings are inside.

384
00:15:58,403 --> 00:16:00,073
- Where?
- Inside the floor.

385
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:01,873
How do I... Like this?

386
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:03,573
(The living room floor...)

387
00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:04,813
- It's all in there.
- Here...

388
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:05,913
Everything is in here.

389
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:09,553
(To make up for the small size, )

390
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:12,523
(the living room floor was raised...)

391
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:14,923
You can put things under the floor.

392
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:15,993
- It's for storage.
- Storage.

393
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:17,853
(to create hidden storage spaces.)

394
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:19,863
If we pull the curtains up...

395
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:20,923
- Okay.
- Right.

396
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:23,093
Roll them up.

397
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:24,293
What?

398
00:16:24,663 --> 00:16:26,303
The windows are floor-to-ceiling.

399
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:28,663
(A wide-open view)

400
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:31,533
(If the curtains are all rolled up)

401
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:34,243
It really opens up the space.

402
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,343
Isn't it really nice?

403
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:37,213
It's best when it rains.

404
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:42,213
All good. We'll be living together for about 15 days now.

405
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:46,953
(A trip...)

406
00:16:46,953 --> 00:16:50,993
(across the ocean with the house)

407
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:54,193
(What foreign sceneries will unfold outside the windows?)

408
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:56,963
(What kind of memories...)

409
00:16:56,963 --> 00:17:00,433
(will we make inside the house?)

410
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,803
We're practically in Paradise right now.

411
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,943
(Let's stay here for about a week.)

412
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:12,143
(We'll go anywhere with the House on Wheels Beyond the Ocean.)

413
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:18,013
- I'm loving it.
- Me too.

414
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:20,323
(Shall we start our trip across the ocean now?)

415
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:22,653
Back up slowly.

416
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:24,923
- How far should I go?
- Keep going slowly.

417
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:27,623
Keep going. Good, just like that.

418
00:17:27,623 --> 00:17:29,333
(How the House on Wheels crosses the ocean)

419
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:30,933
(They have to take the passenger ship.)

420
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:32,203
Turn the engine on.

421
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:36,033
(This ship, departing at 9pm from Busan Port, )

422
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:41,743
(will travel for about 11 hours to Shimonoseki Port.)

423
00:17:42,373 --> 00:17:47,713
(Our cute house is on the road.)

424
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,853
You're really good at driving, Na Ra.

425
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:52,423
I'm surprised myself.

426
00:17:52,423 --> 00:17:54,453
It's my first ever...

427
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:55,923
(A first for Na Ra)

428
00:17:56,123 --> 00:17:57,893
It's a life challenge, Dong Il.

429
00:17:58,023 --> 00:17:59,123
Yes.

430
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:01,993
- Well done.
- Amazing, Na Ra.

431
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:03,633
- You're truly amazing.
- Let's go.

432
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:05,563
(Arrived at the customs area...)

433
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:08,363
(in front of Busan Port for vehicle clearance)

434
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:11,773
They're here to check.

435
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:12,903
(Before the car can be loaded, it must go through customs.)

436
00:18:12,903 --> 00:18:14,243
(Vehicle customs inspection:)

437
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:20,683
(Vehicle document check)

438
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:25,313
(Vehicle interior inspection)

439
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,583
(Vehicle slash house inspection)

440
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:30,653
(After getting the clearance stamp, )

441
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:35,123
(the House on Wheels is ready to board!)

442
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:38,663
Dong Il, we have to load the car now.

443
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:40,563
Right now?

444
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:45,973
(The House on Wheels heads to the ship.)

445
00:18:48,473 --> 00:18:50,713
(I'm tilting.)

446
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:54,483
(Tilting)

447
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:57,513
(Making a wide turn, )

448
00:18:57,513 --> 00:19:00,723
(the house follows the vehicle...)

449
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:05,493
(and moves closer to the ship!)

450
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:09,193
(Rumbling)

451
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:13,333
(Rumbling)

452
00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:18,773
(The house, entering the ramp, )

453
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:25,413
(boards the ship with a loud clatter!)

454
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:30,613
(The ocean can be seen beneath the house.)

455
00:19:31,113 --> 00:19:34,083
(Seconds before the car enters the ship)

456
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:38,393
(Amazed)

457
00:19:39,063 --> 00:19:44,033
(The house enters the ship without a hitch.)

458
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:47,833
(Inside, the house encounters...)

459
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:48,863
(a whole new world.)

460
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:51,673
It looks like a building.

461
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:53,373
(a whole new world.)

462
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:56,573
- It's enormous.
- Right?

463
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:58,773
(A new, unfamiliar area)

464
00:20:01,383 --> 00:20:06,283
(Once the car is secured, )

465
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:09,923
(the House on Wheels is officially aboard!)

466
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:13,293
We're all set.

467
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:14,823
- Good.
- Let's go.

468
00:20:14,823 --> 00:20:16,293
(Hoping our house will endure...)

469
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:18,933
(the long 11-hour journey across the ocean)

470
00:20:19,103 --> 00:20:20,563
After all our bags are checked.

471
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:22,233
And our passports too.

472
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:23,433
It's just like at the airport.

473
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:24,473
(The members get ready to board the ship.)

474
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,673
- Here. Check-in is over there.
- Thank you.

475
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:29,613
(After completing immigration procedures, they board.)

476
00:20:29,843 --> 00:20:32,043
- It's room 321, on the 3rd floor.
- Okay.

477
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,643
Room 321, on the 3rd floor.

478
00:20:33,643 --> 00:20:35,113
It's really nice in here.

479
00:20:36,053 --> 00:20:39,783
(They're ready to depart for Japan!)

480
00:20:39,783 --> 00:20:42,283
- No, I...
- It's got such a great atmosphere.

481
00:20:44,753 --> 00:20:47,993
Don't you agree? It's giving off old-movie vibes.

482
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:51,033
(Happy)

483
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:52,063
Interesting.

484
00:20:52,063 --> 00:20:54,063
(The ship's lower deck where...)

485
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:57,873
(the House on Wheels will spend 11 hours)

486
00:20:58,373 --> 00:20:59,843
Room 321 is at the far end, right?

487
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:00,903
(The 3rd deck of the passenger ship...)

488
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:01,943
Here it is.

489
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:03,573
(where the members will spend 11 hours)

490
00:21:03,573 --> 00:21:05,473
- Look, Hee Won.
- Gosh.

491
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,083
(where the members will spend 11 hours)

492
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:09,683
Having sashimi on a ship isn't easy.

493
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:11,253
(A special dinner for the long journey)

494
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:12,623
- You're right.
- Right?

495
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:17,093
(Boarding tip: Purchase food from nearby markets...)

496
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:20,423
(and eat it in designated areas on the ship)

497
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:22,363
- Let's dig in.
- Thank you for the food.

498
00:21:22,363 --> 00:21:24,333
- Thank you for the food.
- What should I start with?

499
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,333
(The charm of a ship trip)

500
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,363
Start with the tasty one.

501
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:31,673
(The view on the side is a bonus!)

502
00:21:33,203 --> 00:21:35,273
How romantic.

503
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:36,273
- Right?
- Yes.

504
00:21:36,273 --> 00:21:37,343
(Their trip started with boarding the ship.)

505
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:39,643
It's getting dark outside.

506
00:21:39,643 --> 00:21:42,213
(Night falls on the romantic passenger ship.)

507
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:44,153
Tomorrow,

508
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,583
when we land in Japan,

509
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,423
it'll feel different.

510
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:52,353
Don't you agree?

511
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,463
(Excited)

512
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:56,263
- Yes.
- If we arrive at 8am...

513
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:58,093
Na Ra,

514
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:01,463
your somewhat peaceful days end today.

515
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:06,803
You need to start welcoming guests from tomorrow.

516
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:07,843
Right.

517
00:22:08,473 --> 00:22:11,243
It was the same for the other youngest members.

518
00:22:11,343 --> 00:22:14,483
The guest arrived almost immediately, just two hours later.

519
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:15,583
(Na Ra has to become a proper homeowner.)

520
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,613
I'm curious.

521
00:22:17,613 --> 00:22:20,123
(Starting tomorrow, she'll be greeting many guests.)

522
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:22,183
- They're here.
- Hi.

523
00:22:22,183 --> 00:22:23,193
Take a seat.

524
00:22:23,193 --> 00:22:25,193
(Starting tomorrow, she'll be greeting many guests.)

525
00:22:25,753 --> 00:22:29,263
(Imagining the completely new days she'll spend starting tomorrow)

526
00:22:29,593 --> 00:22:30,793
Is it moving?

527
00:22:31,693 --> 00:22:32,733
The ship is moving.

528
00:22:33,303 --> 00:22:34,763
Right? It's moving now.

529
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:35,833
(Really?)

530
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:38,703
(The ship, which had been anchored at Busan Port, )

531
00:22:40,503 --> 00:22:43,673
(slowly starts to move...)

532
00:22:45,843 --> 00:22:48,843
(and sets off with a loud signal.)

533
00:22:49,253 --> 00:22:50,913
- Here we go.
- We've departed.

534
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:52,213
It moved.

535
00:22:52,683 --> 00:22:55,953
(The members hurry outside.)

536
00:22:55,953 --> 00:22:58,293
Now that it's moving, the ship is actually fast.

537
00:22:59,193 --> 00:23:00,623
Isn't this super-fast?

538
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:02,693
No, the ship is backing up slowly.

539
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:04,363
I feel like it's pretty fast.

540
00:23:06,503 --> 00:23:08,303
(Busan's night view unfolds.)

541
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,103
How cool.

542
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,973
We're drifting away fast, Dong Il.

543
00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:17,573
(In the blink of an eye, the three members are far from Busan Port.)

544
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:22,213
(Together, the House on Wheels drifts further from land.)

545
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:23,853
It's going straight now.

546
00:23:24,283 --> 00:23:27,753
Gosh, here we go.

547
00:23:27,753 --> 00:23:31,623
(House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean is off the world!)

548
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:33,323
Amazing.

549
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:37,233
(Crossing the Busan Harbor Bridge, )

550
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:41,033
(which felt like a departure gateway, )

551
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:43,873
(the ship heads toward the vast ocean.)

552
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,303
We're off.

553
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:48,403
(We're off.)

554
00:23:49,713 --> 00:23:52,113
Is it pitch dark from that point onward?

555
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:54,383
We're going to the open sea.

556
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:55,443
I see.

557
00:23:55,443 --> 00:23:57,183
(House on Wheels crosses the ocean toward a mysterious world.)

558
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:59,383
We should all have good dreams tonight.

559
00:24:00,123 --> 00:24:03,223
So that we return to Korea healthy and well.

560
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:04,793
(From Busan Port to Shimonoseki Port)

561
00:24:07,023 --> 00:24:11,993
(With the sun slowly rising, )

562
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:17,373
(the land can be seen from afar!)

563
00:24:17,903 --> 00:24:22,203
(The workers have become busy.)

564
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:25,713
(Dong Il is peeking outside.)

565
00:24:29,483 --> 00:24:33,483
(The ship arrives at the unfamiliar Japanese port at 7:30am.)

566
00:24:34,923 --> 00:24:38,753
(Inside the ship at the same time)

567
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:40,623
(Good morning)

568
00:24:40,923 --> 00:24:42,733
We have to go back and forth.

569
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:43,933
You packed everything, right?

570
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:48,303
(Na Ra is contacting someone early in the morning?)

571
00:24:48,303 --> 00:24:49,603
(Na Ra is contacting someone early in the morning?)

572
00:24:49,703 --> 00:24:50,703
Until the next day.

573
00:24:50,703 --> 00:24:53,043
I couldn't call my husband. It made me worried.

574
00:24:54,373 --> 00:24:58,843
(The phone signal died on the ship during the night.)

575
00:25:00,443 --> 00:25:03,013
(The signal was weak out on the ocean.)

576
00:25:03,553 --> 00:25:05,053
(Notification Center)

577
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:08,183
(When the ship crossed the maritime border, )

578
00:25:08,183 --> 00:25:11,293
(travel messages from Japan popped up.)

579
00:25:12,663 --> 00:25:15,763
(Did our house cross the border safely too?)

580
00:25:16,693 --> 00:25:19,193
(The members check the house right away.)

581
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:25,703
(Thankfully, our house was fine all night.)

582
00:25:26,503 --> 00:25:29,873
(Both the members and the house go through customs inspection.)

583
00:25:31,173 --> 00:25:33,013
(After attaching the international license plate...)

584
00:25:33,013 --> 00:25:34,483
(to the House on Wheels, )

585
00:25:34,843 --> 00:25:37,853
We can finally go out now with our license plate.

586
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:38,913
(we can finally head out!)

587
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,053
- Shall we?
- Thank you.

588
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:43,493
We finally get to leave at 9:05am.

589
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:45,053
Yes.

590
00:25:45,053 --> 00:25:46,793
(Immigration complete at 9:05am)

591
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,533
(But why is Dong Il talking to the worker again?)

592
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,663
(Deep in discussion)

593
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:58,033
(Dong Il is ready to leave with a mysterious smile!)

594
00:26:00,043 --> 00:26:01,603
- You may go.
- Really?

595
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,273
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

596
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,513
(The House on Wheels and the members...)

597
00:26:10,513 --> 00:26:12,453
(head outside energetically.)

598
00:26:13,653 --> 00:26:17,823
(Seeing the blue sky after 11 hours)

599
00:26:18,923 --> 00:26:23,363
(The scenery slowly unfolds...)

600
00:26:23,363 --> 00:26:27,533
(outside the window.)

601
00:26:32,103 --> 00:26:37,273
(They arrive at Shimonoseki Port, Japan, after 11 hours.)

602
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:41,513
(House on Wheels:)

603
00:26:41,513 --> 00:26:45,513
(Beyond the Ocean)

604
00:26:46,923 --> 00:26:48,653
(One worker approaches them.)

605
00:26:49,723 --> 00:26:51,293
- Is he Japanese?
- Yes.

606
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:56,533
- Please follow me.
- Okay.

607
00:26:58,063 --> 00:26:59,133
Stop.

608
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:00,963
(Please follow me.)

609
00:27:00,963 --> 00:27:02,503
- He wants you to follow him?
- Yes.

610
00:27:03,473 --> 00:27:06,343
- You understood him, Hee Won.
- He said, "Follow me."

611
00:27:06,343 --> 00:27:07,843
(They can understand quite easily.)

612
00:27:07,943 --> 00:27:10,573
- Around.
- Back.

613
00:27:10,573 --> 00:27:12,473
- Back the car up.
- Gosh.

614
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:17,653
(Unexpectedly, they can communicate well.)

615
00:27:19,683 --> 00:27:21,253
- Thank you.
- Bye.

616
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:26,693
(Leaving the ship behind, )

617
00:27:26,693 --> 00:27:29,763
(they exit the port.)

618
00:27:30,293 --> 00:27:31,533
Oh, gosh.

619
00:27:32,593 --> 00:27:33,703
We're in Japan.

620
00:27:33,703 --> 00:27:35,263
(The House on Wheels finally hits the road in Japan.)

621
00:27:35,263 --> 00:27:36,373
We're in Japan.

622
00:27:37,603 --> 00:27:39,803
(Staring)

623
00:27:39,873 --> 00:27:41,743
(Glancing)

624
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:45,673
(Unfamiliar scenery unfolds before them.)

625
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:50,983
(Small shops line the road.)

626
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:55,983
(There's even a convenience store with a parking lot.)

627
00:27:56,693 --> 00:27:59,723
To think Hee Won would also drive in Japan.

628
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:04,263
(After crossing the ocean, the House on Wheels...)

629
00:28:04,263 --> 00:28:07,463
(drives on unfamiliar land.)

630
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:11,403
This place gives off really old vibes.

631
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:12,773
Right?

632
00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:15,743
It's like your typical small regional city.

633
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:19,913
All the Korean Japanese...

634
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:23,253
came through the port in Shimonoseki in the past.

635
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:24,613
- Shimonoseki...
- Right?

636
00:28:24,883 --> 00:28:27,023
is the closest part...

637
00:28:27,023 --> 00:28:29,523
of Japan to Korea.

638
00:28:29,893 --> 00:28:30,953
Exactly.

639
00:28:32,023 --> 00:28:33,663
(From Busan Port to Shimonoseki Port, )

640
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:36,733
(the distance is about 225km.)

641
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:38,593
That's why,

642
00:28:38,793 --> 00:28:41,063
when Koreans visited Japan during the Joseon Dynasty,

643
00:28:41,403 --> 00:28:44,403
- they came to Shimonoseki first.
- Yes.

644
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:47,673
Hence, this city...

645
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:50,613
was the first to open to Korea.

646
00:28:51,243 --> 00:28:52,273
I see.

647
00:28:53,913 --> 00:28:55,143
I may not be entirely right.

648
00:28:55,143 --> 00:28:58,013
(Laughing)

649
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:03,223
(Driving through downtown Shimonoseki)

650
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:05,993
- Okay. Turn, Hee Won.
- Okay.

651
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:08,623
(The House on Wheels stops somewhere.)

652
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:09,933
All right.

653
00:29:10,363 --> 00:29:12,733
- All set. Let's go.
- Good.

654
00:29:14,103 --> 00:29:18,133
(What will the members do first after crossing the ocean?)

655
00:29:19,473 --> 00:29:22,573
(Looking around)

656
00:29:23,073 --> 00:29:24,143
Where do we go?

657
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:28,583
- How far is it?
- It's 450m away.

658
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:29,783
It's only 450m away.

659
00:29:30,713 --> 00:29:32,453
(They seem to be looking for a place.)

660
00:29:32,453 --> 00:29:33,953
- Why is it rotating?
- Let me see.

661
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:36,753
Excuse me.

662
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:39,153
We're going here.

663
00:29:39,723 --> 00:29:42,393
- Start here.
- Start here?

664
00:29:42,493 --> 00:29:43,493
Where are we going?

665
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:48,133
(Mixing the little English they know)

666
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:51,333
- So we have to cross over, yes?
- Thank you.

667
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,243
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

668
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:57,773
- At 10:30am...
- That's when we meet, right?

669
00:29:57,773 --> 00:29:58,913
It's when we'll meet.

670
00:29:58,913 --> 00:30:01,943
After having a cup of tea and saying goodbye to your friend,

671
00:30:01,943 --> 00:30:04,353
the three of us will have lunch.

672
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,183
(Who is it?)

673
00:30:06,183 --> 00:30:08,183
- Who is Ms. Takamatsu?
- Coffee or something.

674
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:10,793
She was our guide during my family trip.

675
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,223
(An interesting story from Hee Won)

676
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:15,823
(Because the camera broke, we're substituting with photos)

677
00:30:15,823 --> 00:30:19,133
For the first time in my life, we went on a family trip.

678
00:30:19,563 --> 00:30:22,633
It was my first-ever family trip.

679
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:26,543
As my parents were quite old,

680
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:30,013
The closest place we could visit was Japan.

681
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:31,413
- Right.
- Yes.

682
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:34,483
I couldn't be their tour guide.

683
00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:36,083
I didn't know where to go either.

684
00:30:36,353 --> 00:30:39,783
I knew someone named Takamatsu in Japan.

685
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:45,953
I actually contacted Ms. Takamatsu for help.

686
00:30:46,223 --> 00:30:48,663
She guided my family.

687
00:30:49,123 --> 00:30:51,833
Did she accompany you like a tour guide?

688
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:54,763
That was a stroke of genius.

689
00:30:54,763 --> 00:30:55,833
Seriously.

690
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:58,973
Her kindness was off the charts.

691
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:03,213
When you throw a piece of bread in the air,

692
00:31:03,943 --> 00:31:05,773
something catches and eats it.

693
00:31:06,143 --> 00:31:08,013
There was a vast plain...

694
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:09,283
- that looked amazing.
- I see.

695
00:31:10,283 --> 00:31:12,453
After the trip, I received a letter from her.

696
00:31:13,183 --> 00:31:14,353
It made me cry.

697
00:31:14,353 --> 00:31:15,353
(Moved)

698
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:17,723
"You brought energy..."

699
00:31:17,723 --> 00:31:19,453
"to my dull, everyday life."

700
00:31:21,663 --> 00:31:22,723
It made me happy.

701
00:31:22,723 --> 00:31:24,993
(Ms. Takamatsu gave a happy memory to Hee Won.)

702
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:28,963
(Ms. Takamatsu and her daughter)

703
00:31:29,403 --> 00:31:31,773
(He asked Ms. Takamatsu for the same itinerary.)

704
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:33,373
To the second floor... Let's go to the other side.

705
00:31:33,373 --> 00:31:34,703
He told us to go straight.

706
00:31:34,703 --> 00:31:35,843
- Yes.
- Let's cross the bridge.

707
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:37,213
(Hee Won also wants to show it to us.)

708
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:39,273
There's a lot of Korean writing.

709
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,143
"Welcome to Shimonoseki."

710
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:44,113
This is...

711
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:45,883
"Busan Gate?"

712
00:31:48,623 --> 00:31:50,953
Isn't that Korean? Busan Gate.

713
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:52,023
(Busan Gate?)

714
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:53,263
- What do you mean?
- Isn't it Korean?

715
00:31:53,763 --> 00:31:54,993
- Korean?
- "Green Mall."

716
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:56,093
- Green Mall?
- Yes.

717
00:31:56,093 --> 00:31:57,833
(Busan has been Shimonoseki's sister city for 49 years.)

718
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:01,103
(You can tell from walking around.)

719
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:04,833
(A long relationship between Korea and Shimonoseki)

720
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:06,543
(Full of traditional Korean masks that we're happy to see)

721
00:32:06,543 --> 00:32:08,543
That's why there are many Korean restaurants.

722
00:32:09,073 --> 00:32:11,173
(Daegu Restaurant)

723
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:13,313
(Korean food)

724
00:32:13,513 --> 00:32:16,713
This is where we will find Ms. Takamatsu.

725
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,183
Isn't this the cafe?

726
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:21,283
- This must be the place.
- It's right here.

727
00:32:22,283 --> 00:32:26,323
(Tucked away at the end of a quiet alley)

728
00:32:26,523 --> 00:32:29,293
(A vintage-style cafe)

729
00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:30,693
- This is the cafe.
- We're here.

730
00:32:30,693 --> 00:32:31,693
Let's go.

731
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:33,703
It's Ms. Takamatsu.

732
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:36,103
- They finally met. It must be her.
- Gosh.

733
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:37,733
They finally met.

734
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:40,743
- Hello.
- Hello.

735
00:32:40,743 --> 00:32:42,273
It's been a long time.

736
00:32:43,473 --> 00:32:46,343
(Hello, it's been a long time.)

737
00:32:46,343 --> 00:32:49,113
- Have you been well?
- Yes, how about you?

738
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:51,883
- Hello.
- Hello.

739
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:53,423
It's nice to meet you.

740
00:32:54,023 --> 00:32:56,353
(Today's tour guide)

741
00:32:56,353 --> 00:32:59,723
(Ms. Takamatsu)

742
00:32:59,923 --> 00:33:01,063
It's nice to meet you.

743
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,463
(This is my friend.)

744
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:03,493
Do you know him?

745
00:33:04,593 --> 00:33:05,933
- It's Sung Dong Il.
- I know him.

746
00:33:06,263 --> 00:33:07,763
- This is Jang Na Ra.
- Nice to meet you.

747
00:33:07,763 --> 00:33:08,863
(She's a younger friend of mine.)

748
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:11,273
The Korean drama.

749
00:33:11,273 --> 00:33:12,633
- "Drama?" - I enjoy watching it.

750
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:15,503
All of you.

751
00:33:16,943 --> 00:33:18,673
- Let's...
- Where shall we sit?

752
00:33:18,673 --> 00:33:19,843
- Shall we sit here?
- How about here?

753
00:33:19,843 --> 00:33:20,843
Hee Won.

754
00:33:20,843 --> 00:33:21,883
(They try to find a seat and talk.)

755
00:33:21,943 --> 00:33:22,943
Hee Won.

756
00:33:23,953 --> 00:33:24,983
I brought you cookies.

757
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:26,653
Cookies?

758
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:29,683
(Ms. Takamatsu brought a present for our family.)

759
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:31,753
I'm so happy to see you again.

760
00:33:31,753 --> 00:33:33,293
I'm happy to...

761
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:34,863
- See him again?
- Yes.

762
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:36,693
- I'm happy.
- You're happy?

763
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:40,303
- Let's sit down first.
- Let's sit.

764
00:33:41,163 --> 00:33:44,373
Na Ra, why don't you sit by the window?

765
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:45,373
- Sure.
- Yes.

766
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:47,203
- Why don't I sit by the window...
- I can sit anywhere.

767
00:33:47,603 --> 00:33:51,313
(Will they be able to converse?)

768
00:33:51,313 --> 00:33:52,843
Please have a seat.

769
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:54,543
Thank you very much.

770
00:33:55,843 --> 00:33:57,753
(They're nervous for no reason.)

771
00:33:57,753 --> 00:33:59,513
(Lost for words)

772
00:34:00,183 --> 00:34:04,123
(They're happy to see each other, but there's a language barrier.)

773
00:34:04,323 --> 00:34:07,293
(She doesn't know what to say either.)

774
00:34:07,693 --> 00:34:10,033
We have a lot to say to each other, but...

775
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:13,603
- Can't you speak Japanese?
- I can't.

776
00:34:13,603 --> 00:34:14,663
(No, I can't.)

777
00:34:14,663 --> 00:34:16,403
(Really?)

778
00:34:17,203 --> 00:34:20,103
The weather is very...

779
00:34:20,873 --> 00:34:22,643
The weather is good morning.

780
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:27,043
(The weather is hello.)

781
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:29,783
(Dong Il, speak to the phone.)

782
00:34:29,783 --> 00:34:31,053
The weather is nice.

783
00:34:31,053 --> 00:34:33,223
(The weather is nice.)

784
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:36,893
I'm glad that the weather is nice.

785
00:34:39,653 --> 00:34:42,093
(Translation app)

786
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:43,993
I'll put it on speaker.

787
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:46,363
You look very good.

788
00:34:46,863 --> 00:34:47,933
And then...

789
00:34:47,933 --> 00:34:50,703
(He entered "You look very good.")

790
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:51,903
(You look very good.)

791
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:55,143
- I look very good?
- Yes.

792
00:34:56,843 --> 00:34:58,073
You look like you're doing well.

793
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:01,683
Thank you.

794
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:05,383
I've seen you only on TV.

795
00:35:06,513 --> 00:35:07,723
As I got to meet you...

796
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:11,993
(It takes time, but she communicates with composure.)

797
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:14,423
My heart is beating fast.

798
00:35:15,193 --> 00:35:17,633
(She's so cute.)

799
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:20,063
(Communication is smoother than expected.)

800
00:35:20,063 --> 00:35:21,963
- We should try some.
- Let's eat it.

801
00:35:22,763 --> 00:35:23,933
- Cookies.
- Cookies.

802
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:25,033
(He takes out the cookies that she gave him.)

803
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:27,373
- But...
- Do you want some cookies?

804
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:30,613
Are we allowed to eat them here?

805
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:33,943
(Are we allowed to eat them here?)

806
00:35:33,943 --> 00:35:35,243
- I'll go and ask.
- Okay.

807
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:37,553
- Your Japanese is amazing.
- No.

808
00:35:38,113 --> 00:35:40,183
(Are we allowed to eat them here?)

809
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:42,753
(She spoke in Japanese without realising it.)

810
00:35:43,523 --> 00:35:45,093
- Na Ra, can you speak Japanese?
- She's good at it.

811
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:48,423
I don't know any Japanese that's used in everyday life.

812
00:35:48,963 --> 00:35:51,433
What did I tell you? She has a trick up her sleeve.

813
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:53,263
(Na Ra has a trick up her sleeve.)

814
00:35:53,363 --> 00:35:54,703
- Shall I try it?
- Go ahead.

815
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:56,163
Na Ra is...

816
00:35:56,163 --> 00:35:57,273
(The new member of our family is competent in many ways.)

817
00:35:57,273 --> 00:35:58,673
Na Ra does it when she's determined.

818
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:00,543
Excuse me.

819
00:36:00,773 --> 00:36:02,843
Can we eat cookies in here?

820
00:36:02,843 --> 00:36:04,043
- Yes, that's okay.
- Okay.

821
00:36:05,343 --> 00:36:06,373
Okay.

822
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,443
Thank you.

823
00:36:10,283 --> 00:36:13,723
- Can you speak Japanese?
- This is what happens.

824
00:36:13,723 --> 00:36:15,053
- Just a little.
- This is...

825
00:36:15,053 --> 00:36:16,183
- That's amazing.
- It doesn't work.

826
00:36:16,353 --> 00:36:18,153
I learned Korean...

827
00:36:18,153 --> 00:36:19,993
from watching dramas.

828
00:36:20,493 --> 00:36:21,763
(I see.)

829
00:36:21,823 --> 00:36:23,533
- Did you understand?
- I did.

830
00:36:24,193 --> 00:36:25,533
(When it comes to simple conversations, )

831
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:26,963
(she can understand without the translator.)

832
00:36:27,363 --> 00:36:29,403
- Let's try the present.
- Cookies?

833
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:32,833
(They open the box of cookies.)

834
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:35,003
(Exclaiming)

835
00:36:35,873 --> 00:36:37,073
It looks delicious.

836
00:36:37,073 --> 00:36:38,443
(The dessert lover's heart flutters.)

837
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:40,643
- Here's one.
- Shall I take out each type?

838
00:36:40,643 --> 00:36:41,713
Yes.

839
00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:47,123
(Eating)

840
00:36:48,153 --> 00:36:50,123
(Humming in approval)

841
00:36:50,423 --> 00:36:52,693
- It's so delicious.
- I'm glad to hear that.

842
00:36:53,153 --> 00:36:56,223
I bought them in Hiroshima.

843
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,863
I went there just to buy these cookies.

844
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:01,063
Goodness.

845
00:37:01,233 --> 00:37:02,233
- Dong Il.
- Yes?

846
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:04,133
She went all the way to Hiroshima...

847
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:06,273
- to buy these cookies.
- Goodness.

848
00:37:06,273 --> 00:37:08,243
(She travelled 3 hours to Hiroshima just to buy the present.)

849
00:37:08,743 --> 00:37:10,943
(Moved)

850
00:37:10,943 --> 00:37:12,343
These are cookies from Hiroshima.

851
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:14,443
(Thank you.)

852
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:16,613
(Feeling proud)

853
00:37:16,613 --> 00:37:17,613
It's delicious.

854
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:19,513
Ask her if this is the only thing she bought.

855
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:22,023
(Ask her if this is the only thing she bought.)

856
00:37:22,223 --> 00:37:24,853
(His mischievous side kicks in.)

857
00:37:25,053 --> 00:37:26,423
Ask her if there's more.

858
00:37:26,723 --> 00:37:27,963
Is there more?

859
00:37:28,423 --> 00:37:29,863
Ask her if she has one more box.

860
00:37:29,863 --> 00:37:30,893
(Inputting "one more box")

861
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:32,533
One more box...

862
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:33,933
(Outputting "one more box")

863
00:37:34,103 --> 00:37:36,303
Do you have another box of these cookies?

864
00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:38,103
(He asks again.)

865
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:39,673
Do I...

866
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:43,743
No, I don't.

867
00:37:44,573 --> 00:37:46,713
(Ms. Takamatsu responds with wit.)

868
00:37:46,713 --> 00:37:48,513
She only bought one box.

869
00:37:49,743 --> 00:37:50,813
I was joking.

870
00:37:50,813 --> 00:37:51,983
(Please don't misunderstand.)

871
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:53,953
It was a joke.

872
00:37:53,953 --> 00:37:55,953
(It was a joke.)

873
00:37:55,953 --> 00:37:56,993
I know.

874
00:37:57,593 --> 00:37:58,593
She knows.

875
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:00,163
(Her sense of humour is the best.)

876
00:38:00,163 --> 00:38:01,163
I know.

877
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:03,223
- She seems like a great person.
- Yes.

878
00:38:03,223 --> 00:38:04,733
(She leaves a great impression.)

879
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,293
The impression you leave...

880
00:38:07,903 --> 00:38:09,503
You're beautiful.

881
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:10,833
(Beautiful)

882
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:15,943
He and I are probably the same age.

883
00:38:16,273 --> 00:38:17,773
She says that she's as old as you.

884
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:19,273
(Are they the same age?)

885
00:38:19,273 --> 00:38:20,743
- I think so.
- Was she born early in 1978?

886
00:38:21,043 --> 00:38:22,043
What?

887
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,983
What? Probably.

888
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:26,013
What?

889
00:38:26,483 --> 00:38:28,283
I was born early in 1978.

890
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:31,393
He was born in 1978.

891
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:33,053
(Sighing)

892
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:34,823
In 1978...

893
00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:38,293
He was born in 1978?

894
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:40,103
Why is she getting angry?

895
00:38:40,463 --> 00:38:42,463
(Amicable)

896
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:45,133
Are you 60 years old?

897
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:47,173
- Are you 60?
- Am I 60?

898
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:49,773
Maybe.

899
00:38:50,513 --> 00:38:51,613
Maybe.

900
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:54,583
(Nice to meet you, my friend.)

901
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:57,513
Next time, I should meet up with her without you.

902
00:38:58,213 --> 00:38:59,383
(Upset)

903
00:38:59,383 --> 00:39:00,953
It's over for you.

904
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:02,983
She should come on the show next time as my friend.

905
00:39:04,393 --> 00:39:05,523
That's fine.

906
00:39:07,923 --> 00:39:09,993
(I made a new friend.)

907
00:39:11,063 --> 00:39:12,193
She's like a young girl.

908
00:39:12,193 --> 00:39:13,733
(It's time to ask her about travelling in the neighbourhood.)

909
00:39:13,933 --> 00:39:16,263
I'll take them to places...

910
00:39:16,403 --> 00:39:17,903
where you brought me last time.

911
00:39:17,903 --> 00:39:20,673
(I'll take my family to places where you brought me.)

912
00:39:20,973 --> 00:39:22,173
Akiyoshidai?

913
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:24,813
- Yes, that place...
- Akiyoshidai.

914
00:39:25,273 --> 00:39:26,743
- Is it called Akiyoshidai?
- Akiyoshidai...

915
00:39:26,743 --> 00:39:28,613
I don't know its name.

916
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:29,913
Akiyoshidai?

917
00:39:31,013 --> 00:39:34,753
The place we went to last time that was burnt completely...

918
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:36,483
It was a mountain.

919
00:39:36,783 --> 00:39:40,423
(A mountain?)

920
00:39:40,623 --> 00:39:43,663
And that place where you can feed crows.

921
00:39:44,663 --> 00:39:47,063
And that place where you can feed crows.

922
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,573
(They're listening to him, )

923
00:39:51,573 --> 00:39:54,203
(but it's still unclear.)

924
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,913
(Hold on, where was it?)

925
00:39:57,913 --> 00:40:00,783
(I have no idea where is where.)

926
00:40:00,783 --> 00:40:02,883
(I think I've been here before.)

927
00:40:02,883 --> 00:40:04,353
(Actually, )

928
00:40:04,353 --> 00:40:07,583
(Hee Won isn't familiar either.)

929
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:09,183
(Hee Won Tour...)

930
00:40:09,183 --> 00:40:12,793
(that he isn't familiar with)

931
00:40:14,923 --> 00:40:15,963
(Hee Won!)

932
00:40:16,693 --> 00:40:17,693
(Yes, Dong Il.)

933
00:40:17,693 --> 00:40:19,463
(This is all because of you.)

934
00:40:19,593 --> 00:40:22,363
(Will they be okay during the tour?)

935
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,903
(Hee Won Tour, designed by a real local)

936
00:40:24,903 --> 00:40:27,603
(It's coming soon.)

937
00:40:27,603 --> 00:40:28,773
All right.

938
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:31,243
Shall we get going now?

939
00:40:31,543 --> 00:40:34,613
- Thank you for the cookies.
- You're welcome.

940
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:37,313
Good luck from now on.

941
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:39,713
We can do it.

942
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:42,023
(Please go ahead.)

943
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,023
(You go ahead.)

944
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,393
Please go out before me.

945
00:40:46,553 --> 00:40:49,493
- Na Ra, let's take a photo here.
- Let's take a photo together.

946
00:40:49,793 --> 00:40:51,333
How about a photo together?

947
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:52,393
- Picture.
- Picture.

948
00:40:52,593 --> 00:40:55,563
(A precious relationship captured in a photo)

949
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:00,943
(We look forward to the trip recommended by a local.)

950
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:02,573
Go straight.

951
00:41:03,173 --> 00:41:06,143
- It's so nice.
- Na Ra, look at that house.

952
00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:08,113
When you go to the countryside...

953
00:41:08,813 --> 00:41:11,783
The atmosphere here reminds me of a Japanese comic.

954
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:15,483
Things haven't really changed in Japan.

955
00:41:16,653 --> 00:41:17,723
There are vending machines.

956
00:41:18,953 --> 00:41:20,723
When I came to Japan for the first time when I was young,

957
00:41:20,723 --> 00:41:23,493
I bought so much from them. I couldn't even finish it.

958
00:41:25,163 --> 00:41:26,493
- You fell in love with them.
- There are many types...

959
00:41:26,493 --> 00:41:27,803
of vending machines and beverages.

960
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:30,873
They're also colourful and exotic.

961
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:34,773
- Gosh.
- Vending machines?

962
00:41:36,573 --> 00:41:37,943
Japan is known for their vending machines.

963
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:41,113
There's so much good food.

964
00:41:41,113 --> 00:41:42,643
(There's also a vending machine for ramyeon and dumplings.)

965
00:41:43,243 --> 00:41:46,183
When I visited Japan before,

966
00:41:46,183 --> 00:41:48,353
I was guided by someone...

967
00:41:48,353 --> 00:41:49,853
from Japan's Ministry of Tourism.

968
00:41:49,953 --> 00:41:54,263
I asked the tour guide why vending machines were so popular here.

969
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:55,823
This is what the guide explained.

970
00:41:56,363 --> 00:41:58,593
People in Japan don't want to bother asking the clerk...

971
00:41:58,593 --> 00:42:02,203
how much it is or exchange money with him.

972
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:05,403
You can find the same products inside a store.

973
00:42:05,403 --> 00:42:06,833
Like beverages.

974
00:42:06,973 --> 00:42:09,803
People prefer to buy them outside by themselves.

975
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:13,513
That's how their vending machine culture developed.

976
00:42:14,113 --> 00:42:18,713
(The culture of individualism is deeply rooted in Japan.)

977
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:20,323
- To make things simple?
- Yes.

978
00:42:20,323 --> 00:42:21,553
I was shocked when I heard that.

979
00:42:21,553 --> 00:42:22,623
(The vending machines show how similar yet different Japan is.)

980
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,123
- I can understand.
- Yes.

981
00:42:25,023 --> 00:42:27,023
(By the way, they have to eat lunch.)

982
00:42:27,023 --> 00:42:29,623
(Looking around)

983
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:31,993
This is it.

984
00:42:32,193 --> 00:42:33,863
- Are we here?
- This is it.

985
00:42:34,904 --> 00:42:36,044
This is it.

986
00:42:36,344 --> 00:42:38,074
- Are we here?
- This is it.

987
00:42:38,174 --> 00:42:39,214
This is the restaurant.

988
00:42:40,884 --> 00:42:42,244
(3 hours ago, waiting to go through customs)

989
00:42:42,244 --> 00:42:44,114
Na Ra, you know what's also important?

990
00:42:44,654 --> 00:42:46,854
Our first meal in Japan today.

991
00:42:46,854 --> 00:42:49,024
What we eat as our first meal seems important.

992
00:42:50,794 --> 00:42:54,564
(Dong Il gets out of the car abruptly.)

993
00:42:54,924 --> 00:42:58,664
(Is there a restaurant that local government employees go to?)

994
00:42:58,664 --> 00:43:00,234
(Thinking)

995
00:43:01,234 --> 00:43:03,204
(Asking around for favourite spots of local government workers)

996
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:04,934
(Favourite restaurants?)

997
00:43:06,174 --> 00:43:07,774
(Do you know any popular restaurant?)

998
00:43:07,774 --> 00:43:09,144
(A restaurant?)

999
00:43:10,204 --> 00:43:11,344
Where they go is a good restaurant.

1000
00:43:13,744 --> 00:43:17,454
(Actively investigating popular restaurants to answer the inquiry)

1001
00:43:18,414 --> 00:43:21,624
(That's how he collected special information.)

1002
00:43:22,524 --> 00:43:24,324
We just have to go to the government workers' favourite place.

1003
00:43:24,324 --> 00:43:25,824
(Government workers' favourite restaurant is the real deal.)

1004
00:43:25,954 --> 00:43:28,964
It looks delicious. It's picked by the real locals.

1005
00:43:28,964 --> 00:43:30,024
It's where the locals go.

1006
00:43:31,034 --> 00:43:32,064
- Is this it?
- Yes.

1007
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:36,764
- I can't wait.
- It will be delicious.

1008
00:43:37,334 --> 00:43:38,374
- Let's go in.
- Please go in.

1009
00:43:39,134 --> 00:43:40,204
(They enter with anticipation.)

1010
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:41,804
- Excuse us.
- Hello.

1011
00:43:41,804 --> 00:43:42,874
Hello.

1012
00:43:44,214 --> 00:43:46,644
(They sit down and take a look around the restaurant.)

1013
00:43:46,644 --> 00:43:47,644
What is good to eat?

1014
00:43:47,844 --> 00:43:51,114
(Photos with the frequent customers cover up the wall.)

1015
00:43:51,684 --> 00:43:54,754
(A photo of a visit by a famous person is framed.)

1016
00:43:55,054 --> 00:43:57,054
Doesn't the restaurant owner...

1017
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:59,424
look like some kind of master?

1018
00:43:59,624 --> 00:44:00,924
- Yes, a master.
- He looks like a character...

1019
00:44:00,924 --> 00:44:02,364
from "Shota no Sushi."

1020
00:44:03,164 --> 00:44:05,594
(The presence of a master)

1021
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:07,064
(Turning)

1022
00:44:07,064 --> 00:44:10,204
(Each of his movement is disciplined.)

1023
00:44:11,104 --> 00:44:14,544
(They're too busy watching the chef and forget to order.)

1024
00:44:20,444 --> 00:44:23,814
(Who is the man going to the back of the restaurant?)

1025
00:44:26,784 --> 00:44:29,224
- He's also a worker here.
- You're right.

1026
00:44:31,024 --> 00:44:32,454
He's like a character in a Japanese comic.

1027
00:44:32,454 --> 00:44:35,564
(He also looks like a character in a Japanese comic.)

1028
00:44:36,164 --> 00:44:39,234
(All the employees have a strong presence at this restaurant.)

1029
00:44:39,634 --> 00:44:40,634
Menu?

1030
00:44:41,004 --> 00:44:42,064
I see.

1031
00:44:43,064 --> 00:44:44,104
What looks good?

1032
00:44:45,734 --> 00:44:47,374
Well, I...

1033
00:44:47,674 --> 00:44:49,904
(The menu is 100 percent in Japanese.)

1034
00:44:50,844 --> 00:44:52,944
Do you have a menu with photos?

1035
00:44:52,944 --> 00:44:54,014
(He asks for a menu with photos desperately.)

1036
00:44:54,614 --> 00:44:55,884
(No, we have no photos.)

1037
00:44:56,344 --> 00:44:57,654
(What should we do?)

1038
00:44:58,184 --> 00:44:59,684
There are no photos.

1039
00:44:59,684 --> 00:45:00,784
(The menu is 100 percent in Japanese, )

1040
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:01,884
(and the server can't speak English.)

1041
00:45:02,484 --> 00:45:05,094
(This is definitely a restaurant visited by the locals.)

1042
00:45:05,594 --> 00:45:08,224
Can you take a photo with the translator?

1043
00:45:08,224 --> 00:45:09,264
Right.

1044
00:45:09,694 --> 00:45:11,134
- If we take a photo...
- Here it is.

1045
00:45:11,134 --> 00:45:12,994
If we take a photo of this,

1046
00:45:13,264 --> 00:45:15,064
you can ask for translation.

1047
00:45:16,134 --> 00:45:17,134
(The photo of the menu is translated quickly.)

1048
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:19,634
"Tentoji?" "Chungbura?" What's this?

1049
00:45:21,404 --> 00:45:23,304
It's not translated properly.

1050
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,144
It's just reading the Japanese words.

1051
00:45:26,214 --> 00:45:28,684
- "Oroshisoba, cold nuki..." - "Tuna oroshi?"

1052
00:45:29,044 --> 00:45:32,314
(There is even a cheer on the menu.)

1053
00:45:33,154 --> 00:45:35,684
(Veins are popping under pressure.)

1054
00:45:36,354 --> 00:45:37,524
(We have to order something somehow.)

1055
00:45:37,524 --> 00:45:40,354
How about the house special?

1056
00:45:41,094 --> 00:45:42,094
Special...

1057
00:45:42,694 --> 00:45:44,334
- A special dish like omakase?
- Yes.

1058
00:45:45,594 --> 00:45:47,464
(She understood easily.)

1059
00:45:48,104 --> 00:45:49,664
(Is this really working?)

1060
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:52,034
(My goodness, Dong Il...)

1061
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:56,544
(He managed to break the communication barrier.)

1062
00:45:57,214 --> 00:46:02,514
(The result of the workers' serious discussion)

1063
00:46:02,884 --> 00:46:04,354
- Cold soba?
- Cold soba?

1064
00:46:04,354 --> 00:46:06,154
- Cold soba.
- With fried food.

1065
00:46:06,714 --> 00:46:08,084
- Is it a special dish?
- Yes.

1066
00:46:08,554 --> 00:46:10,894
Fried food over rice, pork cutlet over rice,

1067
00:46:12,094 --> 00:46:13,694
- and soba with fries.
- Okay.

1068
00:46:13,694 --> 00:46:15,424
- Okay.
- Okay.

1069
00:46:16,264 --> 00:46:18,194
- Do you want that?
- It's delicious.

1070
00:46:18,194 --> 00:46:20,064
(They order the special menu successfully.)

1071
00:46:21,264 --> 00:46:23,334
I can't wait. Doesn't it sound delicious?

1072
00:46:24,674 --> 00:46:26,734
(Sizzling)

1073
00:46:26,734 --> 00:46:28,204
- He's deep-frying it right away.
- Gosh.

1074
00:46:31,344 --> 00:46:35,244
(The master starts to prepare fried food with graceful motions.)

1075
00:46:37,254 --> 00:46:39,654
He looks like an expert.

1076
00:46:41,884 --> 00:46:45,154
(Elaborate)

1077
00:46:45,824 --> 00:46:48,224
(The rare sight makes him get up.)

1078
00:46:48,894 --> 00:46:51,264
(He gapes from watching his deep-frying in person.)

1079
00:46:52,034 --> 00:46:53,864
- It's fried food.
- Right.

1080
00:46:55,004 --> 00:46:56,664
(Na Ra joins him like she's possessed.)

1081
00:46:56,664 --> 00:46:59,034
(In awe)

1082
00:46:59,804 --> 00:47:02,704
He keeps making the coating bigger.

1083
00:47:02,704 --> 00:47:03,704
To make it abundant.

1084
00:47:04,244 --> 00:47:06,544
(This is the master's deep-frying technique.)

1085
00:47:06,544 --> 00:47:07,614
He looks amazing.

1086
00:47:08,184 --> 00:47:12,014
(An advanced technique of layering batter to maximize crispiness)

1087
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:13,954
(The shrimp was this thin.)

1088
00:47:15,024 --> 00:47:18,254
(It turned into delicious-looking fried shrimp with coating.)

1089
00:47:18,924 --> 00:47:19,954
(Clank)

1090
00:47:20,454 --> 00:47:22,624
(You have to imitate it once.)

1091
00:47:23,464 --> 00:47:27,404
(The master's kitchen gets busy with the customers' anticipation.)

1092
00:47:31,274 --> 00:47:34,404
(Starting with warm and freshly fried food)

1093
00:47:36,344 --> 00:47:38,314
- He cooked the noodles on the spot.
- He did.

1094
00:47:39,014 --> 00:47:41,244
- Gosh, it looks delicious.
- Look at that.

1095
00:47:44,584 --> 00:47:46,154
- Here it is.
- Look at that.

1096
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:47,724
Gosh, it's hot.

1097
00:47:50,184 --> 00:47:51,354
(Shouting with marvel)

1098
00:47:51,954 --> 00:47:52,954
Thank you.

1099
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,264
(They finally get their first meal in Japan.)

1100
00:47:55,894 --> 00:47:56,924
Oh, my.

1101
00:48:01,364 --> 00:48:02,364
- Doesn't it look delicious?
- Goodness.

1102
00:48:11,944 --> 00:48:17,814
(The government worker's favourite fried food set meal)

1103
00:48:18,254 --> 00:48:20,184
Gosh, it's our first meal.

1104
00:48:20,184 --> 00:48:22,054
(How will the food taste at government workers' favourite place?)

1105
00:48:23,454 --> 00:48:24,494
I can't wait.

1106
00:48:25,254 --> 00:48:27,664
- We can taste each noodle dish.
- Go ahead.

1107
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:29,224
(To taste each dish, they need their own plate.)

1108
00:48:29,224 --> 00:48:30,294
We need to ask.

1109
00:48:31,334 --> 00:48:32,594
How do you say our own plate?

1110
00:48:32,894 --> 00:48:34,504
(She's searching already.)

1111
00:48:34,734 --> 00:48:36,704
- What is it called?
- Never mind.

1112
00:48:36,704 --> 00:48:37,774
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1113
00:48:37,774 --> 00:48:38,834
Plate.

1114
00:48:41,774 --> 00:48:42,874
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1115
00:48:42,874 --> 00:48:44,214
- Plate?
- Plate?

1116
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:46,614
- Three plates, please.
- Oh, my.

1117
00:48:46,614 --> 00:48:47,614
Three.

1118
00:48:47,614 --> 00:48:49,244
(He understood three plates.)

1119
00:48:49,544 --> 00:48:51,184
- Oh, my.
- Three plates.

1120
00:48:51,954 --> 00:48:52,984
"Plate?"

1121
00:48:52,984 --> 00:48:54,154
(Laughing)

1122
00:48:55,284 --> 00:48:57,024
I didn't think that it was a Japanese word.

1123
00:48:57,024 --> 00:48:58,054
(Old people know the word "plate" in Japanese.)

1124
00:48:58,754 --> 00:49:01,424
- They all understand.
- That's amazing.

1125
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:03,364
- What about spoons and chopsticks?
- Spoons and chopsticks?

1126
00:49:03,364 --> 00:49:04,464
(Can you also ask for spoons and chopsticks?)

1127
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:05,964
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1128
00:49:05,964 --> 00:49:07,034
- Spoon.
- Spoon?

1129
00:49:07,034 --> 00:49:09,004
- Yes.
- Oh, my.

1130
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:13,074
Goodness, this is no big deal.

1131
00:49:13,934 --> 00:49:16,274
Everything is possible with me anywhere in the world.

1132
00:49:16,274 --> 00:49:17,674
(There's no border in Dong Il's language.)

1133
00:49:18,514 --> 00:49:20,944
(Dong Il is so reliable.)

1134
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:23,684
- Let's eat.
- It looks delicious.

1135
00:49:23,684 --> 00:49:24,714
(It's time to taste the food.)

1136
00:49:25,514 --> 00:49:26,814
- Hee Won, have some shrimp.
- What?

1137
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:27,924
Try this.

1138
00:49:28,324 --> 00:49:29,524
Thank you, Dong Il.

1139
00:49:31,854 --> 00:49:32,854
(Crunch!)

1140
00:49:34,864 --> 00:49:36,094
Have you tried it?

1141
00:49:36,094 --> 00:49:37,194
(Satisfied)

1142
00:49:38,234 --> 00:49:41,504
(Deep-fried shrimp is crunchy even when dipped in sauce.)

1143
00:49:41,564 --> 00:49:43,364
All the food they serve here is good.

1144
00:49:43,364 --> 00:49:44,574
- Yes.
- Yes.

1145
00:49:44,574 --> 00:49:45,674
It's good.

1146
00:49:46,874 --> 00:49:48,444
(Na Ra has a bite of deep-fried shiso.)

1147
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:49,444
(Crunch!)

1148
00:49:50,344 --> 00:49:51,414
It's good.

1149
00:49:53,974 --> 00:49:54,984
(Crunch)

1150
00:49:59,754 --> 00:50:01,124
(The second method of deep-frying)

1151
00:50:01,124 --> 00:50:03,184
(Apply batter on just one side of the vegetable.)

1152
00:50:03,524 --> 00:50:07,154
(The batter is thin yet still crunchy.)

1153
00:50:07,494 --> 00:50:10,024
I've wanted to try this cold noodles.

1154
00:50:10,294 --> 00:50:11,394
This one.

1155
00:50:11,394 --> 00:50:15,604
(How will Japanese soba taste?)

1156
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:16,834
Let's try it.

1157
00:50:16,834 --> 00:50:17,934
(He picks up soba with his chopsticks...)

1158
00:50:17,934 --> 00:50:19,134
(and dips it in soy sauce broth.)

1159
00:50:19,134 --> 00:50:20,204
Is it good?

1160
00:50:21,344 --> 00:50:24,514
(Slurping)

1161
00:50:25,074 --> 00:50:26,544
(Humming)

1162
00:50:26,974 --> 00:50:29,614
(Curious)

1163
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:32,354
Try this.

1164
00:50:32,814 --> 00:50:37,154
(Taking another bite)

1165
00:50:37,824 --> 00:50:41,364
(Na Ra tries cold soba after him.)

1166
00:50:46,664 --> 00:50:48,404
- This isn't bad.
- It's a bit salty.

1167
00:50:48,534 --> 00:50:49,764
- It's salty?
- Yes.

1168
00:50:50,364 --> 00:50:54,344
It's a bit saltier than Korean cold buckwheat noodles.

1169
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:56,204
- Is it?
- Yes, it's a bit saltier.

1170
00:50:56,874 --> 00:50:58,614
- Is it salty?
- Yes. Add some water.

1171
00:50:59,744 --> 00:51:01,984
You'd better add some water to it.

1172
00:51:03,314 --> 00:51:05,514
(He stirs it.)

1173
00:51:09,624 --> 00:51:11,394
(Humming)

1174
00:51:11,524 --> 00:51:12,894
It's still salty with water.

1175
00:51:14,564 --> 00:51:16,564
- But it's delicious.
- It's delicious.

1176
00:51:17,164 --> 00:51:19,764
They seem to season their food quite strongly overall.

1177
00:51:21,604 --> 00:51:24,274
(Actually, Japanese cold soba...)

1178
00:51:24,504 --> 00:51:27,134
(To fully enjoy the buckwheat taste of the noodles, )

1179
00:51:27,774 --> 00:51:31,774
(you're supposed to dip just a bit in thick soy sauce broth.)

1180
00:51:31,774 --> 00:51:33,944
(Even when she explained how to eat just now...)

1181
00:51:33,944 --> 00:51:35,184
(Dipping it just once)

1182
00:51:35,484 --> 00:51:37,584
(On the other hand, Korean cold buckwheat noodles...)

1183
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:39,454
(Rather than "dipping,")

1184
00:51:39,454 --> 00:51:42,924
(you "mix" it into the broth.)

1185
00:51:42,924 --> 00:51:44,224
(Japanese, Korean)

1186
00:51:44,224 --> 00:51:48,394
(It's a lot colder and more watery than Japanese soy sauce broth!)

1187
00:51:49,194 --> 00:51:51,234
(When the food is salty, )

1188
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:55,064
(eat rice.)

1189
00:51:55,264 --> 00:51:56,534
This isn't salty.

1190
00:51:56,534 --> 00:51:57,934
It used breadcrumbs.

1191
00:51:58,274 --> 00:52:00,474
(He goes for pork cutlet rice bowl next.)

1192
00:52:00,774 --> 00:52:02,674
- This is tasty.
- Is it?

1193
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:05,514
(Taking a big bite)

1194
00:52:05,974 --> 00:52:07,884
(Humming)

1195
00:52:08,384 --> 00:52:10,814
(Battered eggs on pork cutlet boiled in soy sauce)

1196
00:52:10,814 --> 00:52:13,114
(Battered eggs on pork cutlet boiled in soy sauce)

1197
00:52:14,524 --> 00:52:15,984
(Sweet, savoury, and fluffy)

1198
00:52:15,984 --> 00:52:17,654
(A unique style of pork cutlet rice bowl)

1199
00:52:18,154 --> 00:52:19,324
It's good.

1200
00:52:19,324 --> 00:52:20,354
(Na Ra takes a bite too.)

1201
00:52:21,164 --> 00:52:22,324
It's very delicious.

1202
00:52:22,694 --> 00:52:25,564
It tastes good because the rice is so well-cooked.

1203
00:52:25,564 --> 00:52:26,964
The rice is so delicious.

1204
00:52:28,564 --> 00:52:32,174
(They sell various local dishes here.)

1205
00:52:32,874 --> 00:52:33,934
(It's a sort of Japanese local diner.)

1206
00:52:33,934 --> 00:52:35,474
- It's delicious.
- It's delicious.

1207
00:52:38,774 --> 00:52:42,514
(As one can expect from a local diner...)

1208
00:52:43,114 --> 00:52:44,954
I think he went to deliver the food.

1209
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:46,484
Food delivery.

1210
00:52:47,684 --> 00:52:50,124
(He places the tray on the trunk specially modified for delivery.)

1211
00:52:50,954 --> 00:52:54,364
(The staff delivers it himself!)

1212
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:58,094
(Delivering the food placed on the tray...)

1213
00:52:58,494 --> 00:53:00,264
(reminds them of Korean local diners...)

1214
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:01,434
(in traditional markets.)

1215
00:53:02,634 --> 00:53:04,734
- Are we done eating?
- Yes, we are.

1216
00:53:05,074 --> 00:53:07,004
- Na Ra, make the payment.
- Okay.

1217
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:08,774
- Goodness.
- Did you get the receipt?

1218
00:53:08,874 --> 00:53:10,004
Yes, no. Hold on.

1219
00:53:11,014 --> 00:53:13,544
The receipt. How do you say that in Japanese?

1220
00:53:14,684 --> 00:53:15,784
The receipt.

1221
00:53:16,784 --> 00:53:18,954
The receipt, please.

1222
00:53:19,514 --> 00:53:21,324
Just say Korean and make it sound Japanese.

1223
00:53:21,324 --> 00:53:22,484
The receipt?

1224
00:53:23,424 --> 00:53:24,994
(You can speak foreign languages too.)

1225
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:26,854
It works. Confidence is key.

1226
00:53:27,724 --> 00:53:28,964
What is this called in Japanese?

1227
00:53:28,964 --> 00:53:30,164
(Na Ra is curious too.)

1228
00:53:30,164 --> 00:53:31,234
Sorry?

1229
00:53:31,494 --> 00:53:32,934
Ryoshusho.

1230
00:53:32,934 --> 00:53:34,904
- Ryoshusho.
- Ryoshusho.

1231
00:53:34,904 --> 00:53:36,864
- It's really similar.
- See? I told you so.

1232
00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:38,204
Thank you.

1233
00:53:38,204 --> 00:53:39,434
(We enjoyed the food.)

1234
00:53:39,434 --> 00:53:41,274
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1235
00:53:41,744 --> 00:53:43,274
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1236
00:53:43,704 --> 00:53:44,814
Ryoshusho.

1237
00:53:45,574 --> 00:53:46,914
(They feel a lot more at ease after the meal.)

1238
00:53:46,914 --> 00:53:47,944
Okay.

1239
00:53:49,414 --> 00:53:51,714
(It's time to get moving again.)

1240
00:53:52,884 --> 00:53:55,024
We need to drive for two hours.

1241
00:53:55,824 --> 00:53:56,984
That's far.

1242
00:53:57,824 --> 00:54:01,224
(The House's first overseas long-distance driving!)

1243
00:54:01,994 --> 00:54:05,364
(Their destination is 2 hours from Shimonoseki.)

1244
00:54:05,994 --> 00:54:08,534
(Today's front yard!)

1245
00:54:08,764 --> 00:54:09,834
Did you wear your seat belts?

1246
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:10,864
- Yes.
- Seat belts.

1247
00:54:11,074 --> 00:54:12,174
Let's get going.

1248
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:16,474
(They start heading to the front yard.)

1249
00:54:17,344 --> 00:54:18,674
(House on Wheels is reflected on the building windows.)

1250
00:54:18,674 --> 00:54:20,574
- It's quiet and nice.
- Yes.

1251
00:54:20,914 --> 00:54:22,844
The House is rolling.

1252
00:54:24,554 --> 00:54:26,684
Yes. That's the concept of the show.

1253
00:54:26,684 --> 00:54:27,824
(Just like Na Ra, who still finds the House fascinating...)

1254
00:54:28,324 --> 00:54:30,824
(When they are in a standstill for just a minute...)

1255
00:54:32,294 --> 00:54:34,864
(Staring)

1256
00:54:35,024 --> 00:54:37,024
Everyone is looking at our car.

1257
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,334
- Everyone is looking at our House.
- I know, right?

1258
00:54:39,934 --> 00:54:42,264
(Can't take his eyes off of it until the very last moment)

1259
00:54:42,264 --> 00:54:45,974
I think they're more interested because it's really a house,

1260
00:54:45,974 --> 00:54:47,844
- not a normal trailer.
- I think so too.

1261
00:54:48,044 --> 00:54:51,214
It's probably their first time seeing such a car in Japan.

1262
00:54:51,314 --> 00:54:52,514
I'd assume so.

1263
00:54:52,774 --> 00:54:54,384
You wouldn't find it anywhere else in the world either.

1264
00:54:54,384 --> 00:54:56,384
(You wouldn't find it anywhere else in the world either.)

1265
00:54:56,914 --> 00:54:59,984
(The one-and-only House on Wheels...)

1266
00:55:00,954 --> 00:55:02,224
(drives through the downtown of Shimonoseki.)

1267
00:55:02,224 --> 00:55:03,454
Hee Won is a good driver.

1268
00:55:04,724 --> 00:55:09,594
(They enter the highway.)

1269
00:55:09,864 --> 00:55:11,664
At least the highway is pretty wide.

1270
00:55:11,664 --> 00:55:13,564
- The highway is wide.
- Exactly.

1271
00:55:13,864 --> 00:55:14,904
(Exclaiming)

1272
00:55:15,804 --> 00:55:17,534
We're driving at a breakneck speed of 50km per hour.

1273
00:55:20,204 --> 00:55:22,374
We're driving very fast.

1274
00:55:23,274 --> 00:55:28,814
(They drive through the highway with the House.)

1275
00:55:29,114 --> 00:55:30,614
- Hold on.
- You got a call.

1276
00:55:33,554 --> 00:55:34,854
Hello.

1277
00:55:36,024 --> 00:55:37,654
- Hello?
- Hi.

1278
00:55:38,994 --> 00:55:41,064
(The voice sounds rather familiar.)

1279
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:43,424
Tae Goo, did you do it?

1280
00:55:43,724 --> 00:55:46,134
I'm doing it. Hello.

1281
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,294
(Hee Won's close friend and actor, Um Tae Goo)

1282
00:55:47,294 --> 00:55:48,404
Tae Goo.

1283
00:55:49,134 --> 00:55:50,134
(Um Tae Goo)

1284
00:55:50,134 --> 00:55:52,934
- Nice to talk to you.
- You're quite chatty today.

1285
00:55:53,834 --> 00:55:55,944
(He is?)

1286
00:55:56,744 --> 00:55:57,844
(Stuttering)

1287
00:55:57,844 --> 00:56:00,174
Tae Goo, just say it.

1288
00:56:00,544 --> 00:56:03,544
(There's someone else beside Tae Goo?)

1289
00:56:03,544 --> 00:56:05,954
- Hello?
- Hello?

1290
00:56:06,054 --> 00:56:07,824
Hi. Are you sleepy?

1291
00:56:08,124 --> 00:56:09,124
(Laughing)

1292
00:56:09,924 --> 00:56:11,594
- No.
- Then...

1293
00:56:12,094 --> 00:56:13,594
Did you guys get off the plane?

1294
00:56:14,394 --> 00:56:15,664
Come safely.

1295
00:56:16,424 --> 00:56:18,994
- Okay.
- Come safely.

1296
00:56:19,664 --> 00:56:21,104
Okay. See you later.

1297
00:56:21,104 --> 00:56:22,304
- Bye.
- Bye.

1298
00:56:22,664 --> 00:56:25,274
(Looking forward to meeting them)

1299
00:56:26,604 --> 00:56:28,104
Since they have come a long way,

1300
00:56:28,574 --> 00:56:30,574
we should feed them some meat...

1301
00:56:30,574 --> 00:56:32,274
at the very least. Don't you think?

1302
00:56:32,774 --> 00:56:35,084
Will there be a supermarket nearby?

1303
00:56:36,344 --> 00:56:37,544
Michinoseki.

1304
00:56:38,984 --> 00:56:40,954
(What?)

1305
00:56:42,084 --> 00:56:45,024
The campsite we're going to is adjacent to a big supermarket.

1306
00:56:45,024 --> 00:56:46,054
It is?

1307
00:56:46,054 --> 00:56:47,124
That's good.

1308
00:56:47,554 --> 00:56:50,294
- There's a hot spring too.
- That's nice.

1309
00:56:50,294 --> 00:56:52,394
It's really good.

1310
00:56:55,434 --> 00:56:58,234
(What kind of place is it?)

1311
00:56:58,634 --> 00:57:01,344
(Michi no Eki)

1312
00:57:01,344 --> 00:57:03,744
(It means a roadside station.)

1313
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:06,074
(In Japan, there are rest areas...)

1314
00:57:06,074 --> 00:57:07,944
(on national highways!)

1315
00:57:08,414 --> 00:57:10,344
(They're not just normal rest areas for tourists!)

1316
00:57:10,614 --> 00:57:12,654
(On top of basic facilities, )

1317
00:57:12,654 --> 00:57:14,684
(they even have hot springs, swimming pools, and campsites!)

1318
00:57:14,984 --> 00:57:16,924
(Hot spring)

1319
00:57:16,924 --> 00:57:18,594
(Swimming pool)

1320
00:57:19,024 --> 00:57:20,324
(Campsite)

1321
00:57:21,094 --> 00:57:23,894
(A multi-purpose community space which has everything)

1322
00:57:24,794 --> 00:57:26,194
(As of June 13, 2025,)

1323
00:57:26,194 --> 00:57:27,834
(there are 1,230 Michi no Eki in Japan.)

1324
00:57:27,834 --> 00:57:30,804
(All 1,230 Michi no Eki are unique to each other.)

1325
00:57:31,304 --> 00:57:33,434
(For example, an elementary school Michi no Eki)

1326
00:57:33,434 --> 00:57:35,504
(They renovated a closed school, so there are real classrooms.)

1327
00:57:35,504 --> 00:57:37,374
(Even the food is served like that of a school cafeteria.)

1328
00:57:37,674 --> 00:57:40,414
(The spaceship Michi no Eki...)

1329
00:57:40,414 --> 00:57:44,444
(sells space food and space suits!)

1330
00:57:44,684 --> 00:57:46,714
(They sell...)

1331
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:51,194
(local specialties of that particular region!)

1332
00:57:52,024 --> 00:57:54,194
(The farmers' market sells cheap and fresh agro-fishery products.)

1333
00:57:55,094 --> 00:57:57,664
(Even the locals line up before the shop opens.)

1334
00:57:58,134 --> 00:58:00,564
(You must stock this up.)

1335
00:58:00,964 --> 00:58:04,134
(Various town tourist information)

1336
00:58:04,704 --> 00:58:06,204
(The local vibe)

1337
00:58:06,574 --> 00:58:09,174
(Do you want to know about an unfamiliar Japanese town?)

1338
00:58:09,404 --> 00:58:10,844
(This is where you should visit.)

1339
00:58:11,514 --> 00:58:14,614
(The House's front yard today, Michi no Eki)

1340
00:58:14,884 --> 00:58:17,284
(Looking forward to it)

1341
00:58:18,284 --> 00:58:20,354
I can see the sea so clearly.

1342
00:58:22,454 --> 00:58:23,854
It looks like the South Sea.

1343
00:58:24,454 --> 00:58:27,794
Right? It feels like the South Sea.

1344
00:58:29,924 --> 00:58:31,124
It has the South Sea vibe.

1345
00:58:31,124 --> 00:58:32,994
(Emerald-coloured sea)

1346
00:58:36,334 --> 00:58:39,674
(The House drives past it.)

1347
00:58:41,134 --> 00:58:46,274
(They're getting closer to today's front yard.)

1348
00:58:47,044 --> 00:58:49,744
(They enjoy the view and continue driving.)

1349
00:58:50,144 --> 00:58:51,714
Aren't we going to where the signboard points at?

1350
00:58:51,714 --> 00:58:53,654
Yes, it's that way.

1351
00:58:54,354 --> 00:58:55,384
That's it.

1352
00:58:55,384 --> 00:58:57,154
- "Abu Town." - Yes.

1353
00:58:57,154 --> 00:58:59,494
That's the right place.

1354
00:59:05,464 --> 00:59:08,234
(They enter Michi no Eki, the roadside station.)

1355
00:59:08,234 --> 00:59:10,664
You go in here and...

1356
00:59:10,664 --> 00:59:11,674
(You run into a forked road.)

1357
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:12,834
(Campsite, supermarket)

1358
00:59:12,834 --> 00:59:15,244
Are we supposed to go down there?

1359
00:59:15,644 --> 00:59:16,774
This is the place.

1360
00:59:16,774 --> 00:59:19,514
- Yes.
- It's very big.

1361
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,484
(All of this is Michi no Eki.)

1362
00:59:22,584 --> 00:59:24,144
I guess we need to go straight.

1363
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,384
- Straight here?
- Yes.

1364
00:59:25,684 --> 00:59:27,314
It's next to the beach.

1365
00:59:29,724 --> 00:59:33,054
(A train track runs along the coast.)

1366
00:59:34,054 --> 00:59:38,594
(A modest town by the sea, Abu)

1367
00:59:39,364 --> 00:59:42,004
(It's known for its beautiful sunset.)

1368
00:59:42,904 --> 00:59:46,934
(The front yard is famous as a sunset spot.)

1369
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,974
(They drive in excitement.)

1370
00:59:49,974 --> 00:59:52,014
- That's where the road leads to.
- Over there.

1371
00:59:52,014 --> 00:59:53,114
- Over there.
- There.

1372
00:59:57,044 --> 00:59:58,684
(But why do they look...)

1373
00:59:58,684 --> 01:00:00,614
(Blinking)

1374
01:00:01,454 --> 01:00:03,854
It's scorching hot. There's no shade.

1375
01:00:04,924 --> 01:00:05,924
(Laughing in dismay)

1376
01:00:05,924 --> 01:00:07,624
- This...
- Do they want us to die?

1377
01:00:12,064 --> 01:00:13,834
(What's waiting for them...)

1378
01:00:13,834 --> 01:00:17,234
(is a scorching hot campsite.)

1379
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,404
(They drive and drive but can't find any tree or shade.)

1380
01:00:20,404 --> 01:00:21,774
- Go in there.
- Over there.

1381
01:00:21,774 --> 01:00:23,204
- Over there.
- There.

1382
01:00:23,574 --> 01:00:24,574
(They've arrived at the front yard.)

1383
01:00:24,574 --> 01:00:26,644
- Do I stop here? Have we arrived?
- Yes.

1384
01:00:28,444 --> 01:00:33,054
(Still)

1385
01:00:40,224 --> 01:00:41,624
Everything else is fine,

1386
01:00:42,324 --> 01:00:44,964
but a campsite without shade? I don't want to go out.

1387
01:00:44,964 --> 01:00:45,964
Me neither.

1388
01:00:45,964 --> 01:00:48,864
(Current time: 3:20pm)

1389
01:00:48,864 --> 01:00:50,764
What's the temperature? It's 33°C.

1390
01:00:50,764 --> 01:00:51,774
Yes.

1391
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:54,604
(It's 33°C outside, and it feels like 38°C.)

1392
01:00:58,814 --> 01:01:01,544
Call Tae Goo and tell him to come over after sunset.

1393
01:01:02,714 --> 01:01:04,544
- Tell him to go back?
- We may be his seniors,

1394
01:01:04,544 --> 01:01:05,814
but he might grab us by the collar if he comes now.

1395
01:01:06,054 --> 01:01:07,784
- By the way, - Can we...

1396
01:01:07,784 --> 01:01:10,184
we're really just staying in here instead of getting out, aren't we?

1397
01:01:10,184 --> 01:01:11,954
Shall we go out? Let's muster up our courage.

1398
01:01:12,054 --> 01:01:13,224
Muster up our courage?

1399
01:01:13,424 --> 01:01:15,724
I'm out.

1400
01:01:16,694 --> 01:01:18,834
My gosh. It's hot.

1401
01:01:18,934 --> 01:01:20,034
- Goodness.
- It's hot.

1402
01:01:20,694 --> 01:01:23,764
- My neck.
- We're at a Japanese campsite.

1403
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:25,204
(Three of them finally step outside.)

1404
01:01:25,674 --> 01:01:27,674
(She opens the House door first.)

1405
01:01:28,674 --> 01:01:29,674
(Shocked)

1406
01:01:29,874 --> 01:01:31,644
It's no joke.

1407
01:01:31,644 --> 01:01:33,674
Isn't it like a sauna in there?

1408
01:01:34,574 --> 01:01:36,884
(The heat makes her hold her breath.)

1409
01:01:37,744 --> 01:01:39,484
- It's hot.
- It's hot, isn't it?

1410
01:01:39,814 --> 01:01:41,284
Are the chairs here?

1411
01:01:43,154 --> 01:01:44,654
(Sticky)

1412
01:01:44,654 --> 01:01:46,724
They're all sticky.

1413
01:01:47,324 --> 01:01:48,564
Like this.

1414
01:01:48,564 --> 01:01:50,124
(They just unfolded a chair each.)

1415
01:01:53,434 --> 01:01:55,834
(Sweating buckets)

1416
01:01:55,834 --> 01:01:56,904
This...

1417
01:01:56,904 --> 01:01:59,834
(She can't even wear her bandana properly because of the heat.)

1418
01:02:00,874 --> 01:02:01,944
(This won't do.)

1419
01:02:01,944 --> 01:02:02,974
What's this?

1420
01:02:02,974 --> 01:02:04,914
Let's leave this place quickly.

1421
01:02:05,674 --> 01:02:07,274
- Let it cool down.
- Okay.

1422
01:02:07,274 --> 01:02:09,114
He's this close to passing out.

1423
01:02:09,114 --> 01:02:10,284
- It's hot.
- Yes.

1424
01:02:10,384 --> 01:02:13,114
Let's wait until the sun sets a bit.

1425
01:02:13,114 --> 01:02:14,824
- Let's go buy groceries.
- The farmers' market...

1426
01:02:15,024 --> 01:02:16,684
will have nothing left if we're late.

1427
01:02:16,684 --> 01:02:18,494
Let's go grocery shopping first and wait until the sun sets.

1428
01:02:18,494 --> 01:02:19,794
- Okay.
- What do you think, Hee Won?

1429
01:02:19,794 --> 01:02:21,094
- I like that.
- That sounds good.

1430
01:02:21,094 --> 01:02:23,424
We always use this.

1431
01:02:23,424 --> 01:02:24,424
(Taking out the grocery cart, the present from IU)

1432
01:02:25,134 --> 01:02:26,894
Let's go quickly and stay there until they close...

1433
01:02:26,894 --> 01:02:28,264
since it's cool inside the market.

1434
01:02:28,834 --> 01:02:30,564
Just stay there and act like we're buying something.

1435
01:02:31,364 --> 01:02:34,504
(To escape from the killer heat, )

1436
01:02:35,074 --> 01:02:37,244
(they enter the supermarket of Michi no Eki.)

1437
01:02:37,974 --> 01:02:39,544
(Amazed)

1438
01:02:39,944 --> 01:02:42,644
(Amazed by the air-conditioned indoor)

1439
01:02:42,784 --> 01:02:45,054
Watermelons.

1440
01:02:45,914 --> 01:02:47,914
- That...
- Which one?

1441
01:02:47,914 --> 01:02:49,384
- If we slice that...
- Right?

1442
01:02:49,684 --> 01:02:52,424
(Fresh agro-fishery products harvested by the locals)

1443
01:02:52,424 --> 01:02:53,994
It's really nice here.

1444
01:02:53,994 --> 01:02:55,364
(You can buy those products at cheap prices.)

1445
01:02:55,364 --> 01:02:56,424
It's nice.

1446
01:02:56,424 --> 01:02:57,724
(Michi no Eki Market)

1447
01:02:58,164 --> 01:03:01,194
Where's the meat section? Beef.

1448
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,234
Look for beef.

1449
01:03:02,234 --> 01:03:03,664
- That one.
- Four dollars.

1450
01:03:03,664 --> 01:03:04,734
- Right?
- Yes.

1451
01:03:04,734 --> 01:03:06,004
This should be enough, right?

1452
01:03:06,004 --> 01:03:07,704
Of course, more than enough.

1453
01:03:07,704 --> 01:03:09,544
Their lettuce is fresh.

1454
01:03:09,544 --> 01:03:11,714
- It's big and fresh.
- The peaches are so big.

1455
01:03:11,714 --> 01:03:13,474
- They have everything.
- Yes.

1456
01:03:13,474 --> 01:03:14,574
(They buy in abundance, and it's still cheaper than supermarkets.)

1457
01:03:15,444 --> 01:03:17,614
(It's our House's Michi no Eki Market.)

1458
01:03:17,614 --> 01:03:19,614
Thank you.

1459
01:03:20,014 --> 01:03:22,254
(They finish their grocery shopping in a flash.)

1460
01:03:23,184 --> 01:03:27,924
(We finished too fast.)

1461
01:03:28,964 --> 01:03:32,664
(Current time: 4pm)

1462
01:03:35,204 --> 01:03:37,564
(Where are...)

1463
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:39,304
(the members?)

1464
01:03:39,574 --> 01:03:40,804
- This?
- Yes.

1465
01:03:41,434 --> 01:03:42,474
Okay.

1466
01:03:42,904 --> 01:03:45,944
Their coffee is good too. They're famous for it.

1467
01:03:45,944 --> 01:03:48,214
(This cafe is...)

1468
01:03:48,214 --> 01:03:49,214
(Farmers' market, cafe, the House)

1469
01:03:49,214 --> 01:03:53,054
(Michi no Eki Cafe right next to the House)

1470
01:03:53,354 --> 01:03:54,554
If you convert the currency?

1471
01:03:54,554 --> 01:03:55,624
(They take their seats.)

1472
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:57,184
- If this is 500 yen, - It's 5 dollars.

1473
01:03:57,184 --> 01:03:58,694
- it's five dollars.
- Yes.

1474
01:03:59,624 --> 01:04:01,624
This is 1 yen, so it's 0.01 dollars.

1475
01:04:02,094 --> 01:04:03,794
(Wind blowing)

1476
01:04:03,794 --> 01:04:04,824
Eight dollars.

1477
01:04:04,824 --> 01:04:06,134
(The sound of cool air conditioner)

1478
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,864
It's 8.50 dollars.

1479
01:04:07,864 --> 01:04:11,104
Na Ra is very good at organising things.

1480
01:04:11,934 --> 01:04:14,944
Na Ra, do you put money into instalment savings,

1481
01:04:14,944 --> 01:04:15,944
or...

1482
01:04:16,544 --> 01:04:18,104
Both deposit and instalment savings.

1483
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,174
Really?

1484
01:04:19,514 --> 01:04:20,874
(They check each other's investment preferences.)

1485
01:04:20,874 --> 01:04:22,584
Who does the investments, you or your husband?

1486
01:04:22,584 --> 01:04:24,144
- We don't do investments.
- Really?

1487
01:04:24,144 --> 01:04:26,254
Yes. I've never done investments.

1488
01:04:26,254 --> 01:04:27,254
- Really?
- Yes.

1489
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:30,624
Na Ra isn't the type to waste money.

1490
01:04:30,984 --> 01:04:32,724
She doesn't spend easily.

1491
01:04:32,724 --> 01:04:33,854
- You're right.
- Right?

1492
01:04:33,854 --> 01:04:34,964
Yes. I really don't spend easily.

1493
01:04:34,964 --> 01:04:39,594
Only after I got in my mid-40s,

1494
01:04:39,894 --> 01:04:44,264
I bought an expensive watch and stuff.

1495
01:04:44,364 --> 01:04:47,474
- I felt really proud of myself.
- Really?

1496
01:04:48,004 --> 01:04:50,174
This is why I always say...

1497
01:04:50,174 --> 01:04:51,944
you should reward yourself.

1498
01:04:52,644 --> 01:04:55,444
- My gosh.
- Thank you.

1499
01:04:55,784 --> 01:04:57,884
(Sipping)

1500
01:04:59,184 --> 01:05:01,114
(Freezing)

1501
01:05:02,324 --> 01:05:05,454
It's very stimulating and clean.

1502
01:05:05,894 --> 01:05:07,324
(Sipping)

1503
01:05:07,324 --> 01:05:10,864
It's perfect for quenching your thirst.

1504
01:05:10,964 --> 01:05:12,194
My gosh.

1505
01:05:12,464 --> 01:05:15,264
(While the three siblings cool down with cold drinks...)

1506
01:05:15,904 --> 01:05:17,704
- Would you like one?
- Yes.

1507
01:05:17,704 --> 01:05:18,734
(Guest Tae Goo and the cheerful girl visits a convenience store...)

1508
01:05:18,734 --> 01:05:19,774
(to buy housewarming presents.)

1509
01:05:19,774 --> 01:05:21,274
This is very famous.

1510
01:05:22,444 --> 01:05:23,704
Really? It's my first time seeing it.

1511
01:05:23,804 --> 01:05:24,844
This is very famous.

1512
01:05:24,844 --> 01:05:25,874
(Starting with the very famous pudding...)

1513
01:05:25,874 --> 01:05:28,414
There's this famous ice cream.

1514
01:05:28,744 --> 01:05:30,144
This is famous.

1515
01:05:30,144 --> 01:05:33,054
(She's using the housewarming as an excuse to buy stuff she wants.)

1516
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:37,384
What snacks do you think they'd like?

1517
01:05:38,724 --> 01:05:39,754
Old snacks?

1518
01:05:39,754 --> 01:05:41,324
(Laughing)

1519
01:05:42,124 --> 01:05:43,594
(Laughing)

1520
01:05:43,594 --> 01:05:45,334
They like new snacks too.

1521
01:05:45,434 --> 01:05:47,964
Really? My mom only likes old shrimp snacks and stuff.

1522
01:05:48,604 --> 01:05:50,504
(She buys shrimp snacks to suit the members' taste.)

1523
01:05:50,504 --> 01:05:52,134
- It might be better...
- Right?

1524
01:05:52,134 --> 01:05:53,204
because...

1525
01:05:54,674 --> 01:05:55,774
Let's follow this road.

1526
01:05:55,774 --> 01:05:57,074
(After convenience store shopping, they arrive at the front yard.)

1527
01:05:58,644 --> 01:06:00,444
Are they inside?

1528
01:06:00,444 --> 01:06:02,644
- I think they're over there.
- Where?

1529
01:06:03,044 --> 01:06:05,114
Shall we go back to the market?

1530
01:06:05,114 --> 01:06:06,114
Now...

1531
01:06:06,114 --> 01:06:08,424
(They're still thinking of ways to avoid the heat.)

1532
01:06:09,254 --> 01:06:10,424
I'm feeling nervous.

1533
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:12,554
I'm not nervous at all.

1534
01:06:12,554 --> 01:06:14,754
Don't lie. Am I the only one who's nervous?

1535
01:06:15,094 --> 01:06:18,064
(They approach the three members with pounding hearts.)

1536
01:06:18,594 --> 01:06:21,134
(They flew across the ocean to Japan.)

1537
01:06:21,634 --> 01:06:23,804
(Today's special first guests)

1538
01:06:24,149 --> 01:06:25,209
Am I the only one who's nervous?

1539
01:06:25,209 --> 01:06:28,479
(They approach the three members with pounding hearts.)

1540
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:31,719
(They flew across the ocean to Japan.)

1541
01:06:32,059 --> 01:06:35,059
(Today's special first guests)

1542
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:37,629
There are bicycles, Tae Goo.

1543
01:06:38,629 --> 01:06:39,729
- Can we rent...
- I see.

1544
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,899
(Shin Eun Soo, Um Tae Goo)

1545
01:06:43,329 --> 01:06:46,269
(The curly-haired girl in the movie "Love Untangled")

1546
01:06:46,699 --> 01:06:48,739
(The high school student who comes to the light shop...)

1547
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:50,569
(every day in the drama "Light Shop")

1548
01:06:51,409 --> 01:06:52,979
(Shin Eun Soo has grown from a child actress...)

1549
01:06:52,979 --> 01:06:54,579
(into an adult actress.)

1550
01:06:55,279 --> 01:06:57,449
(His natural intense stares...)

1551
01:06:58,209 --> 01:07:00,149
(makes him look strong on the outside, )

1552
01:07:00,919 --> 01:07:04,049
(but he's a very shy introvert.)

1553
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:05,759
(Scratching his head)

1554
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:07,689
(Feeling shy)

1555
01:07:08,089 --> 01:07:10,089
(He subtly shows off his quiet charms.)

1556
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,229
(Revisiting House on Wheels: Beyond the Ocean as a guest, )

1557
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:13,259
(Um Tae Goo)

1558
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:14,959
(And)

1559
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:21,569
(Hee Won turned from being an actor to a director...)

1560
01:07:21,569 --> 01:07:23,569
(in the drama "Light House.")

1561
01:07:24,009 --> 01:07:26,709
(His debut as a director)

1562
01:07:26,739 --> 01:07:28,579
(Eun Soo)

1563
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:30,909
(The two of them worked on the drama as actors.)

1564
01:07:30,909 --> 01:07:34,079
(Tae Goo)

1565
01:07:34,479 --> 01:07:37,149
(I miss Hee Won today.)

1566
01:07:38,219 --> 01:07:41,219
(They flew across the ocean for their best friend.)

1567
01:07:41,759 --> 01:07:44,529
(Hee Won's good friends, Um Tae Goo and Shin Eun Soo)

1568
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:47,799
He's over there.

1569
01:07:47,799 --> 01:07:50,169
(Where?)

1570
01:07:50,269 --> 01:07:52,099
(Glancing)

1571
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:53,239
Tae Goo is here.

1572
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:55,439
- He's here.
- Is he?

1573
01:07:55,539 --> 01:07:57,739
- Tae Goo is here.
- He's here.

1574
01:07:57,739 --> 01:07:58,739
(He recognises him from his silhouette behind the glass door.)

1575
01:08:00,279 --> 01:08:01,379
(Welcoming them with open arms)

1576
01:08:01,379 --> 01:08:02,379
Hello.

1577
01:08:02,979 --> 01:08:04,909
- Hello.
- Hello.

1578
01:08:04,909 --> 01:08:06,319
We didn't come empty-handed.

1579
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,889
You really didn't. They sell this here too.

1580
01:08:09,649 --> 01:08:11,019
Nice to meet you.

1581
01:08:11,019 --> 01:08:12,049
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

1582
01:08:12,049 --> 01:08:13,519
I heard a high and loud voice.

1583
01:08:13,919 --> 01:08:14,919
You're here.

1584
01:08:14,919 --> 01:08:16,159
(Tae Goo is here.)

1585
01:08:16,629 --> 01:08:18,259
- Take a seat first.
- Eun Soo.

1586
01:08:18,259 --> 01:08:19,629
- Hello.
- Come here.

1587
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:20,659
(Friendly)

1588
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:23,169
- Just now...
- Thank you for coming.

1589
01:08:23,169 --> 01:08:24,299
- Thank you for coming.
- It's nothing.

1590
01:08:25,639 --> 01:08:26,869
By the way...

1591
01:08:27,739 --> 01:08:29,539
They're my real best friends.

1592
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:31,769
They came all the way to Japan.

1593
01:08:31,869 --> 01:08:33,539
- Right.
- That's not easy to do,

1594
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:34,639
but they still came.

1595
01:08:36,009 --> 01:08:37,609
(Glancing)

1596
01:08:38,879 --> 01:08:40,549
- I should take a photo.
- What was first?

1597
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:42,789
(Na Ra takes a photo of the drink menu for the guests.)

1598
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:44,849
(Taking a photo of the menu)

1599
01:08:44,849 --> 01:08:46,789
(Walking back fast)

1600
01:08:47,689 --> 01:08:49,329
Thank you. Amazing.

1601
01:08:50,789 --> 01:08:53,959
I will have that drink, the blue drink.

1602
01:08:53,959 --> 01:08:55,999
- The blue drink.
- I will have the watermelon.

1603
01:08:55,999 --> 01:08:56,999
- Watermelon.
- Yes.

1604
01:08:57,469 --> 01:08:59,869
Watermelon and blue lemonade.

1605
01:09:01,299 --> 01:09:03,639
Let Tae Goo order. Let's see how Tae Goo handles it.

1606
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,439
- Na Ra, let him do it.
- Me?

1607
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:06,609
- Should I give him money?
- Just give him money.

1608
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,809
You go and do it.

1609
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:10,609
Try.

1610
01:09:12,049 --> 01:09:13,119
(He seems to give up.)

1611
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:15,219
- Ask for the blue drink.
- Ask for the blue drink.

1612
01:09:15,689 --> 01:09:17,549
(Awkward)

1613
01:09:17,949 --> 01:09:20,589
(Whispering)

1614
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:23,029
It's that easy?

1615
01:09:23,129 --> 01:09:24,159
It's easy.

1616
01:09:24,629 --> 01:09:26,629
He's well-travelled.

1617
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:29,069
- Where has he been?
- That I don't know.

1618
01:09:31,999 --> 01:09:33,869
(Tae Goo's been to many countries.)

1619
01:09:34,469 --> 01:09:36,669
- Watermelon?
- This one, please.

1620
01:09:37,509 --> 01:09:40,039
And this one. Yes.

1621
01:09:42,009 --> 01:09:43,179
Thank you.

1622
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,679
(Speaking only Korean)

1623
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:48,519
(He elegantly completes the order mission.)

1624
01:09:48,819 --> 01:09:50,519
(Good job, Tae Goo.)

1625
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,619
Thank you.

1626
01:09:52,459 --> 01:09:55,629
Tae Goo, Eun Soo, did you get on the same flight?

1627
01:09:55,729 --> 01:09:56,729
- We did.
- I see.

1628
01:09:56,989 --> 01:09:59,929
You had to travel far by car even after landing, right?

1629
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,959
- Right.
- It was quite far.

1630
01:10:05,799 --> 01:10:09,469
Goodness. Didn't you feel frustrated by Tae Goo?

1631
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,039
Tae Goo?

1632
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:13,579
You forget how to speak when you stay with him for a few days.

1633
01:10:14,539 --> 01:10:15,979
He is quite chatty though.

1634
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:17,049
- Tae Goo?
- Yes.

1635
01:10:17,509 --> 01:10:20,849
We talked nonstop on the way here.

1636
01:10:21,349 --> 01:10:24,049
(Dong Il is shocked.)

1637
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:25,689
It's different from what you said.

1638
01:10:27,559 --> 01:10:29,989
Did YouTube make you chatty?

1639
01:10:30,489 --> 01:10:32,399
- I heard you are on YouTube now.
- Yes.

1640
01:10:36,269 --> 01:10:39,169
(He now hosts a YouTube channel.)

1641
01:10:39,839 --> 01:10:43,339
(He’s a hotshot social butterfly!)

1642
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,309
(Did that make him chattier?)

1643
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:47,609
Thank you.

1644
01:10:47,709 --> 01:10:51,179
He appeared on my YouTube channel.

1645
01:10:51,949 --> 01:10:55,549
When Tae Goo asked, I went without hesitation.

1646
01:10:55,749 --> 01:10:58,149
You two have always gotten along so well.

1647
01:10:58,749 --> 01:11:00,219
- When Tae Goo asks, - Even if he didn't ask,

1648
01:11:00,219 --> 01:11:02,119
- I would go anytime.
- you would still do it.

1649
01:11:02,589 --> 01:11:06,599
Eun Soo is almost my daughter.

1650
01:11:06,859 --> 01:11:11,269
She used to be a minor, but now she's all grown-up.

1651
01:11:11,929 --> 01:11:12,999
Right.

1652
01:11:13,539 --> 01:11:16,309
Eun Soo...

1653
01:11:17,409 --> 01:11:22,079
There's an episode I remember.

1654
01:11:22,549 --> 01:11:23,549
What?

1655
01:11:23,549 --> 01:11:25,609
She had to cry for a scene.

1656
01:11:26,179 --> 01:11:28,919
- Gosh.
- She was crying.

1657
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:32,519
But I thought it looked...

1658
01:11:32,519 --> 01:11:34,019
too fake.

1659
01:11:34,019 --> 01:11:36,159
So I said to her, "Why are you faking it?"

1660
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:39,199
And she said it was tough if she cried for real.

1661
01:11:39,799 --> 01:11:42,829
So I said to her, "Still, an actor needs to cry for real."

1662
01:11:43,429 --> 01:11:46,599
She cried for real then.

1663
01:11:46,599 --> 01:11:48,469
I told her she was great.

1664
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:52,239
And she said it was tough because she cried for real.

1665
01:11:53,879 --> 01:11:55,309
I don't know now.

1666
01:11:59,519 --> 01:12:03,949
(It's hard when I cry for real!)

1667
01:12:03,949 --> 01:12:05,349
She cried for real.

1668
01:12:05,549 --> 01:12:08,819
- That made me realise...
- I...

1669
01:12:09,089 --> 01:12:12,329
that she is a real actor.

1670
01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:15,229
She knew how hard it is to act.

1671
01:12:15,329 --> 01:12:18,729
She was different.

1672
01:12:18,729 --> 01:12:21,139
(To Hee Won's eyes, Eun Soo was different.)

1673
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:23,639
(Glancing)

1674
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,569
How many times have you been to Japan?

1675
01:12:25,569 --> 01:12:27,409
- This is my 3rd visit.
- It's your 3rd visit.

1676
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:28,409
Yes.

1677
01:12:28,409 --> 01:12:32,419
But isn't it rare to come all the way to this part of Japan?

1678
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:34,619
- Right.
- No matter how often you come...

1679
01:12:34,619 --> 01:12:36,349
- to Japan, you don't come here.
- Right.

1680
01:12:36,589 --> 01:12:38,689
Tae Goo was really sorry.

1681
01:12:38,689 --> 01:12:39,719
Why?

1682
01:12:40,119 --> 01:12:41,159
About what?

1683
01:12:41,519 --> 01:12:42,759
Why was he sorry?

1684
01:12:42,889 --> 01:12:43,889
(Hesitating)

1685
01:12:43,889 --> 01:12:46,159
He thought he was going to Hokkaido.

1686
01:12:47,259 --> 01:12:48,329
(Oh, dear.)

1687
01:12:48,329 --> 01:12:49,699
But he ended up coming here.

1688
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:54,069
He thought he came here because of my schedule.

1689
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:55,809
So he kept telling me how sorry he was about it.

1690
01:12:55,809 --> 01:12:57,209
(That's not it.)

1691
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,539
He did a lot of research on Hokkaido.

1692
01:12:59,539 --> 01:13:02,409
- He thought he was going there.
- Oh, dear.

1693
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:06,019
(It's okay.)

1694
01:13:06,019 --> 01:13:09,289
(We've got Hee Won Tour.)

1695
01:13:09,289 --> 01:13:11,489
Hokkaido is...

1696
01:13:11,589 --> 01:13:13,919
- It's okay.
- Just think you're in Hokkaido.

1697
01:13:15,489 --> 01:13:17,329
It's less than 20°C.

1698
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:19,499
Just think you're in Hokkaido.

1699
01:13:19,899 --> 01:13:22,359
You thought you were going to Hokkaido, so you dressed warmly.

1700
01:13:23,229 --> 01:13:24,769
- I did too.
- Long sleeves. You too?

1701
01:13:24,769 --> 01:13:25,769
And I wore black.

1702
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:26,839
(Happily wearing black)

1703
01:13:26,839 --> 01:13:29,569
- You're wearing long sleeves.
- She covered her hands too.

1704
01:13:29,569 --> 01:13:30,569
(She even covered her hands to prepare for Hokkaido.)

1705
01:13:30,569 --> 01:13:31,609
I didn't want to get sunburnt.

1706
01:13:31,609 --> 01:13:33,209
- You won't get burnt.
- Right?

1707
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:36,409
It's like what you wear to harvest corn or chilli.

1708
01:13:36,509 --> 01:13:39,009
No, this is a cool outfit though.

1709
01:13:39,009 --> 01:13:41,219
- Is it?
- This is my style.

1710
01:13:41,879 --> 01:13:43,249
(Cute)

1711
01:13:43,449 --> 01:13:47,089
A chic adult.

1712
01:13:47,659 --> 01:13:49,529
- You're chic now?
- Adult.

1713
01:13:49,729 --> 01:13:51,689
- Am I not chic?
- You are very chic.

1714
01:13:51,689 --> 01:13:53,299
- When I don't speak.
- Yes.

1715
01:13:54,059 --> 01:13:55,659
You are chic even when you speak.

1716
01:13:57,629 --> 01:14:00,099
- Thank you.
- You aspire to be chic then.

1717
01:14:00,439 --> 01:14:03,369
I totally aspire it. I want to be cool.

1718
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:05,939
I got my hair and makeup done.

1719
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:07,009
You did too?

1720
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:09,909
We both did.

1721
01:14:12,279 --> 01:14:14,879
This is the chicest he's ever looked to me.

1722
01:14:16,349 --> 01:14:18,049
He's never looked better. He looks intellectual.

1723
01:14:18,049 --> 01:14:19,189
Tae Goo is handsome, you know.

1724
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:23,359
You look much more handsome in person...

1725
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:25,859
than you did on screen.

1726
01:14:25,959 --> 01:14:28,959
- I...
- I've been her fan...

1727
01:14:29,169 --> 01:14:30,399
since I was young.

1728
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:32,329
- Since when?
- What year were you born?

1729
01:14:32,329 --> 01:14:33,469
I was born in 1983.

1730
01:14:34,899 --> 01:14:37,039
- You're older, right?
- I was born in 1981.

1731
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:38,539
Right. She's older.

1732
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:41,009
- You're younger than Na Ra?
- I am.

1733
01:14:42,379 --> 01:14:45,349
- If she didn't get married...
- Na Ra looks...

1734
01:14:45,349 --> 01:14:46,579
- so young for her age.
- She does.

1735
01:14:47,019 --> 01:14:49,719
On the way here, we watched a clip together.

1736
01:14:50,389 --> 01:14:53,219
"Successful Story of a Bright Girl."

1737
01:14:53,219 --> 01:14:55,689
Oh, dear. You watched that?

1738
01:14:56,189 --> 01:14:57,489
She hasn't changed.

1739
01:14:57,529 --> 01:14:58,689
She's got a lot of anger. Be careful.

1740
01:14:58,689 --> 01:14:59,699
Really?

1741
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:01,699
- No, that's not true.
- Be careful...

1742
01:15:01,699 --> 01:15:03,199
- until you leave tomorrow.
- I am not the angry type.

1743
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,499
Be careful. Don't mistreat her.

1744
01:15:04,499 --> 01:15:06,939
She hasn't changed a bit.

1745
01:15:07,899 --> 01:15:10,269
- You said you brought something.
- Yes.

1746
01:15:10,269 --> 01:15:11,369
(She gives them the housewarming gift.)

1747
01:15:11,369 --> 01:15:12,469
I bought these.

1748
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:16,579
There's something I really want you to try.

1749
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:19,179
The first one is this.

1750
01:15:19,179 --> 01:15:20,249
(The dessert lover is tempted.)

1751
01:15:20,919 --> 01:15:22,719
This is the mochi roll.

1752
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:25,249
This is very popular.

1753
01:15:25,349 --> 01:15:27,419
- But we need to have dinner.
- Gen Zs...

1754
01:15:27,419 --> 01:15:29,489
know these things well.

1755
01:15:29,489 --> 01:15:31,189
This is called...

1756
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:32,659
(Gen Z Eun Soo's 1st choice is...)

1757
01:15:32,659 --> 01:15:33,899
It's mochi cream bread.

1758
01:15:33,999 --> 01:15:37,399
And snacks. This potato snack is really good too.

1759
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:38,969
- I like this snack.
- That looks good.

1760
01:15:38,969 --> 01:15:40,399
There's pudding too.

1761
01:15:40,499 --> 01:15:42,169
This is really popular too.

1762
01:15:42,269 --> 01:15:43,809
- This is really popular.
- Yes.

1763
01:15:43,809 --> 01:15:45,309
(It's a collection of all things Na Ra loves.)

1764
01:15:45,309 --> 01:15:47,339
- Look at this.
- That looks so good.

1765
01:15:47,339 --> 01:15:48,409
What?

1766
01:15:49,249 --> 01:15:52,879
(He gets permission from the cafe owner.)

1767
01:15:52,879 --> 01:15:54,449
- Let's dig in.
- We will...

1768
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:55,679
try these.

1769
01:15:56,149 --> 01:15:57,849
(She goes for Eun Soo's 1st choice, the cream bread.)

1770
01:15:57,849 --> 01:15:58,849
(Surprised)

1771
01:15:58,849 --> 01:16:01,119
The cream is bouncy.

1772
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:03,989
(Did I tilt my head back too much?)

1773
01:16:03,989 --> 01:16:05,059
This is good.

1774
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:07,499
It's good, isn't it?

1775
01:16:07,499 --> 01:16:08,859
It's really good.

1776
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,369
- This is amazing.
- You will really like this one too.

1777
01:16:11,369 --> 01:16:13,199
- This is crazy.
- It's really good, isn't it?

1778
01:16:14,739 --> 01:16:16,939
- It's good, isn't it?
- It's good.

1779
01:16:17,069 --> 01:16:19,539
The cream inside is bouncy.

1780
01:16:19,639 --> 01:16:21,879
(He pops it into his mouth.)

1781
01:16:22,179 --> 01:16:24,949
- The cream is so good.
- I know.

1782
01:16:25,549 --> 01:16:27,279
The cream isn't overly sweet.

1783
01:16:27,879 --> 01:16:28,879
(Glancing)

1784
01:16:30,889 --> 01:16:31,889
(Tae Goo gets up.)

1785
01:16:31,889 --> 01:16:33,359
(Walking carefully)

1786
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:35,059
Napkin, please.

1787
01:16:36,729 --> 01:16:38,759
(He picks them one by one.)

1788
01:16:39,399 --> 01:16:40,929
(Thank you.)

1789
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:43,829
(He got wet tissue for the family.)

1790
01:16:44,069 --> 01:16:45,099
(He opens it.)

1791
01:16:45,099 --> 01:16:46,469
You picked the good ones.

1792
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:47,739
- Did I?
- Yes.

1793
01:16:48,169 --> 01:16:49,809
(He opens each one and hands it.)

1794
01:16:49,809 --> 01:16:51,209
Thank you.

1795
01:16:51,209 --> 01:16:52,939
- Tae Goo is so attentive.
- I know.

1796
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:55,609
You can open it yourself.

1797
01:16:56,379 --> 01:16:57,449
Thank you.

1798
01:16:58,209 --> 01:16:59,279
Why didn't he open it for me?

1799
01:17:00,619 --> 01:17:02,249
It's so good.

1800
01:17:02,249 --> 01:17:03,649
(Leaving the aftertaste of dessert behind…)

1801
01:17:03,649 --> 01:17:06,089
Can you work in that outfit?

1802
01:17:06,189 --> 01:17:07,789
- Yes. It's okay.
- Is it?

1803
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:10,789
(Work?)

1804
01:17:11,629 --> 01:17:13,599
- Do you want to get changed?
- Yes.

1805
01:17:13,999 --> 01:17:15,999
You looked nice when you came in, so it's okay.

1806
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:17,299
- I'm satisfied.
- Right?

1807
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,669
- Nice.
- You looked stylish.

1808
01:17:18,669 --> 01:17:20,439
- Yes.
- Change into the work outfit.

1809
01:17:20,439 --> 01:17:22,939
- She's adorable.
- Right. Let's go outside...

1810
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:25,309
- and set things up.
- Okay.

1811
01:17:25,609 --> 01:17:30,009
We will have rice and a delicious steak.

1812
01:17:30,209 --> 01:17:31,979
- Sounds great.
- Sounds good.

1813
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:33,019
(While they were cooling down at the cafe, )

1814
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:36,419
(the sun went down.)

1815
01:17:36,949 --> 01:17:38,049
It's in.

1816
01:17:38,049 --> 01:17:39,859
Hee Won, you're an expert now.

1817
01:17:40,819 --> 01:17:41,819
Okay.

1818
01:17:43,129 --> 01:17:47,259
(Dong Il Diner is open!)

1819
01:17:47,259 --> 01:17:48,359
Nice.

1820
01:17:49,469 --> 01:17:52,169
The sun is down, so I'm sweating less now.

1821
01:17:52,169 --> 01:17:53,199
(The Japanese heat is unbelievable.)

1822
01:17:54,939 --> 01:17:59,509
(Blocking sweat with the scarf, in Na Ra style)

1823
01:18:00,109 --> 01:18:03,109
Doesn't it feel cooler? Is it because I changed my outfit?

1824
01:18:03,109 --> 01:18:04,449
- No, it's cooler.
- Right?

1825
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,179
You will get yelled at if you step on the grass.

1826
01:18:10,749 --> 01:18:12,919
(Walking on grass)

1827
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:15,589
- I'm sorry.
- You dropped it!

1828
01:18:15,589 --> 01:18:17,729
- I'm sorry.
- Gosh.

1829
01:18:17,789 --> 01:18:18,859
I'm sorry.

1830
01:18:18,859 --> 01:18:21,459
(He gets mischievous to Eun Soo whenever he gets a chance.)

1831
01:18:21,459 --> 01:18:22,459
What?

1832
01:18:22,629 --> 01:18:25,529
Come on. We don't have time to go around.

1833
01:18:25,729 --> 01:18:27,199
Will we get yelled at? No.

1834
01:18:27,299 --> 01:18:28,899
(Laughing)

1835
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:32,739
(Look!)

1836
01:18:32,739 --> 01:18:34,609
It's our house. So that's how it's attached.

1837
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:35,879
What?

1838
01:18:37,809 --> 01:18:40,179
- It's in.
- Yes.

1839
01:18:40,179 --> 01:18:41,179
(Suddenly, it's like a hardware store?)

1840
01:18:41,319 --> 01:18:42,949
We should get this plate out.

1841
01:18:42,949 --> 01:18:44,289
(They get the plate out too.)

1842
01:18:44,289 --> 01:18:46,359
Gosh, this plate is super heavy.

1843
01:18:49,159 --> 01:18:50,929
(What's the plate that will shock the guests?)

1844
01:18:52,029 --> 01:18:53,799
- Can you handle it alone?
- No, I can't.

1845
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:56,899
(He asks for help quickly.)

1846
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,969
This plate is super heavy.

1847
01:18:59,429 --> 01:19:00,539
There.

1848
01:19:00,539 --> 01:19:02,809
(What will they do with the heavy plate?)

1849
01:19:02,809 --> 01:19:03,939
Watch your hand.

1850
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:05,839
Hello.

1851
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:07,709
You're here.

1852
01:19:09,309 --> 01:19:10,649
Is Eun Soo not here?

1853
01:19:11,449 --> 01:19:13,049
I'm here.

1854
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:15,049
There you were, Eun Soo.

1855
01:19:16,189 --> 01:19:17,419
- I'm sorry.
- Hold it.

1856
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,819
(She transformed into the innocent Eun Soo.)

1857
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:21,659
Okay.

1858
01:19:21,659 --> 01:19:23,489
(Now that the plate is in place, we can see what it is for.)

1859
01:19:23,489 --> 01:19:25,189
- There.
- It's all set, right?

1860
01:19:25,289 --> 01:19:27,599
- It's perfect.
- Perfect.

1861
01:19:27,599 --> 01:19:30,429
I'm sure you can turn the bottom part to adjust.

1862
01:19:31,369 --> 01:19:32,499
We prepared it for you guys.

1863
01:19:33,239 --> 01:19:35,439
Let's move it to the far right. The ground is sunk there.

1864
01:19:35,799 --> 01:19:38,439
Look, the ground is sunken here.

1865
01:19:38,439 --> 01:19:39,679
(It's as heavy as 50kg.)

1866
01:19:40,139 --> 01:19:43,049
- Take a seat. You are a guest. Sit.
- It's okay.

1867
01:19:43,049 --> 01:19:44,479
(Its width is nearly 1 meter.)

1868
01:19:45,109 --> 01:19:46,779
It's a massive griddle.

1869
01:19:46,779 --> 01:19:50,189
It is. This is all we need now.

1870
01:19:50,189 --> 01:19:52,189
- I know.
- We can cook anything.

1871
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:56,389
(Chef Sung's new challenge!)

1872
01:19:57,229 --> 01:20:00,499
(Supersized griddle)

1873
01:20:00,999 --> 01:20:03,229
(From flashy fire show...)

1874
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:05,499
(to the ultimate griddle food, fried rice)

1875
01:20:06,739 --> 01:20:09,369
(From seafood to beef and vegetables, )

1876
01:20:10,569 --> 01:20:14,179
(everything will be reborn on Chef Sung's griddle.)

1877
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:16,809
(The most fundamental dish of all...)

1878
01:20:16,909 --> 01:20:18,949
(is beef teppan steak!)

1879
01:20:19,149 --> 01:20:21,379
There. Let's take a seat.

1880
01:20:21,379 --> 01:20:22,549
It's all ready now.

1881
01:20:22,949 --> 01:20:23,989
We just have to grill the meat.

1882
01:20:24,389 --> 01:20:27,259
- Wait. Go wash the vegetables.
- Okay.

1883
01:20:28,289 --> 01:20:29,989
- Vegetables.
- Vegetables and mushrooms.

1884
01:20:29,989 --> 01:20:31,029
Should we go and wash them?

1885
01:20:31,029 --> 01:20:32,559
- Tae Goo, go with them.
- Okay.

1886
01:20:32,559 --> 01:20:33,599
(Even guests have to help when you're abroad!)

1887
01:20:37,029 --> 01:20:39,369
- It's a house.
- It's a house.

1888
01:20:39,569 --> 01:20:42,069
- Excuse me.
- What?

1889
01:20:42,669 --> 01:20:44,609
It was a two-story house before.

1890
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:49,339
We had to adjust it to match the roads in Japan.

1891
01:20:50,249 --> 01:20:54,019
Shouldn't we give them a house tour first?

1892
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:55,549
No.

1893
01:20:55,549 --> 01:20:56,649
(We didn't do the house tour yet.)

1894
01:20:57,049 --> 01:20:58,089
Since they're here...

1895
01:20:58,089 --> 01:20:59,089
(Taking a peek)

1896
01:20:59,089 --> 01:21:00,359
It became compact.

1897
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:02,389
I love the colour.

1898
01:21:02,959 --> 01:21:04,289
- Right?
- Yes.

1899
01:21:04,589 --> 01:21:05,659
Cabbage.

1900
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:07,259
- Goodness.
- Oh, dear.

1901
01:21:07,259 --> 01:21:08,799
(They want to get inside the House on Wheels.)

1902
01:21:08,799 --> 01:21:10,799
Should we wash all of these?

1903
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:13,369
Can you ask if we need to wash the bean sprouts too?

1904
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:14,899
- Dong Il.
- Yes?

1905
01:21:14,899 --> 01:21:17,609
- Should I wash the bean sprouts?
- Not the bean sprouts.

1906
01:21:17,709 --> 01:21:19,509
- Not the bean sprouts.
- Yes.

1907
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:22,839
- Onion and garlic.
- Take some of it first.

1908
01:21:23,209 --> 01:21:24,949
You should help her.

1909
01:21:25,149 --> 01:21:27,779
We're not washing them here?

1910
01:21:27,779 --> 01:21:29,149
- Are we?
- Should we...

1911
01:21:29,149 --> 01:21:30,149
- wash them here?
- Can we wash them all...

1912
01:21:30,149 --> 01:21:31,949
- here?
- The sink is better there.

1913
01:21:31,949 --> 01:21:33,789
- The sink there is...
- The sink is big there.

1914
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:35,119
- You get one sink each.
- You can use one each.

1915
01:21:35,289 --> 01:21:37,359
- It's nice there.
- They have big sinks.

1916
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:39,529
If you turn the corner, there's water.

1917
01:21:39,529 --> 01:21:41,259
- You see that, right?
- That one?

1918
01:21:41,259 --> 01:21:42,629
- Yes. That's the one.
- Okay.

1919
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:44,169
We will be back.

1920
01:21:46,539 --> 01:21:49,709
We got so lucky. The sun went down...

1921
01:21:49,709 --> 01:21:51,669
- as soon as we came outside.
- It became really cool.

1922
01:21:51,769 --> 01:21:52,809
It must've been really hot earlier.

1923
01:21:52,809 --> 01:21:56,209
It was brutally hot.

1924
01:21:57,049 --> 01:21:58,279
It was brutally hot.

1925
01:21:58,709 --> 01:22:00,279
- It's really hot.
- The scenery is really pretty,

1926
01:22:00,379 --> 01:22:02,649
but the sun is blazing hot.

1927
01:22:03,849 --> 01:22:05,619
There's no shade.

1928
01:22:05,619 --> 01:22:06,719
(No shade)

1929
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:07,719
We're in the middle of the field.

1930
01:22:09,559 --> 01:22:11,489
- Goodness.
- It's bearable now.

1931
01:22:11,489 --> 01:22:12,529
It is.

1932
01:22:17,229 --> 01:22:20,099
It's an open view, so it's quite nice.

1933
01:22:20,099 --> 01:22:21,099
- Yes.
- Yes.

1934
01:22:22,339 --> 01:22:24,109
It's going to be even better when the sun goes down.

1935
01:22:24,109 --> 01:22:25,139
- It is.
- Right?

1936
01:22:25,869 --> 01:22:28,579
I told you. This place is known for sunset.

1937
01:22:28,579 --> 01:22:30,979
Look at that view.

1938
01:22:32,009 --> 01:22:34,579
(The open view...)

1939
01:22:34,579 --> 01:22:37,949
(and a sunset!)

1940
01:22:39,819 --> 01:22:43,589
(Gradually dying the blue sea red, )

1941
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:49,229
(the warm light spreads in the sky.)

1942
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:54,839
(The House on Wheels that was under the scorching sun...)

1943
01:22:55,369 --> 01:22:59,269
(became warm under the sunset light.)

1944
01:23:05,409 --> 01:23:08,849
(The heat wore them out today.)

1945
01:23:08,849 --> 01:23:09,919
It's nice.

1946
01:23:12,349 --> 01:23:14,219
- Isn't the sunset pretty?
- It is.

1947
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:16,829
(The two take a break looking at the sunset.)

1948
01:23:19,029 --> 01:23:21,359
How can the sun be so round?

1949
01:23:21,459 --> 01:23:22,459
I know.

1950
01:23:25,529 --> 01:23:26,799
It's going to hit the mountain.

1951
01:23:29,669 --> 01:23:32,239
It's dropping. Don't go.

1952
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:35,909
(Shy)

1953
01:23:36,409 --> 01:23:37,609
Why did you come back so quickly?

1954
01:23:37,609 --> 01:23:38,949
I came to get something.

1955
01:23:38,949 --> 01:23:40,279
- Get what? A knife?
- Yes.

1956
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:42,319
You need to get a knife to peel the garlic, right?

1957
01:23:42,949 --> 01:23:45,749
I think we need to call them...

1958
01:23:45,749 --> 01:23:47,359
to see the sunset first.

1959
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:49,489
They need to see this first. Let's tell Tae Goo.

1960
01:23:49,489 --> 01:23:50,889
- Okay.
- When he leaves.

1961
01:23:51,989 --> 01:23:53,329
- Tae Goo.
- Yes?

1962
01:23:53,329 --> 01:23:57,999
This place is known for the sunset.

1963
01:23:57,999 --> 01:24:00,999
Don't walk around holding a knife like that! Tae Goo!

1964
01:24:01,969 --> 01:24:03,039
- You frightened me.
- Tae Goo.

1965
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:05,169
Stop washing the vegetables.

1966
01:24:05,169 --> 01:24:06,309
- It's known for the sunset.
- Yes.

1967
01:24:06,309 --> 01:24:07,779
- Come and see the sunset.
- See the sunset.

1968
01:24:07,779 --> 01:24:09,779
Go tell them to look at the sunset.

1969
01:24:10,809 --> 01:24:12,509
- Hide the knife.
- Okay.

1970
01:24:14,019 --> 01:24:15,879
(Putting it down gently)

1971
01:24:15,879 --> 01:24:17,789
- Go tell the girls to come out.
- Should I?

1972
01:24:17,789 --> 01:24:19,019
Sit. I will go tell them.

1973
01:24:19,019 --> 01:24:21,719
- No, I have to go anyway.
- The knife.

1974
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:25,529
Don't hold the knife like that.

1975
01:24:25,529 --> 01:24:27,159
I will turn it around when I get there.

1976
01:24:30,029 --> 01:24:31,869
Why does he look so scary?

1977
01:24:31,869 --> 01:24:34,069
(Running with a knife, he looks frightening.)

1978
01:24:36,169 --> 01:24:38,339
(Holding it gently)

1979
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:41,139
- Here you go, Na Ra.
- Thank you.

1980
01:24:42,509 --> 01:24:43,509
What is it?

1981
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:45,909
They said you should stop and look at the sunset.

1982
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:49,779
(He told them in the most gentle manner.)

1983
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:57,359
It's a shame I don't have my phone. I will just contain it in my eyes.

1984
01:24:58,459 --> 01:25:00,399
The sky is really beautiful.

1985
01:25:01,799 --> 01:25:03,469
It's so beautiful.

1986
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:05,929
The clouds are really beautiful.

1987
01:25:06,599 --> 01:25:09,269
They are so beautiful.

1988
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:12,369
The sky is so beautiful.

1989
01:25:12,369 --> 01:25:15,109
(The sunset gradually beats the Japanese heat.)

1990
01:25:15,109 --> 01:25:16,409
It's so beautiful.

1991
01:25:17,449 --> 01:25:19,679
It's the perfect scenery of Japan.

1992
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:23,319
(They enjoy the view of the town.)

1993
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:26,049
This is amazing. It's better than Hokkaido.

1994
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:31,589
They said you should enjoy the sunset first.

1995
01:25:31,829 --> 01:25:33,599
Do whatever you feel like.

1996
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,599
But it will take too long for the sun to go down completely.

1997
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:38,869
I'm done looking at it.

1998
01:25:39,069 --> 01:25:40,069
Should we get back to washing?

1999
01:25:40,169 --> 01:25:43,069
- Let's look while washing.
- We're done looking at it.

2000
01:25:43,069 --> 01:25:44,109
Sounds great.

2001
01:25:44,109 --> 01:25:45,569
(To cook dinner before the sun goes down, )

2002
01:25:46,409 --> 01:25:48,639
(they need to prepare the vegetables quickly.)

2003
01:25:49,509 --> 01:25:51,249
(Struggling)

2004
01:25:53,579 --> 01:25:55,749
The Japanese vegetables aren't easy to prepare.

2005
01:25:58,219 --> 01:26:00,059
(She gets Tae Goo's help to untie the vegetable.)

2006
01:26:00,059 --> 01:26:01,389
It's wet, that's why.

2007
01:26:01,859 --> 01:26:03,159
It might snap.

2008
01:26:05,289 --> 01:26:07,399
(Breaking)

2009
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:09,659
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you apologising?

2010
01:26:11,469 --> 01:26:13,029
What happened?

2011
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:16,069
He just...

2012
01:26:16,969 --> 01:26:18,069
Goodness.

2013
01:26:18,069 --> 01:26:21,609
(He was trying to help Eun Soo, but he apologised to Na Ra.)

2014
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:24,309
You broke them with the tape.

2015
01:26:25,249 --> 01:26:27,319
Isn't it asparagus?

2016
01:26:27,519 --> 01:26:29,519
- Asparagus murderer.
- It's okay.

2017
01:26:29,519 --> 01:26:30,749
We were going to cut it anyway.

2018
01:26:32,089 --> 01:26:33,759
It's hard.

2019
01:26:33,859 --> 01:26:36,659
- I...
- Did you see the sunset?

2020
01:26:37,489 --> 01:26:38,659
- We did.
- You saw the sunset?

2021
01:26:38,659 --> 01:26:39,659
We did.

2022
01:26:40,429 --> 01:26:43,129
You're working hard to peel the garlic.

2023
01:26:43,129 --> 01:26:44,399
(Trying hard)

2024
01:26:45,699 --> 01:26:48,099
- Some I can peel.
- What?

2025
01:26:48,099 --> 01:26:49,539
- Some I can peel, and some I can't.
- Right.

2026
01:26:49,539 --> 01:26:51,409
- Thank you.
- I will peel the ones I can.

2027
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:55,379
That's done. Wait. This isn't peeled.

2028
01:26:56,379 --> 01:26:58,479
- Did you do what you could do?
- Yes.

2029
01:27:01,179 --> 01:27:02,979
(Did he peel with his fingernails?)

2030
01:27:02,979 --> 01:27:04,049
Thank you.

2031
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:07,289
(Tae Goo helps her diligently.)

2032
01:27:07,289 --> 01:27:08,519
You worked hard.

2033
01:27:12,059 --> 01:27:15,699
(They finished preparing the vegetables before sundown.)

2034
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:19,869
Sit. Sit down and...

2035
01:27:19,869 --> 01:27:21,899
(Dong Il starts cooking on the griddle.)

2036
01:27:21,899 --> 01:27:25,039
I will cook the meat quickly when rice is about to be done.

2037
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:27,139
(Chef Sung's debut griddle cooking begins!)

2038
01:27:27,622 --> 01:27:29,952
(Welcoming guests from overseas)

2039
01:27:29,952 --> 01:27:32,162
(Chef Sung's special)

2040
01:27:32,802 --> 01:27:34,472
You can do anything as long as you have a griddle.

2041
01:27:35,272 --> 01:27:38,242
(Today's special, griddled beef steak)

2042
01:27:38,772 --> 01:27:40,012
(Humming in surprise)

2043
01:27:41,082 --> 01:27:42,112
(It's really delicious.)

2044
01:27:42,442 --> 01:27:44,412
(I feel full from watching you eat.)

2045
01:27:44,512 --> 01:27:45,852
(Shall we eat it all?)

2046
01:27:45,952 --> 01:27:47,352
(No)

2047
01:27:47,452 --> 01:27:48,452
(Exclaiming)

2048
01:27:48,452 --> 01:27:49,452
(My cooking is incredible.)

2049
01:27:50,152 --> 01:27:52,622
(It's their second day in Japan.)

2050
01:27:52,622 --> 01:27:54,092
(Today's trip is...)

2051
01:27:54,962 --> 01:27:57,462
(Hee Won Tour)

2052
01:27:57,762 --> 01:27:59,992
(Hee Won's memories)

2053
01:28:00,402 --> 01:28:03,262
(Hee Won's feelings)

2054
01:28:04,172 --> 01:28:05,832
Dong Il, I've been here before.

2055
01:28:05,832 --> 01:28:06,842
(Everything will be guided...)

2056
01:28:06,842 --> 01:28:07,942
(by Hee Won during today's tour.)

2057
01:28:08,772 --> 01:28:10,712
(Wait, where was it?)

2058
01:28:11,172 --> 01:28:12,642
(We're going to where you've been.)

2059
01:28:12,642 --> 01:28:14,012
(However, it's not perfect.)

2060
01:28:14,412 --> 01:28:17,652
(With Leader Hee Won who's very clumsy)

2061
01:28:17,652 --> 01:28:19,112
(This is all because of you.)

2062
01:28:19,312 --> 01:28:20,722
(A chaotic journey)

2063
01:28:21,822 --> 01:28:23,552
(Scratching)

2064
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:25,052
(Will we be okay today?)
