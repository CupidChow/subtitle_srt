1
00:00:17,906 --> 00:00:20,038
(Sung Dong Il)

2
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:22,297
(Kim Hee Won, Jang Na Ra)

3
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:31,559
It's so pretty.

4
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,729
Oh, my. It's so pretty.

5
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:37,598
It's so pretty.

6
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:39,999
(When the sunset passes through our window)

7
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:43,399
He did tell us to cook after watching the sunset, but...

8
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,069
What would you like...

9
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:48,339
Watching until it fully sets would be a bit...

10
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,609
I think we've watched enough.

11
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:52,009
Should we get going, then?

12
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,148
- First...
- Yes.

13
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:54,978
- Should we take turns?
- We're done.

14
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:56,018
Sounds good.

15
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:57,179
(To prepare dinner before the sun goes down)

16
00:00:57,779 --> 00:01:00,319
(Quickly preparing the vegetables)

17
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,889
(Struggling)

18
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,659
Japanese vegetables. They're not easy to handle.

19
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,898
(Getting Tae Goo's help with the packaging)

20
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:13,199
It's wet...

21
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:14,969
I think it might break.

22
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:19,268
(Crunch!)

23
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:21,339
- I'm sorry.
- What?

24
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:24,839
What happened?

25
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:27,779
Wait...

26
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:29,948
Tae Goo.

27
00:01:29,949 --> 00:01:33,518
(Helping Eun Soo and apologising to Na Ra)

28
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,988
- Along with the tape, - Snap!

29
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:36,189
the heads...

30
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,528
- Isn't that asparagus?
- Yes...

31
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:41,088
Asparagus murderer.

32
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:42,528
We'll cut it anyway.

33
00:01:42,529 --> 00:01:43,799
(Asparagus murderer!)

34
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:51,969
(Thankfully, they finished before the sun set.)

35
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:55,709
You haven't been inside yet, right?

36
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:57,608
I came just up to here.

37
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:59,679
- Come in. It's nice and cool.
- Okay.

38
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:01,718
- Tae Goo.
- Yes?

39
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,419
(You should come in too, Tae Goo.)

40
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:06,818
(Eun Soo finally gets to see the house.)

41
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,919
- It's nice.
- There are cameras all over.

42
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:10,518
Yes, cameras.

43
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:12,388
- Hello.
- Come in. It's nice and cool.

44
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:13,429
Hello.

45
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:15,228
- Good work.
- Thank you.

46
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:16,359
(The super simple house tour is done!)

47
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:18,468
- We washed the rice.
- Yes, the rice.

48
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:21,269
(Putting the washed rice in)

49
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:24,799
- What should we do now?
- Go out and sit.

50
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:26,668
- Can I tie it for you?
- No, I'll do it.

51
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:28,439
- Oh, it's cute!
- Totally.

52
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,408
Who made this?

53
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:32,549
Hyo Jin made this.

54
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,748
Oh, my. Oh, it says here.

55
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:36,479
Yes, that's why I like Hyo Jin.

56
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,388
- There we go. Let's go outside.
- Okay.

57
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:41,289
(House on Wheel's official apron still hasn't changed.)

58
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:45,458
Okay. Sit down.

59
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:47,489
(Dong Il's teppan cooking)

60
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:50,529
(Oh, my!)

61
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:55,969
(It's Dong Il's first time using a large teppan!)

62
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,098
You're saying, "Oh, my" now.

63
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,208
Later, you might say, "Why does it taste like this?"

64
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,079
No. All meat tastes good.

65
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:04,309
- Really?
- Yes.

66
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:06,448
I've been exercising these days.

67
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:08,179
- What kind of exercise?
- I go to the gym.

68
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:10,679
- Really?
- So I need to have protein.

69
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:13,849
You can have a year's worth today.

70
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:15,418
A whole year's worth?

71
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:16,859
- Yes, get a year's worth.
- Okay.

72
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,129
- I'll really fill up.
- Okay.

73
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:23,499
Do some squats.

74
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,529
- Should I do it here?
- Yes.

75
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:29,338
You're so mean.

76
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:31,639
(This newbie gym-goer is shy.)

77
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:34,509
You two really get along well.

78
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,608
We...

79
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:38,979
- Tae Goo is considerate, right?
- Yes.

80
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,508
- Tae Goo...
- Yes.

81
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:41,979
can't say bad things to others.

82
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:43,348
- Wait.
- I can.

83
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,048
He often says bad things to me.

84
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:46,089
- Really?
- Yes.

85
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:49,189
- He's naturally a kind person.
- He is.

86
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,289
I really like Eun Soo.

87
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,758
- Tae Goo. Untie this for me.
- Okay.

88
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,099
(Leaving out key words, he ended up confessing his love.)

89
00:03:58,099 --> 00:03:59,829
- Tie it more tightly.
- Okay.

90
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:05,909
- That's nice.
- Hey.

91
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:08,779
My innards will come out, Tae Goo.

92
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,478
This looks so romantic.

93
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,979
- The two of us?
- Yes.

94
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:14,409
Is this okay?

95
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,949
The male lead on his knees...

96
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,849
Tae Goo. What do you think about me?

97
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,048
We'll eat right away, right?

98
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:23,058
Yes, around the time the rice is done.

99
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:24,419
The meat cooks fast.

100
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:30,899
(Slicing the vegetables before grilling the meat)

101
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:36,169
(Using the teppan as a cutting board to slice vegetables)

102
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,408
(We don't need a cutting board!)

103
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,139
(Chop, chop!)

104
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:45,349
What is it, Na Ra?

105
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:47,649
I want to be able to slice like that.

106
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:53,348
(There's no need to put things on a plate.)

107
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,859
(Just slice and slide to the side.)

108
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:59,259
(Even though time has passed, his skills are still sharp.)

109
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:02,059
(And with a convenient teppan, )

110
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:06,829
(they already have a mountain of vegetables.)

111
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:09,039
Let's see.

112
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:10,698
The meat and...

113
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:12,309
Wait, I don't see the asparagus.

114
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:14,208
The asparagus?

115
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:15,309
It's over there.

116
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:21,049
The asparagus...

117
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,849
They were too long.

118
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:27,419
- Right.
- So they're easy to eat.

119
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:30,719
(Let's say we cut them in half to make them easier to eat!)

120
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:35,398
We're just grilling everything with the meat, right?

121
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,458
This is nice.

122
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:37,459
(Distracting Dong Il)

123
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:42,239
(Here is the asparagus!)

124
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:52,249
(As soon as he sees the asparagus)

125
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:55,349
Oh, these are too small.

126
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,318
(Did... Did we get caught?)

127
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,819
Oh, these are too small.

128
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:07,259
I guess there are thick ones and thin ones.

129
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:09,528
That's the case for all vegetables.

130
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:12,429
(That's the case for all vegetables!)

131
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:14,929
(Of course.)

132
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,299
(Did we not get caught?)

133
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:23,378
(Thankfully, Dong Il is cutting the asparagus.)

134
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:25,848
- They were going to be cut anyway.
- They were.

135
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:26,949
He's cutting them.

136
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,919
- Hey, Tae Goo.
- Yes?

137
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:32,348
Why does the apron tie keep dropping below my butt?

138
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:33,388
(Please tie my apron again!)

139
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:34,789
Would you like me to tie it again?

140
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:37,358
(The asparagus murderer got away with his crime.)

141
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,418
I'll fix it.

142
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:40,129
- You should tie it up here.
- Okay.

143
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,658
That's nice.

144
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,328
(A sigh of relief)

145
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:45,968
I'm hungry.

146
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:48,668
- Me too.
- Right?

147
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:50,399
You must be so hungry.

148
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,739
It's been so long since we last ate.

149
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:55,709
Don't I look like someone working at a local market?

150
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:58,778
Like at a festival, in a food truck...

151
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:00,079
(Gosh. Yes.)

152
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,449
You're like the B-Class Gourmet from "Crayon Shin-chan."

153
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:06,849
- Tae Goo.
- Yes?

154
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:09,788
She said I was the B-Class Gourmet from "Crayon Shin-chan."

155
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:12,258
- Eun Soo!
- That character...

156
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:14,158
- is super cool, Dong Il.
- She loves "Crayon Shin-chan."

157
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:15,159
- "Crayon Shin-chan?" - Yes.

158
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:17,798
He's a character who does teppan cooking.

159
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:19,528
- She can do imitations...
- He's super...

160
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:21,228
- What?
- She can do a perfect imitation...

161
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:22,399
of Shin-chan.

162
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:23,969
An imitation? Show me.

163
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:25,769
Tae Goo!

164
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:27,139
Tae Goo!

165
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:29,209
(Awkwardly moving his arms around)

166
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:31,579
(Shyly walking away after teasing Eun Woo)

167
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,748
- Show me.
- I can do Bo-chan.

168
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:34,809
Bo-chan? Show me.

169
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:37,179
"Shin-chan."

170
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:41,218
- Isn't that Shin-chan?
- This is Bo-chan...

171
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:42,458
- That's Shin-chan.
- Hey.

172
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,688
You said you could do Bo-chan. That's Shin-chan.

173
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:47,959
"Shin-chan." It's slightly different.

174
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:50,558
Go practice behind the house and come back.

175
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:52,569
"Shin-chan."

176
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:54,568
Tae Goo.

177
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:56,539
(Tae Goo!)

178
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:00,968
"Shin-chan."

179
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:04,839
(While she practices hard, )

180
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:07,678
(they finally light up the teppan.)

181
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,749
It's on.

182
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:11,348
(Time to grill the mat on the heated teppan.)

183
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:12,389
It's fully lit.

184
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:20,589
(Starting with Chef Sung's love, butter)

185
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:24,598
It'll really sizzle once the teppan is heated, right?

186
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:25,669
I think so.

187
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:27,698
There we go.

188
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:29,739
(Adding some richness to the vegetables with butter)

189
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:33,208
Oh, my. This meat is nice. We got some nice meat.

190
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:34,409
(This meat is from a direct seller in front of our house.)

191
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,709
Bring over the powder.

192
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:38,138
- The powder?
- Yes, the powder.

193
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:40,179
(Bring over the powder!)

194
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:42,448
Here is the powder.

195
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:43,478
(Powder on the teppan?)

196
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,519
Powder.

197
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:47,718
(They stopped by a cafe to escape the heat.)

198
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:49,588
Oh, this must be salt.

199
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:53,589
(They bought this powder, thinking it was salt.)

200
00:08:57,729 --> 00:09:00,169
It's 99 percent ramyeon powder.

201
00:09:00,469 --> 00:09:02,099
- Really?
- Totally. Try it.

202
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:04,069
It's 99 percent ramyeon powder.

203
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:05,568
(Wait, this flavour!)

204
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:07,509
Right? You can't tell if you have too little.

205
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:10,639
Right? I'm glad I bought this.

206
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,048
Here is the powder.

207
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:15,579
(A.k.a. magic powder)

208
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:16,878
Powder.

209
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,849
(Sprinkling a generous amount on the teppan)

210
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:23,888
Don't you think it's too much?

211
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:26,259
No, the vegetables will release water,

212
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:27,988
so it's okay.

213
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:29,759
- Sprinkle some on here.
- Sprinkle what?

214
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:31,829
- The powder?
- Yes, the powder.

215
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:35,899
(Dong Il places large steaks on the grill.)

216
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:37,569
Oh, my.

217
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:40,568
Just the right amount.

218
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:41,839
(Then, Hee Won shakes some magic powder on top.)

219
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:46,209
(The Hee Won and Dong Il Duo is finally back.)

220
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:50,419
(With the butter's richness and the magic powder's aroma)

221
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:53,189
Oh, I can start to smell it now.

222
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:54,519
Yes. It's nice.

223
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,989
So, it smells good.

224
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:01,488
Since the grill is large,

225
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:02,858
- we can cook everything at once.
- Yes, it's nice.

226
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:03,929
(The smell of the teppan steak wafts into the house!)

227
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,629
- Let's feed them lots of food.
- Okay.

228
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:12,039
(Add some sausages on the side and sprinkle some magic powder, )

229
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:18,509
(and the large teppan is totally full!)

230
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:21,809
That looks yummy.

231
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,118
(The combination of many juicy ingredients)

232
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:28,488
- So neat.
- It's so neat this way, right?

233
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:29,659
(The combination of many juicy ingredients...)

234
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:36,429
(steals her attention.)

235
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:39,999
Oh, I'm so hungry.

236
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:44,138
There's some rosemary next to the plant pot.

237
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:46,438
Please pick some rosemary.

238
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:47,568
- What?
- Rosemary.

239
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:49,008
(There's rosemary by the window!)

240
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,679
Oh, we have plant pots here.

241
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:53,809
We're all about the vibe.

242
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:57,349
This is rosemary, right?

243
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:02,149
Is this rosemary? This is good, right?

244
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,188
This is rosemary, right?

245
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:07,489
(This is rosemary, right?)

246
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:11,099
(Neither of them knows much.)

247
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,429
- Dong Il.
- Yes?

248
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:16,199
- Is this rosemary?
- It is.

249
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,598
Oh, it is rosemary.

250
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:18,599
(It is rosemary!)

251
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,309
Should I rinse this with water?

252
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:23,079
Tae Goo, look at the size.

253
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:25,909
Look. I'm out after using it on three pieces of meat.

254
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,618
Tae Goo. We need more. You need to pick ten times more.

255
00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:32,688
- Okay?
- I'll go get some more.

256
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:34,218
Pick about ten and rinse them.

257
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:36,259
(Now that you know, go pick some!)

258
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,689
Oh, my.

259
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:42,528
(The rosemary gave the food an even richer aroma.)

260
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:43,559
There we go.

261
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,368
- It smells so good.
- Right?

262
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:48,098
(It smells so good.)

263
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:51,238
Dong Il. Are these the scissors to use for cutting meat?

264
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:52,909
- They are.
- I think so.

265
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:54,309
They look strong.

266
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:55,909
They look so scary.

267
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:58,678
Don't put them next to Tae Goo or Hee Won.

268
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,848
(Don't put them next to Tae Goo!)

269
00:12:00,849 --> 00:12:02,679
Even if they use them for nice things, it'll look bad.

270
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:07,089
(The rosemary murderer is working hard in silence...)

271
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:11,789
Rosemary?

272
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:14,158
I feel like I'm picking weeds.

273
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,559
(I feel like I'm picking weeds.)

274
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:23,039
(Tae Goo worked hard to pick some rosemary.)

275
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:26,539
Dong Il. Do we eat the rosemary?

276
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:28,368
We can.

277
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:29,409
(Spread the pieces all over the large teppan.)

278
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:33,049
The rosemary really made the aroma even nicer.

279
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:35,309
(The scent of the rosemary gently spreads around them.)

280
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,379
I'll do this...

281
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:38,649
and place the meat slices on here,

282
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:41,819
so we can all grab some on our own plates, like at a buffet.

283
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,389
(This is so fancy.)

284
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:48,659
- I'll keep grilling the mat.
- You need to eat too.

285
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:50,799
No, I'll be full as long as you eat.

286
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:52,929
- Just watching you all eat...
- Shall we, then?

287
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:54,628
"Shall we, then..."

288
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:56,799
(Shall we, then?)

289
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,909
(Will you really be able to resist this smell?)

290
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:07,079
It seriously smells so good.

291
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:08,978
Let's eat buffet-style.

292
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:11,049
This looks amazing.

293
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:14,519
We used butter and ramyeon powder. It has to be good.

294
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,219
- Hey. Butter and ramyeon powder...
- Totally.

295
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,488
- Most things...
- The final boss.

296
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:22,289
Even rotten things would taste good.

297
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:24,429
- Even dead meat.
- Of course.

298
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:25,999
It can even revive dead meat.

299
00:13:29,739 --> 00:13:31,039
Eun Soo, come here.

300
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:33,608
- Where are you? Come here.
- Me? Okay.

301
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,808
- Have some with chopsticks.
- Okay.

302
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:37,179
(Eun Woo, who came a long way, gets the first bite.)

303
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:44,348
- Can I eat it?
- I think it turned out well.

304
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:45,379
Yes, go ahead.

305
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:49,889
How is it?

306
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,759
- Is it good?
- She said it turned out well.

307
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:55,159
- It's so good.
- Really?

308
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:58,258
- Okay, bring your plates.
- Okay.

309
00:13:58,259 --> 00:13:59,429
(Nicely-cooked, medium-well teppan steak)

310
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:01,899
- Let's eat buffet-style.
- Okay.

311
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:04,338
Here, Eun Soo.

312
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:05,639
(The members head over to get their food.)

313
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,809
(The appetizing smell)

314
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:15,408
Not yet.

315
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:16,418
(It's starting to make her dizzy from hunger.)

316
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:18,519
- It turned out so well.
- Get some from the bottom.

317
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:20,449
- Which one?
- The bottom one here.

318
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:23,819
Isn't Na Ra standing there so nicely?

319
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,489
I like that about Na Ra.

320
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,359
(I want to eat soon...)

321
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,898
- Isn't it cooler to use two hands?
- That is true.

322
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:32,969
(Isn't teppan cooking all about the show?)

323
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:35,939
- Hey, you should...
- Oh, the garlic!

324
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:37,669
(Hey!)

325
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:40,139
I'm sorry, Na Ra.

326
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:42,369
- You should use two hands.
- I made you angry again.

327
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:45,538
They turn it like this...

328
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:47,379
Every time I do that, I lose some garlic.

329
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:49,179
Let's leave that...

330
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:51,378
up to the pros. I'll just do this.

331
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:52,749
(This is just the first day. I'll practice more...)

332
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,989
Oh, my.

333
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:59,889
(Dong Il's special performance)

334
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:02,189
The teppan cook.

335
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,198
(Now, he's an A-Class Teppan Cook.)

336
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,459
Okay. Take some.

337
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:07,768
(It's finally buffet time.)

338
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:09,138
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

339
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:10,199
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

340
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,299
- Thank you for cooking.
- It's nothing.

341
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,469
Oh, my. This looks delicious.

342
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:18,309
Oh, my. I'm so happy.

343
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,078
- I feel like I'm on a trip.
- You are.

344
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:23,078
(You are on a trip, Eun Soo.)

345
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:24,978
Right. That's how happy I feel.

346
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:25,988
(That's how happy I feel.)

347
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:27,348
It's totally a trip.

348
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:28,919
(That's how happy I feel.)

349
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:35,789
Is it good?

350
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,199
The vegetables...

351
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:39,768
don't need anything.

352
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:41,099
- They're delicious on their own.
- Totally.

353
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:44,468
- The seasoning is perfect.
- Yes. You don't need anything else.

354
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:48,109
Oh, my. Hey. The meat is delicious. Hurry up and try some.

355
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:49,379
Okay.

356
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:51,638
You wanted to have meat.

357
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:52,849
- You must be happy.
- I am.

358
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:54,809
- Have lots of meat.
- Do you want to sit here?

359
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:57,749
Sit wherever you want. Anywhere is fine for me.

360
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,618
- I can sit on the ground...
- What are you talking about?

361
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:03,289
- No, make yourself comfortable.
- Come on.

362
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,389
(Playing with Eun Soo is the best.)

363
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:11,059
- Tae Goo, come here.
- Okay.

364
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:13,298
Oh, thank you.

365
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,729
The aroma is amazing. Try some.

366
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:19,669
Isn't the aroma amazing?

367
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:21,669
- Isn't it so delicious?
- It is.

368
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,209
How can meat have this aroma?

369
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,248
I think the aftertaste is even more delicious.

370
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:27,608
- It is, right?
- Yes.

371
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:29,149
- The aroma of the meat, right?
- Yes.

372
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,919
(Eating a piece of freshly grilled beef)

373
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:37,959
- Isn't it delicious?
- Yes.

374
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:41,029
There's no way it wouldn't be good.

375
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:43,029
Tae Goo just said that...

376
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:45,998
the after aroma of the meat was amazing.

377
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:47,299
(With the help of butter and the magic powder)

378
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:49,368
- How is it?
- Dong Il.

379
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:50,498
- It's delicious.
- Right?

380
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:52,069
(The savouriness boosts the flavour!)

381
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:54,109
- The powder is truly magical.
- Yes.

382
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,278
It's really good.

383
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,138
(It's really good.)

384
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:00,179
It's unbelievable.

385
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:03,148
Eun Soo, this is your first-ever camping trip, right?

386
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:04,149
Yes.

387
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,588
- What do you think about the food?
- It's delicious.

388
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,719
- Really?
- Try this.

389
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:09,619
That's the most I can be expressive.

390
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:11,219
But it's really good.

391
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,759
Did you pick the rosemary from here?

392
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,329
- I love the scent.
- Right?

393
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:17,658
It's amazing.

394
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:21,869
(The scent of rosemary makes it even better.)

395
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:24,198
Grilling everything all at once,

396
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,108
even the vegetables, on the griddle is really convenient.

397
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,439
I don't need to cook twice.

398
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:30,739
Later,

399
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:32,878
let's fry up some rice on it.

400
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:35,548
(Later, let's fry up some rice on it!)

401
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:38,579
Slice the meat into thin pieces, add an egg,

402
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:40,789
sprinkle some of the dried seaweed Na Ra brought,

403
00:17:41,449 --> 00:17:43,659
- and we'll have fried rice.
- Yes.

404
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:45,618
- Teppan fried rice?
- Yes.

405
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:47,529
(Round 2 is teppan fried rice.)

406
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:52,259
The rice is almost done.

407
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,599
- Is the rice done?
- Yes.

408
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:57,799
Did it turn out okay? It wasn't our usual rice.

409
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:02,168
- I couldn't stir it earlier.
- Is it cooked well?

410
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:05,878
The rice is... How should I say it?

411
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:09,278
(How should I say it?)

412
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,848
- Was it brown rice?
- What?

413
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:11,879
Is it brown rice?

414
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:13,288
It's what we bought earlier.

415
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:15,249
- The rice is mixed with grains.
- Is the rice different?

416
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:18,558
Because the rice we bought earlier wasn't from Korea...

417
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,188
- Is that so? Let me see.
- It's like brown rice.

418
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:21,228
Brown rice? Let me try.

419
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:23,199
The grains are a bit... It's hot.

420
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:25,358
- Here.
- Did we buy the wrong rice?

421
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,599
But it's still good.

422
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:29,638
- Is it cooked?
- You get it, right?

423
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:31,199
- It's brown rice.
- Right?

424
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:33,338
We should've soaked the rice.

425
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:35,439
You're right. I thought it was regular rice.

426
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:37,939
- Then...
- Yes?

427
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:41,078
- Let's not make fried rice, Na Ra.
- Okay.

428
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,849
- Just eat it as it is?
- Let's just eat it.

429
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:44,548
It won't taste good as fried rice.

430
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:46,148
Yes. The rice would only get harder.

431
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:47,219
Exactly.

432
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:53,229
(But I really wanted teppan fried rice.)

433
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:57,959
(To save the rice...)

434
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:07,539
(Dong Il gets up, as if he suddenly has an idea.)

435
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:16,978
(What's in the white box Dong Il is carrying?)

436
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:19,589
(What?)

437
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:22,548
This is aged kimchi from Gangjin.

438
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:27,089
(Aged kimchi from Gangjin, South Jeolla Province)

439
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:28,888
30kg?

440
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:30,899
It's unusual, but I said I'd take it.

441
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:32,228
It's unbelievable.

442
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:34,128
Even though it was aged for 2 to 3 years,

443
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:36,199
the kimchi is still crunchy.

444
00:19:36,469 --> 00:19:37,638
I only need to bring kimchi.

445
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:39,909
(Chef Sung's secret weapon for this trip)

446
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:43,208
(It's not your ordinary kimchi!)

447
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:45,379
(Interpreting)

448
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,349
(Kimchi aged for 2 years)

449
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:51,748
Chew it well, and it's crunchy.

450
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:53,788
This is real Korean kimchi.

451
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:56,659
(The Aged Kimchi Evangelist, spreading it far and wide)

452
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:01,488
(I'm the best chef...)

453
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:06,029
(in Korea!)

454
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:07,698
(Let me treat you...)

455
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:10,799
(to a plate of kimchi!)

456
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:14,238
How did it not go bad for two years?

457
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:16,069
(Opening the aged kimchi for the first time)

458
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,039
Give it a smell, Na Ra.

459
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:27,088
Cook stew with this, and it'd be amazing.

460
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:29,758
It'd be great cooked together with pork as a kimchi stew.

461
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,218
It wouldn't need much seasoning.

462
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:33,258
Just cook the kimchi stew as is.

463
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:34,489
- Right?
- With pork.

464
00:20:34,889 --> 00:20:37,159
Shishito peppers with anchovies.

465
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:38,759
Let me plate some.

466
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:40,228
And this is perilla leaves.

467
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:41,229
(Stir-fried shishito peppers with dried anchovies, )

468
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:42,229
(and pickled perilla leaves)

469
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,998
I'm sure you'll devour them.

470
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:45,538
(They'd kill two bowls of rice!)

471
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:46,669
Because they're too good.

472
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:49,578
- It smells great.
- Does it?

473
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:51,839
(While plating the 3 delicious side dishes in the house)

474
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:56,219
I don't usually like vegetables, but these are good.

475
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:57,818
You don't like vegetables?

476
00:20:57,819 --> 00:20:59,449
You should eat a lot of them.

477
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:01,618
Only then are you healthy.

478
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:02,859
(Nagging like a dad)

479
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:04,588
Do whatever you want.

480
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:06,189
I'm sure there's a limit to well-being.

481
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:09,859
Haven't I built some?

482
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:11,099
Of what?

483
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:14,198
(Biceps)

484
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:16,399
- I've built some, right?
- Yes, how impressive.

485
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,438
- Really?
- No.

486
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:20,438
(No!)

487
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:21,608
No, for real.

488
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:22,978
I don't see any difference.

489
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:24,878
I've been working out every day lately.

490
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:25,939
Is that so?

491
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:28,649
Stop doing it from now on.

492
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:30,118
- Why?
- What?

493
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,449
- Because my muscles won't grow?
- Yes.

494
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:34,618
(Best friend vibes, even across the generation gap)

495
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:36,049
That wouldn't you know...

496
00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:38,389
It's hot.

497
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,929
To think I'd come to a place like this with you.

498
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:42,228
I know, right?

499
00:21:42,229 --> 00:21:45,128
To think we'd camp all the way in Japan.

500
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:46,368
It's weird, right?

501
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:48,399
Yes. I can't believe we're in Japan.

502
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:49,599
Exactly.

503
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:52,799
Why are you sweating so much?

504
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:54,169
Are you hot?

505
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:57,379
I feel hot. My body must be messed up.

506
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:00,079
My mom is sweating buckets these days.

507
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:02,349
I must've gotten weak.

508
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:04,448
Shouldn't you replenish your energy?

509
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:05,449
Exactly.

510
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:07,548
Did you have samgyetang?

511
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:09,248
- It was 1 of the 3 dog days.
- No.

512
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:11,119
What? But you should've.

513
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:13,389
Is samgyetang a must?

514
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:15,258
Of course. You must have it...

515
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:16,428
at least once on every dog day.

516
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:17,959
- Did you have some?
- Yes.

517
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:19,699
- Gosh.
- I had perilla seed samgyetang.

518
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:20,929
Well done.

519
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:23,199
There's a bug crawling around right here.

520
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:24,439
Where?

521
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,969
(A caring girl, even noticing the bugs)

522
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:28,969
Why did you flick it at me?

523
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:32,479
- It didn't fly at you.
- Really?

524
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:34,148
You did that on purpose, right?

525
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:35,748
No, it's because I'm right-handed.

526
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:37,219
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

527
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,718
(While Hee Won and Eun Soo are bickering)

528
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:40,919
- The kimchi.
- Yes?

529
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:44,688
Amazing, right?

530
00:22:44,689 --> 00:22:48,029
(Here's the kimchi aged 2 years.)

531
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:53,299
(Can the top 3 side dishes from Dong Il's friend...)

532
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:55,198
(stand in for the fried rice?)

533
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:57,369
- Try the kimchi first.
- Okay.

534
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:59,469
Have a taste of the kimchi.

535
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:01,538
(Crunchy)

536
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:03,608
It's a masterpiece, isn't it?

537
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:04,778
(Crunchy)

538
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:06,079
Did you try the kimchi?

539
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:09,148
The kimchi is super refreshing.

540
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:11,579
(The kimchi is super refreshing!)

541
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,459
(Crunchy)

542
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:18,089
How's the kimchi, Tae Goo?

543
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:19,829
This is...

544
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:22,329
- It's good.
- Delicious, right?

545
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:24,428
Wrap this around the beef.

546
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:25,559
Try the perilla leaf.

547
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:29,198
- This aged kimchi is amazing.
- It's unbelievable.

548
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,238
It's a killer.

549
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:31,968
Try the perilla leaf. It tastes incredible.

550
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:33,539
(The aged kimchi stole the show.)

551
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:36,779
(If you wrap the rice in a pickled perilla leaf)

552
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:41,349
Try the perilla leaf, Na Ra.

553
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:44,848
Wrap the beef in a perilla leaf. It's so good.

554
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:48,049
(The brown rice goes down easily.)

555
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:50,588
(Pickled perilla leaf from Gangjin, South Jeolla Province)

556
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:51,888
- Doesn't it taste traditional?
- Yes.

557
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,329
- This is good too.
- By the way...

558
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:56,898
The aged kimchi is good, but so is the perilla leaf.

559
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:57,998
I love its aroma.

560
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:59,398
The shishito peppers are...

561
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:01,129
It's stir-fried shishito peppers with dried anchovies.

562
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:03,939
The Joseon soy sauce was homemade.

563
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,869
The shishito peppers are also delicious.

564
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:14,109
(His most expressive moment yet on House on Wheels)

565
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:16,209
Thank you.

566
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:19,449
I knew you guys would love the perilla leaf.

567
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:21,318
- It's delicious.
- Right?

568
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:25,559
(Seeing that everyone is enjoying the meal, )

569
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:28,288
I'm glad everyone is enjoying it.

570
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:30,628
(Chef Sung finally relaxes.)

571
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:31,829
Dig in.

572
00:24:32,229 --> 00:24:35,099
Our youngest is surely digging in.

573
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:37,739
- I'm happy.
- I can really eat today.

574
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,968
- Right?
- I'm in top form today.

575
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:41,438
(Eun Soo is in top form today!)

576
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,109
I'm happy Tae Goo is enjoying it.

577
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:44,439
It's delicious.

578
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,109
I love seeing you two dig in.

579
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:50,449
It's a bit...

580
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,389
- Trains?
- I hear trains.

581
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:01,258
- Right behind you.
- Goodness.

582
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:03,758
(Right behind you!)

583
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,328
Only one car passed by, Dong Il.

584
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:06,468
It's either 1 or 2 cars.

585
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:08,698
It often appears in movies.

586
00:25:08,699 --> 00:25:10,638
- Really?
- Like our shuttle buses,

587
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:11,939
it runs on the road.

588
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:13,469
The trains don't come often.

589
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:15,308
- How romantic.
- Yes.

590
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:17,939
Many ride that on purpose as a sightseeing trip.

591
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:20,078
When they come to Japan.

592
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,848
(After their first romantic dinner together with the surface train)

593
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:23,919
I'm full.

594
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:28,089
Let's clean these up.

595
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:31,659
- Only these need to be washed.
- Okay.

596
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:35,229
(With everyone helping out, )

597
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,798
(the House quickly becomes clean.)

598
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,829
Gosh.

599
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:43,199
Can Tae Goo...

600
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:46,339
sleep inside the House?

601
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,908
(Up to 2.5 people can sleep in the House on Wheels.)

602
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:52,779
(The space is tight.)

603
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:56,149
The two ladies can sleep inside.

604
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,378
Okay.

605
00:25:57,379 --> 00:25:59,319
Yes, you two are to sleep in the house.

606
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:00,889
- I'll sleep in the tent.
- You will?

607
00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:03,318
Okay, then let's pick our spots.

608
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,688
(Tonight's sleeping arrangements)

609
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,188
(House on Wheels: Na Ra and Eun Soo)

610
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,859
(Single tent: Dong Il, Double tent: Hee Won and Tae Goo)

611
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:10,158
Okay.

612
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,399
(Na Ra and Eun Soo are getting ready to go to bed.)

613
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:14,369
- This is nice.
- Right?

614
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:17,068
Sleeping together with Na Ra.

615
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:19,539
- Out of the blue.
- On our first encounter.

616
00:26:20,469 --> 00:26:21,509
I'm happy.

617
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:24,579
(After laying the bedding side by side)

618
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,978
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da. All done.

619
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:28,979
(They can get close, like the beddings, right?)

620
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,019
All done.

621
00:26:31,949 --> 00:26:33,849
- Turn on the machine.
- Okay.

622
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:35,849
I'm turning it on.

623
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,088
(Air pump)

624
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:38,089
Nice.

625
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:39,559
Rise.

626
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:42,328
Rise!

627
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:43,598
(Rise, dear tent!)

628
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:44,599
It'll inflate on its own.

629
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:46,668
Tents these days are so easy to set up.

630
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:47,728
(The double tent is ready.)

631
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:49,369
- Right?
- This is so cool.

632
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:50,968
(Even the single tent)

633
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:52,269
- Is this right?
- It's inflating in no time.

634
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:54,508
Good. I think that's enough.

635
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:56,039
(They're all set for bed.)

636
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:58,709
Come on. Let's go to the hot spring.

637
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:01,308
- Are we going to the hot spring?
- Yes.

638
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:05,079
(In the front yard of the campsite, Michi no Eki, )

639
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:07,148
(there's a hot spring!)

640
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:08,289
This is a surprise.

641
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,318
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I'm loving it.

642
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,389
You are?

643
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:17,629
(The place where locals and tourists all come to warm up)

644
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:23,369
(See you in a bit.)

645
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:29,409
(Relaxing)

646
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:33,279
(About 30 minutes later)

647
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:38,319
(Clean and refreshed Eun Soo appears.)

648
00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:41,049
(But nobody else is out yet.)

649
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:44,659
The others told us to be back by 40.

650
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:46,589
I couldn't even wash my hair.

651
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:49,759
The others aren't out yet.

652
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:51,399
They clearly told us...

653
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:53,669
to be back by 40.

654
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:55,829
But it's past 45 now.

655
00:27:56,939 --> 00:27:57,939
Just in case,

656
00:27:58,699 --> 00:28:00,339
I rushed outside.

657
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:03,539
(But nobody else is out yet.)

658
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:06,979
(Eun Soo, waiting for the others, )

659
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:09,108
(measures her height.)

660
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:10,119
Am I in the right position?

661
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:13,149
(What's this?)

662
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:16,119
They clearly said 40.

663
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:19,389
Goodness.

664
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:23,259
(Dong Il finally comes out.)

665
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,759
Dong Il.

666
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:27,769
(What?)

667
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:29,799
- Do you feel refreshed?
- Of course.

668
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:33,069
Washing up made me feel refreshed.

669
00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:37,078
The atmosphere is different from during the day.

670
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,279
- Totally.
- Right?

671
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,478
- Yes, you...
- I came out after a bath,

672
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:42,579
but you weren't there.

673
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:46,889
This is so much fun.

674
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:50,259
- I'm simply amazed.
- Right? Same here.

675
00:28:52,589 --> 00:28:55,589
I've only seen you on TV.

676
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,058
- You saw me?
- Of course.

677
00:28:58,059 --> 00:28:59,798
- You saw me?
- Of course.

678
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,168
But to think we'd meet like this...

679
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:02,229
(Lying down out of happiness)

680
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:04,798
The watermelon. The twinkling one.

681
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,708
- Really?
- For real.

682
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:10,308
After watching that, I never expected you to be this bright.

683
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:11,709
Right? That's what the others said too.

684
00:29:11,939 --> 00:29:15,008
I'm someone with a big head and small shoulders.

685
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:17,649
So I look really small.

686
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:19,549
- Really?
- Touch here.

687
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:21,888
I know, right? My head bulges out on the sides.

688
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:23,359
- Seriously, it's quite...
- Guys.

689
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:26,558
(Opening)

690
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,589
Guys.

691
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:29,629
You have to sleep with those down.

692
00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:30,798
- Yes.
- Okay.

693
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,529
- Or you'll be struck by sunlight.
- Got it.

694
00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:36,938
(Worried Na Ra and Eun Soo might wake up...)

695
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:39,199
(because of the morning sunlight, )

696
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,708
(Hee Won came out thoughtfully.)

697
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:43,238
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

698
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,439
- Goodnight.
- See you tomorrow.

699
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:50,149
(Feeling at ease, Hee Won finally returns to his tent.)

700
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:54,388
Goodness, what a nice tent.

701
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:55,748
(Dong Il tucks himself in.)

702
00:29:55,749 --> 00:29:56,819
Gosh.

703
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:58,518
Shall we go to bed?

704
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,859
- Yes. I'll turn off the lights.
- Okay.

705
00:30:01,689 --> 00:30:02,758
- Thank you.
- No problem.

706
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,199
(Rushing to bed)

707
00:30:04,729 --> 00:30:06,259
This is so nice.

708
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:08,528
Are you going to sleep right away?

709
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:10,699
(No way.)

710
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:15,169
(The two ladies' night continued until late hours.)

711
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:21,179
(The night passes.)

712
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:27,518
(Their first morning...)

713
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:33,019
(across the ocean)

714
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:39,059
(Current time: 5:20am)

715
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:41,868
(Relieving yesterday's fatigue, )

716
00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:43,899
(the House on Wheels members are deeply asleep.)

717
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:45,799
(Moving)

718
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:49,839
(Rustling)

719
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,539
(Opening)

720
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:54,649
(Dong Il gets up 1st.)

721
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:58,149
(Stretching)

722
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:03,559
(After getting changed quickly, )

723
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:10,629
(he prepares quietly so as not to wake the others.)

724
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:16,599
(He leaves the front yard of the house...)

725
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:23,639
(and heads somewhere.)

726
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:25,939
(Front yard)

727
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:30,379
(Abu Village, home to the Sunset Michi no Eki)

728
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:32,879
(Crossing the road above the ocean)

729
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:41,059
(What is Abu Village like?)

730
00:31:42,589 --> 00:31:43,899
(Bowing)

731
00:31:45,699 --> 00:31:48,969
(After greeting the elderly villager)

732
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:52,699
(Glancing)

733
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:55,169
Just look at that alley.

734
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:57,139
It's just...

735
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,439
(What stopped Dong Il...)

736
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:03,719
(was the alley to the village.)

737
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:06,278
(Shall I take a walk around the village?)

738
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,288
How about it?

739
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:08,719
(Shall I take a walk around the village?)

740
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:12,358
(He's off to look around...)

741
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:14,929
(the neighbouring village along the alley.)

742
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:18,799
Look at the village.

743
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:21,029
It's so pretty.

744
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,869
(It's so pretty.)

745
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:31,179
(The morning scenery unfolds along the road.)

746
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:34,608
That house is made of wood.

747
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:38,449
(A typical wooden Japanese duplex house)

748
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:43,658
Mansions in Korea were built on vast lands.

749
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:45,389
They weren't built as duplexes.

750
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:49,259
Is that the train station?

751
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:51,929
It's totally a train station.

752
00:32:54,829 --> 00:32:58,099
(Walking inside)

753
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:03,139
Such stations appear in movies.

754
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:09,649
The Japanese keep the old. They don't get rid of them.

755
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:11,748
(This village, like one from a Japanese movie, )

756
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:12,749
They maintain them.

757
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,289
(This village, like one from a Japanese movie, )

758
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:18,059
(held a little surprise.)

759
00:33:18,489 --> 00:33:20,559
You can spot hibiscus in Japan,

760
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:21,888
Korea's national flower.

761
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:23,859
(Hibiscus, Korea's national flower)

762
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:26,459
(A photo is a must.)

763
00:33:28,229 --> 00:33:29,429
Hibiscus...

764
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:32,199
thrives well even in Japanese villages.

765
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:34,809
Right.

766
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:37,439
Koreans go to countries all around the world.

767
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:40,909
We're very resilient. So is hibiscus.

768
00:33:42,709 --> 00:33:45,179
(While Dong Il came across an unexpected gift)

769
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:49,019
(Meanwhile, at our House)

770
00:33:49,949 --> 00:33:56,889
(Na Ra and Eun Soo are still in dreamland.)

771
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:02,729
(Moving)

772
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,509
(Eun Soo is up.)

773
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,509
(Bowing)

774
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,438
(Current time: 7am)

775
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:13,649
(But it's quiet?)

776
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:17,479
(She checks outside first, )

777
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:21,589
(then tidies her bedding.)

778
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:23,549
Where is everyone?

779
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:32,159
(Waking up)

780
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,769
How about I look around?

781
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:39,069
(Eun Soo is off to enjoy the morning leisure.)

782
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,368
This is so nice.

783
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,969
(Eun Soo is off to enjoy the morning leisure.)

784
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:45,409
(Dong Il and Hee Won are back with breakfast.)

785
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,308
This looks good.

786
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:49,348
(They prepare a simple feast.)

787
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:50,378
Right?

788
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,978
Shouldn't we put them in the fridge if we're sharing with the others?

789
00:34:52,979 --> 00:34:54,319
(But only two are up to eat.)

790
00:34:55,249 --> 00:34:56,848
They're still asleep. Waking them up is a bit...

791
00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:58,019
(Shall we dig in first?)

792
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:01,359
(I have appeared.)

793
00:35:01,629 --> 00:35:03,759
(An anxious feeling woke her up.)

794
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,929
- Na Ra is up.
- Yes, she is.

795
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:07,269
(Sliding)

796
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:09,499
Good morning.

797
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:12,238
- Good morning.
- Did you sleep with your bag on?

798
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:15,139
No. I'm going to go wash up.

799
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:18,039
No, wash after breakfast. We haven't washed yet either.

800
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,949
Have some salad and milk.

801
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:23,379
- Coffee too. Come outside.
- Get up.

802
00:35:24,819 --> 00:35:26,018
(Staggering)

803
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:27,049
Sit.

804
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,988
(Zoning out)

805
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:31,359
This isn't bad as breakfast.

806
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:35,089
What time did you wake up, Dong Il?

807
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:36,259
(Laughing)

808
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:37,629
We...

809
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:40,229
I already walked around the village as a workout.

810
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:42,198
(Is this the usual morning here?)

811
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,199
I'm done for the day.

812
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,969
I woke up, thinking I got up early.

813
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:49,908
But compared to Korea, you're up early, aren't you?

814
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:52,608
Yes, I'm up about three hours earlier.

815
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,548
Three hours? You told me.

816
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:55,549
(Shocked)

817
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,649
Here's my recommendation, Na Ra.

818
00:35:58,249 --> 00:36:00,049
Salad in the morning.

819
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:02,318
Try the eggs.

820
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:03,389
(Eggs first)

821
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:05,719
(Eating)

822
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:10,798
Would you like to try Japanese convenience store coffee?

823
00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:11,799
- Yes.
- Yes?

824
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,298
Thank you.

825
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:15,529
(This is family love.)

826
00:36:15,629 --> 00:36:19,439
(Hands full of food)

827
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:20,838
- Thank you for the food.
- Dong Il,

828
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:22,338
is that your first triangle gimbap?

829
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:24,439
(Waking up with a sweet snack)

830
00:36:25,909 --> 00:36:26,909
I'm going to wash up.

831
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:28,379
- Okay.
- All right.

832
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:31,579
I will be back. Thank you for the food.

833
00:36:32,449 --> 00:36:33,648
Isn't Na Ra really cute?

834
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:34,649
(Why is she bringing the mug with her?)

835
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:37,589
Are you a photographer?

836
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:40,289
Yes, I'll take photos of you.

837
00:36:40,629 --> 00:36:42,689
- Is that a film camera?
- What's that?

838
00:36:42,929 --> 00:36:44,199
Yes, it's a film camera.

839
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,698
I even got a new strap for the camera.

840
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:49,699
I see. Go ahead.

841
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:51,769
- You look very amazing.
- Really?

842
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:54,039
(Secretly anticipating)

843
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:56,369
I apologise.

844
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:59,008
Without my glasses, I can't see if it's focused.

845
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,038
(I forgot to put on glasses.)

846
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:01,878
Goodness, you're being annoying.

847
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:03,918
Aren't you going back and forth on purpose...

848
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:05,779
- to look cool?
- No.

849
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:08,589
I can't tell if the camera is out of focus or not.

850
00:37:09,919 --> 00:37:11,759
(She tries again after putting on her glasses.)

851
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:12,959
- I can see it now.
- Do it properly.

852
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:15,189
(Exclaiming)

853
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:18,759
I didn't insert the film properly.

854
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,929
She's driving me crazy.

855
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:24,339
It's too high because there's too much light.

856
00:37:24,469 --> 00:37:25,539
I'll take it anyway.

857
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,708
- You look amazing.
- That's right.

858
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:28,839
You look amazing.

859
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:30,308
- Without shaking the camera...
- All right.

860
00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:31,738
- I'll take the photo.
- Okay.

861
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:33,179
One, two, three.

862
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:35,349
- Hey.
- Did you take it?

863
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,118
After taking the photo, you have to hold it for 0.5 seconds.

864
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:40,018
If not, the photo will be blurry.

865
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:42,189
After taking the photo, you should count in your head.

866
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:44,618
Then you can move the camera.

867
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:45,619
Hey.

868
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,758
(Eun Soo is being playful with Dong Il.)

869
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:47,989
Go and wash up.

870
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:51,029
Don't say that. She's taking photos sincerely.

871
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:53,028
(Clicking)

872
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:55,398
After taking a photo of Hee Won, you held it for a long time.

873
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:56,629
(Getting suspicious of her favouritism)

874
00:37:56,969 --> 00:37:58,299
Go ahead and sit down.

875
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:00,139
I'll take off my glasses.

876
00:38:02,409 --> 00:38:04,478
I will also pose nicely like Dong Il.

877
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:05,739
Yes, pose nicely.

878
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:07,809
All right.

879
00:38:08,209 --> 00:38:09,249
You look great.

880
00:38:11,149 --> 00:38:12,348
- It was incredible.
- It felt like a fashion shoot.

881
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:13,679
- A fashion shoot?
- Yes.

882
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:17,619
In the end, only photos remain.

883
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,728
What if we lost all the photos?

884
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:22,359
- No.
- No, they turned out well.

885
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:25,698
(Faint)

886
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:28,298
A professional pressed the shutter and took good photos.

887
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:30,399
(A fair result without favouritism)

888
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:32,538
(Although the photos turned out faint)

889
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:33,909
- Well done.
- Gosh.

890
00:38:35,139 --> 00:38:38,209
(Their memories remain clear.)

891
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:41,149
- Hee Won, let's go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

892
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:43,478
Come on. Let's go.

893
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:45,779
(They're scrubbing buddies who even bathe together.)

894
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,048
- Enjoy your shower.
- Okay.

895
00:38:48,049 --> 00:38:49,719
(They enjoy the hot spring until the very end.)

896
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:53,018
(In a front yard across the sea, )

897
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:55,229
(the family spent a unique morning.)

898
00:38:56,589 --> 00:39:00,499
(Carried away by the sunset, the sun rose above us once again.)

899
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,868
(They're ready to head to a new place.)

900
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:05,469
- It's not hot anymore, is it?
- No, it's very cool.

901
00:39:06,299 --> 00:39:07,909
Did you have the card this morning?

902
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:09,869
When you were paying.

903
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:11,109
- Dong Il.
- No way.

904
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:13,109
I had cash and the card.

905
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,779
- Hee Won, here you go.
- What's this?

906
00:39:16,649 --> 00:39:19,919
It's candy made with 100 percent Manuka honey.

907
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:22,118
- Thank you.
- It's only made with honey.

908
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:24,188
- What are its health benefits?
- It's honey.

909
00:39:24,189 --> 00:39:26,388
- It's just...
- It's Manuka honey.

910
00:39:26,389 --> 00:39:28,329
- I also eat it regularly.
- Do you?

911
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:30,329
Thank you.

912
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:32,499
There are people who know about it.

913
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:34,669
- It's good for the throat.
- I heard that this is the best.

914
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:36,698
(Sweet)

915
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:37,899
I'll take the wrapper.

916
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:41,068
(Detailed)

917
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:42,869
- It's exactly like starch syrup.
- Yes.

918
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:46,209
- Is this 100 percent honey?
- Yes.

919
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:48,508
- It's the best type of honey.
- And so,

920
00:39:48,509 --> 00:39:50,878
one piece of candy costs 2 to 3 dollars.

921
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:52,149
- How much?
- Two to three dollars.

922
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:55,419
- That's nice.
- It's very expensive.

923
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:57,018
- I eat it sparingly.
- Gosh.

924
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,789
- That's why it tastes refined.
- How many pieces did you bring?

925
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:02,359
How many? I have a few more.

926
00:40:03,129 --> 00:40:04,498
- Do you want me to show you?
- Give it to me when we're leaving.

927
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:05,629
When we're leaving?

928
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:08,699
You should only give it to whom?

929
00:40:09,499 --> 00:40:10,739
To Jang Na Ra.

930
00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:12,468
Na Ra?

931
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:14,138
(To Jang Na Ra)

932
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:15,339
Tae Goo, get out of the car.

933
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:17,008
It takes 15 minutes by car, but you can walk.

934
00:40:17,009 --> 00:40:18,508
You went running this morning.

935
00:40:18,509 --> 00:40:19,708
(Tae Goo has a sense of humour.)

936
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:20,779
All of a sudden?

937
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:24,418
Eun Soo.

938
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:26,319
(Hello, Na Ra.)

939
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:29,318
- It may be uncomfortable.
- It's okay.

940
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:31,189
Since you two are guests, I'll sit in the middle.

941
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,218
- Na Ra.
- What?

942
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:34,528
Why don't you sit at the end?

943
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:36,428
- No, if you sit in the middle...
- I see.

944
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:37,628
(Eyes widening)

945
00:40:37,629 --> 00:40:39,228
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable for everyone?

946
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:40,928
For everyone? That's not good.

947
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:42,869
It's better that you sit there.

948
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:45,368
I'll sit in the middle next time.

949
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:47,569
- No, I will.
- We can take turns.

950
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:50,679
Here are the guests.

951
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:52,409
Here we go.

952
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:54,308
Let's go.

953
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:56,109
(A chaotic day spent in a neighbouring country across the sea)

954
00:40:56,809 --> 00:40:59,378
(Carrying an armful of memories in their home)

955
00:40:59,379 --> 00:41:01,789
(They move ahead with lots of energy.)

956
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:06,789
(Is our home following us without problems?)

957
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:10,829
(Saying goodbye to his sweat)

958
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:12,398
(As always, )

959
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:16,069
(they left the place clean after their stay.)

960
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:24,079
(What unexpected memories will they create today and where?)

961
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:26,709
Today's trip is...

962
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:30,179
mostly organised by Hee Won.

963
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:32,879
They're places that he's been to recently.

964
00:41:33,379 --> 00:41:35,219
I have no information at all.

965
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:37,419
- Really?
- Yes.

966
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,389
- I can't wait.
- Me neither.

967
00:41:41,229 --> 00:41:43,229
(Hee Won prepared a special gift for the family.)

968
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,759
(Just yesterday)

969
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:52,739
(Meeting with a local who guided his family trip in the neighbourhood)

970
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:56,368
(Hee Won picked his favourite spots...)

971
00:41:56,369 --> 00:41:58,679
(and asked for her advice.)

972
00:41:59,509 --> 00:42:02,809
(A tour of feeding crows?)

973
00:42:03,209 --> 00:42:06,779
(Recommended by the local resident)

974
00:42:07,419 --> 00:42:11,859
(Personally guided by Hee Won)

975
00:42:12,419 --> 00:42:15,058
(Hee Won Tour that Hee Won isn't familiar with)

976
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:16,889
- Are we going to have food?
- Over there...

977
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:18,558
We won't eat just yet.

978
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:21,598
You'll see a hawk over there.

979
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,998
(There's a hawk.)

980
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,099
Do you know what a hawk is?

981
00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:28,869
You get to feed the hawk.

982
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:30,938
Feed the hawk?

983
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:32,009
(Dong Il can't believe what he's hearing.)

984
00:42:32,439 --> 00:42:34,148
By the way, is it safe?

985
00:42:34,149 --> 00:42:35,749
- What?
- Is it safe?

986
00:42:36,149 --> 00:42:37,379
(Thinking)

987
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:39,449
It was safe when I was there.

988
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:43,518
The hawk is... You'll feel it when you do it.

989
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,619
It isn't a joke.

990
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:47,158
The hawk flies towards you...

991
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:48,489
- and suddenly grabs it.
- I see.

992
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:50,088
The hawk flies towards you...

993
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:51,998
(A realistic peek of the hawk tour)

994
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:54,898
What if the hawk pecks someone's nose?

995
00:42:54,899 --> 00:42:56,398
- It could be dangerous.
- Gosh.

996
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:59,269
That's quite possible.

997
00:42:59,399 --> 00:43:00,598
- Really?
- Yes.

998
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:01,869
Should we take off our nose before going?

999
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:04,178
- Anyway, it's big.
- Really?

1000
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:06,409
The hawk is extremely big.

1001
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:08,448
(What's with the vibe?)

1002
00:43:08,449 --> 00:43:10,408
The first thing on the itinerary is feeding the hawk.

1003
00:43:10,409 --> 00:43:12,348
(The first thing on the itinerary is feeding the hawk.)

1004
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:14,388
- Feeding the hawk.
- After feeding the hawk,

1005
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:16,088
we'll eat.

1006
00:43:16,089 --> 00:43:18,258
(1st Period: Feeding the hawk, 2nd Period: Eating)

1007
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:20,089
After that, we'll visit a cave.

1008
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,588
We'll go to a cave.

1009
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:23,228
A cave sounds perfect today. It's cool inside.

1010
00:43:23,229 --> 00:43:26,298
Yes. I think it used to be part of the sea.

1011
00:43:26,299 --> 00:43:27,398
(He doesn't know exactly.)

1012
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:30,169
It turned into a cave when the water receded.

1013
00:43:30,629 --> 00:43:32,499
Is it usually filled with water?

1014
00:43:32,899 --> 00:43:36,239
No, it's part of the land now. The water is gone for good.

1015
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:40,878
There's an elevator in the cave.

1016
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:42,878
(An elevator in the cave?)

1017
00:43:42,879 --> 00:43:45,148
- You can take the elevator...
- What?

1018
00:43:45,149 --> 00:43:46,478
and descend about 100m.

1019
00:43:46,479 --> 00:43:48,189
Like reaching the bottom of a coal mine?

1020
00:43:49,049 --> 00:43:50,119
That's incredible.

1021
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:54,189
After going down, we'll come out.

1022
00:43:54,629 --> 00:43:55,889
- We just come out?
- Yes.

1023
00:43:56,059 --> 00:43:57,728
It's like having an elevator in the mountain.

1024
00:43:57,729 --> 00:43:59,228
(Hee Won Tour doesn't sound ordinary. Will we be okay?)

1025
00:43:59,229 --> 00:44:00,898
We'll look at things like this.

1026
00:44:00,899 --> 00:44:02,229
(Goodness...)

1027
00:44:02,499 --> 00:44:04,738
- I can't wait to find out.
- The sun is on your side.

1028
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:06,098
- Anyway, it's big.
- What did you say?

1029
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:07,808
The sun is on your side.

1030
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:09,209
It's okay. I put some sunscreen.

1031
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:12,779
We also have some cookies.

1032
00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:15,808
You want some now? They're right behind us.

1033
00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:18,149
- Cookies?
- Yes, shall I get them?

1034
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:21,849
Hee Won, we'll have those cookies from yesterday.

1035
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:23,189
What? Cookies?

1036
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:26,418
- Those cookies?
- They tasted amazing.

1037
00:44:26,419 --> 00:44:28,988
- They're from Ms. Takamatsu.
- Didn't she buy them there?

1038
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:32,228
She went all the way to Hiroshima just to buy those cookies.

1039
00:44:32,229 --> 00:44:33,328
- It took her several hours.
- She travelled far.

1040
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:34,528
- They look delicious.
- It took her three hours.

1041
00:44:34,529 --> 00:44:35,669
- Yes.
- Take it first.

1042
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:37,398
You can choose.

1043
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:38,998
I should've told them four hours.

1044
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:40,238
(Cookies)

1045
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:42,408
- They aren't listening anyway.
- Dong Il, would you like some?

1046
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:43,409
You're right.

1047
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,709
(Dad and his children)

1048
00:44:45,909 --> 00:44:46,938
Is it good?

1049
00:44:46,939 --> 00:44:48,408
(They become happy with one cookie.)

1050
00:44:48,409 --> 00:44:50,278
It'd go so well with black tea.

1051
00:44:50,279 --> 00:44:52,378
(They forget about the tour for a while and enjoy sweets.)

1052
00:44:52,379 --> 00:44:53,448
It's delicious.

1053
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:55,019
(Eating it all in one bite)

1054
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:57,688
I remember this place.

1055
00:44:57,689 --> 00:44:59,188
(They get near to the spot where you feed the hawk.)

1056
00:44:59,189 --> 00:45:01,388
I'm starting to remember when I came here.

1057
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:03,328
- You mean here?
- We're almost there.

1058
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:04,899
(We're almost there.)

1059
00:45:05,499 --> 00:45:06,899
Like this.

1060
00:45:07,799 --> 00:45:10,169
- Like this.
- Is this it?

1061
00:45:11,069 --> 00:45:14,308
(Stopping the car in a residential area)

1062
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:16,109
- I'll park here.
- That's good.

1063
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:17,808
We're here. Please get out.

1064
00:45:17,809 --> 00:45:19,479
Get out. Let's go and see the hawk.

1065
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,379
(I'll take photos of the hawk.)

1066
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:26,178
- Let's go and see the hawk.
- Okay.

1067
00:45:26,179 --> 00:45:27,478
(Will they get to see the hawk at this place?)

1068
00:45:27,479 --> 00:45:28,589
My goodness.

1069
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:32,519
Wait, where was it?

1070
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,219
What do you mean?

1071
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:37,489
It's right here. Do you see that?

1072
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:39,898
- Is this where we're going?
- Yes.

1073
00:45:39,899 --> 00:45:42,629
- It's 50m from here.
- Yes, we have to walk over there.

1074
00:45:43,229 --> 00:45:44,339
It's an alley.

1075
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:46,868
Dong Il, this is also a residential area.

1076
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:47,909
You're right.

1077
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:51,508
(Murmuring)

1078
00:45:51,509 --> 00:45:52,609
Are they drinking alcohol?

1079
00:45:52,879 --> 00:45:55,608
It looks like someone's house.

1080
00:45:55,609 --> 00:45:56,609
It is.

1081
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:59,779
- These are people's houses.
- People's houses?

1082
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:02,419
What's that? Is it a lake?

1083
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:05,588
(A lake?)

1084
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:07,418
I don't know if it's the sea or a lake.

1085
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:09,559
(Confused)

1086
00:46:10,689 --> 00:46:12,028
(Does the hawk live by the lake?)

1087
00:46:12,029 --> 00:46:13,959
- This is the place.
- Is this what we came to see?

1088
00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:15,869
- It's here.
- My gosh.

1089
00:46:16,269 --> 00:46:17,938
- You mean the hawk?
- There's no hawk.

1090
00:46:17,939 --> 00:46:19,998
(But there's no hawk.)

1091
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:21,869
- Gosh, is that it?
- Yes.

1092
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:26,939
(Is there really a huge hawk?)

1093
00:46:28,232 --> 00:46:29,536
(Does the hawk live by the lake?)

1094
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,277
- This is the place.
- Is this what we came to see?

1095
00:46:31,777 --> 00:46:33,077
- It's here.
- My gosh.

1096
00:46:33,777 --> 00:46:35,246
- You mean the hawk?
- There's no hawk.

1097
00:46:35,247 --> 00:46:37,046
(But there's no hawk.)

1098
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:39,147
- Gosh, is that it?
- Yes.

1099
00:46:41,657 --> 00:46:44,727
(A huge hawk flies over their heads.)

1100
00:46:45,987 --> 00:46:49,157
(There's really a hawk!)

1101
00:46:49,827 --> 00:46:50,827
(There isn't just one.)

1102
00:46:50,828 --> 00:46:51,866
It's really big.

1103
00:46:51,867 --> 00:46:53,127
(There isn't just one.)

1104
00:46:53,927 --> 00:46:55,867
- Oh, my goodness.
- Gosh.

1105
00:46:56,467 --> 00:46:57,467
It's huge.

1106
00:46:57,468 --> 00:46:59,906
(Running away to the back)

1107
00:46:59,907 --> 00:47:02,306
From that place over there...

1108
00:47:02,307 --> 00:47:03,376
(After seeing the hawk, he raises his voice confidently.)

1109
00:47:03,377 --> 00:47:06,347
We can buy some toast bread over there.

1110
00:47:06,447 --> 00:47:08,177
- Gosh.
- It's not just one hawk.

1111
00:47:08,277 --> 00:47:10,877
- This is scary.
- I can't believe there are so many.

1112
00:47:12,347 --> 00:47:13,417
It's really big.

1113
00:47:13,947 --> 00:47:15,656
- It's much bigger than I thought.
- One of them came down.

1114
00:47:15,657 --> 00:47:17,257
(It's much bigger than I thought.)

1115
00:47:18,227 --> 00:47:19,227
Here...

1116
00:47:20,127 --> 00:47:22,397
- This is so fascinating.
- They look magnificent.

1117
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:25,467
We'll buy some toast bread over here.

1118
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:28,566
- Toast bread?
- Yes, they eat toast bread.

1119
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:31,736
- I see. They must also eat brunch.
- Yes.

1120
00:47:31,737 --> 00:47:34,407
- Exactly.
- They're sophisticated.

1121
00:47:34,937 --> 00:47:36,337
Aren't hawks carnivores?

1122
00:47:37,477 --> 00:47:39,547
- I don't know.
- But they eat toast bread?

1123
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,477
Anyway, I bought it here.

1124
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,716
- Do we buy it here?
- Yes.

1125
00:47:44,717 --> 00:47:45,986
(A place that sells the feed)

1126
00:47:45,987 --> 00:47:47,447
This is what we buy here.

1127
00:47:47,547 --> 00:47:49,316
What kind of restaurant is it? They actually sell it.

1128
00:47:49,317 --> 00:47:50,786
They only sell toast bread.

1129
00:47:50,787 --> 00:47:52,786
- Is it a toast bread shop?
- Yes.

1130
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:53,857
It's 50 yen.

1131
00:47:54,057 --> 00:47:56,027
This costs 50 yen.

1132
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:58,127
Are we buying only one?

1133
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:01,136
Let's buy one for now. I'm too scared to feed them.

1134
00:48:01,137 --> 00:48:02,137
(I'm scared to get pecked in the hand.)

1135
00:48:02,497 --> 00:48:03,536
Let's see.

1136
00:48:03,537 --> 00:48:04,866
(Glancing)

1137
00:48:04,867 --> 00:48:06,806
Do they make toast bread here?

1138
00:48:06,807 --> 00:48:08,477
It's food for the hawks.

1139
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:10,877
What's their main business?

1140
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,377
Food for the hawks.

1141
00:48:13,447 --> 00:48:14,646
(A shop that sells food for the hawks?)

1142
00:48:14,647 --> 00:48:16,347
(Suspicious)

1143
00:48:17,047 --> 00:48:20,487
(There's a menu signboard right in the front.)

1144
00:48:20,717 --> 00:48:23,417
(Dubious)

1145
00:48:24,257 --> 00:48:27,457
Anyway, come here for now. Take this.

1146
00:48:28,657 --> 00:48:30,457
Tear off this much toast bread.

1147
00:48:30,757 --> 00:48:33,026
Tae Goo, come this way. Let's watch Hee Won do it.

1148
00:48:33,027 --> 00:48:34,797
After tearing off this much...

1149
00:48:35,767 --> 00:48:37,767
- Watch me do it.
- Okay.

1150
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,407
(Throwing the bread into the air)

1151
00:48:44,337 --> 00:48:45,577
(Chuckling)

1152
00:48:48,647 --> 00:48:51,247
(Snatching the bread that fell)

1153
00:48:51,647 --> 00:48:53,386
It's slow today.

1154
00:48:53,387 --> 00:48:57,117
(It should eat it in the air.)

1155
00:48:57,587 --> 00:49:00,757
They're exactly like the seagulls in Songdo.

1156
00:49:01,427 --> 00:49:02,856
Watch this.

1157
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,357
(How dare you compare them to seagulls?)

1158
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,367
(Watch carefully.)

1159
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:08,167
Here you go.

1160
00:49:08,337 --> 00:49:09,366
(Catching in the air)

1161
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:10,466
(Did you see that?)

1162
00:49:10,467 --> 00:49:13,006
- Did you see that?
- They're really agile.

1163
00:49:13,007 --> 00:49:18,377
(It snatched it in the air with its talons nimbly.)

1164
00:49:19,107 --> 00:49:20,777
(That's amazing.)

1165
00:49:21,477 --> 00:49:23,877
- So many hawks appeared.
- Oh, my.

1166
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,546
Look at them crowding up.

1167
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:27,617
Goodness.

1168
00:49:27,817 --> 00:49:30,657
Isn't it incredible? There's a flock of them.

1169
00:49:31,227 --> 00:49:33,456
(It's a feeding hawk tour that Hee Won mentioned.)

1170
00:49:33,457 --> 00:49:34,697
It's unbelievable how many hawks there are.

1171
00:49:35,857 --> 00:49:38,327
Gosh, there's a huge flock of them.

1172
00:49:39,897 --> 00:49:41,696
- Oh, my. It's fascinating.
- It's so scary.

1173
00:49:41,697 --> 00:49:42,937
(Hee Won Tour draws you in slowly.)

1174
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:46,767
There are unusually many hawks here. There's a group of them.

1175
00:49:46,867 --> 00:49:47,937
Why is that?

1176
00:49:48,737 --> 00:49:55,077
(Where gigantic hawks as big as an adult's upper body live)

1177
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:59,447
(It's a pond in a quiet village.)

1178
00:50:00,087 --> 00:50:03,756
(There's a secret to this pond.)

1179
00:50:03,757 --> 00:50:05,687
(Is it connected to the sea?)

1180
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:08,256
(A seawater pond formed by the receding sea)

1181
00:50:08,257 --> 00:50:11,197
(The hawks' pond)

1182
00:50:11,827 --> 00:50:13,226
(That's why there are sea creatures living in the pond.)

1183
00:50:13,227 --> 00:50:14,597
(Gray mullet)

1184
00:50:15,037 --> 00:50:16,437
(Stingray)

1185
00:50:16,537 --> 00:50:18,007
(Sole)

1186
00:50:18,237 --> 00:50:22,007
(Including blowfish, a specialty in Shimonoseki)

1187
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:26,077
(Why are there hawks around a pond where fish live?)

1188
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:31,287
(By stealing fish food given by people)

1189
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,717
(The bread is mine.)

1190
00:50:35,317 --> 00:50:38,987
(The hawks became the neighbourhood's iconic figure.)

1191
00:50:39,927 --> 00:50:43,797
(The roles got reversed, and it became the hawks' pond.)

1192
00:50:44,427 --> 00:50:45,596
(The fish eat bread that fall in the water.)

1193
00:50:45,597 --> 00:50:48,397
There are fish over here too.

1194
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:50,736
When I dropped the toast bread,

1195
00:50:50,737 --> 00:50:52,337
- The fish are also huge.
- the hawks couldn't get it.

1196
00:50:52,707 --> 00:50:55,477
Don't they eat fish? Hawks usually feed on fish.

1197
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:56,706
I know.

1198
00:50:56,707 --> 00:50:57,737
(Turning down all questions)

1199
00:50:58,247 --> 00:51:00,376
- I want to try it too.
- Try it.

1200
00:51:00,377 --> 00:51:01,417
(Curious Eun Soo comes forward.)

1201
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,017
Hold this.

1202
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,146
(Passing down his expertise)

1203
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:05,216
Throw it up.

1204
00:51:05,217 --> 00:51:06,246
(Passing down his expertise)

1205
00:51:06,247 --> 00:51:07,647
(It's over.)

1206
00:51:08,457 --> 00:51:10,056
(They watch Eun Soo try it from afar.)

1207
00:51:10,057 --> 00:51:11,087
The hawks shouldn't gather around all of a sudden.

1208
00:51:12,587 --> 00:51:14,927
(Brave Eun Soo tries it without hesitation.)

1209
00:51:16,057 --> 00:51:17,097
There you go.

1210
00:51:18,067 --> 00:51:19,867
(Nice catch)

1211
00:51:20,897 --> 00:51:22,266
(Surprised)

1212
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:23,297
She's good.

1213
00:51:24,767 --> 00:51:26,737
- A fish popped up.
- Where?

1214
00:51:27,707 --> 00:51:28,777
To eat bread?

1215
00:51:30,677 --> 00:51:32,647
(Jumping)

1216
00:51:33,647 --> 00:51:35,747
(Let me have some too.)

1217
00:51:37,447 --> 00:51:38,617
A fish jumped.

1218
00:51:38,717 --> 00:51:41,016
- Yes, fish also jump up.
- Right?

1219
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:42,287
I saw a fish jump.

1220
00:51:43,817 --> 00:51:47,287
(Eun Soo quickly gets into it.)

1221
00:51:48,297 --> 00:51:50,156
- Do you want to hold a new piece?
- Yes.

1222
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:51,497
- A long one?
- Yes.

1223
00:51:53,567 --> 00:51:55,036
- Do you want to hold a new piece?
- Do you want to try it?

1224
00:51:55,037 --> 00:51:56,267
- A long one?
- Yes.

1225
00:51:57,437 --> 00:51:59,167
- Will it be okay?
- Be careful.

1226
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:04,007
(Striding courageously)

1227
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:05,946
(Nerve-racking)

1228
00:52:05,947 --> 00:52:07,007
- Look.
- Gosh.

1229
00:52:09,047 --> 00:52:10,777
(Snatching as soon as she raises her hand)

1230
00:52:12,147 --> 00:52:14,187
(It almost grabbed her finger as well.)

1231
00:52:14,487 --> 00:52:15,816
(Curious Eun Soo also got nervous.)

1232
00:52:15,817 --> 00:52:16,886
It broke.

1233
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:18,687
(Curious Eun Soo also got nervous.)

1234
00:52:19,057 --> 00:52:20,286
(Frozen)

1235
00:52:20,287 --> 00:52:21,327
I know.

1236
00:52:22,427 --> 00:52:24,226
- This one won't break.
- Let me see.

1237
00:52:24,227 --> 00:52:25,497
(Dong Il grabs it after watching.)

1238
00:52:25,827 --> 00:52:28,537
(Hiding it)

1239
00:52:29,837 --> 00:52:31,607
I'll take a photo of this important scene.

1240
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:35,706
(After checking the target precisely)

1241
00:52:35,707 --> 00:52:37,137
(Here you go.)

1242
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:39,307
(Come on.)

1243
00:52:40,507 --> 00:52:42,877
(Snatching it up neatly)

1244
00:52:43,617 --> 00:52:46,746
(Perfect teamwork between the hawk and Dong Il)

1245
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:47,947
The talons grab it.

1246
00:52:48,047 --> 00:52:50,656
(It flies over fiercely...)

1247
00:52:50,657 --> 00:52:52,627
(and grabs only the bread with its talons.)

1248
00:52:53,187 --> 00:52:55,097
(She captured the moment.)

1249
00:52:55,757 --> 00:52:56,997
(Both of her eyes are sparkling.)

1250
00:52:57,627 --> 00:53:00,467
(The tour guide is very excited.)

1251
00:53:01,127 --> 00:53:02,697
(Chuckling)

1252
00:53:04,567 --> 00:53:05,637
I took a photo of it.

1253
00:53:06,407 --> 00:53:09,607
(Mr. Hawk, that's mine!)

1254
00:53:11,007 --> 00:53:13,477
(A strong feeling lingers.)

1255
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,146
(Isn't it fun?)

1256
00:53:15,147 --> 00:53:17,476
- Didn't it snatch it away?
- How did it feel?

1257
00:53:17,477 --> 00:53:18,487
It's fun.

1258
00:53:19,287 --> 00:53:20,347
- Isn't it nice?
- Yes.

1259
00:53:21,387 --> 00:53:22,886
- Do you want some?
- Give him some too.

1260
00:53:22,887 --> 00:53:25,627
- Throw it.
- No, it's nice to hold it.

1261
00:53:25,957 --> 00:53:28,527
When it snatches it away, there's a loud sound.

1262
00:53:28,627 --> 00:53:29,627
Really?

1263
00:53:30,027 --> 00:53:31,027
(A loud sound?)

1264
00:53:31,028 --> 00:53:33,626
There's a sound of explosion.

1265
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,866
What if I get scratched a few times?

1266
00:53:34,867 --> 00:53:37,997
No. Don't take it all. They might also attack your other hand.

1267
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:39,737
Give this here.

1268
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:42,477
Tae Goo, hide it like I did.

1269
00:53:43,877 --> 00:53:47,207
(Taking steps carefully while hiding the bread)

1270
00:53:49,717 --> 00:53:50,746
Stretch out your hand.

1271
00:53:50,747 --> 00:53:51,747
(Keeping it as far as he can from himself)

1272
00:53:52,487 --> 00:53:53,917
(Fascinated)

1273
00:53:54,387 --> 00:53:55,917
(Pit-a-pat)

1274
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:57,487
Gosh.

1275
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:00,057
(Oh, my goodness)

1276
00:54:01,257 --> 00:54:03,856
(Frightened out of his wits, he runs...)

1277
00:54:03,857 --> 00:54:04,866
(into Hee Won's arms.)

1278
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,297
(Hee Won...)

1279
00:54:06,897 --> 00:54:07,966
(Curious)

1280
00:54:07,967 --> 00:54:09,096
It was quite close to his hand.

1281
00:54:09,097 --> 00:54:10,397
(The guide is satisfied.)

1282
00:54:11,397 --> 00:54:13,367
(It didn't touch him.)

1283
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:17,877
(Holding his frightened heart tightly)

1284
00:54:19,277 --> 00:54:20,976
(Breaking out in a cold sweat)

1285
00:54:20,977 --> 00:54:22,046
That startled me.

1286
00:54:22,047 --> 00:54:24,277
(Breaking out in a cold sweat)

1287
00:54:24,917 --> 00:54:26,316
- I want to try it too.
- Try it.

1288
00:54:26,317 --> 00:54:28,417
(Na Ra was watching it carefully.)

1289
00:54:28,687 --> 00:54:30,416
Na Ra, go and feed them.

1290
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:31,626
(Na Ra also sets off with bread in her hand.)

1291
00:54:31,627 --> 00:54:33,027
- Na Ra, stretch out your hand.
- Okay.

1292
00:54:33,827 --> 00:54:35,026
(Homebody Na Ra's challenge of a lifetime)

1293
00:54:35,027 --> 00:54:37,697
(Closing her eyes tightly)

1294
00:54:38,367 --> 00:54:40,627
(You can do it, Na Ra.)

1295
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,367
(What?)

1296
00:54:47,237 --> 00:54:50,707
(Suddenly, it's empty like there's nothing.)

1297
00:54:54,077 --> 00:54:55,647
Why aren't they coming? Are they full?

1298
00:54:56,447 --> 00:54:57,476
(There's no way...)

1299
00:54:57,477 --> 00:54:59,617
(Looking around)

1300
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:02,317
(Glancing)

1301
00:55:02,587 --> 00:55:05,457
(Shaking)

1302
00:55:06,157 --> 00:55:08,396
(She calls for them while waving it.)

1303
00:55:08,397 --> 00:55:09,626
Are you there?

1304
00:55:09,627 --> 00:55:10,657
(Mr. Hawk)

1305
00:55:11,457 --> 00:55:12,627
Are you there?

1306
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:15,266
(Quiet)

1307
00:55:15,267 --> 00:55:16,936
- Why aren't they coming?
- They must be full.

1308
00:55:16,937 --> 00:55:18,937
- Did they eat enough?
- How about this?

1309
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:21,237
Or this?

1310
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,707
They're also picky when it comes to people.

1311
00:55:25,677 --> 00:55:28,317
(My goodness)

1312
00:55:29,277 --> 00:55:30,317
Guys.

1313
00:55:30,917 --> 00:55:31,987
Na Ra.

1314
00:55:32,547 --> 00:55:33,747
Anybody home?

1315
00:55:34,087 --> 00:55:35,857
That bird is staring at me from there.

1316
00:55:36,487 --> 00:55:37,986
(Taking a break)

1317
00:55:37,987 --> 00:55:39,027
Guys.

1318
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:41,287
Hey!

1319
00:55:42,227 --> 00:55:43,956
- Wait for a while.
- Will I be here for half a day?

1320
00:55:43,957 --> 00:55:46,197
They're shy around strangers.

1321
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:48,837
- They must've eaten a lot.
- They're full.

1322
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:50,637
- It's coming.
- It's coming. Above you.

1323
00:55:51,037 --> 00:55:52,606
(Finally!)

1324
00:55:52,607 --> 00:55:53,766
(Flying by)

1325
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,907
It won't eat.

1326
00:55:55,037 --> 00:55:56,106
- It won't eat.
- It just flew by.

1327
00:55:56,107 --> 00:55:57,207
Guys.

1328
00:55:58,607 --> 00:55:59,676
It's delicious.

1329
00:55:59,677 --> 00:56:00,876
(Guys, it's delicious.)

1330
00:56:00,877 --> 00:56:02,277
They all left.

1331
00:56:03,017 --> 00:56:04,946
- Why won't they eat yours?
- Why did they leave?

1332
00:56:04,947 --> 00:56:06,087
(The hawks won't take what's being offered.)

1333
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:07,647
They're gone.

1334
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:09,816
- They shouldn't pass by.
- It's here.

1335
00:56:09,817 --> 00:56:11,727
- Gosh, it startled me.
- It's here.

1336
00:56:12,757 --> 00:56:14,626
- They shouldn't pass by.
- Guys.

1337
00:56:14,627 --> 00:56:16,027
(Just one bite, please.)

1338
00:56:16,227 --> 00:56:17,296
Here.

1339
00:56:17,297 --> 00:56:19,397
(There's no reason for them not to eat the snack.)

1340
00:56:20,067 --> 00:56:21,496
They shouldn't just pass by.

1341
00:56:21,497 --> 00:56:23,536
- You...
- They're just avoiding Na Ra.

1342
00:56:23,537 --> 00:56:25,137
(How strange)

1343
00:56:25,237 --> 00:56:26,536
They're just avoiding Na Ra.

1344
00:56:26,537 --> 00:56:27,766
(A surprise attack)

1345
00:56:27,767 --> 00:56:28,837
Did it take it?

1346
00:56:29,277 --> 00:56:30,277
(Surprised)

1347
00:56:30,737 --> 00:56:34,007
(A short but intense encounter)

1348
00:56:34,407 --> 00:56:35,817
It feels strange, doesn't it?

1349
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:37,946
- It feels strange, right?
- It feels like I was slapped.

1350
00:56:37,947 --> 00:56:39,316
- You feel like you were slapped?
- Yes.

1351
00:56:39,317 --> 00:56:40,786
(It feels like I was slapped by the hawk.)

1352
00:56:40,787 --> 00:56:41,956
Isn't it nice?

1353
00:56:41,957 --> 00:56:43,016
- It's fun.
- Yes.

1354
00:56:43,017 --> 00:56:44,257
- It is, right?
- Yes.

1355
00:56:45,657 --> 00:56:48,026
I'll try with multiple pieces.

1356
00:56:48,027 --> 00:56:49,227
Okay.

1357
00:56:49,427 --> 00:56:52,766
There's a lot of fish too. They look like catfish.

1358
00:56:52,767 --> 00:56:54,397
(He grabs a handful of bread and checks the sky.)

1359
00:56:54,827 --> 00:56:57,396
I'll attract their attention with this.

1360
00:56:57,397 --> 00:56:58,467
(Dong Il attracts their attention.)

1361
00:56:58,607 --> 00:57:00,837
They're gathering round.

1362
00:57:01,637 --> 00:57:03,037
They're here.

1363
00:57:03,437 --> 00:57:04,937
- They've gathered.
- One,

1364
00:57:05,477 --> 00:57:06,847
two, three.

1365
00:57:07,077 --> 00:57:09,477
They know I'm going to throw it when I do this.

1366
00:57:11,047 --> 00:57:12,887
You look like a bird controller.

1367
00:57:12,987 --> 00:57:14,047
Here.

1368
00:57:14,547 --> 00:57:16,687
(Come, hawks.)

1369
00:57:17,287 --> 00:57:20,427
(The hawks snatch it hastily.)

1370
00:57:20,527 --> 00:57:22,196
(It spots the bread.)

1371
00:57:22,197 --> 00:57:23,427
That's it.

1372
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:25,197
(It spots the bread.)

1373
00:57:29,097 --> 00:57:30,166
You guys.

1374
00:57:30,167 --> 00:57:33,267
(The man who controls hawks)

1375
00:57:33,707 --> 00:57:35,677
He looks like the father of hawks.

1376
00:57:35,877 --> 00:57:37,107
The father of hawks?

1377
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:39,976
It's so close.

1378
00:57:39,977 --> 00:57:41,676
(He picks up the bread he dropped.)

1379
00:57:41,677 --> 00:57:43,847
(Dong Il is having fun with them.)

1380
00:57:44,477 --> 00:57:46,316
(He picks up the bread pieces dropped by others.)

1381
00:57:46,317 --> 00:57:48,786
(Na Ra too.)

1382
00:57:48,787 --> 00:57:50,887
(He picks up the bread pieces dropped by others.)

1383
00:57:51,317 --> 00:57:52,486
One, two, three.

1384
00:57:52,487 --> 00:57:54,187
(He keeps throwing them.)

1385
00:57:57,097 --> 00:57:58,826
It's so cool.

1386
00:57:58,827 --> 00:57:59,927
- It is.
- Right?

1387
00:58:00,567 --> 00:58:03,036
- It's fun.
- Right?

1388
00:58:03,037 --> 00:58:05,437
They're not raised by someone.

1389
00:58:05,807 --> 00:58:07,706
- The neighbour hawks.
- The neighbour hawks.

1390
00:58:07,707 --> 00:58:09,436
(The neighbour hawks)

1391
00:58:09,437 --> 00:58:10,607
They're neighbour hawks.

1392
00:58:12,977 --> 00:58:14,376
- It's fun, isn't it?
- Yes.

1393
00:58:14,377 --> 00:58:15,846
(Feeding Hawks Tour unexpectedly turns out to be fun.)

1394
00:58:15,847 --> 00:58:16,977
It's nice.

1395
00:58:17,677 --> 00:58:18,917
This is something new.

1396
00:58:19,487 --> 00:58:21,546
It really is nice, right? How was it?

1397
00:58:21,547 --> 00:58:23,087
The hawks... Dong Il.

1398
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:24,816
Eun Soo, did you enjoy the hawks?

1399
00:58:24,817 --> 00:58:26,026
- Yes, it was fun.
- The neighbour hawks.

1400
00:58:26,027 --> 00:58:27,126
It was fun.

1401
00:58:27,127 --> 00:58:28,326
(They were doubtful at first, but they're very satisfied!)

1402
00:58:28,327 --> 00:58:29,757
I can't believe there are so many hawks.

1403
00:58:30,327 --> 00:58:33,696
Ms. Takamatsu introduced this place.

1404
00:58:33,697 --> 00:58:35,266
(They head to the next course expectantly!)

1405
00:58:35,267 --> 00:58:36,966
- Ms. Takamatsu.
- She recommended the place?

1406
00:58:36,967 --> 00:58:38,066
Yes.

1407
00:58:38,067 --> 00:58:40,266
(They're about to head to the next destination.)

1408
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:42,407
(The seat is empty?)

1409
00:58:43,137 --> 00:58:46,077
(Where is Eun Soo?)

1410
00:58:48,147 --> 00:58:50,477
(She spots Eun Soo.)

1411
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,246
(Eun Soo was walking toward the House.)

1412
00:58:52,247 --> 00:58:53,616
(Looking around)

1413
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:55,286
(The clouds!)

1414
00:58:55,287 --> 00:58:56,987
(Let's take a picture!)

1415
00:58:57,087 --> 00:58:58,456
(She stops for a while as if she's sad to leave...)

1416
00:58:58,457 --> 00:59:02,227
(and captures the sky in her phone.)

1417
00:59:02,827 --> 00:59:06,026
(Na Ra stares at her for a long while.)

1418
00:59:06,027 --> 00:59:07,267
How pretty.

1419
00:59:09,037 --> 00:59:11,667
(Her best friend is feeling proud.)

1420
00:59:12,207 --> 00:59:13,267
Let's go.

1421
00:59:15,007 --> 00:59:16,007
Let's go.

1422
00:59:16,008 --> 00:59:17,436
(He says, "Let's go.")

1423
00:59:17,437 --> 00:59:19,477
(Running)

1424
00:59:20,177 --> 00:59:22,317
(Eun Soo runs over like a puppy.)

1425
00:59:22,417 --> 00:59:24,347
- Let's go.
- How pretty.

1426
00:59:25,077 --> 00:59:26,117
Right?

1427
00:59:28,017 --> 00:59:29,656
(Smiling)

1428
00:59:29,657 --> 00:59:30,786
- Let's go.
- Wait.

1429
00:59:30,787 --> 00:59:32,887
(She's too shy to say it to her.)

1430
00:59:33,127 --> 00:59:34,686
(Hee Won saw that.)

1431
00:59:34,687 --> 00:59:36,957
(Laughing)

1432
00:59:37,297 --> 00:59:38,527
- Eun Soo.
- Yes?

1433
00:59:38,897 --> 00:59:41,837
When we were all in the car,

1434
00:59:42,237 --> 00:59:44,297
- you took pictures of the sky.
- Yes.

1435
00:59:44,737 --> 00:59:46,737
Na Ra called you pretty.

1436
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:48,637
- Really?
- Yes.

1437
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,236
(Really?)

1438
00:59:50,237 --> 00:59:51,907
She said, "How pretty."

1439
00:59:52,407 --> 00:59:54,207
(Giggling)

1440
00:59:54,577 --> 00:59:56,076
(Hee Won even relays her feelings.)

1441
00:59:56,077 --> 00:59:57,847
(Proud of himself)

1442
00:59:58,687 --> 01:00:03,217
(They drive in the car filled with love.)

1443
01:00:04,657 --> 01:00:08,627
(The view outside has changed.)

1444
01:00:09,297 --> 01:00:11,526
(Blue sky above the roof)

1445
01:00:11,527 --> 01:00:12,566
I didn't know.

1446
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:15,126
Dong Il, look at the road stretched out.

1447
01:00:15,127 --> 01:00:16,667
- It...
- It's pretty.

1448
01:00:17,797 --> 01:00:19,266
It's like a work of art.

1449
01:00:19,267 --> 01:00:21,837
(The picturesque view unfolds in front of them.)

1450
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:28,977
(Driving on the road that meets the sky)

1451
01:00:31,847 --> 01:00:35,117
(When you look outside absent-mindedly...)

1452
01:00:35,387 --> 01:00:38,187
(Between the greens, )

1453
01:00:38,487 --> 01:00:41,897
(you can see white rocks.)

1454
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,796
(They're limestone formed by the touch of nature...)

1455
01:00:43,797 --> 01:00:45,497
(over a few hundred thousand years.)

1456
01:00:45,967 --> 01:00:49,697
(The land where rocks and the meadow blend in harmony)

1457
01:00:50,937 --> 01:00:55,477
(Karst grassland)

1458
01:00:56,677 --> 01:00:59,477
(The beautiful view sculptured by time)

1459
01:00:59,647 --> 01:01:01,147
It's nice to drive this road...

1460
01:01:01,547 --> 01:01:04,046
when the weather is nice.

1461
01:01:04,047 --> 01:01:07,387
(They admire the beautiful grassland as they drive.)

1462
01:01:07,587 --> 01:01:09,357
I've been to this car park before.

1463
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:12,486
(I've been to this car park before.)

1464
01:01:12,487 --> 01:01:14,357
You've been here.

1465
01:01:14,987 --> 01:01:16,426
You've been here.

1466
01:01:16,427 --> 01:01:18,867
- Hee Won, since just now...
- Come on.

1467
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:20,626
It's green all around,

1468
01:01:20,627 --> 01:01:22,496
so I can't tell where I am.

1469
01:01:22,497 --> 01:01:23,636
(The tour guide's memory is fuzzy again.)

1470
01:01:23,637 --> 01:01:26,436
Back then, it was all burned,

1471
01:01:26,437 --> 01:01:28,566
- That's here?
- so it was completely black.

1472
01:01:28,567 --> 01:01:30,637
(It was black here?)

1473
01:01:31,037 --> 01:01:36,647
(The mountain that was completely black and burned.)

1474
01:01:36,917 --> 01:01:40,887
(What's the burned mountain that Hee Won saw?)

1475
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:45,487
(It is the same karst grassland!)

1476
01:01:45,687 --> 01:01:49,257
(In late fall, they set fire to the mountain on purpose.)

1477
01:01:50,027 --> 01:01:51,356
(They remove weed and pests and make space for sprouts.)

1478
01:01:51,357 --> 01:01:53,796
Imagine this whole place in black.

1479
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:55,366
Both sides?

1480
01:01:55,367 --> 01:01:56,866
They were completely black.

1481
01:01:56,867 --> 01:01:58,337
(It's a ritual to welcome the year's spring.)

1482
01:01:59,037 --> 01:02:03,377
(It's a similar tradition to Korea's sheaf burning.)

1483
01:02:03,677 --> 01:02:07,707
(The mountain that turned black...)

1484
01:02:10,947 --> 01:02:15,787
(uses the burned grass as fertilizer and becomes green grassland again.)

1485
01:02:16,057 --> 01:02:18,757
(Beautiful grassland made by nature)

1486
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:22,827
(What awaits us down here?)

1487
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:24,557
Here.

1488
01:02:24,957 --> 01:02:26,296
- Have we arrived?
- Yes.

1489
01:02:26,297 --> 01:02:27,767
(After going through his memories, they arrive at the second place.)

1490
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:31,296
Now that I'm here, I remember I was here.

1491
01:02:31,297 --> 01:02:33,607
(Now that I'm here, I remember I was here.)

1492
01:02:35,237 --> 01:02:36,907
(Hee Won tour's second course!)

1493
01:02:37,307 --> 01:02:38,747
- Look.
- Here.

1494
01:02:39,777 --> 01:02:41,576
Thank you for driving.

1495
01:02:41,577 --> 01:02:42,977
I need to get down quickly.

1496
01:02:46,017 --> 01:02:49,687
(He drove for so long until his legs are cramped.)

1497
01:02:51,387 --> 01:02:54,757
(The cave entrance feels rather empty.)

1498
01:02:55,597 --> 01:02:58,897
(Is that the entrance?)

1499
01:02:59,827 --> 01:03:02,396
(The simple building in front seems to be the cave entrance.)

1500
01:03:02,397 --> 01:03:05,466
How many floors down to the cave?

1501
01:03:05,467 --> 01:03:08,267
If I remember correctly, was it 100m?

1502
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,177
One hundred meters?

1503
01:03:11,377 --> 01:03:12,407
Was it not?

1504
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:14,776
I'm not sure.

1505
01:03:14,777 --> 01:03:16,317
(One characteristic of Hee Won Tour: The guide doesn't remember clearly.)

1506
01:03:17,317 --> 01:03:19,087
- Was it not?
- You're not sure.

1507
01:03:19,217 --> 01:03:20,347
I'm not sure.

1508
01:03:20,747 --> 01:03:22,057
Was it 100m?

1509
01:03:23,457 --> 01:03:25,056
- Hello.
- Hello.

1510
01:03:25,057 --> 01:03:27,457
Thank you for visiting this place.

1511
01:03:27,587 --> 01:03:31,226
I'm Murakami, your cave guide.

1512
01:03:31,227 --> 01:03:33,066
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1513
01:03:33,067 --> 01:03:34,396
I'll guide you safely.

1514
01:03:34,397 --> 01:03:36,997
(He's a guide.)

1515
01:03:37,437 --> 01:03:39,937
How long does the tour take?

1516
01:03:40,607 --> 01:03:44,707
Today's course will take about 1 and a half hours to 2.

1517
01:03:45,477 --> 01:03:46,747
Inside the cave?

1518
01:03:46,807 --> 01:03:48,447
(Surprised)

1519
01:03:49,217 --> 01:03:51,146
That's quite long.

1520
01:03:51,147 --> 01:03:52,647
(That's quite long.)

1521
01:03:53,687 --> 01:03:56,757
(Did it take that long?)

1522
01:03:56,957 --> 01:03:59,457
Please change your clothes first.

1523
01:04:00,857 --> 01:04:02,826
Now I remember. This was what happened last time.

1524
01:04:02,827 --> 01:04:03,996
(Laughing)

1525
01:04:03,997 --> 01:04:06,596
(He might've forgotten on purpose at this point.)

1526
01:04:06,597 --> 01:04:07,867
Size large, please.

1527
01:04:08,797 --> 01:04:10,336
(Hee Won Tour has a separate outfit for the tour.)

1528
01:04:10,337 --> 01:04:11,367
(Shocked)

1529
01:04:11,737 --> 01:04:13,137
I need to wear this?

1530
01:04:15,237 --> 01:04:17,436
It should be bearable since it will be cool. Right?

1531
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:18,737
(He twists his whole body to get changed into the clothes.)

1532
01:04:19,877 --> 01:04:21,746
(Struggling)

1533
01:04:21,747 --> 01:04:24,047
I could wear it easily when I did last time.

1534
01:04:24,977 --> 01:04:28,516
(He wears the tour clothes that became a bit smaller.)

1535
01:04:28,517 --> 01:04:30,256
(They start the tour now!)

1536
01:04:30,257 --> 01:04:32,527
We'll take the elevator to go down.

1537
01:04:33,027 --> 01:04:35,656
(As Hee Won said, they take the elevator to the cave.)

1538
01:04:35,657 --> 01:04:36,697
Let's go.

1539
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:43,566
Bye.

1540
01:04:43,567 --> 01:04:47,267
(Let's go to the cave!)

1541
01:04:49,707 --> 01:04:51,137
It's 80m.

1542
01:04:52,037 --> 01:04:54,147
It's 80m,

1543
01:04:54,247 --> 01:04:56,716
so we're going down about 20 floors.

1544
01:04:56,717 --> 01:04:58,946
(The entrance of the cave is 80m underground.)

1545
01:04:58,947 --> 01:05:03,017
(House on Wheels parked, 80m underground)

1546
01:05:04,187 --> 01:05:05,187
(Surprised)

1547
01:05:05,188 --> 01:05:06,787
This will be a unique experience.

1548
01:05:08,527 --> 01:05:11,327
(They arrive at the cave entrance.)

1549
01:05:11,457 --> 01:05:13,466
(Surprised)

1550
01:05:13,467 --> 01:05:15,937
(Amazed)

1551
01:05:17,237 --> 01:05:18,366
It's cool.

1552
01:05:18,367 --> 01:05:19,567
(It's cool!)

1553
01:05:21,007 --> 01:05:22,337
It's fascinating.

1554
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:27,447
(The entrance of the cave feels very chilly.)

1555
01:05:28,777 --> 01:05:30,047
Okay.

1556
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:32,747
I'll start explaining.

1557
01:05:33,487 --> 01:05:36,686
We're here now.

1558
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:39,026
- Here?
- Yes.

1559
01:05:39,027 --> 01:05:40,227
(He starts the briefing for the tour.)

1560
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,456
Tourists normally follow...

1561
01:05:43,457 --> 01:05:44,457
this blue route.

1562
01:05:44,497 --> 01:05:47,366
Tourists follow the blue path.

1563
01:05:47,367 --> 01:05:50,197
We'll explore this red route.

1564
01:05:50,737 --> 01:05:52,136
- I see.
- We'll take the red route.

1565
01:05:52,137 --> 01:05:54,066
(Ours is short.)

1566
01:05:54,067 --> 01:05:58,437
The distance is relatively short.

1567
01:05:58,737 --> 01:06:00,876
(But there's a mountain here, )

1568
01:06:00,877 --> 01:06:04,147
(and we'll cross a river here.)

1569
01:06:04,847 --> 01:06:08,617
(A mountain and a river?)

1570
01:06:17,357 --> 01:06:20,897
(Hee Won Cave Tour including a mountain and a river)

1571
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,937
(Normally, for a cave tour...)

1572
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:27,007
(You walk on a well-paved path...)

1573
01:06:27,337 --> 01:06:30,437
(and enjoy looking at rocks in various shapes and colours.)

1574
01:06:31,677 --> 01:06:36,147
(It's supposed to be a leisurely tour.)

1575
01:06:37,447 --> 01:06:38,877
It's just a natural cave.

1576
01:06:39,447 --> 01:06:41,086
There's nothing much. It's cool.

1577
01:06:41,087 --> 01:06:43,686
(For Hee Won Tour, it's just a natural cave as is.)

1578
01:06:43,687 --> 01:06:45,186
(Natural cave)

1579
01:06:45,187 --> 01:06:48,286
(They will explore the natural cave.)

1580
01:06:48,287 --> 01:06:52,057
(A cave exploration course)

1581
01:06:53,127 --> 01:06:55,397
I thought it'd be something simple.

1582
01:06:55,967 --> 01:06:57,237
I didn't expect this.

1583
01:06:57,737 --> 01:06:59,637
He said, "It's just a cave."

1584
01:07:00,507 --> 01:07:02,336
This will be nice. I'm serious.

1585
01:07:02,337 --> 01:07:04,607
(Hee Won Tour is very confident.)

1586
01:07:05,437 --> 01:07:07,107
Okay, let's go in.

1587
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,446
Akiyoshi Cave.

1588
01:07:09,447 --> 01:07:11,016
(They enter the cave.)

1589
01:07:11,017 --> 01:07:13,287
(Surprised)

1590
01:07:18,987 --> 01:07:22,697
(It feels very much like a cave from the entrance alone.)

1591
01:07:25,727 --> 01:07:28,796
(Surprised)

1592
01:07:28,797 --> 01:07:30,167
It's huge.

1593
01:07:31,037 --> 01:07:32,097
My gosh.

1594
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:33,937
Tae Goo, check below.

1595
01:07:34,107 --> 01:07:37,076
(What caught their attention...)

1596
01:07:37,077 --> 01:07:41,077
(is the 1st sight of the cave 80m underground.)

1597
01:07:41,907 --> 01:07:43,177
It's incredible.

1598
01:07:43,277 --> 01:07:47,417
(Although it's underground, the cave is pretty big.)

1599
01:07:47,747 --> 01:07:48,956
(Hee Won Tour)

1600
01:07:48,957 --> 01:07:50,116
My gosh.

1601
01:07:50,117 --> 01:07:51,186
(Hee Won Tour)

1602
01:07:51,187 --> 01:07:53,187
(Proud of himself)

1603
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,326
(The walk in the cave is pretty smooth until here.)

1604
01:07:55,327 --> 01:07:56,396
My gosh.

1605
01:07:56,397 --> 01:07:58,057
(My gosh)

1606
01:08:00,527 --> 01:08:02,597
Are you guys ready?

1607
01:08:03,597 --> 01:08:04,636
- Yes.
- Yes.

1608
01:08:04,637 --> 01:08:05,637
Are we going in here?

1609
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:08,067
We don't need to.

1610
01:08:14,577 --> 01:08:18,477
(They climb the fence and away from the path?)

1611
01:08:19,417 --> 01:08:23,757
(Instead of the normal tour course which is well-paved, )

1612
01:08:24,087 --> 01:08:26,526
(it's the entrance to the special course.)

1613
01:08:26,527 --> 01:08:31,197
(Cave exploration course)

1614
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:36,066
(It's a special course, but everyone can experience it...)

1615
01:08:36,067 --> 01:08:38,797
(as long as they make a reservation!)

1616
01:08:41,007 --> 01:08:42,706
(They enter the exploration course.)

1617
01:08:42,707 --> 01:08:44,006
Goodness.

1618
01:08:44,007 --> 01:08:45,577
(They enter the exploration course.)

1619
01:08:45,777 --> 01:08:47,446
Hold the rocks as you walk.

1620
01:08:47,447 --> 01:08:50,077
- Hold the rocks as you walk.
- Okay.

1621
01:08:51,847 --> 01:08:54,316
Be careful. Hold the rocks as you walk.

1622
01:08:54,317 --> 01:08:56,357
Hold the rocks as you walk.

1623
01:09:02,827 --> 01:09:09,537
(The mountain course is a downhill slope.)

1624
01:09:11,497 --> 01:09:15,737
(The cave is completely dark except where the lanterns shine.)

1625
01:09:17,607 --> 01:09:21,307
(They rely on each other's lights and walk down slowly.)

1626
01:09:21,977 --> 01:09:23,017
My gosh.

1627
01:09:24,277 --> 01:09:25,277
It's fun.

1628
01:09:26,617 --> 01:09:27,647
- Be careful.
- Okay.

1629
01:09:29,287 --> 01:09:30,616
(Na Ra's camera)

1630
01:09:30,617 --> 01:09:34,986
(Holding the chains tight)

1631
01:09:34,987 --> 01:09:36,626
- Hold tight, Na Ra.
- Okay.

1632
01:09:36,627 --> 01:09:38,097
(They go deeper.)

1633
01:09:45,137 --> 01:09:46,967
(Amazed)

1634
01:09:47,937 --> 01:09:51,077
(What did the see at the end of the downhill?)

1635
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,007
Now...

1636
01:09:54,935 --> 01:09:58,035
(What did the see at the end of the downhill?)

1637
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:04,445
(We'll step on the footholds and walk down one by one.)

1638
01:10:05,345 --> 01:10:07,545
We'll go down the ladder one by one.

1639
01:10:08,885 --> 01:10:09,955
One by one...

1640
01:10:14,025 --> 01:10:17,954
(Beyond the chains, )

1641
01:10:17,955 --> 01:10:21,065
(you can see a thrilling view.)

1642
01:10:21,465 --> 01:10:24,394
When I give you the signal from the bottom,

1643
01:10:24,395 --> 01:10:25,965
come down one by one.

1644
01:10:27,935 --> 01:10:30,335
(The cave expedition is very nervous from the steep slope.)

1645
01:10:31,705 --> 01:10:34,575
(Can the members climb down safely?)

1646
01:10:35,905 --> 01:10:37,015
(Do it...)

1647
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:38,415
(like me.)

1648
01:10:38,675 --> 01:10:39,985
(Come down...)

1649
01:10:40,185 --> 01:10:42,615
(like this.)

1650
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:45,355
He climbs down so fast.

1651
01:10:46,355 --> 01:10:47,524
He's amazing.

1652
01:10:47,525 --> 01:10:48,925
(In awe)

1653
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:51,895
Okay, I'm here.

1654
01:10:54,265 --> 01:10:56,194
- Come down.
- Okay.

1655
01:10:56,195 --> 01:10:58,064
(The first person to climb down...)

1656
01:10:58,065 --> 01:10:59,965
(is Hee Won.)

1657
01:11:01,365 --> 01:11:02,404
Okay.

1658
01:11:02,405 --> 01:11:06,944
(Hee Won's camera)

1659
01:11:06,945 --> 01:11:10,645
(Hee Won takes a step to the cliff without hesitation.)

1660
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:20,785
(He walks down carefully but quickly.)

1661
01:11:20,955 --> 01:11:24,155
(Stone)

1662
01:11:24,595 --> 01:11:27,395
(Hee Won kicks a stone while trying to step on a foothold.)

1663
01:11:27,665 --> 01:11:29,594
Dong Il, don't throw a stone down.

1664
01:11:29,595 --> 01:11:31,235
(Accusing innocent Dong Il)

1665
01:11:31,535 --> 01:11:33,535
Dong Il, don't throw a stone down.

1666
01:11:34,065 --> 01:11:36,304
(The sudden accusation...)

1667
01:11:36,305 --> 01:11:37,804
(makes him laugh.)

1668
01:11:37,805 --> 01:11:38,875
Okay.

1669
01:11:40,105 --> 01:11:42,104
(His way of making them feel more at ease)

1670
01:11:42,105 --> 01:11:44,144
(Sighing)

1671
01:11:44,145 --> 01:11:45,145
I'm covered in sweat.

1672
01:11:45,146 --> 01:11:46,315
(I'm covered in sweat.)

1673
01:11:46,585 --> 01:11:47,645
Okay, next.

1674
01:11:50,385 --> 01:11:52,255
(Next is Eun Soo.)

1675
01:11:52,485 --> 01:11:53,655
(Let's go.)

1676
01:11:53,955 --> 01:11:55,925
- What?
- Hold the chain.

1677
01:11:57,595 --> 01:11:59,125
(The chain)

1678
01:12:00,925 --> 01:12:02,934
(She follows Dong Il's advice and finds the foothold...)

1679
01:12:02,935 --> 01:12:04,365
(while holding the chain.)

1680
01:12:08,165 --> 01:12:10,435
(Stretching)

1681
01:12:10,635 --> 01:12:12,205
(Stretching)

1682
01:12:12,475 --> 01:12:15,905
(The distance between the footholds is a bit too far for Eun Soo.)

1683
01:12:19,045 --> 01:12:20,215
Good job.

1684
01:12:20,785 --> 01:12:21,815
Please move...

1685
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:23,355
- to that side.
- Okay.

1686
01:12:24,485 --> 01:12:27,055
(Eun Soo comes down safely too.)

1687
01:12:27,455 --> 01:12:29,855
(Laughing and panting)

1688
01:12:30,055 --> 01:12:31,055
(Panting)

1689
01:12:32,395 --> 01:12:33,395
It's amazing.

1690
01:12:33,396 --> 01:12:35,125
(It's amazing.)

1691
01:12:35,525 --> 01:12:40,035
(Eun Soo seems to be enjoying the thrilling cave exploration.)

1692
01:12:40,605 --> 01:12:41,765
It's worth...

1693
01:12:43,305 --> 01:12:45,605
coming to Japan, right?

1694
01:12:46,505 --> 01:12:48,945
- I didn't expect this.
- Be careful.

1695
01:12:50,315 --> 01:12:51,344
(Meanwhile, someone else arrives.)

1696
01:12:51,345 --> 01:12:53,545
Na Ra. It's such a special experience.

1697
01:12:54,615 --> 01:12:55,645
I'm Hee Won.

1698
01:12:57,215 --> 01:12:58,315
Why do you suddenly...

1699
01:12:59,255 --> 01:13:00,325
You're scared, aren't you?

1700
01:13:00,725 --> 01:13:02,755
(Laughing)

1701
01:13:03,525 --> 01:13:04,694
(Mumbling)

1702
01:13:04,695 --> 01:13:06,295
(Whining)

1703
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:07,625
My goodness.

1704
01:13:07,995 --> 01:13:09,835
(Cries of pain can be heard everywhere.)

1705
01:13:10,165 --> 01:13:11,195
Hee Won.

1706
01:13:11,995 --> 01:13:14,764
- Yes, Dong Il.
- I'm suffering because of you.

1707
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:15,904
(Laughing)

1708
01:13:15,905 --> 01:13:16,935
Watch out.

1709
01:13:17,635 --> 01:13:18,974
I'm suffering because of you.

1710
01:13:18,975 --> 01:13:20,005
(Tae Goo laughing)

1711
01:13:21,045 --> 01:13:22,174
Why did we come here?

1712
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,215
(Tae Goo laughing)

1713
01:13:23,475 --> 01:13:24,514
I'm suffering here.

1714
01:13:24,515 --> 01:13:25,575
(Tae Goo laughing)

1715
01:13:25,675 --> 01:13:28,085
(A rare moment of Tae Goo laughing)

1716
01:13:28,585 --> 01:13:29,614
Oh, dear.

1717
01:13:29,615 --> 01:13:30,615
(Oh, dear)

1718
01:13:30,815 --> 01:13:34,225
(He climbs down carefully after making Tae Goo laugh.)

1719
01:13:40,695 --> 01:13:42,424
Tae Goo came thinking he was going to Sapporo.

1720
01:13:42,425 --> 01:13:43,735
But he's stuck here.

1721
01:13:44,335 --> 01:13:45,594
(Shocked)

1722
01:13:45,595 --> 01:13:47,104
Poor him.

1723
01:13:47,105 --> 01:13:48,165
(Poor him.)

1724
01:13:48,335 --> 01:13:50,304
(Tae Goo thought he was going to Sapporo.)

1725
01:13:50,305 --> 01:13:51,335
It's fun.

1726
01:13:52,305 --> 01:13:55,805
(Thankfully, he's enjoying the exploration.)

1727
01:13:57,315 --> 01:13:58,315
Thank you.

1728
01:14:01,615 --> 01:14:03,484
It's worth trying.

1729
01:14:03,485 --> 01:14:05,115
Is that dust or water fog?

1730
01:14:05,685 --> 01:14:07,454
- It's water fog.
- Is it?

1731
01:14:07,455 --> 01:14:09,185
Yes. It's all water.

1732
01:14:10,055 --> 01:14:12,325
(Water?)

1733
01:14:12,595 --> 01:14:14,265
Is that... That's water.

1734
01:14:15,925 --> 01:14:20,104
(When they come down to the lower part of the cave, )

1735
01:14:20,105 --> 01:14:24,575
(they can see puddles here and there.)

1736
01:14:29,545 --> 01:14:33,144
(The unfamiliar landscape of the underground, )

1737
01:14:33,145 --> 01:14:35,515
(unseen from the surface)

1738
01:14:35,815 --> 01:14:36,815
(Even in the dark, )

1739
01:14:36,816 --> 01:14:38,455
- The water is crystal-clear.
- It's so clear.

1740
01:14:39,055 --> 01:14:42,725
(you can feel how crystal-clear the water is.)

1741
01:14:43,055 --> 01:14:44,625
That's shrimp.

1742
01:14:44,725 --> 01:14:46,965
- Where?
- Shrimp. That's shrimp.

1743
01:14:47,165 --> 01:14:48,965
- It's tiny.
- Shrimp.

1744
01:14:49,065 --> 01:14:51,295
- That tiny thing is?
- Yes, that's shrimp.

1745
01:14:51,895 --> 01:14:53,335
It's more like an anchovy.

1746
01:14:56,165 --> 01:14:59,535
The reason its eyes are so white is because they've degenerated.

1747
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:03,575
Many of these creatures live inside the cave.

1748
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:10,455
(They encountered fascinating cave life as soon as descended.)

1749
01:15:14,025 --> 01:15:17,525
You can also see some fascinating stones here.

1750
01:15:18,755 --> 01:15:21,395
There's a special stone on this floor.

1751
01:15:23,235 --> 01:15:25,364
(A special stone on the floor?)

1752
01:15:25,365 --> 01:15:26,405
It's pretty.

1753
01:15:28,805 --> 01:15:31,975
Here you can find...

1754
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:35,345
some pretty green stones.

1755
01:15:37,345 --> 01:15:42,545
(Malachite)

1756
01:15:43,515 --> 01:15:48,655
(It's the raw gemstone known as malachite.)

1757
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:51,855
(The malachite is green when found in nature.)

1758
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:56,895
(Its unique wave-like pattern is the key feature.)

1759
01:15:58,065 --> 01:16:01,305
(It's a unique mineral that caught people's attention.)

1760
01:16:01,405 --> 01:16:04,435
(It's widely used for decoration, )

1761
01:16:05,205 --> 01:16:09,305
(and it got inlaid in the FIFA World Cup trophy.)

1762
01:16:11,945 --> 01:16:14,545
(So it's a gemstone.)

1763
01:16:16,455 --> 01:16:19,714
(Touching)

1764
01:16:19,715 --> 01:16:22,985
It's a green gemstone.

1765
01:16:23,155 --> 01:16:25,894
Mr. Guide. Can I take it as a souvenir?

1766
01:16:25,895 --> 01:16:27,765
- No.
- No?

1767
01:16:28,895 --> 01:16:30,594
- No.
- I can't take it with me?

1768
01:16:30,595 --> 01:16:32,094
It's a special treasure of Japan.

1769
01:16:32,095 --> 01:16:33,905
- Okay.
- Okay.

1770
01:16:35,865 --> 01:16:38,234
(He's joking.)

1771
01:16:38,235 --> 01:16:40,075
Now, this time,

1772
01:16:40,975 --> 01:16:43,545
let's experience how dark the cave gets...

1773
01:16:44,075 --> 01:16:47,645
by turning off all the lights.

1774
01:16:47,945 --> 01:16:49,815
By turning off all the lights.

1775
01:16:50,585 --> 01:16:52,384
I'm going to get scared. I will stay next to the pillar.

1776
01:16:52,385 --> 01:16:53,385
(Blackout experience)

1777
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:54,625
All right.

1778
01:16:55,255 --> 01:16:58,554
(Adjusting headlamps in the safe zone before the pillar)

1779
01:16:58,555 --> 01:16:59,555
Like this?

1780
01:17:00,895 --> 01:17:04,295
We will turn the lights off for a minute.

1781
01:17:09,535 --> 01:17:14,344
(Guide, Na Ra, Dong Il, )

1782

(Tae Goo, Eun Soo, Hee Won's camera)

1783
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:24,915
(At a depth of 80 meters underground, )

1784
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:28,024
(complete darkness surrounds them)

1785
01:17:28,025 --> 01:17:29,484
(Exclaiming)

1786
01:17:29,485 --> 01:17:32,354
(Exclaiming)

1787
01:17:32,355 --> 01:17:33,694
(Complete darkness)

1788
01:17:33,695 --> 01:17:35,464
This is unbelievable.

1789
01:17:35,465 --> 01:17:39,065
(Whoa)

1790
01:17:40,265 --> 01:17:41,464
(In a cave without a single ray of light, )

1791
01:17:41,465 --> 01:17:42,664
(there's only the sound of water and wind.)

1792
01:17:42,665 --> 01:17:46,234
(Exclaiming)

1793
01:17:46,235 --> 01:17:49,574
(Gosh!)

1794
01:17:49,575 --> 01:17:50,974
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

1795
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:52,645
Gosh, you.

1796
01:17:53,545 --> 01:17:54,914
You...

1797
01:17:54,915 --> 01:17:57,714
(A bloody incident in the dark?)

1798
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:00,125
(Laughing)

1799
01:18:01,325 --> 01:18:03,824
(To prevent an incident, )

1800
01:18:03,825 --> 01:18:07,225
(lights are turned back on.)

1801
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:13,635
There's an interesting stone.

1802
01:18:15,335 --> 01:18:20,005
(A shining stone?)

1803
01:18:21,205 --> 01:18:22,275
Is that a ruby?

1804
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:25,844
No, it’s a type of stalactite.

1805
01:18:25,845 --> 01:18:27,015
(Disappointed)

1806
01:18:29,185 --> 01:18:32,754
(A special stalactite with large crystals lets light pass through.)

1807
01:18:32,755 --> 01:18:35,184
(Large-crystal stalactite, small-crystal stalactite)

1808
01:18:35,185 --> 01:18:40,625
(Light passes through, light blocked)

1809
01:18:41,025 --> 01:18:42,364
This is really interesting.

1810
01:18:42,365 --> 01:18:44,294
It's my first time to come to a place like this.

1811
01:18:44,295 --> 01:18:45,464
Same here. It's my first time too.

1812
01:18:45,465 --> 01:18:46,495
- Yes.
- Right.

1813
01:18:46,965 --> 01:18:48,065
This is worth a try.

1814
01:18:48,705 --> 01:18:51,335
(Hee Won Tour gives you the joy of exploring a cave.)

1815
01:18:51,535 --> 01:18:53,805
From this point on,

1816
01:18:54,405 --> 01:18:56,714
you must follow my instructions.

1817
01:18:56,715 --> 01:18:58,515
You must follow his instructions.

1818
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:00,385
We have to follow the same order.

1819
01:19:01,815 --> 01:19:03,554
It's super fascinating.

1820
01:19:03,555 --> 01:19:05,054
(They head to the final destination located in the deep zone.)

1821
01:19:05,055 --> 01:19:06,584
It's getting rougher.

1822
01:19:06,585 --> 01:19:08,124
(Current location)

1823
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:11,095
(They have to go deeper into the cave.)

1824
01:19:13,225 --> 01:19:14,265
Goodness.

1825
01:19:14,825 --> 01:19:16,464
Watch your head.

1826
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:18,664
Watch this rock.

1827
01:19:18,665 --> 01:19:20,505
Watch your head.

1828
01:19:22,865 --> 01:19:27,445
(From this point, it’s a natural cave in every direction!)

1829
01:19:28,845 --> 01:19:30,945
What's up with this rock? It's creepy.

1830
01:19:31,715 --> 01:19:34,684
This grows and becomes a stalactite.

1831
01:19:34,685 --> 01:19:36,215
That's super cool.

1832
01:19:39,115 --> 01:19:42,724
(They enter the crevice of the creepy and super cool rock.)

1833
01:19:42,725 --> 01:19:43,825
Be extra careful here.

1834
01:19:49,895 --> 01:19:52,895
Na Ra, you're moving fearlessly.

1835
01:19:53,765 --> 01:19:55,365
If you are not fearless here...

1836
01:19:55,605 --> 01:19:56,935
Right, if you don't move fearlessly,

1837
01:19:58,005 --> 01:19:59,875
you will be gone for good.

1838
01:20:00,845 --> 01:20:01,874
(Laughing)

1839
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:03,975
(Laughing)

1840
01:20:05,145 --> 01:20:07,014
(Moving through the cave isn't easy. Where is the final destination?)

1841
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:08,745
My head is spinning.

1842
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:12,014
The sound of the water is incredible.

1843
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:13,925
Check out the colour of the water.

1844
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:16,185
- It's emerald.
- The light.

1845
01:20:16,485 --> 01:20:18,224
Are we finally done walking?

1846
01:20:18,225 --> 01:20:20,425
(The water is emerald?)

1847
01:20:24,735 --> 01:20:26,264
That's amazing. It's so cool.

1848
01:20:26,265 --> 01:20:27,265
(After a tough journey, )

1849
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:32,975
(an emerald river unfolds before them.)

1850
01:20:34,105 --> 01:20:37,045
- It's so beautiful.
- It's emerald.

1851
01:20:39,475 --> 01:20:40,584
Are we riding a boat?

1852
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,515
(A river flowing gently 100 meters underground)

1853
01:20:42,945 --> 01:20:46,455
Now, we are going to ride a boat.

1854
01:20:46,825 --> 01:20:48,125
Now, we are going to ride a boat.

1855
01:20:48,325 --> 01:20:51,955
In the deeper parts, the water reaches a depth of four meters.

1856
01:20:52,825 --> 01:20:55,524
So please wear a life jacket.

1857
01:20:55,525 --> 01:20:56,525
(A cave river with an unbelievable 4-meter depth)

1858
01:20:57,695 --> 01:20:59,765
- That's how deep the water is?
- It's four meters.

1859
01:21:00,405 --> 01:21:02,765
(That's really deep.)

1860
01:21:03,735 --> 01:21:04,775
Should I wear it?

1861
01:21:05,635 --> 01:21:08,074
(Hee Won Tour)

1862
01:21:08,075 --> 01:21:13,745
(The highlight of Hee Won Tour is the cave river experience.)

1863
01:21:15,885 --> 01:21:19,054
(Hee Won and Eun Soo get on the boat first.)

1864
01:21:19,055 --> 01:21:22,654
You will sit down and then get on the boat.

1865
01:21:22,655 --> 01:21:24,755
- You have to sit, Eun Soo.
- Okay.

1866
01:21:26,155 --> 01:21:27,494
- Careful.
- Thank you.

1867
01:21:27,495 --> 01:21:30,095
(The light-weighted Eun Soo gets on the boat first.)

1868
01:21:31,935 --> 01:21:33,195
- Should I go in?
- Yes.

1869
01:21:35,865 --> 01:21:37,405
Please move forward.

1870
01:21:37,705 --> 01:21:40,644
(Moving forward)

1871
01:21:40,645 --> 01:21:41,645
(Excited)

1872
01:21:45,145 --> 01:21:47,884
(Hee Won gets on the boat too.)

1873
01:21:47,885 --> 01:21:48,915
Okay.

1874
01:21:49,645 --> 01:21:52,355
(Excited)

1875
01:21:53,155 --> 01:21:57,125
(Fascinated)

1876
01:21:59,395 --> 01:22:01,565
- Bye.
- Watch your head.

1877
01:22:02,665 --> 01:22:07,705
(Eun Soo and Hee Won start crossing the river.)

1878
01:22:14,405 --> 01:22:17,974
(From the boat, you encounter...)

1879
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:23,115
(the unfamiliar scenery.)

1880
01:22:24,615 --> 01:22:30,024
(They're under the high cave ceiling filled with huge rocks.)

1881
01:22:30,025 --> 01:22:32,595
(They're under the high cave ceiling filled with huge rocks.)

1882
01:22:34,765 --> 01:22:37,764
- This is fascinating.
- I know.

1883
01:22:37,765 --> 01:22:41,665
(The wonder of the underground world continues to fascinate them.)

1884
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:54,885
I never thought I would be riding a boat inside a cave.

1885
01:22:55,715 --> 01:22:58,184
This is very unique.

1886
01:22:58,185 --> 01:22:59,814
We can't experience something like this again.

1887
01:22:59,815 --> 01:23:06,725
(It's a fascinating, special, and rare experience.)

1888
01:23:10,435 --> 01:23:13,564
It looked as if he had another reason for bringing us here.

1889
01:23:13,565 --> 01:23:15,664
- Me?
- He made it seem...

1890
01:23:15,665 --> 01:23:17,475
like there was another reason.

1891
01:23:18,305 --> 01:23:24,215
(Here's why Hee Won brought them to the cave.)

1892
01:23:26,145 --> 01:23:27,185
Okay.

1893
01:23:27,915 --> 01:23:29,515
It's beautiful.

1894
01:23:30,655 --> 01:23:32,155
Hello, there.

1895
01:23:35,755 --> 01:23:40,865
(The family enjoys the experience Hee Won wanted to share with them.)

1896
01:23:45,935 --> 01:23:47,235
It was so fascinating.

1897
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,705
The water was pure emerald.

1898
01:23:52,935 --> 01:23:54,544
When you see a cave river in a movie,

1899
01:23:54,545 --> 01:23:57,945
it's depicted to be pure emerald.

1900
01:23:58,245 --> 01:24:02,615
I thought that was just nice visual effects.

1901
01:24:02,715 --> 01:24:04,415
But it was grounded in reality.

1902
01:24:04,885 --> 01:24:07,424
It was clearly emerald.

1903
01:24:07,425 --> 01:24:11,195
(The true sight of the cave river we thought was movie magic.)

1904
01:24:13,155 --> 01:24:15,994
(Thanks to Hee Won, they get to see the new world.)

1905
01:24:15,995 --> 01:24:17,565
It's beautiful.

1906
01:24:20,935 --> 01:24:23,635
Compared to this, humans are nothing.

1907
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:25,805
- Right.
- Right?

1908
01:24:27,105 --> 01:24:29,375
We are just some cute things.

1909
01:24:30,845 --> 01:24:34,485
(The majestic nature humbles the two cute human beings.)

1910
01:24:36,045 --> 01:24:38,655
(While enjoying the fascinating exploration...)

1911
01:24:43,425 --> 01:24:48,024
(Tae Goo's boat fiercely chases...)

1912
01:24:48,025 --> 01:24:51,435
(after the two cute human beings.)

1913
01:24:52,265 --> 01:24:55,935
(For your reference, )

1914
01:25:00,235 --> 01:25:03,945
(he's been quiet this whole time.)

1915
01:25:04,845 --> 01:25:08,544
(This is how Tae Goo will remember this moment.)

1916
01:25:08,545 --> 01:25:11,115
That moment was very special to me.

1917
01:25:12,015 --> 01:25:15,525
(He's enjoying the special moment.)

1918
01:25:17,355 --> 01:25:18,894
(After a short and special voyage)

1919
01:25:18,895 --> 01:25:20,424
You have to hold this rock.

1920
01:25:20,425 --> 01:25:22,665
Hold my hand. I got you.

1921
01:25:23,295 --> 01:25:25,365
Okay.

1922
01:25:25,795 --> 01:25:28,204
You can get off now. Na Ra first.

1923
01:25:28,205 --> 01:25:29,665
(Until the end, Hee Won Tour makes sure you travel comfortably.)

1924
01:25:29,765 --> 01:25:30,805
Okay.

1925
01:25:31,575 --> 01:25:34,405
- You're next, Dong Il.
- Thank you.

1926
01:25:35,145 --> 01:25:37,175
- Thank you.
- Well done.

1927
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:42,215
(Tae Goo is the last to arrive.)

1928
01:25:44,585 --> 01:25:46,485
- Tae Goo came very quickly.
- I know.

1929
01:25:47,655 --> 01:25:51,054
This is like a scene from a movie, isn't it?

1930
01:25:51,055 --> 01:25:53,694
- It is.
- When characters are lost.

1931
01:25:53,695 --> 01:25:56,124
(Hee Won Tour made them feel like they were in a movie scene.)

1932
01:25:56,125 --> 01:25:57,165
Okay.

1933
01:25:59,035 --> 01:26:01,434
(They take photos at the mysterious place.)

1934
01:26:01,435 --> 01:26:03,465
What did you think of my tour?

1935
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:08,004
- I really enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

1936
01:26:08,005 --> 01:26:09,104
(The guide was forgetful, but the tour was worthwhile.)

1937
01:26:09,105 --> 01:26:10,515
Thank you. Well done.

1938
01:26:12,945 --> 01:26:19,885
(Thank you, Hee Won Tour.)

1939
01:26:20,391 --> 01:26:24,161
(They will once again cross the ocean.)

1940
01:26:24,501 --> 01:26:27,971
(The real destination of House on Wheels)

1941
01:26:28,071 --> 01:26:32,141
(The land of pristine nature)

1942
01:26:32,741 --> 01:26:35,271
(A land brimming with midsummer sunlight...)

1943
