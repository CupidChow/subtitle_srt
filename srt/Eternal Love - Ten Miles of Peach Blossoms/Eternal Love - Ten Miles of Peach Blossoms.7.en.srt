”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,480
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,060
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,600
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,110
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,410
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,080
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,740
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,220
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,750
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,430
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,970
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,380
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,020
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,520
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,060
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,600
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,040
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,960
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,780
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,080
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,630
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,020
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,790
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,560
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,810
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,990
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,940
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Episode 7]

31
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,080
Teacher? Teacher!

32
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,180
Teacher! Teacher.

33
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,040
Teacher.

34
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,530
Zhe Yan, when will my teacher regain consciousness?

35
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,150
Young Fifth, Mo Yuan's soul has disintegrated.

36
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,690
Don't you have the strongest magic in all of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses?

37
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,790
Aren't you his older brother? Why won't you save him?

38
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,030
Zhe Yan, why won't you save him? Zhe Yan!

39
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,790
Young Fifth, your teacher used his spirit as sacrifice for the Donghuang Bell.

40
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,820
No one can save him.

41
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,240
In the past, Teacher told me that

42
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,260
Donghuang Bell needs a spirit as sacrifice.

43
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,430
But Teacher also told me that,

44
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,050
the one who made the Donghuang Bell is him,

45
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,600
that he would have a way to stop it.

46
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,860
And I just believed him.

47
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,180
Teacher got struck by three heavenly lightning strikes because of me.

48
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,740
His injury wasn't fully healed.

49
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,220
It's all my fault.

50
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,840
Fourth Older Brother, everything's my fault.

51
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,880
Young Fifth,

52
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,530
do you still remember what your teacher said before he left?

53
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,160
"Wait for me."

54
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,190
Teacher did say that.

55
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,510
What kind of person is Mo Yuan?

56
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:26,420
Since he left us a promise, then he'll definitely return.

57
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,980
- Really?
- You should know him better than I do.

58
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,220
That's right.

59
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,390
Since Teacher wants us to wait, then he will definitely return.

60
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,810
What I must do now is to preserve his body,

61
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,650
then wait for his return.

62
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,640
Young Fifth, you're seriously injured.

63
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Why not follow me back to Green Hill?

64
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,110
I don't want to go anywhere.

65
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,810
I want to stay here and keep Teacher company.

66
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,950
If you're going to stay here,

67
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:53,290
then I'll accompany you to guard Mo Yuan here.

68
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,240
Just now in order to comfort Young Fifth, I said Mo Yuan would return.

69
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,070
Actually, I don't think it's possible either.

70
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,130
Mo Yuan's soul has scattered.

71
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,230
How can he come back?

72
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,690
Zhen Zhen, it looks like you don't really understand Mo Yuan.

73
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,770
We grew up together.

74
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:19,670
If he isn't going to return, he wouldn't leave behind those words to torment Young Fifth.

75
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,190
You're saying that...?

76
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,990
Who knows? He just might be able to return.

77
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,710
Ah Yin!

78
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,720
Stop!

79
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,830
What are you doing?!

80
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,890
Teacher.

81
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:45,960
Before, you already knew that I was a wild fox. Right?

82
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,860
You didn't know I was a nine-tailed white fox.

83
00:08:53,280 --> 00:09:01,250
Drinking the blood from the heart of a nine-tailed white fox can protect a person's body from decaying.

84
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:12,950
In the past, I kept feeling that other than the nice appearance of the nine-tailed white fox,

85
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,540
there was nothing else that was of value.

86
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,120
But I'm especially grateful to my parents for giving me this life today.

87
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,390
Teacher,

88
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:33,270
you should drink the blood of my heart.

89
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,940
At worst, I'll leave with you.

90
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,040
Still I'll be content.

91
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,640
Winged Monarch!

92
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,740
You may rise, my dear subjects!

93
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,550
Yes!

94
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,780
When I return, I will reorganize our military.

95
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:40,580
After 10,000 years, we'll exact revenge for the former monarch and purge the Heavenly Palace.

96
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,550
Revenge for the former monarch and purge the Heavenly Palace!

97
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,250
What?

98
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,460
Second Younger Brother, you still have thoughts about this position as Winged Monarch?

99
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,100
- I wouldn't dare.
- Wouldn't dare?!

100
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:04,040
I have received the Blue Robe to succeed the former monarch's title.

101
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,820
Why aren't you kneeling?

102
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,160
Father's corpse isn't even cold yet.

103
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,130
No. Father's body hasn't even been found yet.

104
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,770
Maybe he isn't even dead.

105
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,600
Why are you so anxious, Eldest Brother?

106
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:31,230
In the past, I said that if one day I become the Winged Monarch, the first life I take is yours.

107
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,170
Thank you for being so thoughtful of me.

108
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,430
In the past, Father murdered my mother for the sake of your mother.

109
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,490
I will never forget this grudge.

110
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,380
That's right.

111
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,820
My birth mother also died by your hands.

112
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,660
Since it's come to this, I won't hide it from you any longer.

113
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,980
True.

114
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,210
I personally killed that slut.

115
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:10,980
Just like this, I choked her little by little to death.

116
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,200
How do you have this kind of inner power?

117
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,340
Before, it was just for self-defense.

118
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,980
I didn't expect it to come in handy now.

119
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,440
This is not bad, either. Don't you think, Elder Brother?

120
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,730
How can this be?

121
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,090
Your powers aren't even one third up to par to the former monarch's.

122
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,750
Yet you dare to massacre the Heavenly Palace?

123
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,380
Are you planning to sacrifice our lives, too?

124
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,920
From our original 200,000 soldiers, we're down to only 30,000 left.

125
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,330
You've never even considered caring for the surviving soldiers nor honoring the dead soldiers.

126
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:53,190
You didn't even feel compassion as a monarch.

127
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,480
You only thought about getting that Blue Robe so you could be crowned the next Winged Monarch.

128
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,330
How can you be our Winged Monarch when you have no honor and no compassion?

129
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,290
I'm the crowned prince of the Winged Tribe.

130
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,060
What's wrong with me inheriting the Winged Monarch title?

131
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:13,520
As for you... The royal soldiers will definitely hunt you down when you return.

132
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,110
We've never thought about rebelling against the royal family.

133
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,120
We just wanted to support His Second Highness as the Winged Monarch.

134
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,080
As long as His Second Highness becomes the Winged Monarch,

135
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,860
the Heavenly Monarch will accept our surrender and leave the Winged Realm alone.

136
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,840
How dare you conspire with the Heavenly Tribe?

137
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,350
Lock him up in the Winged Realm's Land of Extreme Coldness.

138
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,410
Have someone watch him night and day.

139
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,380
That golden lion is also Li Yuan's ally.

140
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,980
Arrest him quickly and lock him up with Li Yuan.

141
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,830
Also, do not let the princess know about this.

142
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,350
Anyone that disobeys these orders will die.

143
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,070
Yes! Let's go.

144
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,610
Release me! Li Jing, I won't let you get away with this!

145
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,380
I'll surely return and kill you!

146
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,220
Release me, Li Jing! Release me!

147
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,170
Li Jing! I'll surely return and kill you for sure!

148
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,470
Li Jing!

149
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,020
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

150
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,880
Congratulations, Winged Monarch, for getting rid of the rebels.

151
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,540
If I failed today, would you have run away?

152
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,230
I'm completely loyal to Mighty Monarch.

153
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,320
The sun and moon are my witness.

154
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,960
My dear consort.

155
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,460
Mighty Monarch.

156
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,460
You're quite an impressive woman.

157
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,540
Whether it's when you begged Father Monarch back then,

158
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,170
or when you used the pity act to steal the formation map from Kunlun Void,

159
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,330
I had no choice but to see you in a different light.

160
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,990
Everything that I did was for you.

161
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,820
For me?

162
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,440
That's also true.

163
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,800
I'm not a good person, either.

164
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,800
We're a perfect match.

165
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,950
It's fate, too.

166
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,370
Mo Yuan already passed away for over two months.

167
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,580
I sent eighteen high immortals to help with his funeral,

168
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,920
but they were driven away by a young High Immortal.

169
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,380
Why is that young High Immortal so bossy?

170
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,890
The Heavenly Palace is full of immortals.

171
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,460
Some like to joke around, and some don't.

172
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,590
High God Mo Yuan has seventeen disciples.

173
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,200
Some will have better personalities than others.

174
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,350
Why should you take it seriously?

175
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,190
Rarely do you speak on anyone's behalf, Emperor.

176
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,550
Since this is so, I will cease chasing after this matter.

177
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,280
Yang Cuo.

178
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,560
Go to Kunlun Void and give some warning,

179
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,190
to prevent this young High Immortal from destroying the alliance that our two tribes have just made.

180
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,870
Yes.

181
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,950
Go and bow to the Heavenly Monarch.

182
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,020
I bow to the Heavenly Monarch.

183
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,390
Rise.

184
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,100
Come here.

185
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,050
Has your parents named you yet?

186
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,790
I am only five hundred years old.

187
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,810
In our tribe, we can only have a name once we're a thousand years old.

188
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,750
I see.

189
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,750
Your Sujin Tribe all died at Ruoshui River.

190
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,000
Is it okay if I name you Su Jin?

191
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,570
Yes.

192
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:04,130
Su Jin, your whole tribe got annihilated for the Heavenly Tribe.

193
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,410
Stay here in the Heavenly Palace and I'll confer you the title Princess Zhaoren, is that okay?

194
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,290
Hurry and thank the Heavenly Monarch.

195
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,210
Thank you, Heavenly Monarch.

196
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,220
Yes. Rise.

197
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,880
Yang Cuo,

198
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,700
raise Su Jin like your goddaughter.

199
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,930
Don't let her feel wronged.

200
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,550
I will obey.

201
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,000
Father, please don't worry.

202
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,060
I will surely raise Su Jin like my real daughter.

203
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,680
Let's go, Su Jin.

204
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,010
Father Monarch wants me to raise Su Jin.

205
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,630
Is it because he blames me for not having kids?

206
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,190
You're overthinking. Between my three brothers, I'm the only one that is married.

207
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,280
Second Younger Brother and Third Younger Brother don't even have consorts.

208
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,150
There are also no other women in the palace.

209
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,480
Naturally Su Jin would have to be raised by us.

210
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,010
We have already been married for 30,000 years,

211
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,920
I wonder when we would be able to have our own kids.

212
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:37,030
Princess Consort Le Xu, perhaps you will find the answer to the problem you're worrying about in Kunlun Void.

213
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,410
- Kunlun Void?
- Kunlun Void?

214
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,270
Eldest Senior Brother.

215
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,160
They are His First Highness and Princess Consort Le Xu of the Heavenly Palace.

216
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,630
This is my seventeenth junior brother.

217
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,620
Your Highnesses.

218
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,340
We met once before at the great battle.

219
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,700
His Highness came today to speak about the Heavenly and Winged Tribes.

220
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,100
Let me speak.

221
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,750
High Immortal Si Yin, Heavenly Monarch just received the surrender letter not long ago.

222
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,770
There was a power change in Grand Purple Palace.

223
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,090
The eldest prince Li Yuan has been exiled.

224
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,900
The second prince Li Jing received the Blue Robe and ascended to the monarch throne.

225
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:44,040
On the day of his ascension, Li Jing offered the Heavenly Monarch the Cold Moon Lotus, a sacred item of the Winged Tribe, as a tribute.

226
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,390
Heavenly Monarch has accepted it.

227
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:52,330
Your Highness is trying to say that the Heavenly and Winged Tribes have formed an alliance,

228
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,080
so you don't want Kunlun Void to go take revenge. Am I right?

229
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,210
Since the new Winged Monarch has submitted himself to the Heavenly Monarch,

230
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,840
for the stability of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses, it's not right for any conflict to arise again.

231
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,560
As High God Mo Yuan's most favored disciple,

232
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,000
you surely wouldn't want to see the world fall into calamity.

233
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,800
Before I came to Kunlun Void, I was just a wild fox.

234
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,050
In these 20,000 years in Kunlun Void, my teacher never tried to suppress my innate personality.

235
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:26,390
I've never been able to fake politeness and endure indignation in silence.

236
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:33,540
Si Yin, in consideration that we were comrades in arms before, I kept showing tolerance.

237
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,800
I never thought that you would be this stubborn.

238
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,580
Do you really want me to discipline Mo Yuan's disciple on his behalf?

239
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:44,250
Your Highness, my teacher sacrificed his spirit to the Donghuang Bell to protect the Heavenly Tribe,

240
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,770
so why aren't disciples of Kunlun Void allowed to get revenge?

241
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,470
If Your Highness doesn't need anything else, I will take my leave.

242
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,340
Seventeenth!

243
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,980
Your First Highness, don't worry.

244
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,280
Seventeenth has always understood Teacher.

245
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,210
He is just currently suffering from the pain in his heart.

246
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,120
Hence, he spoke words that offended you.

247
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,400
Hope Your Highness won't put it to heart.

248
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,930
May Your Highness reply to Heavenly Monarch that since Qing Cang has been sealed,

249
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,800
Kunlun Void will never seek vengeance anymore.

250
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,840
Who touched the golden lotus?

251
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,990
Teacher.

252
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,650
Ah Yin, someone touched the golden lotus without permission.

253
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,360
I can't stay in Kunlun Void to keep you company anymore.

254
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:03,120
Once I cultivate into my human form, I won't remember you nor this place.

255
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,390
Ah Yin.

256
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,440
Teacher.

257
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,490
Teacher.

258
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:41,710
Teacher, was that you? Teacher.

259
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,990
The golden lotus suddenly withered just now. There were no signs beforehand.

260
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,740
Eldest Senior Brother, what should we do?

261
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,760
Your Highnesses.

262
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,410
Second Junior Brother forgot proper etiquette because Teacher's favorite golden lotus withered.

263
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,820
Your Highness, please forgive him.

264
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,790
It's fine.

265
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,830
Could it be you're also leaving with Teacher?

266
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,520
Your Highness, don't panic.

267
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,200
Teacher once said that this lotus has always been waiting for its master.

268
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,270
It's only temporarily staying here in Kunlun Void.

269
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:14,240
With Your Highness's appearance, it first withered and then turned into a golden light before disappearing.

270
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,050
I'm guessing that maybe the master it is waiting for is you.

271
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,060
Me?

272
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,130
How could it be me?

273
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,600
Everything in this world has a cause and effect.

274
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:32,000
Since Father God returned to a formless mass, Teacher has been caring for this golden lotus for thousands of years.

275
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,930
Now that Teacher is gone, since this golden lotus is fated with Your Highness,

276
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,200
it's also quite a fortunate event.

277
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,150
Seventeenth, you left in such a haste earlier.

278
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,880
I'm a bit worried.

279
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,330
You mustn't develop any thoughts of going to the Winged Realm to seek vengeance.

280
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,260
Seek vengeance?

281
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,370
This is a peace that Teacher exchanged with his life.

282
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,590
Why would I seek vengeance?

283
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,200
You're right.

284
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,520
You are the favorite disciple of Teacher.

285
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,250
How could you not know his thoughts?

286
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,530
Seventeenth, you have changed.

287
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,510
I'm sure that Teacher's soul in heaven will be in peace.

288
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,330
Teacher has been dead for so many days.

289
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,970
How come his body hasn't changing at all?

290
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,860
Could there be a secret in this cave?

291
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,050
Maybe, he's being protected by Father God.

292
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,950
When Father God returned to a formless mass, his body dispersed.

293
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:50,250
Seeing Teacher's body like this, I remembered a rumor.

294
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,650
What rumor?

295
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,900
The sacred item of the Winged Tribe, the Jaded Soul.

296
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,740
Jaded Soul?

297
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,230
Ancient scriptures have documented that if the Winged Tribe's sacred item Jaded Soul is placed in the mouth of a corpse,

298
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,120
it can forever preserve it.

299
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,390
Is that rumor true?

300
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,080
That's what is written in ancient texts.

301
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,220
It probably is true.

302
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,880
But our Kunlun Void now has an irreconcilable relationship with the Winged Tribe.

303
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,260
Even if we don't seek vengeance with them, we will never have any dealings with them.

304
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,830
Seventeenth, don't even think of forcefully stealing it.

305
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,200
Who are you?

306
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,730
The seventeenth disciple of Kunlun Void, Si Yin.

307
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,070
I need to see your Winged Monarch for an emergency.

308
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,300
You want the Jaded Soul?

309
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:02,420
If Winged Monarch still cares about our former relationship,

310
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,030
please lend the Jaded Soul to me.

311
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,950
Get up first.

312
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:14,440
I thought you had come for revenge.

313
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,690
On the battlefield, there is no right nor wrong.

314
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:23,950
Moreover, our two tribes are at peace with each other,

315
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:27,050
and you are the Winged Monarch personally anointed by the Heavenly Monarch.

316
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,950
Naturally, I wouldn't dare seek revenge.

317
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,490
I just want to borrow the Jaded Soul.

318
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:38,050
Although the Jaded Soul is a sacred item of my tribe,

319
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,760
other than its ability to preserve a corpse from ever rotting,

320
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,220
it has no other use.

321
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:52,750
Are you trying to use it for High God Mo Yuan?

322
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,910
I have my use for it.

323
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,160
Even if you're unwilling to tell me your use for it,

324
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:09,300
with our relationship, I should allow you to borrow it.

325
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,830
But with the change in our court, the Jaded Soul disappeared a while ago.

326
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,360
I'm really sorry, High Immortal.

327
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,720
- It's lost?
- Right.

328
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,920
Why is it lost?

329
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,930
I already told you that I don't even know the whereabouts of my father and brother,

330
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,880
never mind a measly Jaded Soul.

331
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,100
Thank you for telling me, Winged Monarch.

332
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,990
High Immortal Si Yin. You traveled so far to get here. Why don't you rest a little before leaving?

333
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:10,970
If you don't, it'll make my Grand Purple Palace seem like a bad host.

334
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:18,130
High Immortal, did you come seeking for this Jaded Soul?

335
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:26,360
Two days ago, His Mighty Monarch gifted it to me to help with the recovery of my wounds.

336
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,140
Qing Cang's whipping wasn't light.

337
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,370
I still have a lot of wounds on my body.

338
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:39,540
You should know that it's not good for a girl to have scars on her body.

339
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:47,830
If you want it, I'll give it to you.

340
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,530
What are you doing?

341
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,040
This is the item that you lost?!

342
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:31,980
In my entire life, the thing I regret the most is coming to Grand Purple Palace and meeting you, Li Jing.

343
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,780
You two are both as heartless as wolves.

344
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,710
What a perfect match.

345
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,520
From now on, I and your Grand Purple Palace have irreconcilable hostility between us!

346
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,100
- Ah Yin!
- Mighty Monarch!

347
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,150
Ah Yin!

348
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,180
- Mighty Monarch!
- Get lost!

349
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,440
Tell me. What are you after?

350
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,460
Mighty Monarch, you lied to him first, saying that you lost the Jaded Soul.

351
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,830
I just added to the lie that you made.

352
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:25,210
When did you get the right to interfere between him and me?

353
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:31,310
You and him? But he never cared about you.

354
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:37,410
When you listened to Si Yin talk constantly about his Teacher Mo Yuan while you lived under the Kunlun Void Mountains,

355
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:43,760
you were so jealous you wanted to kill Mo Yuan, but Si Yin never liked you.

356
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,140
He's from the Heavenly Tribe.

357
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,090
That's why you flirted with me.

358
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:53,900
I know that very well, but do you?

359
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,080
You've never been in his heart.

360
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,090
Did you know that?

361
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,520
Stop talking.

362
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,840
He is such a prideful person,

363
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,450
but today he came to beg you all for Mo Yuan.

364
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,280
You know that very well.

365
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,750
You were jealous. That's why you didn't give the Jaded Soul to him.

366
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,180
You're so jealous that you're about to go insane. Isn't that right?

367
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,910
Stop talking.

368
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,050
I'm also jealous.

369
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,250
I'm insanely jealous.

370
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:41,650
I've done so much for you, but you've never valued me.

371
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,320
Just for him,

372
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,070
you actually are treating me like this just for him?!

373
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,330
I've already given you the title of Winged Monarchess.

374
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,960
Isn't that enough?

375
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,920
Since we got married, you've never touched me.

376
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,900
What's the point of having the Winged Monarchess position?

377
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:11,150
So what if I'm above everyone else besides you?

378
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:18,380
It can't even compare to the few days we had under the Kunlun Void Mountain.

379
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,160
Don't mention Kunlun Void to me again.

380
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:44,950
If I don't mention it, can you forget it?

381
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,700
We haven't gathered like this to eat in a long time.

382
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,180
- That's right.
- That's right.

383
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:15,530
Since Ninth Senior Brother and Teacher passed away, it was never this lively again.

384
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,520
Let's stop talking about those sad things.

385
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,320
Come.

386
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,380
Today, we have wine so let's all get drunk!

387
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,690
Let's toast this cup to Teacher.

388
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,170
This cup is for Ninth Junior Brother.

389
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:25,200
Eldest Senior Brother, Ninth Senior Brother never drank wine.

390
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,510
Don't get him drunk.

391
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,770
That's right. That's right.

392
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,320
Ninth Junior Brother did have poor alcohol intolerance.

393
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:37,500
Compared to you, he was really a thousand miles apart.

394
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,860
Okay, let's eat now. Hurry up and eat.

395
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,820
I've cooked these for four hours.

396
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,920
You all must eat them all.

397
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,870
- Come.
- Dear senior brothers.

398
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:02,590
Ever since I've been in Kunlun Void,

399
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,440
I've been cared for by Teacher and all of you.

400
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,850
Yet, I kept creating troubles.

401
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:15,200
I didn't focus on my training.

402
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:24,480
I've caused Teacher and all of you to worry.

403
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,770
I'll drink this one first.

404
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,860
So satisfying! That's really a satisfying drink!

405
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,810
Little Seventeenth, come here.

406
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,650
Come. Sit here.

407
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,040
In an instant there, I thought we were back in the past,

408
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:02,300
the days when we fooled around and admired the peach blossoms, drank wine and enjoyed some sensual pleasures.

409
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:07,580
That time, your senior brothers would take you to the mortal world and run amok.

410
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,160
Only Ninth Junior Brother was willing to watch you study.

411
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,650
Ninth Junior Brother... Such a pity.

412
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,760
I even remembered that there was one time,

413
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,120
we all got drunk, and we then rode the clouds

414
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,050
to the Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness to watch the sunrise.

415
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:37,540
That's right. Good thing it was deep at night, so the mortals didn't see us riding the clouds.

416
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,670
Or else, Teacher would have scolded us.

417
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,920
Okay! Okay! Once we're done handling Teacher's burial,

418
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,740
let's go again to Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness and enjoy one more sunrise.

419
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,190
- Okay.
- Okay.

420
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:54,470
- Cheers!
- Come.

421
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:07,030
Come. Come. Let's eat. Eat more.

422
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:38,470
Dear senior brothers, let's part ways here.

423
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,330
Teacher, I was useless.

424
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,380
I was unable to get the Jaded Soul.

425
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,970
To preserve your body, I can only bring you back to Green Hill.

426
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,530
May you forgive me.

427
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,690
So annoying! You're the most hateful person!

428
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,000
You kept stealing our food!

429
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,700
So ugly! And you keep appearing in front of us every day!

430
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,840
Leave! Go back to where you came from!

431
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,680
You are not allowed to follow us again!

432
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,840
Go back!

433
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,140
