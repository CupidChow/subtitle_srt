”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,580
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,140
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,610
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,980
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,450
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,220
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,800
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,380
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,910
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,280
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,810
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,470
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,860
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,640
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,180
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,570
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,210
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,990
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,850
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,330
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,930
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,870
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,830
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,270
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,930
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,140
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,620
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,980
[Episode 22]

31
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:27,270
It's said in the scroll that the Fiery Golden Lion showed up in the rebel camp in Northern Wilderness.

32
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,310
Fiery Golden Lion?

33
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,100
Ye Hua, I'm very disappointed in you.

34
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,220
In the past, I asked Primeval Lord of Heaven,

35
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,370
who resides in the High Clear Plane of the Eternal Heavenly Realm to accept you as his closed-door disciple.

36
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,210
Primeval Lord of Heaven only enlightened one disciple, that is Lord of Lingbao.

37
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:58,060
He's very strict in accepting disciples, but without saying a word, he accepted you his closed-door disciple.

38
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,220
I was very happy.

39
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,520
Afterward, you transcended into a High Immortal in less than 20,000 years.

40
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,560
This made everyone in the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses stop seeing you as the replacement of Mo Yuan.

41
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,710
You finally earned me honor.

42
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:19,230
Crown Prince Ye Hua is better than High God Mo Yuan.

43
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:29,290
But since you went down to subdue the Fiery Golden Lion, your actions successively disappointed me.

44
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,280
Heavenly Monarch, please calm down.

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,100
Please give me a chance to make up for my mistakes.

46
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,880
Let me personally lead an army to pacify the uprising in the Northern Wilderness.

47
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,960
Ye Hua, stop having any more romantic follies.

48
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,160
In the fight with the merpeople, you lost to their chieftain.

49
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,240
In subduing the Fiery Golden Lion, you failed.

50
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,720
The pacification of the Northern Wilderness uprising is your last chance.

51
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,730
Also, even though you're in line to inherit the throne,

52
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,810
and you're addressed as the crown prince, you still haven't received the crown prince seal.

53
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,540
You still haven't obtained the support of the feudal princes within the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,920
I understand.

55
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,270
I surely will return victorious.

56
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,870
If you make any more mistakes,

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,210
not only you, everyone in Pure Wutong Palace will be punished with you.

58
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,400
Yes.

59
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,950
My Lady, wait here for a while.

60
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,460
I've sent someone to get a nourishing soup from the kitchen.

61
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,750
Once the soup is here, you can personally deliver it to the Purple Morning Hall.

62
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,850
His Highness will surely be happy.

63
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,740
But...

64
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,540
Didn't Ye Hua order that everyone in the Courtyard of Moonlight was barred to go out?

65
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,430
If I casually walk around, isn't that improper?

66
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,440
What His Highness the Crown Prince meant was that we can't leave Pure Wutong Palace.

67
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,390
You're only delivering the soup within Pure Wutong Palace.

68
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,310
Crown Prince won't say anything about this.

69
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,180
Okay then. Thank you, Nai Nai.

70
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,720
His Highness brought me here to serve you.

71
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,630
What's there to thank me for?

72
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,380
I'm leaving now.

73
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,150
You go with him, too.

74
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,970
Me? I'm not good at leading an army.

75
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,390
During the pacification of the merpeople, weren't you the one who replaced Ye Hua's position

76
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,950
and completely eliminated the enemies?

77
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,950
That's right, Father Monarch.

78
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,680
But that was because Ye Hua was able to earn the support of the chieftains when he recruited them for battle,

79
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,400
and he had set war strategies beforehand; hence, I was able to defeat the rebels.

80
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,650
Do you plan to disobey my decree?

81
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,520
I dare not.

82
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,660
Also, the woman in your palace said that someone framed her.

83
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:15,000
Do you think I should give her an explanation?

84
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,330
She doesn't know anything.

85
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,290
I've ordered that she is to be restricted inside Pure Wutong Palace as a punishment.

86
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,300
I think that it should be clearly investigated.

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:36,940
Tonight, I'll change all the divine maids of Pure Wutong Palace and hand them all to Lord of Puhua for interrogation.

88
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,900
Change the divine maids?

89
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,270
Father Monarch is doing this for your safety.

90
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:51,300
If something really happens in the palace and someone targets your Courtyard of Moonlight today,

91
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,160
they'll be able to put poison in your tea the next day.

92
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,290
It's best to investigate.

93
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,710
Enough.

94
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,580
It's decided then.

95
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,850
The two of you, wait here first.

96
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,010
Later, the leaders of the sub-tribes and Winged Monarch Li Jing will come here

97
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,760
to discuss with you two the war situation in Northern Wilderness.

98
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,910
- Yes.
- Yes.

99
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:28,370
Father Monarch is using this chance to change all the loyal divine maids in your palace.

100
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,500
You must be extra careful, Ye Hua.

101
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,480
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince, Third Highness.

102
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:48,500
- Where's Heavenly Monarch?
- He has ordered me to lead the army to pacify the uprising in Northern Wilderness.

103
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,260
Since my older brother made this mess,

104
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,130
I am willing to bring my troops to follow Your Highness to pacify this uprising.

105
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,280
What's wrong? Do you doubt my loyalty?

106
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,320
Although you're from the Winged Realm, you have vested interest with our Heavenly Tribe.

107
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,660
I trust you.

108
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:18,160
However, are your soldiers really willing to fight against their First Highness?

109
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,230
It's understandable for you to have such worries.

110
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,640
I have been the Winged Monarch for 70,000 years.

111
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,160
Those soldiers who are against the Heavenly Tribe have mostly been wiped out.

112
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,250
Actually, I have a selfish motive in joining the battle.

113
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,900
- Selfish motive?
- Your Highness was hurt by the Merpeople Tribe.

114
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,150
After all, the Merpeople Tribe is considered a sub-tribe of the Winged Tribe.

115
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,620
I want to use this chance to help you pacify the uprising in the Northern Wilderness,

116
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,710
so you can write off our debt regarding the Long Sea Battle.

117
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,820
Since the Merpeople Tribe have been annihilated, please don't implicate our Winged Realm anymore.

118
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,040
This is my selfish motive.

119
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,240
Fine. I promise you.

120
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,540
If you win at the battle in Northern Wilderness, I won't pursue the connection between the Winged and Merpeople Tribes again.

121
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,720
It's a deal.

122
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,870
It's a deal.

123
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,710
I just asked the older sisters at Purple Morning Hall.

124
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,890
His Highness the Crown Prince is there now.

125
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,700
I heard he's leaving the palace tonight.

126
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,730
Go now before the soup gets cold.

127
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,330
All right.

128
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,230
Ye Hua.

129
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,740
Isn't this Consort Su Jin's voice?

130
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,330
I begged mercy from him for her because of you.

131
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,020
Why can't you understand?

132
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,690
If she wasn't pregnant with your child,

133
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,760
why would your mother barge into the Grand Hall to plead mercy for her?

134
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,170
And why would I defend her at all costs?

135
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,380
I know you married a mortal

136
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:32,880
just to take revenge at me for betraying you and marrying Heavenly Monarch, right?

137
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,580
But what can I do?

138
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,560
What can I do?

139
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,930
Among the women of Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses, who would dare to resist the favors of the Heavenly Monarch?

140
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,200
Tell me, Ye Hua.

141
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,480
You still love me, right?

142
00:10:50,480 --> 00:11:00,060
You call her Su Su because there is "Su" in my name, right?

143
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:45,220
Ye Hua, how could you not know that my love for you surpasses that of the mortal?

144
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,650
My Lady, you delivered it that fast?

145
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,530
Why are you crying, My Lady?

146
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,330
I...

147
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,340
I'm fine.

148
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,320
I'm a bit tired.

149
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,770
I want to rest.

150
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,930
You can leave.

151
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,880
Ye Hua, why are you suddenly here?

152
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,660
What's wrong?

153
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,440
What's the matter?

154
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,720
Give me the copper mirror.

155
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,590
Copper mirror?

156
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,240
What copper mirror?

157
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,150
I remember now.

158
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:11,070
Are you referring to the copper mirror which you lost during the battle with the Merpeople Tribe?

159
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:16,300
I have been keeping it for you and forgot about it.

160
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,890
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

161
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:06,840
Tonight, I'll change all the divine maids of Pure Wutong Palace and hand them all to Lord of Puhua for interrogation.

162
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,890
Father Monarch is using this chance to change all the loyal divine maids in your palace.

163
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,310
You must be extra careful, Ye Hua.

164
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:26,010
You call her Su Su because there's a "Su" in my name, right?

165
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,330
What's wrong with you?

166
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,250
Did something happen?

167
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,410
Can you tell me?

168
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,650
What are you doing here?

169
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,130
I need to stay in the Northern Wilderness for six months.

170
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,960
You will be gone for six months again?

171
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,240
At least for six months.

172
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,930
But just like before, we will use the copper mirror to communicate.

173
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:27,710
Whenever you need something or want to talk to me, you can use the copper mirror.

174
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,610
Take care of yourself.

175
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,090
I'm not feeling well, so I won't get up to send you off.

176
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,630
You are not feeling well?

177
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,680
What are you trying to do?

178
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,490
I... I merely wanted to check on you.

179
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,550
There's nothing to see.

180
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,570
Leave now.

181
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,060
I will personally lead troops to the Northern Wilderness.

182
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:49,320
Who is willing to come with me to capture the traitor Li Yuan?

183
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,310
What's wrong?

184
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,140
I have many good men in the Winged Realm, yet no one dares to go to the Northern Wilderness?

185
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,050
Mighty Monarch, we are not afraid to fight,

186
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:18,030
but... but it's the former First Prince of the Winged Tribe who is rebelling in the Northern Wilderness.

187
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,320
Also, they are using the excuse of seeking vengeance for the former Winged Monarch.

188
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,450
If... If our army sets out this way and helps the Heavenly Tribe to suppress them,

189
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,620
I'm afraid that we may not be popular with the people.

190
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,960
That's right. The previous Winged Monarch received great support from the people.

191
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,760
Because he was sealed later, many tribes of the Winged Realm wanted to take revenge.

192
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,680
But they were all forcefully suppressed by you.

193
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,960
Those who harbored huge grudges, like the Merpeople Tribe, directly retreated to Long Sea and stopped paying tribute.

194
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,720
Those harboring minor grudges didn't say anything but also developed discontent.

195
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,950
If we set out like this, I don't know what mess those sub-tribes will incite.

196
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,640
Enough!

197
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:06,810
I know what those tribes are saying behind my back, that I'm getting close to the Heavenly Tribe

198
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,050
and forgot to take revenge for my father.

199
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,850
But how could they understand that only when there's peace in the world,

200
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,470
the people will then be able to live a good life?

201
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,600
Yes. Although our Winged Tribe is aggressive,

202
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,510
we still might die!

203
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,290
We still might shed blood.

204
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,110
As the Winged Monarch,

205
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:39,420
I don't want to see again that bloody battlefield from 70,000 years ago, where thousands died.

206
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,470
- But Mighty Monarch—
- There will be no further disputes on this!

207
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,220
I will leave tonight with the troops.

208
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,140
We will comply.

209
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,160
Has His Mighty Monarch left the Grand Purple Palace yet?

210
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,040
Your Highness, he left an hour ago.

211
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,060
- Leave.
- Yes.

212
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,360
As long as you can preserve this child for me,

213
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,130
I won't forget your loyalty.

214
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:22,660
I... I really cannot deceive the Monarch like this.

215
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,100
Please... Please forgive me.

216
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,120
You must let me give birth to this child.

217
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,150
Your Highness, this is against Heaven's will.

218
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,400
It's impossible.

219
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:52,960
When I was in Green Hill, I heard there was an herb from the Winged Realm that can help give birth and a spell to heal the sick child.

220
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,160
You have served three generations of monarchs.

221
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,870
You must know about this spell.

222
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,510
There is such a thing, but it's too dangerous.

223
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:10,980
Those, who used this spell, suffered retribution in the end because it was against Heaven's will.

224
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,170
Your Highness, you must think carefully about this again.

225
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,590
I don't believe in any retribution.

226
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,360
I only believe in myself.

227
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,560
Please take my advice, Your Highness.

228
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,460
Even if this child is born, it will be sick.

229
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,850
Your Highness, is there a need to cling on to this fetus?

230
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,720
Shut up. Leave.

231
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,490
Yes.

232
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:50,590
If I don't give birth to you, will I still have the opportunity?

233
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,760
His Mighty Monarch wouldn't even touch me on our wedding night 70,000 years ago.

234
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:02,020
I went through so much to get pregnant.

235
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:07,590
This is my only opportunity, the only opportunity to retain him.

236
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,890
If this child is taken from me,

237
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,240
he will never talk to me again.

238
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,920
He won't even feel guilty.

239
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:37,330
Even if it's a sick child,

240
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,900
he'll at least pity me.

241
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,470
And he might even visit me occasionally.

242
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:49,620
It's better than him drinking with other women.

243
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:59,530
Child, I will definitely give birth to you.

244
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,070
Northern Wilderness is dominated by waterways.

245
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,550
It's too easy for the rebel soldiers to disperse and hide.

246
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,250
Yes, Your Highness. This is not the Long Sea.

247
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,020
Among the Four Seas, the Long Sea's bottom is the most level.

248
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,150
It's very easy for both troops to confront each other.

249
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,880
But this place is connected to a lake. The water routes are accessible in all directions.

250
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,560
It's such a headache.

251
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,770
Moreover, there has never been a war in the Northern Wilderness.

252
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,520
Our men and those soldiers below us have never been here.

253
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,810
If we want to contend with them, it will be extremely difficult.

254
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:56,540
Your Highness the Crown Prince, I do have a way that can allow us to be familiarized with the Northern Wilderness as soon as possible.

255
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,880
Winged Monarch, please speak.

256
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:15,100
I heard you have a marriage agreement with Bai Qian of Green Hill.

257
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,430
Yes, I do have a marriage agreement with Bai Qian.

258
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,150
From what I know, Fox Emperor of Green Hill has four sons and one daughter.

259
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,420
Other than the youngest daughter, who has never stepped out from Green Hill,

260
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:31,130
the remaining four sons have left Green Hill and set up their own homes.

261
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,700
Although the fourth son, Bai Zhen, usually lives in Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms Forest,

262
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,790
he set up his manor in Xiazhou of the Northern Wilderness.

263
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:44,790
I think High God Bai Zhen should be able to help Your Highness.

264
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,720
High God Bai Zhen?

265
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,020
That's right. This is a good idea.

266
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,280
His younger sister will be married to our crown prince soon.

267
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,250
It's natural he should help us.

268
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,340
It's a good thing the Northern Sea Water Monarch withdrew his marriage because of a snake,

269
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,420
and passed this marriage to His Highness the Crown Prince.

270
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,240
Look, it's of use today.

271
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,400
This is great.

272
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,310
Your Highness is my younger sister Young Fifth's future husband.

273
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,010
Help you?

274
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,350
Of course, I will help you.

275
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,350
But previously, I didn't usually live here.

276
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:35,300
After some changes with the water current, the terrain has changed a lot.

277
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,850
Is this something that even you find difficult?

278
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,010
Don't be anxious.

279
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,400
Let me finish talking first.

280
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,450
Young people shouldn't rush.

281
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,560
It won't benefit you.

282
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,570
My temperament is not that good.

283
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,070
If anyone else had come to ask,

284
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,450
I would have kicked them out.

285
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,320
But if it's for my future brother-in-law asking for help,

286
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,430
at most within three months,

287
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:08,320
the map of the Northern Wilderness terrain will be delivered to your battle tent to assist you in pacifying the rebellion.

288
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,330
Thank you, High God.

289
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,030
Don't mention it.

290
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:20,390
You only need to remember that I'm helping you only because you are Green Hill's future son-in-law,

291
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,970
not because you are the Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

292
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,560
Today, I can help you.

293
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,670
In the future, I will naturally have ways to control you.

294
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,900
If you mistreat my Young Fifth in the future,

295
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,290
I will definitely not let you off lightly.

296
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,870
High God Zhe Yan.

297
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,310
I'm taking my leave.

298
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,890
Your Highness the Crown Prince, take care. I won't be seeing you off.

299
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,900
You sounded so official.

300
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:12,510
If Qian Qian were to see her fourth brother just now, would she die laughing?

301
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,540
Try my new concoction.

302
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,140
I was learning from your usual disrespectful way.

303
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,080
How was it? Did I resemble you?

304
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,250
It's a good way to scare my future brother-in-law.

305
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,720
This nut is not bad. It's crispy and refreshing.

306
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,590
Try one, too.

307
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,140
You keep saying "brother-in-law, brother-in-law."

308
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,030
On the contrary, I feel a bit regretful for helping Qian Qian agree to the marriage.

309
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:45,100
I heard that for the past few years, this crown prince has been attracting lots of women.

310
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,190
If Qian Qian marries him, her future may not be good.

311
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,550
That's nothing.

312
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,250
With Qian Qian's personality, no one can bully her.

313
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,530
I just don't like Heavenly Tribe's harem.

314
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,830
Is having only one husband with one wife no good?

315
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,330
But this is a conversation for later.

316
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:08,120
The Heavenly Tribe thinks Qian Qian is still in Green Hill, waiting for her marriage proposal.

317
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,290
But we still don't know where she is.

318
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,760
Bi Fang also came to see me last night.

319
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,820
He said that he searched the entire Eastern Wilderness, but couldn't find any traces of Young Fifth.

320
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,660
I have been searching the Northern Wilderness for several days, too.

321
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,230
There are no results, either.

322
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,110
Where did she go exactly?

323
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,970
I was worried last night, too.

324
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,340
I looked up at the stars,

325
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,390
and I immediately realized that I was overthinking.

326
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,150
Overthinking?

327
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,830
Guess what I saw.

328
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,080
- What did you see?
- Not only is that brat safe,

329
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,330
from looking at the movement of the stars, the Red Comet has moved.
(Comet that predicts one's marital status)

330
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,360
The Red Comet has moved?

331
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,870
Did she leave Green Hill because she eloped?

332
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,350
I'm not sure if she eloped,

333
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:59,430
but the movement of the Red Comet is definitely true.

334
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,390
According to the principle, Young Fifth is engaged to the Crown Prince,

335
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,550
but she's already married someone else.

336
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,420
It might be troublesome.

337
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,990
That's nothing.

338
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,080
If she finds someone she loves, we'll just withdraw the marriage.

339
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,170
Yes, you are right.

340
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,710
They already withdrew the marriage once.

341
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,690
We can do it, too.

342
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,080
They can't do anything to us if we do.

343
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,790
If you say this, I'm relieved.

344
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:33,260
But we do need to take special care of the favor we're doing for Ye Hua.

345
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,650
That can act as compensation for the future withdrawal of their engagement.

346
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,790
Why are you out here?

347
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,400
Sitting inside all day is boring.

348
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,700
I wanted to come out to take a look.

349
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,670
The wind is strong out here. It's best if you went inside.

350
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,180
Okay.

351
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,170
I can't bear to leave,

352
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,470
but if I stay, I will feel guilty.

353
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,250
If Emperor finds out that I lied to him,

354
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,720
will he be angry?

355
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,760
The view here is not bad.

356
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,020
Who is he talking to?

357
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,300
Little Fox, do you want to have a sip?

358
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,150
Emperor,

359
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,190
are you drunk?

360
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,630
Emperor,

361
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,850
you must think that clingy Bai Fengjiu left already.

362
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,170
I bet you think I don't know how to repay someone.

363
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,380
It's not that I don't want to.

364
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,260
It's just...

365
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,390
I don't know how to repay you.

366
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,330
Oh dear.

367
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,160
- Did you kiss him?
- Yes.

368
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,550
- Did you really?
- Yes!

369
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,470
He had no reaction.

370
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,420
He was pretending to be asleep, right?

371
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:53,040
No! Emperor... drank a lot of alcohol and went into a deep sleep.

372
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,630
I don't believe it.

373
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,350
Emperor Dong Hua once led troops into battle.

374
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,940
How could he be so incautious that he didn't even know he was kissed by someone?

375
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:07,540
I think he might like you, too.

376
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,650
He's going along with it.

377
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,270
Don't say nonsense!

378
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,950
Was Emperor pretending to be drunk?

379
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,030
Or...

380
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,550
For the past few months, you and Jia Yun have been assisting His Highness.

381
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,210
I'm not worried at all.

382
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:03,920
By the way, are you going back today?

383
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,160
Your Highness, the war is critical.

384
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,630
I'm going back now.

385
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,250
Didn't you just come back from Heavenly Monarch's place?

386
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,530
You're leaving so soon.

387
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:20,360
Did His Highness write any letters to that mortal in the Courtyard of Moonlight?

388
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,630
Your Highness, there were no letters for that courtyard.

389
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,940
Okay. I understand.

390
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,960
My Lady, when I was at the divine mountain in the lower realm,

391
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,960
I always saw the mortals hang lanterns on the 15th day of each month.

392
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,810
I learned how to make some. Do you want to hang some together?

393
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,540
Nai Nai,

394
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,180
did the Crown Prince send any oral messages?

395
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,590
No.

396
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,820
I asked around Purple Morning Hall about it this morning.

397
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,950
I heard that the situation at the Northern Wilderness is critical,

398
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,510
so His Highness was probably too busy.

399
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,470
Don't overthink it, My Lady.

400
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:08,590
It wasn't easy for you to stop crying these past few months.

401
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,560
I'll bring some food.

402
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,280
Little Fox, you're here again?

403
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,250
If you didn't look so much like my aunt, I wouldn't be here to keep you company.

404
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,800
Little Fox, I finally realized something recently.

405
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,430
Do you think that's strange?

406
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,390
What did you realize?

407
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,950
Even though Ye Hua doesn't say much and doesn't like to smile much,

408
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,960
he was still willing to be with me at a place like Junji Mountain.

409
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,960
That means he still likes me a little.

410
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,360
As long as he likes me even a little bit,

411
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,420
I'm willing to be by his side forever.

412
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,290
What's so good about the Crown Prince?

413
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:06,420
He's leading Consort Su Jin on, made you pregnant, and he's even engaged to my aunt.

414
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,420
Don't you think it's a bother between the three of you women?

415
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,740
No matter what, he married me.

416
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,760
We made an oath to the Eastern Wilderness.

417
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,990
I'm his wife.

418
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,160
I'm also pregnant with his child now.

419
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,140
I love him so much.

420
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:28,700
I believe that one day, I can move his heart to fall in love with me.

421
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,010
You are a fox in heaven.

422
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,330
You should know how to cultivate.

423
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:43,820
If I could cultivate into an immortal,

424
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,410
would he treat me better?

425
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,070
I'm not sure about that.

426
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:51,650
If I have the chance, I'll ask Si Ming and Cheng Yu.

427
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:01,740
The two of you haven't told me how to cultivate into an immortal yet.

428
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,800
Cultivate into an immortal?

429
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,870
If you talk about cultivating into an immortal, that's a long process.

430
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,750
Yes, very long.

431
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,000
Why are you two in my study?

432
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,440
Playing with the fox.

433
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,170
Isn't it cute?

434
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,880
I just remembered I have something to do.

435
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,410
Emperor, I will take my leave now.

436
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,950
You seem to like this fox quite a bit.

437
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,850
Do you want to take it?

438
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,620
No. No.

439
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,390
I'm usually afraid of these animals with claws.

440
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,750
I will take my leave.

441
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:34,280
Just now, Si Ming talked about cultivating to become an immortal.

442
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,580
Emperor, don't misunderstand. I'm just a small fox.

443
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,380
I just want to be by your side forever.

444
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,950
To an immortal, there's no "forever."

445
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,530
This life...

446
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,620
is long enough.

447
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,180
Don't tell me he knows how to read minds?

448
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:06,310
[Northern Wilderness Map]

449
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,630
His Fourth Highness of Green Hill indeed kept his promise.

450
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,350
The Green Hill's Fox Tribe has been guarding the Five Wildernesses for generations.

451
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:21,240
They are indeed the only ones who can produce this map.

452
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,940
His Highness said that the Nine-Tailed Fox Tribe is not good at fighting, nor do we produce soldiers.

453
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,110
He can only help Your Highness till here.

454
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,050
Thank His Highness on my behalf.

455
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:37,070
His Highness also said that he has given the map to Your Highness the Crown Prince.

456
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:41,020
He also said that, in the future, if Empress Bai Qian of Green Hill suffers anger in the Heavenly Tribe,

457
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,210
he will pay you a visit to argue with you.

458
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:54,530
- The Fox Tribe of Green Hill is really very straightforward.
- That's right.

459
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,540
They're less afraid to speak their mind than us, the Heavenly Tribe.

460
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:02,890
Your Highness the Crown Prince, the 100,000 soldiers that I brought with me are very familiar with waterways.

461
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,550
We are willing to be the vanguards for the army.

462
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:10,030
Within three months, I will force the Northern Wilderness rebel soldiers to have nowhere else to go.

463
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:14,370
Your Highness only needs to defend the four main roads to intercept the dispersed soldiers.

464
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,950
Winged Monarch, you are that confident?

465
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,870
I pledge to fulfill this military order.

466
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,910
It's just that I have a small request.

467
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:26,260
When Your Highness intercept Li Yuan's dispersed soldiers,

468
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,020
please let me have Li Yuan.

469
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,280
I want to personally finish him off.

470
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,350
All right. I promise you.

471
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,180
It's three months after three months.

472
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,250
Su Su,

473
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:21,130
I didn't expect that when we were in the Heavenly Palace, you would still have to wait for me every day.

”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

475
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,320
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

476
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,930
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

477
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:09,330
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

478
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:18,360
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

479
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,580
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

480
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:27,970
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

481
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:35,240
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

482
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,970
♫ All are just illusions ♫

483
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:46,900
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

484
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:52,170
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

485
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:56,570
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

486
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:02,790
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

487
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:08,310
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

488
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:13,450
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

489
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,160
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

490
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:25,310
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

491
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:37,350
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

492
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:42,820
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

493
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:47,210
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

494
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:53,450
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

495
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:58,760
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

496
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:04,260
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

497
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,850
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

498
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:15,970
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

499
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:28,370
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
