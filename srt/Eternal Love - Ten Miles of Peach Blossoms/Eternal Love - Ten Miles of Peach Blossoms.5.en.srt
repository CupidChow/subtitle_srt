”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,000
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,600
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,000
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,400
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,200
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,800
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,200
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,800
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,400
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,000
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,400
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,800
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,600
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,000
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,500
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,000
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,020
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,800
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,200
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,800
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,200
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,800
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,600
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,800
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,200
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,900
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,800
[Episode 5]

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,500
Hey, High Immortal!

32
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,700
Ah Yin, I'm sorry.

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,600
The Heavenly and Winged Tribesmen can't have a future together.

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,900
Okay.

35
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,700
Okay.

36
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,300
You're the one to decide if we have a future together or not.

37
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,000
Then, tell me.

38
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,200
What do you plan to do about me now?

39
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,760
At the time...

40
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,390
At the time, I was being too preposterous.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,170
Previously, you said that no matter what happens, you have to be with me.

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,800
Now, you're saying you were just being preposterous.

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,710
High Immortal Si Yin, please allow us to be together.

44
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,800
Li Jing and I love each other.

45
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,400
There'll be no result of your relationship with him.

46
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,500
Then tell me, what's your definition of "result"?

47
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,000
Do you define "result" as abandoning me,

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,800
or do you define "result" as breaking a couple apart?

49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
Ah Yin, I...

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
- Ah Yin, I...
- Don't say my name!

51
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,300
I have betrayed you.

52
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,700
Ah Yin,

53
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,800
I have betrayed you.

54
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,400
I don't deserve to be with you.

55
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,900
You should be with Mo Yuan.

56
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,500
Even at this moment, you dare to insult my teacher?

57
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:27,250
In the past, you were the one who said that no matter my identity,

58
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,400
you wanted to be with me.

59
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,100
But what about now?

60
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
Fine,

61
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,620
I'll let you two be together.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,900
- High Immortal!
- Let go!

63
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,100
Your Highness,

64
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,700
let's go.

65
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,100
Are you really going to come to the Winged Realm with me?

66
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,500
You must think it through.

67
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,400
In the Winged Realm, I'm just a second prince who has no power.

68
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,200
Your Highness, I betrayed Si Yin.

69
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,800
It's the same as betraying Kunlun Void and the Heavenly Tribe.

70
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,500
Currently, you're the only one I can rely on.

71
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,300
Let's go.

72
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,400
Teacher? Teacher, you've returned from your retreat?

73
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,800
You're awake. Next time, don't start a fire in the wine cellar.

74
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,600
If I had arrived any later, you would have burned down Kunlun Void.

75
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,750
I was wrong.

76
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,020
You drank so much alcohol.

77
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,200
You should cry it out.

78
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,300
Otherwise, if you keep your sadness bottled up, it'll be a waste of my good alcohol.

79
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,750
Teacher, why did you leave your retreat so early?

80
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,010
Not only are you inattentive in your studies,

81
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,970
you're also distracted when you cry.

82
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,010
Teacher, I don't want to cry anymore.

83
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,770
All right, then don't cry.

84
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,500
Okay.

85
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,280
Teacher, how are your injuries?

86
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,270
Will it leave behind any aftereffects?

87
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,850
I'm fine.

88
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,210
I don't need you to cook yourself into nourishment soup for me.

89
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,170
Teacher, you heard all that?

90
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,240
Very clearly.

91
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,030
Li Jing's eyes are very bright.

92
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,770
Sadly, he has bad taste.

93
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,960
Teacher, you know everything?

94
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,200
Know what?

95
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,920
All I heard is that the woman who looks like you had left with Li Jing.

96
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,370
They had left?

97
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,540
Back to the Winged Realm.

98
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,710
It's good that they're gone.

99
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,200
Teacher, let's stop talking about irrelevant people.

100
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,700
Let's talk about something fun.

101
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,850
- Something fun?
- Yes.

102
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,540
Teacher, since you were on retreat,

103
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,320
tell me about the Donghuang Bell.

104
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,450
Donghuang Bell?

105
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,070
Why are you suddenly asking about that?

106
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,150
I just accidentally heard that the Donghuang Bell is in Qing Cang's hands.

107
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,340
Later, I searched in many books, but I didn't find anything about it.

108
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,730
It's written in the records that you created the Donghuang Bell.

109
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,060
It's a magical weapon that can destroy the world.

110
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,930
Why is it in the Winged Realm?

111
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,460
Back during the great war with the Demon Tribe, in order for the Heavenly and Winged Tribes to form an alliance,

112
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,010
Father God gave the Donghuang Bell to Qing Cang to express their sincerity.

113
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,660
Thus, Teacher, can this Donghuang Bell really destroy the world?

114
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,270
Right.

115
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,270
The Donghuang Bell is an extremely dangerous weapon.

116
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:39,120
Once it's brought out, it can kill all forms of life in the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

117
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,630
The only way to stop it is to offer a powerful spirit as a sacrifice.

118
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,430
That's the only way to lock it again.

119
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,660
What will happen after offering the sacrifice?

120
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,870
The sacrifice's soul will shatter,

121
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,490
the Donghuang Bell's anger will be pacified, and peace will return.

122
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,330
So if Qing Cang rebels,

123
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,010
the Donghuang Bell would be a big problem.

124
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,440
Teacher, I heard that the Donghuang Bell can seal spirits.

125
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,570
- Is that true?
- Yes.

126
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,100
However, only the Heavenly, Phoenix, and Nine-Tailed Fox Tribes can seal a spirit with the Donghuang Bell.

127
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:23,520
So the only people who can make the seal are Fox Emperor, Zhe Yan, and the Heavenly Monarch?

128
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,080
And me.

129
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,860
Teacher, Lord of Lingbao asked someone to deliver an invitation.

130
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,260
They're hosting a conference, and they want you to attend.

131
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,060
I know that you typically directly reject it,

132
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,880
but, after all, the invitation was from Lord of Lingbao this time.

133
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,620
It's time for Seventeenth to experience the outside world.

134
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,920
Teacher, are you really going?

135
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,130
Get ready. We'll take off in two days.

136
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,010
Yes.

137
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,330
Seventeenth, Teacher usually doesn't accept these tedious invitations.

138
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:11,170
He must be trying to take you outside to clear your mind, after seeing how upset you are.

139
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,060
You're already grown up.

140
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,950
Learn to stop making him worry.

141
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,480
That's your duty as his disciple.

142
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,780
I got it.

143
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,200
Senior Brother, don't worry.

144
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,230
We all know that you're really sad after you saw Li Jing take Xuan Nü away because you like Xuan Nü.

145
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,320
I... I like...

146
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,580
Don't explain yourself. I understand everything.

147
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,090
Second Younger Brother, how have you been?

148
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,150
Father Monarch, Second Older Brother would never collude with the Heavenly Tribe.

149
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,060
Please calm down, Father Monarch!

150
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,350
Move aside!

151
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,580
You unfilial son!

152
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,960
I know that I've done wrong to your birth mother.

153
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,840
In order to unify the Winged Realm, I sacrificed her life.

154
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:16,280
However, when did I ever mistreat you? Tell me.

155
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,530
I allowed you to lead a life of debauchery, linger in the Mortal Realm, and spend time in brothels.

156
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,470
When did I ever stop you?

157
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,610
I have two sons and one daughter, but I'm the most lenient towards you.

158
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,430
And now, just for a small immortal, you abandoned the Winged Realm,

159
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,260
and you are colluding with Kunlun Void.

160
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,780
Do you deserve death?

161
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,000
- I do.
- Shut up!

162
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,110
I hate it when you act like this.

163
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,170
You're just like your birth mother.

164
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,100
I'm willing to die.

165
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,050
I just hope that you let that woman go.

166
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,680
This has nothing to do with her.

167
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,400
Even in the face of death, you're still thinking about a woman.

168
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,750
Father Monarch!

169
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,270
What did you call me?

170
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,570
Father Monarch! I'm the woman that Li Jing brought back from Kunlun Void.

171
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,790
I'm the one he likes! Not Si Yin!

172
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,150
Father, please make the correct judgment. Don't kill an innocent person.

173
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,220
What did you say?

174
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,300
Explain yourself.

175
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,700
It's true that Li Jing went to Kunlun Void,

176
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,550
but he did it to spy on them.

177
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,490
Father Monarch, you should know that when Li Jing was still in Grand Purple Palace,

178
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,720
he pretended to be close to Si Yin.

179
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,080
Later, when Mo Yuan attacked Grand Purple Palace and rescued Si Yin,

180
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,760
Li Jing took the opportunity to follow him back.

181
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,200
Father Monarch, you watched Li Jing grow up.

182
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,990
Aren't you clear whether he has the intention of betraying the Winged Tribe?

183
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,640
Keep talking.

184
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,670
In Kunlun Void, His Highness saved me once, and I fell in love with him.

185
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,260
I willingly came to Winged Realm with His Highness.

186
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:21,370
I am now his woman, and you are my father monarch.

187
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:25,450
Although His Highness didn't gain anything from Kunlun Void,

188
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,780
since I have decided to follow him,

189
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,360
I should fulfill his filial piety in his place.

190
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,410
I'm willing to help you, Father Monarch, attack the Heavenly Tribe.

191
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:50,190
Who gave you the guts to offer help to me?

192
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,220
Father Monarch, you must not know my identity.

193
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,780
I am the younger sister of Green Hill's Bai Xuan's wife.

194
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:02,950
With that identity, I had received lots of care from the high immortals at Kunlun Void.

195
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,380
So what?

196
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,860
I once heard the people from Kunlun Void talk about the battle between the Heavenly and Winged Tribes.

197
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,080
From what I know,

198
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,900
Kunlun Void has a battle formation of heavenly soldiers that can be used to resist their enemies.

199
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,140
I know that.

200
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,010
Back during the battle against the Demon Realm,

201
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:35,210
Mo Yuan led the heavenly soldiers and used 49 battle formations.

202
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,310
It was extremely powerful.

203
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,450
And with that, they forced the Demon Realm to retreat.

204
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,570
I have a way to help you obtain the formation.

205
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,230
Speak.

206
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:54,490
But I must ask that you first promise me two things.

207
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,560
You dare to discuss terms with me?

208
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,910
Are you not afraid that I will decapitate you?

209
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,090
I wouldn't dare.

210
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,090
I am only making minor requests.

211
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,660
I just want you to let Li Jing and me off,

212
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,610
then grant me a marriage.

213
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:18,300
Let me officially marry into the Grand Purple Palace.

214
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,740
It's that simple?

215
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,110
Yes, it's that simple.

216
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,170
Li Jing, oh, Li Jing.

217
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:41,130
I didn't expect you to be just like your birth mother.

218
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:47,810
You can make countless people go through hell for you, just to be your life companion.

219
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,070
- Father, you have given your consent then?
- Of course.

220
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,500
I'm giving you my consent.

221
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,350
The grand wedding will be tomorrow!

222
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,050
Four fire kirins will carry you into Grand Purple Palace.

223
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:11,650
You will be officially married with a nine-day grand celebration in the Winged Realm!

224
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,850
Thank you, Father Monarch, for granting this.

225
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,580
The beauties in Li Jing's palace are as numerous as clouds.

226
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,680
If he marries them or not, I do not care.

227
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,950
Just remember, once you enter my Grand Purple Palace,

228
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,760
you belong to the Winged Realm.

229
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,300
Don't you dare forget about your promise regarding the formation.

230
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,770
I will never disappoint you.

231
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,830
Please take care, Your Highnesses.

232
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,720
Please stay here.

233
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,710
High God Mo Yuan?

234
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,320
I didn't think that you, High God Mo Yuan, would personally come today.

235
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,690
I just came out of retreat, and my disciple has never come out here before, so I brought him to get some fresh air.

236
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:12,520
High Immortal Si Yin, I just met you a few days ago, and today we have the fate to meet again.

237
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,620
- High God Mo Yuan.
- High God Mo Yuan.

238
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,650
Little Disciple Si Yin, greet His Second Highness and His Third Highness of the Heavenly Tribe.

239
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,110
Your Second Highness and Your Third Highness.

240
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,350
His Second Highness has much of Heavenly Monarch's favor.

241
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,790
A few days ago, the Heavenly Monarch even wanted to ask High God Zhe Yan

242
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,080
to propose marriage to Bai Qian of Green Hill for His Second Highness.

243
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,660
What?

244
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,460
High Immortal Si Yin, why are you so surprised?

245
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,800
Do you know Bai Qian of Green Hill?

246
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,880
I don't.

247
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,390
My disciple is a fox picked up by Zhe Yan and sent to me for education.

248
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:54,490
He must have been happy to hear his benefactor's name.

249
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,790
I'm delighted. I'm delighted.

250
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,430
Since you have have such a close relationship with High God Zhe Yan,

251
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,260
do you think he will help the Heavenly Monarch suggest the wedding?

252
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,270
I don't know.

253
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:14,430
I think High God Zhe Yan is not the type to meddle in other people's business. Right?

254
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:20,720
My father said to invite High God Mo Yuan to the main hall if he arrives.

255
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,730
The Winged Realm is stirring up trouble,

256
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,020
He needs to discuss military matters and strategies with you, High God.

257
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,870
Okay, I know.

258
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,100
The injuries on you are not light.

259
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,240
This time, you forced yourself out of retreat. Right?

260
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,910
That is why I came to Shangqing Wonderland to borrow your hot spring.

261
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,170
Although this Heavenly Eye Spring of mine has great spiritual power,

262
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,020
it is not an all-cure medicine.

263
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,060
Are you wanting a speedy recovery

264
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,120
to look after the Golden Lotus left behind by Father God or because of the Winged Realm?

265
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,180
For both of those reasons.

266
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,660
A few days ago I visited the Kunlun Void.

267
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,990
I felt the Golden Lotus' spiritual breath.

268
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,830
Congratulations, High God. You are about to achieve your goal.

269
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,320
I could feel it as well.

270
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,970
Your Highness.

271
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,210
Ah Yin,

272
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,900
my greatest wish is to be able to marry you one day.

273
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,000
Your Highness, I am Xuan Nü.

274
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,680
That's right.

275
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,060
You are Xuan Nü.

276
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,300
You are not Ah Yin.

277
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,020
You are not Ah Yin.

278
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,300
If she were here today,

279
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:29,210
she would definitely not forsake her own tribe to keep her life.

280
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,550
She is someone who values friendship and loyalty.

281
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,110
Yet for your sake,

282
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,610
I wronged her.

283
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,120
Your Highness...

284
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,210
But I'm doing this for you.

285
00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:00,600
Xuan Nü, look properly.

286
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,150
You have fallen in love with the wrong person.

287
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,370
There is indeed someone who lives in my heart,

288
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,820
but it's not you.

289
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,670
Ah Yin.

290
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,720
Sorry.

291
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:50,020
Everything is my fault.

292
00:26:54,830 --> 00:27:00,070
Your Highness, don't say such things on the night of our wedding. All right?

293
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,860
Our wedding?

294
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,620
Your Highness!

295
00:27:54,750 --> 00:28:00,640
Why? Elder Brother, are you going to guard outside during my wedding night?

296
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,230
If not because you married a good wife,

297
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,110
Father Monarch would have already decapitated you.

298
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,110
He wouldn't have let you survive to see your wedding.

299
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,850
Elder Brother, you're wrong.

300
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,790
Us three siblings are of big use to Father.

301
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,350
He wouldn't kill us.

302
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,410
Take His Second Highness and closely guard him.

303
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,620
Until the day we deploy our troops, do not let him out.

304
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,350
- Yes.
- Yes.

305
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,250
Go drag Li Jing's woman out.

306
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,060
- Yes.
- Yes.

307
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,700
What are you doing? What are you doing?

308
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,150
I'm the Second Princess Consort. What are you doing?

309
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,330
- What are you doing?
- Go!

310
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,360
Let go of me! Let go of me!

311
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,510
You let go of me!

312
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,510
Mo Yuan of the Heavenly Tribe trespassed into my Grand Purple Palace,

313
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,460
stole my godson, Ling Yu,

314
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,440
and killed my Winged Realm's soldiers.

315
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,140
As the leader of the Winged Realm,

316
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,930
I cannot accept such humiliation!

317
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:54,870
Are you all willing to follow me to shift the master of this world,

318
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:59,330
drag the Heavenly Monarch down from the Nine Heavens,

319
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:03,270
and allow our Winged Tribe to unify the world?

320
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:06,800
We will follow you, even to death!

321
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,570
Good.

322
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,690
Throw this woman back into Kunlun Void.

323
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:19,460
Let the Heavenly Tribe see our determination on declaring this war.

324
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,620
I didn't think I would be taking such a long trip with you, Teacher.

325
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:43,810
Even if you don't say anything, I know that you are trying to cheer me up.

326
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,410
At least you have a conscience.

327
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,620
Seventeenth,

328
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,810
I'm a little tired.

329
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,900
Let's rest here for an hour. What do you think?

330
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,900
Okay.

331
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,000
Although Li Jing had betrayed me,

332
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,880
I'll eventually recover thousands of thousands years.

333
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,810
It was just a mere love affair.

334
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,840
I'm such a bad disciple for making Teacher worry for me.

335
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,930
You are indeed a bad disciple.

336
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,610
Your teacher was injured by the heavenly lightning,

337
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:04,370
and he had to leave his retreat early before he was fully recovered all because of you.

338
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:10,050
As of today, his heart is burning from his injury, but you're oblivious to it.

339
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:15,190
Fortunately, Fourth Older Brother and Zhe Yan don't know about this yet.

340
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,690
If they find out, they'd surely mock me.

341
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,430
I'm so glad I didn't deliver that letter the other day.

342
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,850
Fourth Older Brother? You have a fourth older brother?

343
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:30,230
But Fourth Older Brother had said that the Heavenly and Winged Tribes will eventually fight.

344
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,310
I wonder if Teacher will take me into battle.

345
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:39,120
I studied under Teacher for 20,000 years, and I'd never led troops into battle before. What a waste.

346
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,880
Lead troops?

347
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,710
If I was Mo Yuan, I would never let you do it.

348
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,160
I'm about to win again!

349
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,570
Eldest Senior Brother, why are you so distracted?

350
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:29,230
Qing Cang is preparing to deploy his troops to rebel, but Teacher is yet to return.

351
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:33,950
If Qing Cang deploys his troops at this time, it'll be big trouble.

352
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,790
A measly Qing Cang is no match for Teacher.

353
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:39,460
Why are you so nervous?

354
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,650
I think Eldest Senior Brother is worried because Teacher had blocked three heavenly lightnings for Seventeenth,

355
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,390
and he's not fully recovered since he had to leave his retreat early,

356
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,510
so it'll be hard for him to face battle.

357
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,120
Do not mention this in front of Seventeenth.

358
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,770
Otherwise, he'll blame himself and drink alcohol again.

359
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,100
Maybe Seventeenth is still thinking about Xuan Nü.

360
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,970
Now that we're on the topic of Xuan Nü...

361
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:13,960
After Li Jing took Xuan Nü back to the Winged Realm, they recklessly held a wedding.

362
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,750
The Winged Tribe celebrated for nine days.

363
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,320
I'm afraid if Seventeenth hears about this, he'll be sad again.

364
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,360
Seventeenth.

365
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,050
Greetings, Senior Brothers.

366
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,330
I've escorted Teacher back safely.

367
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,870
Good job. When you first left, you looked soulless.

368
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:37,020
Now, you're back to the old Seventeenth.

369
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,880
I really broadened my horizons through this trip with Teacher.

370
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,030
In the past, I thought that Teacher wasn't interested in Buddhist and Dao philosophies.

371
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:49,230
Unexpectedly, he can spout eloquent speeches in debate.

372
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:53,420
Teacher was able to outdebate all the other immortals.

373
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,260
I couldn't help but sigh.

374
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:02,140
Eldest Junior Uncle, Second Junior Uncle, someone tossed that Xuan Nü at the entrance of the mountain.

375
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,360
- What?
- What?

376
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,640
Why are you like this?

377
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,500
Aren't you married to Li Jing?

378
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:32,430
Eldest Senior Brother, everything was my fault.

379
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,750
I shouldn't have trusted that lowlife Li Jing.

380
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:42,190
Eldest Senior Brother, hurry and tell High God that the Winged Tribe has deployed its troops in rebellion.

381
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,340
Really?

382
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:51,030
In order to express his determination, Qing Cang chose another woman from the Winged Tribe for Li Jing.

383
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,590
Then, he whipped me with thorns and threw me back here.

384
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:59,330
All of this is because he wanted to humiliate High God Mo Yuan.

385
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,850
Let me tend to your wounds first.

386
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,190
This teacup is nice.

387
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:19,260
Do you have more? Can I have one?

388
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,970
Okay. I'll have someone send it to your palace tomorrow.

389
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,280
Mo Yuan, what do you think about this situation?

390
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,500
I'm the God of War.

391
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,210
If the Winged Realm insists on fighting, then let's fight.

392
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:44,010
But as to how you, Heavenly Monarch, will make the Winged Realm willingly submit to the Heavenly Tribe

393
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,190
is none of my business.

394
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,630
No need for you to worry about this, High God.

395
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,470
Too bad.

396
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,530
This lotus was sculptured in a manner that's unbearable to look at.

397
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,520
Do you have a white porcelain cup?

398
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,060
I actually want to draw and put color on by myself.

399
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,130
I'll ask my disciples to look. Maybe, I have one.

400
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,190
Teacher! Teacher!

401
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,050
- Teacher.
- Qing Cang has led his army in an uprising.

402
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,350
He badly injured Xuan Nü and threw her just outside the mountain.

403
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,730
I fear that he is determined to break off with the Heavenly Tribe.

404
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,740
Heavenly Monarch. Emperor. I'll take her to have her wounds tended first.

405
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,310
I'll take my leave.

406
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,110
It looks like it's happening earlier than we expected.

407
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,870
He has led an uprising.

408
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,350
The Winged Tribe has 200,000 soldiers.

409
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:46,080
Heavenly Monarch, please also mobilize 200,000 soldiers for me to use for ten days.

410
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,600
I'll then have to rely on you, High God.

411
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,630
Eldest Senior Brother.

412
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,710
There's no woman here in our Kunlun Void.

413
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,950
What should we do?

414
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,400
Just treat her as a man.

415
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,890
Eldest Senior, she's about to die.

416
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,970
Why bother with so much?

417
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,460
That's our only option.

418
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,820
She's after all a legally married Second Princess Consort.

419
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,800
How come he beat her up like that?

420
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,580
He's so cruel.

421
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,270
A battle of life and death is about to ensue.

422
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,540
Why wouldn't he bear to hit her?

423
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:33,280
Oh, right. You were the only one attending to Heavenly Monarch and Emperor today.

424
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,390
Did you hear anything?

425
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,580
How does Heavenly Monarch plan to deploy the soldiers?

426
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,800
I didn't see Teacher having any worries.

427
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,160
Emperor, too. He was in such an idle state.

428
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,340
Heavenly Monarch kept anxiously asking Teacher what to do,

429
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,840
but Emperor kept asking Teacher for a porcelain cup for his tea.

430
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:55,440
I'm guessing that Emperor and Teacher aren't really putting great importance on this war.

431
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,690
Although I don't understand Heavenly Monarch and Emperor that much,

432
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,740
I know Teacher.

433
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,090
The more relaxed he is before a battle,

434
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:08,630
the more difficult this battle will be.

435
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,350
Ah Yin.

436
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,670
Why did you come here?

437
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,580
Hey, you!

438
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:33,030
How come after going to the Winged Realm, you learned to speak while kneeling?

439
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,350
Keep kneeling, then.

440
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,270
You must kneel until the end for it to look more sincere.

441
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,090
Ah Yin, I was possessed by my evil desires,

442
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,680
that's why, I did things that wronged you.

443
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,890
I feel guilty and couldn't put it down.

444
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,730
I owe you.

445
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:54,540
Now, I've brought all of these to myself.

446
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:59,270
Tell me, what should I do so you can forgive me?!

447
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,770
Do you think that by coming here late at night and crying,

448
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:06,820
all your rotten debts can be forgotten?

449
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,990
Ah Yin, if you won't forgive me,

450
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,710
why then did you allow them to save me?

451
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,950
The one who saved you was Eldest Senior Brother.

452
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,480
The one who agreed was Teacher.

453
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,290
What do I have to do with that?

454
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,610
Tell me! For your past actions,

455
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,370
do you deserve to be called an ungrateful person as cruel as a wolf?

456
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,420
Si Yin, you can't be this heartless to me.

457
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,540
Don't come near!

458
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:42,780
If I'm really heartless, I would have killed you that day.

459
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,640
The person who saved you today was Eldest Senior, because he's a kind person.

460
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,590
I tell you, I'm a person who can't tolerate any mistakes.

461
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:55,930
I urge you that once you've fully recovered, quickly leave Kunlun Void.

462
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:58,190
Or else, if I ever end up drunk one day,

463
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,930
I might demand you to pay back your debts, and no one can stop me!

464
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,070
Keep kneeling, then.

465
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,910
Ninth Senior Brother?

466
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:23,820
I never knew that you had the habit of standing in the corner and eavesdropping.

467
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,300
I wasn't eavesdropping.

468
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:29,930
I came to inform you to prepare to go with Teacher to the Heavenly Palace for the gathering of soldiers.

469
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,370
Did Teacher ask us to go with him?

470
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,010
That's right. The two of us will accompany Teacher in facing the enemy.

471
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,040
Our other co-disciples will lead their own armies

472
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,360
and guard the different areas where the Heavenly Realm and Wing Realm intersect.

473
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,800
Do you have any doubts?

474
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,770
I don't.

475
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,400
Your eldest disciple looked down on me.

476
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,900
He refused to marry me no matter what.

477
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,590
Your seventeenth disciple also looked down on me.

478
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:11,510
He wanted me to kneel and be humiliated.

479
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:15,410
It's fine. All of those are fine with me.

480
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:22,700
Mo Yuan, I'll take away the battle formation map of your Kunlun Void right in front of your Xuanyuan Sword today,

481
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,180
and make you suffer a crushing defeat.

”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

483
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,640
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

484
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,430
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

485
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:05,690
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

486
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:15,010
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

487
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,960
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

488
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,360
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

489
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:31,630
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

490
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:36,440
♫ All are just illusions ♫

491
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:43,240
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

492
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:48,530
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

493
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:53,070
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

494
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:59,170
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

495
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:04,610
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

496
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:09,750
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

497
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,620
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

498
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:21,920
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

499
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,530
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

500
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:39,030
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

501
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,480
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories, ♫

502
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:49,850
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

503
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:55,170
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

504
00:44:55,170 --> 00:45:00,510
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

505
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,250
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

506
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:12,130
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

507
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:25,310
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
