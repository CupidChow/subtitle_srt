”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,550
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,140
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,680
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,190
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,470
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,120
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,800
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,220
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,810
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,390
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,920
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,470
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,040
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,530
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,130
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,520
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,050
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,960
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,750
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,170
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,790
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,110
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,910
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,580
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,910
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,020
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,680
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,970
[Episode 11]

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,470
High God.

32
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,140
- Is Young Fifth here?
- Great Lady?

33
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,250
Didn't she say she went to Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms?

34
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,560
High God, you didn't see her?

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,310
Young Fifth was definitely at Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms last night.

36
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,450
But when I woke up today, I didn't see her at all.

37
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,110
Isn't she back?

38
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,890
She didn't, but High God Zhe Yan is here.

39
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,680
- Zhe Yan?
- Yes.

40
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,210
- He came back from the Heavenly Palace?
- Yes.

41
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,750
Yes, I'm back.

42
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,750
Why are you so interested in coming to Young Fifth's fox den?

43
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,990
What are you doing here?

44
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,480
I just came back from the Heavenly Palace.

45
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,940
That's right. I only remembered where Young Fifth had gone to,

46
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,600
but I forgot you went to Heavenly Palace to break off her engagement.

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,220
Come, let me talk to you about her engagement.

48
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,720
Did the engagement break off?

49
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,360
The engagement with Sang Ji was broken off but the engagement with Heavenly Tribe still exists.

50
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,550
What do you mean?

51
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,430
Let me slowly explain this to you.

52
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,360
Emperor?

53
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,550
Did it shake?

54
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,280
Why are you here?

55
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,580
I came here with my aunt.

56
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,150
Aunt?

57
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,800
That Bai Qian from Green Hill who's never shown her face to the public?

58
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,960
Yes, my aunt is Bai Qian.

59
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,020
I remember last night... I don't even know if it was last night.

60
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,200
Before I slept, I saw my aunt leaving Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms.

61
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,360
Hence, I followed her here.

62
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,670
Could it be...

63
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,360
What's the relationship between your aunt and Kunlun Void?

64
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,790
There's none.

65
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,720
I have never heard her mention this.

66
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,290
Is this what your aunt left to you?

67
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,500
Yes, she left it to me.

68
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,720
Do you know what's recorded here?

69
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,490
My aunt said there's a spell recorded in there.

70
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,290
That's right.

71
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,480
The technique of how the ancient magical weapon Donghuang Bell can be sealed using an individual's spirit is written here.

72
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,650
Donghuang Bell? Isn't that a magical weapon that can destroy Heavens and Earth?

73
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,340
That's right.

74
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:24,300
Then, isn't that the magical weapon that caused High God Mo Yuan's spirit to shatter in Ruoshui Riverbed 70,000 years ago?!

75
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,390
That's right.

76
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,880
Mo Yuan used this spell to seal Qing Cang.

77
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,960
It looks like your aunt and Kunlun Void are indeed deeply connected.

78
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,800
How is this possible? Since my aunt was born, she has never left Green Hill.

79
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,320
Really?

80
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,960
It's true.

81
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
You are my savior.

82
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,460
How could I dare to lie to you?

83
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,030
Where are you going, Emperor?

84
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:36,420
The color of your clothes is strange, but it looks nice.

85
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,610
Where did you buy it?

86
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,290
Green... Green Hill.

87
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,480
Ah Yin, I like you.

88
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,080
Since you've already accepted me by remaining silent, why are you being bashful?

89
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,050
When have I accepted you by remaining silent?

90
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,860
Li Jing, if you can wake up, I'll agree to your request.

91
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,470
Once you've agreed, you can't go back on your word.

92
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,320
I, Li Jing, will only be with Ah Yin this lifetime.

93
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,230
If I break this promise, may I live my life alone, without any descendants.

94
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,320
Previously, you said that no matter what happens, you have to be with me.

95
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,040
Now, you're saying you were just being preposterous.

96
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,750
Fine.

97
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,730
I'll let you two be together.

98
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,940
When will you stop following me?

99
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,110
I said that I would pay you back.

100
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,500
Did I want you to pay me back?

101
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,910
Zhe Yan said that we must return favors to people we're in debt to.

102
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:43,400
If I can't pay you back here, I can pay you back elsewhere.

103
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,470
Hence, after thinking carefully about this,

104
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,720
I think it's better that I take the initiative to pay you back.

105
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,230
This way, I can choose how to repay you.

106
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,110
How do you plan to do it then?

107
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,080
I... I haven't thought about this yet.

108
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:11,430
Since Mo Yuan left, Kunlun Void has never been this bustling with activity.

109
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,100
Emperor Dong Hua.

110
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,850
What are you doing at Kunlun Void?

111
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,150
I was just passing by and dropped in to take a look.

112
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,440
Now, the people are gone and the place is empty.

113
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,880
The previous grandness is gone.

114
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,070
I won't disturb you again.

115
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,110
Ah Yin.

116
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,130
It has been 70,000 years.

117
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,650
Where have you gone to?

118
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,260
- Emperor.
- After obtaining an item just now,

119
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,260
I realized that the seal of the Donghuang Bell can't last forever.

120
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,760
Must we immediately report this to the Heavenly Emperor and look for a countermeasure?

121
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,930
When will the seal break?

122
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,770
It's today.

123
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,370
Today?

124
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,610
The sealing magic will disappear every 70,000 years.

125
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,350
70,000 years. Then...

126
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,860
Today, at Ruoshui Riverbed, a lady appeared.

127
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,140
She probably knows that the seal is about to be broken; hence, she went there to seal Qing Cang.

128
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,220
70,000 years...

129
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,970
Even Heavenly Emperor didn't know that the seal would eventually be gone.

130
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,280
Then, who would be able to predict such a thing?

131
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:10,000
It wasn't predicted, but... this lady already knew about this.

132
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,050
However, she didn't tell anyone.

133
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:19,750
I fear that she has long made a plan to duel it out with Qing Cang, not involving anyone else.

134
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,800
The more you say it, the more I admire this lady.

135
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,940
May I dare to ask who she is?

136
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:36,020
Most likely, it's the aunt of this Young Highness.

137
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,040
My aunt?

138
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,090
I still haven't asked.

139
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,740
This Young Highness is...?

140
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,070
I'm Bai Fengjiu from Green Hill.

141
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,430
Fox Emperor's granddaughter!

142
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,640
Your Young Highness Fengjiu.

143
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,010
It is indeed me.

144
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,820
Then, your aunt is Bai Qian from Green Hill?

145
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,340
Yes. My aunt is Bai Qian.

146
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,730
Then, isn't she the Crown Prince's main consort?

147
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,590
What main consort?

148
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,840
Isn't my aunt getting married to the Second Prince?

149
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,440
How did it become the Crown Prince?

150
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,780
It's a long story.

151
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,200
Keep the story short then.

152
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,860
Okay. Let's start with that little Bashe snake from your aunt's den.

153
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,070
Little Bashe snake? Are you referring to Shao Xin?

154
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,910
Yes, it's Shao Xin.

155
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,800
Shao Xin...

156
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,020
Why did you guess that it was Bai Qian of Green Hill?

157
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,840
The book that you are holding was left to this Young Highness by Bai Qian last night.

158
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,650
The book that you are holding was left to this Young Highness by Bai Qian last night.

159
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,550
It's clearly written on there the sealing technique of the Donghuang Bell.

160
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,500
Don't you find it too coincidental?

161
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,390
It's definitely so.

162
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,120
But I have one question.

163
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,120
Ever since Bai Qian was born, she never stepped out from Green Hill.

164
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,190
How did she know about the private technique of High God Mo Yuan?

165
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,260
That is also what's puzzling me.

166
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,930
Moreover, the passing of private techniques like this is usually from a teacher to his disciple.

167
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,360
High God Mo Yuan never accepted any female disciples.

168
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,670
Young Highness,

169
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,910
do you know any internal story?

170
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,360
My aunt has nothing to do with Kunlun Void.

171
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,950
That's strange then.

172
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:45,390
I fear that this puzzle can only be answered once Mo Yuan resurrects.

173
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,170
Perhaps,

174
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,490
when Ye Hua marries Bai Qian,

175
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,800
you can personally ask her.

176
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,020
Emperor, you must be joking.

177
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,070
That Great Lady Bai Qian from Green Hill is a very distinguished person.

178
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:05,240
I wouldn't dare to just casually ask her.

179
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,850
Hey, Star Monarch, you've stimulated my desire to listen to stories.

180
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,040
You have to be responsible and narrate it clearly.

181
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,620
After telling it, you have to help me pay back my debt of gratitude to the emperor.

182
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,810
- Pay back a debt of gratitude?
- Right.

183
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,790
Quick, tell me first.

184
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,790
Why is my aunt marrying the Crown Prince?

185
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,340
Also, you two were talking about my aunt sealing the Donghuang Bell.

186
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,130
I can't make any sense out of it.

187
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,710
Can you explain it clearly to me?

188
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,150
Let's go.

189
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,190
Let's talk while walking.

190
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,720
Young Highness, where do you want me to start my story?

191
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,780
Start from the little Bashe snake.

192
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,280
Okay.

193
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,840
I was just gone for a few days,

194
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,560
and that little maidservant turned my aunt into a laughingstock?

195
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,690
No. Even if Zhe Yan and Grandfather can endure this,

196
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,980
I can't!

197
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,320
So what if you don't?

198
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,500
Your aunt doesn't even care.

199
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,430
Aunt is able to endure it because she's magnanimous, but I can't.

200
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,750
Why don't you take me to the Heavenly Palace today?

201
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,450
What?

202
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,580
Why are you surprised? I must go teach that little Bashe snake a lesson.

203
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,500
Didn't I just break a crime of instigation?

204
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,970
Just for this woman, you destroyed your future.

205
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,880
Do you have any grudges?

206
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,640
I wouldn't dare.

207
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,160
You can take this little snake away, but you can't give her any status.

208
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
This is my greatest mercy.

209
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,260
I will abide.

210
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,350
Shao Xin, stop there!

211
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,880
My aunt treated you well.

212
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,020
You instead stole her fiancé and caused her to be laughed at by everyone.

213
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,470
Young Highness...

214
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,240
You even know that I'm Your Highness?

215
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,810
Everything is my fault.

216
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,450
Young Highness, please don't be mad.

217
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,030
Be careful not to hurt your health because of anger.

218
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,520
You only know to pretend to be weak.

219
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,620
How dare you! Where did this wild girl come from?

220
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,200
You dare to act atrociously in the Heavenly Palace?

221
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,960
You dare to stop me? You...

222
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,210
You're that unfaithful man,

223
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,500
Sang Ji, the second prince of Heavenly Tribe.

224
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,920
That's not right.

225
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,340
You have been demoted. You are no longer the second prince.

226
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,020
You are the Water Monarch of the Northern Sea.

227
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,400
Your rank isn't even as high as mine, so you can't stop me!

228
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,920
Shut up.

229
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,990
Water Monarch of the Northern Sea.

230
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,650
Water Monarch of the Northern Sea, please calm down.

231
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,690
Young Highness, calm down, too.

232
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,830
Since Heavenly Emperor has decided on this,

233
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,700
you two should just put harmony above all else. Put harmony above all else.

234
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,000
In consideration of Star Monarch Si Ming, I'll forgive you this time.

235
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,840
I'm the distinguished granddaughter of the Emperor of Green Hill.

236
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,250
I don't need you to consider anyone to spare me.

237
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,800
You wronged our Green Hill first.

238
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,340
I just scolded you a little and you can't take it?

239
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,660
You!

240
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,150
Fengjiu.

241
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,790
Emperor.

242
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,790
W-Why are you here?

243
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:52,360
Then should I just watch as you argue with the Water Monarch of the Northern Sea, instead?

244
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,500
I was seeking justice for my aunt.

245
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,750
I...

246
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,830
This is the granddaughter of the Fox Emperor of Green Hill.

247
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,470
She was spoiled by Fox Emperor.

248
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,580
Water Monarch, don't put it to heart.

249
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,080
I wouldn't dare to.

250
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,770
This lady...

251
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,950
Have you been serving Bai Qian of Green Hill?

252
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,630
Yes.

253
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:27,190
Then, have you heard of Si Yin?

254
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,330
Oh, no. Emperor is going to investigate the whereabouts of High God Mo Yuan.

255
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,000
Then, this little Bashe snake...

256
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,860
I don't know.

257
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,580
At least you have a conscience.

258
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,910
Do you know who I am?

259
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,130
I don't.

260
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,720
I'm Emperor Dong Hua.

261
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,420
If you lie to me, no one can save you.

262
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,290
Emperor, you are trying to threaten her.

263
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:08,340
I... truly have never heard of Si Yin.

264
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,320
You have to persist.

265
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,570
Okay, Emperor. Stop pressuring her.

266
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,110
She has been living in Green Hill for a long time.

267
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,610
How could she know the High Immortal Si Yin of Kunlun Void from 70,000 years ago?

268
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,500
You are right.

269
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,230
Emperor.

270
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,250
Early Dawn Palace?

271
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,830
You're so bold! How dare you trespass into Early Dawn Palace?!

272
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,880
In the whole Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses, is there a place that I can't enter?

273
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:44,960
I never thought that a mortal would dare to come to the Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness.

274
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,500
Kunlun Fan of Yuqing...

275
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,330
70,000 years ago... 70,000 years ago.

276
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:35,300
I want you all to be buried with him!

277
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,510
Impossible.

278
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,270
That one inside the hut is clearly a mortal.

279
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,760
And she's totally a different gender as him.

280
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,260
Why then does she have the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing?

281
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,300
- Fiery Golden Lion.
- Who are you?

282
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,570
Ye Hua, Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

283
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,730
Why is there red lightning on this mountain?

284
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,570
I hid from your Heavenly Tribe for 70,000 years!

285
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,800
Why must you be hell-bent on exterminating me?

286
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,890
That's karma.

287
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,940
Mother!

288
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,160
Mother, where are you?

289
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,460
My precious son.

290
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,340
- It's a dragon!
- It's a divine dragon!

291
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,200
- It's a divine dragon!
- It's a divine dragon!

292
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,110
The Red Lotus Fire of that Golden Lion is indeed very powerful.

293
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,600
I'm not able to recover to my human body.

294
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,780
I'll just rest here for a few days.

295
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,820
You're awake?

296
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,020
Here.

297
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,570
I have a cat in my room.

298
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,120
Hopefully, you two can get along.

299
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,010
Does it taste good?

300
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,710
What are you doing here?

301
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:52,280
Little black snake, come with me.

302
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,630
Where is this?

303
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,340
It's her.

304
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:25,970
In my dreams, she's a male.

305
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,710
Why is she a female now?

306
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,570
You're awake.

307
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:40,100
Do you know that you're the most handsome snake I've ever met?

308
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,100
You see, you even have horns on your head.

309
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,200
You feel so slippery. So good.

310
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,410
Do I look like a snake?

311
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:56,420
Do you know, when I first saw you in the cave, I thought you were hibernating?

312
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,260
Then, I thought isn't it September?

313
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,720
It isn't the time for snake hibernation.

314
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,940
I thought you might be injured, so I brought you back here to treat you.

315
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,580
Although the Golden Lion has powerful magic, he can't hurt me.

316
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,110
Do you know what place this is?

317
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:18,050
How come other than beasts, I can't see other humans?

318
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,480
This is the Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness.

319
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,070
Golden Lion has occupied this mountain for more than ten years.

320
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,970
Definitely, no one will come here to hunt.

321
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,790
I tell you, I only have this grass hut.

322
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,820
I see that you are also homeless.

323
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,360
How about you stay here so I can take care of you?

324
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,660
I only need three days to recover my human body and return to the Heavenly Palace.

325
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,820
Why do I need you to take care of me?

326
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,830
This is not right. I shouldn't discuss this with you.

327
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,240
Since I picked you up and brought you home, you should stay with me.

328
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,120
But if you want to leave, I won't stop you.

329
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,580
But you must not have another Master. Okay?

330
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,560
Master?

331
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,970
Okay.

332
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,410
I didn't get anything but just some fruits.

333
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,780
Just eat some of the fruits then.

334
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,310
This fan...

335
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,640
Could it be the Kunlun Fan of Yunqing?

336
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:20,290
Why does a mortal have a magical weapon of Kunlun Void?

337
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,420
Princess, Your Highness.

338
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,380
Why did His Mighty Monarch rest so early today?

339
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,090
Is he not feeling well?

340
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:42,530
Your Highness, His Mighty Monarch was ordered by Heavenly Monarch to go to the mortal world to subdue the Golden Lion.

341
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,870
Golden Lion?

342
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,780
Isn't that Qing Cang's animal carriage?

343
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,220
Indeed. It's that Golden Lion.

344
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,240
Because of the political change in the Winged Tribe, it escaped into the mortal world.

345
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:59,270
Then, when will His Mighty Monarch be back?

346
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,880
I made some soup.

347
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,940
I'm afraid it will get cold later on.

348
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,160
This... One day in the heavens is one year in the mortal world.

349
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:12,070
At most, it will take His Mighty Monarch the time for one incense stick to burn (~1 hour) to return.

350
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,930
Then, please take the soup in.

351
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,730
After His Mighty Monarch comes back, he can immediately drink it.

352
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,280
Yes.

353
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,330
They didn't attend the morning court meetings,

354
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,490
yet they want me to praise the loyalty of each of their sub-tribes?

355
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,120
Father Monarch, don't be angry.

356
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,870
I think that since Kunlun Void is gone, the more the Heavenly Tribe needs to be united.

357
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,290
The chieftains of each of this sub-tribes must be placated.

358
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,110
Eldest Brother is right.

359
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,850
On the south, there's the Merpeople Tribe. The north doesn't have peace, either.

360
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:11,060
At this time, we mustn't have any internal strife.

361
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,370
I understand.

362
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,450
You two don't need to worry.

363
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,520
Where's Ye Hua?

364
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,740
Heavenly Monarch, His Highness went to the mortal world to subdue the golden lion.

365
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,660
Since Ye Hua is not here,

366
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,750
you two make your suggestions first of any good plan

367
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:34,160
to make the different chieftains of the sub-tribes feel that I'm sincere in maintaining harmony with them.

368
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,490
Su Jin, you can leave first.

369
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,290
Heavenly Monarch,

370
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:47,790
do you possibly think that I'm an outsider?

371
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,230
I was brought here to the Heavenly Palace when I was little. I...

372
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,950
You are a woman.

373
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,470
Staying here will be useless.

374
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,090
Please leave.

375
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,830
Yes.

376
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:27,190
I have an idea that can placate the different sub-tribe chieftains.

377
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,390
You have an idea?

378
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,260
What idea?

379
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,210
Confer me as a side consort.

380
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:43,000
Confer you as a side consort?

381
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,360
If you confer me as your side consort;

382
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,720
first, not one sub-tribe is favored.

383
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,540
Second, it will show everyone that you put importance on the sub-tribes.

384
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
I'm old.

385
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,750
I'm not interested in the harem.

386
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,600
I will only delay you.

387
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,520
I just wanted to help you, Heavenly Monarch.

388
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,300
Just like my Father Monarch, I want to do some meaningful things for the world.

389
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:20,830
Exactly because your father had made sacrifices for the Heavenly Tribe, I really cannot do this.

390
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,130
The south is being troubled by the merpeople.

391
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,990
The Northern Wilderness is also at war.

392
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,590
The Heavenly Tribe needs an army.

393
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,770
Don't be hesitant anymore.

394
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,370
This is out of my heart.

395
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,670
I will never bear any grudge.

396
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,160
You don't understand.

397
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,280
This is your biggest moment in life.

398
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,390
We mustn't do it in a hasty manner.

399
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,010
If...

400
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:10,670
If you feel any guilt towards me, can you just promise me one condition?

401
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:16,540
If I have any wishes in the future, you'll surely fulfill them.

402
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,970
How didn't I realize you were injured when I picked you up?

403
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:48,530
I also used these medicinal herbs when I picked up those birds.

404
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,910
In less than ten days, you'll recover.

405
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,630
Bear with it. You will recover soon.

406
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,770
That's a decaying herb that can only be found here in the Eastern Wilderness.

407
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,300
It can eliminate necrotic flesh.

408
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,240
It should be paired with berry juice which has regenerating effects for it to be effective.

409
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,180
If you only use these, it will make my wounds worse.

410
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,950
It won't do any good.

411
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,100
It's done. I treat you well, right?

412
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,870
Snakes like to eat raw meat, right?

413
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,510
Snakes do like to eat raw meat

414
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,130
but I don't like it.

415
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,030
Eat it now. Aren't you hungry?

416
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,860
I can only eat this when it's cooked.

417
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,860
I'll be sad if you're hungry.

418
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,130
How dare you!

419
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,570
Still not eating?

420
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:46,840
Are you not eating because you want me to kiss you again?

421
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,850
No need. I will eat it.

422
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,800
The snakes here are indeed smart.

423
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,250
You know how to pick your own favorite food.

424
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,800
Good thing I brought you back that day.

425
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,710
You are way smarter than the birds and cat.

426
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,610
How about you accompany me to the market to trade some items?

427
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,760
I already stayed here for three days.

428
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,500
I should say farewell to you.

429
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,400
Although you made my wound deeper, you had good intentions.

430
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,280
Thank you for your hospitality for these three days.

431
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,260
I'll say goodbye now.

432
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,820
Then, let's go.

433
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,000
Don't you see it's going to rain soon?

434
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,300
It's going to rain soon. Let's find a place for cover first.

435
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,420
I heard Crown Prince has subdued the Golden Lion in this area.

436
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,930
If I had gotten this news earlier, it would have been better.

437
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,070
For thousands of years in the Heavenly Palace,

438
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:26,780
I've never had the chance to talk to His Highness.

439
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
Are you about to cast rain?

440
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,840
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

441
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,100
You don't need to cast rain today.

442
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,600
Yes.

443
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,010
The dark clouds just dispersed like that?

444
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,040
You're sleeping again.

445
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,300
If you're not eating, you're sleeping.

446
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,900
You're really a snake.

447
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,280
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

448
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,430
Su Jin.

449
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,810
Heavenly Monarch.

450
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,490
I've already killed the Golden Lion, and came back to report the completion of my mission.

451
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,190
Good! You were able to complete your mission so successfully.

452
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,450
You didn't disappoint me.

453
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,340
But I still was careless and suffered some injuries.

454
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,760
I've shamed your trust.

455
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,800
- Is it serious?
- It's not. Just a minor wound.

456
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,600
It's just that the wound wasn't properly tended to.

457
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,360
I must re-bandage it.

458
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,860
The Red Lotus Fire isn't an ordinary sinister magic.

459
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,030
You must be careful.

460
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,200
Yes.

461
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,530
- Slowly.
- Okay.

462
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,610
- Put it here. Put it here.
- Come, give it to me.

463
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,260
Come, please hold this first.

464
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,700
- There's more. Here.
- Be careful of what you're stepping on.

465
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,090
- Take these two.
- Okay. Okay.
- Be careful.

466
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,470
Come. Come. There are some more wood.

467
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,100
Sir, may I ask, what happened here?

468
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:39,370
Yesterday, there was a completely red lion-like monster spouting fire in this area.

469
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,530
Look. Everything was burned.

470
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:46,270
The heavens might be trying to bless ordinary citizens like us.

471
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,260
Suddenly, a black dragon appeared with the rain.

472
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:55,520
Not only did it put out the fire, he even struck lightning to kill that beast.

473
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,210
Does that beast look like a lion?

474
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,120
That's more or less what people are saying.

475
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,060
Golden Lion? Hey, Sir!

476
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,520
Do you know where the corpse of the beast is?

477
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,450
Miss, you're so weird.

478
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,970
You want to look at the corpse of a monster?

479
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,700
I don't know.

480
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,870
Back then, Eldest Brother disappeared with father's ride, the Golden Lion.

481
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,100
If it's really Golden Lion, I can then find clues of where Eldest Brother is.

482
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,550
Selling buns!

483
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,900
Hot buns!

484
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,490
I've sold some fruits and got some bronze coins in return.

485
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,960
Later, let's have some tea and listen to stories.

486
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,560
Let's go.

487
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,930
This talisman. Look at this talisman.

488
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:44,390
If a similar situation like yesterday happens to you,

489
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:48,190
I guarantee that this talisman can bless you with protection from the black dragon.

490
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,400
- Come! Come!
- I want one!

491
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,540
Everyone will have one! Everyone will have one!

492
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,550
- Everyone can get one!
- Can that talisman really drive monsters away?f

493
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,830
Of course. Miss, do you want one, too?

494
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,090
I'm not afraid of demons.

495
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:03,350
For a lady, you are quite bold.

496
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,860
You are not afraid of demons?

497
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:11,410
Vegetables!

498
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,700
- He got hit and fell on the floor!
- Good! Good!

499
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,400
That scene happened so fast.

500
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,370
That hero just flipped and jumped on top of that tiger.

501
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,630
- He swung his fist thrice and kicked twice.
- Good! Good!

502
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,250
Miss.

503
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,860
Why did you follow me? I won't buy your talisman.

504
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:37,380
I just wanted to know where you got this fan from.

505
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,960
I picked it up.

506
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,820
How about selling it to me?

507
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,800
I'm not selling it. This fan is the first item I've picked up.

508
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,570
I'm keeping it as a remembrance.

509
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,710
You don't have any use for it anyway, so why keep it?

510
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,310
I already said that I won't sell it.

511
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,440
- Miss, look.
- Hey, you!

512
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,800
Miss, how come you stole my fan when I was writing my talismans?

513
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,580
Who stole your fan? Return it to me.

514
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,330
It was you.

515
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,190
Earlier, I was writing talismans outside and you approached me to observe what was happening.

516
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,320
While I was not paying attention, you stole my fan.

517
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,420
I found this fan!

518
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,250
- Hey.
- Everyone, take a look.

519
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:21,040
Miss, since you are this hard-mouthed, why don't we ask a middle man to be the judge

520
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,690
and see who this fan belongs to?

521
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,410
The fan was mine to begin with.

522
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,590
Why must we ask a third person to judge it?

523
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:30,020
If this fan really belongs to you,

524
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,160
do you know what's drawn on it?

525
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,960
And who wrote on it?

526
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,500
It makes sense.

527
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,740
I didn't look at it in details.

528
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,150
Of course, you don't know.

529
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:42,470
Even if you know, you wouldn't know the history of this fan.

530
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,690
My ancestors passed this down to me.

531
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:48,110
It has been passed down to me from many generations.

532
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:52,070
The drawing on it is the divine mountain, Kunlun Void.

533
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:57,190
This fan is a divine magical weapon, the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing.

534
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,430
Wow! Impressive!

535
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:02,220
Kunlun Fan of Yuqing?

536
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:31,360
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

537
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,390
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

538
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,690
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

539
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:41,330
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

540
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:50,420
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

541
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,620
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

542
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:59,890
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

543
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:06,290
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

544
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,430
♫ All are just illusions ♫

545
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,950
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

546
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:24,190
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

547
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:28,670
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

548
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:34,790
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

549
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:40,200
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

550
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,460
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

551
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,390
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

552
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:57,310
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

553
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:09,360
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

554
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:14,940
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

555
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,270
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

556
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:25,630
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

557
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:30,730
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

558
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:36,170
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

559
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,800
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

560
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:48,140
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

561
00:44:49,640 --> 00:45:00,630
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
