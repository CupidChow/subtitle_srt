”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,500
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,930
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,580
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,100
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,320
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,090
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,690
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,210
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,780
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,420
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,860
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,330
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,980
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,420
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,060
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,500
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,000
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,710
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,130
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,630
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,950
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,800
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,410
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,850
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,030
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,900
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,010
[Episode 21]

31
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,980
After soaking for three to five days in Lord of Lingbao's Heavenly Eye Spring, normal wounds can recover.

32
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,390
But you have been here for several days, and there's still no improvements.

33
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,290
Looks like the Soul Severing Blade that has been offered tributes to by the merpeople for thousands of years in their Shaman Temple is really formidable.

34
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,200
You found the most loyal and honest divine maid to attend to her.

35
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,130
You haven't been to Courtyard of Moonlight for seven or eight days.

36
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,710
You obviously love her very much, but you pretend not to care.

37
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,900
It's also a kind of torture.

38
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,200
Third Uncle,

39
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,330
I heard when we fought with the Merpeople Tribe, Li Yuan also escaped from the Land of Extreme Coldness.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,340
What is your impression of the former first prince of the Winged Tribe?

41
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,800
Li Yuan?

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,760
I met him 70,000 years ago.

43
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,290
He's very fierce and ruthless, but he's a little lacking if he wants to be the winged monarch.

44
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,630
But I heard the current king, Li Jing, also indulges in sensual pleasures.

45
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,440
Both of them are incompetent.

46
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,280
That's right.

47
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,570
Father Monarch.

48
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,800
The two sons of Qing Cang don't amount to anything.

49
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,020
Ye Hua is healing his wounds here,

50
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,750
yet you're here trying to avoid the religious assembly.

51
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,430
Father Monarch, that's not true.

52
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,010
I'm here to check on Ye Hua's injuries because I was worried.

53
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,520
I'm heading back to the religious assembly now.

54
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,180
After here, it'll be High Clear Plane.

55
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,680
Your Highness Su Jin.

56
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,120
Your Second Highness.

57
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,100
I'm the Water Monarch of the Northern Sea.

58
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,530
How could I, a demoted person, be addressed as Second Highness again?

59
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,350
In my heart, you will always be the Second Highness.

60
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,400
It will never change.

61
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,850
Are you pregnant again?

62
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,630
Yes, my morning sickness is killing me.

63
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:27,630
Look, Su Su. The both of you are very fortunate.

64
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,150
And this is?

65
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,690
This is...

66
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,910
This is Ye Hua's savior in the mortal realm.

67
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,870
She's a mortal named Su Su.

68
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,970
She's pregnant with Ye Hua's child,

69
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,690
so he's keeping her here in the Heavenly Palace.

70
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,520
Ye Hua's savior in the mortal realm?

71
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,920
That's right. Ye Hua was severely injured in the Mortal Realm after his fight with the Fiery Golden Lion,

72
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,600
and she saved him.

73
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,480
Who knew Ye Hua would find such a casual lover?

74
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,720
When you were at Heavenly Palace, didn't you had many beauties, too?

75
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,800
By the way, Second Highness, do you know where His Highness the Crown Prince is?

76
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,780
I just heard from Lord of Lingbao that he has been soaking in the Heavenly Eye Spring since this morning.

77
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,700
That's right, too.

78
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,180
Ye Hua was severely injured.

79
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,850
That place is more suitable for recuperation.

80
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,720
Su Su, let's go.

81
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,490
Second Highness, Lady Shao Xin, we will take our leave.

82
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,440
Shao Xin,

83
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,400
why do you keep staring at that mortal?

84
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,710
Your Highness Su Jin.

85
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,420
Do you only see me, and not this noble lady next to me?

86
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,220
Your Highness Su Jin, she does not have a title here.

87
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,960
- We do not—
- How dare you?!

88
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,000
You are from the Heavenly Palace.

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,650
Don't you know that she is His Highness the Crown Prince's woman?

90
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,790
Your Highness, we know,

91
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:36,950
but His Highness once ordered us to treat her with the Heavenly Palace's rules.

92
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,400
Please forgive us, Your Highness Su Jin!

93
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,140
Your Highness,

94
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,360
don't make it hard for them.

95
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,780
I... truly don't have a title.

96
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,100
All right, you may stand.

97
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes.

98
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,570
Are Heavenly Monarch and His Highness the Crown Prince in there?

99
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,850
Your Highness, His Highness the Crown Prince has been here for two hours.

100
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,660
Heavenly Monarch just arrived.

101
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,790
- Does Your Highness want us to inform them?
- No need.

102
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,300
- But—
- If Heavenly Monarch and Crown Prince get angry, I'm here.

103
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,100
There's no need to be afraid.

104
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,230
I'm from High Clear Plane.

105
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:36,880
The noble lady here instructed you to retrieve the fan that she usually uses and to go to High Clear Plane.

106
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,460
The fan that she usually uses?

107
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,570
It's a fan with a drawing of mountains and water.

108
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,100
She just handed it over to you.

109
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,200
Look for it and deliver it to High Clear Plane immediately.

110
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,900
All right.

111
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,460
Although Green Hill said that Bai Qian is in seclusion,

112
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,170
you can't delay the wedding.

113
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,520
I understand.

114
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,720
The Fox Emperor has only one daughter, Bai Qian.

115
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,600
She has also inherited the position as Monarchess of the Eastern Wilderness.

116
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,540
She won't be a kind and good-tempered woman.

117
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,390
If she finds out you suddenly have a child and gives you a hard time,

118
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,990
you must know to endure it.

119
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,700
Yes.

120
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,550
Su Su.

121
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,890
- Heavenly Monarch.
- Heavenly Monarch.

122
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,370
Why are you here?

123
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,140
I...

124
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:07,620
Heavenly Monarch, Consort Le Xu was afraid that Su Su would feel bored while being detained in the Courtyard of Moonlight.

125
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,410
She asked me to come out for a stroll with her.

126
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,120
Do you think a mere mortal can come to the Lord of Lingbao's assembly?

127
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,340
If you have no business, leave.

128
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,440
Yes.

129
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,360
Su Su, don't worry.

130
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,980
With Ye Hua here, Heavenly Monarch won't do anything to you.

131
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,740
Why are you here?

132
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,920
Ye Hua, I brought Su Su here. Don't blame her.

133
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,660
It's better for you, Consort Su Jin, not to interfere with the issue within Pure Wutong Palace.

134
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,280
You are right.

135
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,760
You are Your Highness the Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

136
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,620
As for me, I'm merely one of the many consorts in Heavenly Monarch's harem.

137
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,520
I was being a busybody.

138
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,440
Don't interact with her again in the future.

139
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,220
Based on the laws of the Heavenly Tribe, you shouldn't be here.

140
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,260
I'll change my clothes and escort you back.

141
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,330
Take me there!

142
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,100
Please! Take me!

143
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,250
Not only are Heavenly Monarch and the Emperor there today, everyone who's prestigious from all realms will be there.

144
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,020
Since you have no invitation, how can I let you in?

145
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,520
But I'm a divine maid.

146
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,250
I'll just follow you.

147
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,870
Today, I'm Star Monarch Si Ming's divine maid.

148
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,520
- I wouldn't dare to.
- You dare to.

149
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,960
- I wouldn't dare to.
- You dare to.

150
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,980
Shao Xin is pregnant.

151
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:38,770
I brought her here today to request that you issue a decree to allow me to give her a legal status.

152
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,730
You gave up your bright future for her.

153
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,200
I'm already very disappointed,

154
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,770
yet you even brought her to Heavenly Palace at the assembly of the Lord of Lingbao.

155
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,140
Do you want me to remember your past unfilial actions?

156
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,460
I didn't consider this completely.

157
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,110
Father Monarch, please don't be angry.

158
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,660
Father Monarch, please don't be angry.

159
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,150
Leave now.

160
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,350
Don't create a disturbance at the Lord of Lingbao's assembly.

161
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,180
This is bad. It's the beast of Lord of Lingbao.

162
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,270
Father Monarch, be careful!

163
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,620
Your Young Highness! Your Young Highness!

164
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,840
The demonic nature of this phoenix is not removed.

165
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,830
Disperse now!

166
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,220
Don't say anything.

167
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,530
Emperor.

168
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,350
What happened?

169
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,850
Why did she spit blood?

170
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,630
Her Young Highness insisted on joining the assembly with me,

171
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:18,390
but someone dropped the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing from Kunlun Void and surprised Lord of Lingbao's mount.

172
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:23,210
When that Phoenix lost its sanity, it wounded Her Young Highness.

173
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,910
Everyone, leave.

174
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,100
Yes.

175
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,410
Emperor, why not allow me to take a look at her?

176
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,280
Leave!

177
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,440
Yes.

178
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,940
I let Su Su take care of the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing.

179
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,130
She doesn't know that it's a magical weapon of the Kunlun Void.

180
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,160
I thought that, as a mortal, she wouldn't know how to use it even if she had obtained it.

181
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,260
I didn't expect such a disaster would occur.

182
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,150
I didn't handle this well.

183
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,220
I'm willing to be punished.

184
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,040
Do you know who was injured?

185
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,680
I don't.

186
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,560
It was Bai Qian's niece, Bai Fengjiu, from Green Hill.

187
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,880
Bai Qian hasn't married into the Heavenly Tribe, but a mortal wounded her niece.

188
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,000
If Green Hill blames us, what will I do?

189
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,820
I'm willing to go to Green Hill to seek punishment.

190
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,090
Seek punishment? Rise.

191
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,940
Yes.

192
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:56,260
You were negligent in your sin, but what about this mortal's sin?

193
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,970
I'm innocent.

194
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,070
Please be wise and investigate this, Heavenly Monarch.

195
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,370
You're innocent?

196
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,240
Previously, I didn't know this fan was genuine.

197
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,760
In the Laws of Heaven, there's no such clause for being ignorant.

198
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,350
I didn't have the intention to intrude deliberately.

199
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,560
A divine maid passed a message to me.

200
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,020
She said that My Lady wanted me to deliver the fan.

201
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,340
Which divine maid? Do you know her?

202
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,640
Heavenly Monarch, please investigate wisely.

203
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,700
I didn't pass any message to Nai Nai. Someone must be out to frame me.

204
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,520
How presumptuous!

205
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,600
Are you saying an immortal is trying to harm a mere mortal here?!

206
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,100
I'm not the only one to claim that. You heard it, too!

207
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,970
That's enough!

208
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,970
Please forgive Su Su for her outrageous claims.

209
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:04,340
Father Monarch, this divine maid from the Courtyard of Moonlight just got promoted from the divine mountain in the lower realm.

210
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,270
She doesn't understand the rules here.

211
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,210
It's also her first time seeing such a huge event.

212
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,140
She merely committed a mistake and dared not admit it.

213
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,520
Father Monarch, you don't need to be angry over the words of a measly slave.

214
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,030
Although Nai Nai is of low rank, she's very honest.

215
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,420
How could she not admit her mistake and frame it on others?

216
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,990
- Heavenly Monarch—
- Shut up!

217
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,950
Heavenly Monarch, please allow me to say a few words.

218
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,130
What are you trying to say?

219
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:45,110
Blame me for taking the initiative to bring Su Su to High Clear Plane.

220
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:50,200
If you want to mete out any punishments, I'm willing to be punished in her place.

221
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,790
Are you willing to take her punishment?

222
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,350
Yes.

223
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,940
I am willing to take her punishment.

224
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,560
There's no need for outsiders to interfere in matters of Pure Wutong Palace.

225
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,940
If there are any punishments to be meted, Su Su will be punished.

226
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,370
It has nothing to do with you, Heavenly Consort.

227
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,970
Heavenly Monarch.

228
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,520
Heavenly Monarch, I just found out that that beast created a disaster.

229
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Hence, I rushed here.

230
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,390
Thank you, everyone, for subduing it.

231
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:28,290
I wonder why it suddenly released such a demonic nature today.

232
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,810
A servant dropped this fan and surprised the Phoenix.

233
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,590
I was just meting out punishment on them.

234
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,120
Kunlun Fan of Yuqing?

235
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,090
Heavenly Monarch, do you know who the original owner is?

236
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,300
I know.

237
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:12,210
Heavenly Monarch, you may not know that 70,000 years ago, this beast almost wounded High Immortal Si Yin?

238
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,200
- It almost wounded High Immortal Si Yin?
- That's right.

239
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,550
If I remember correctly, the Winged Monarch was there, too.

240
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,980
He was also wounded by that beast.

241
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,800
Winged Monarch, do you still remember this?

242
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,530
That's right.

243
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,040
Ah Yin and I fought with this Phoenix in the past.

244
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,470
She later used this Kunlun Fan to subdue it.

245
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:45,210
I didn't know that Si Yin and you, Winged Monarch, were friends.

246
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:51,490
It was purely coincidental. We were not friends.

247
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,870
Since you are going to handle family matters,

248
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,570
it's not appropriate for me to be here.

249
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,550
I'm taking my leave.

250
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,150
Winged Monarch, please do as you wish.

251
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,210
Everyone,

252
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,140
I'm taking my leave.

253
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,820
Perhaps, it's because Si Yin used this fan to subdue the beast,

254
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,400
the beast had a relapse of its demonic nature and wounded others.

255
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:35,370
Regardless, it was still people from Pure Wutong Palace who disrupted your assembly, Senior Brother.

256
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,280
Senior Brother, I seek your forgiveness.

257
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,610
It was a mere beast that died.

258
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,760
Heavenly Monarch, why are you so angry?

259
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:55,740
Not only did your mount die, but this beast also wounded the Young Highness of Green Hill.

260
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,530
This is also my fault.

261
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,770
I knew that this beast was untamed,

262
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:05,480
and I still brought it to Nine Heavens and created such a disaster.

263
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,030
If there are any punishments to be meted, I should be punished first.

264
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,990
Lord, your words are too serious.

265
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,680
Since Lord of Lingbao prevented you from being punished,

266
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,930
you must remember this in your heart.

267
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,360
Su Jin, rise.

268
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,500
Yes.

269
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,290
The both of you, leave.

270
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,570
Wait.

271
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,360
Although Lord of Lingbao has pleaded for your mercy, it's still hard for me to let you two off so lightly.

272
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,140
Starting from today, everyone at the Courtyard of Moonlight will be confined.

273
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:45,150
Without my consent, you are not allowed to leave Pure Wutong Palace.

274
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,550
I will abide.

275
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:56,540
Junior Brother, our teacher is here, too.

276
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,740
Let's go and greet him.

277
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,670
Ye Hua,

278
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,770
since your teacher is here, go and pay respects to him now.

279
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,050
Yes.

280
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,960
Escort them back.

281
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,250
- Yes.
- Yes.

282
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,270
Thank you for your help, Senior Brother.

283
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:52,820
Fortunately, Winged Monarch Li Jing came to find me.

284
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:58,900
If not, with Heavenly Monarch's temper, he would have killed that lady.

285
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,220
Winged Monarch Li Jing?

286
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:08,230
A few days ago, because his mount mistakenly set fire to Zhaohua Palace,

287
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,500
Su Su was almost hurt.

288
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,970
That's also the reason he was willing to extend his help today,

289
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,240
even though it was none of his business.

290
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,400
Ye Hua, think back on how your second uncle was favored in the past,

291
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,060
but he was demoted and sent to the Northern Sea because of a woman.

292
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,890
You personally witnessed all of that.

293
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,220
A mortal is a mortal, after all.

294
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,330
She's not suitable to stay here.

295
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,810
Send her away as soon as possible so that you can preserve her life.

296
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,980
Everyone, leave.

297
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,290
Yes.

298
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,530
Kneel down.

299
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,800
Why did you try to protect that mortal?

300
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,790
I don't believe a death sentence is suitable for what happened today.

301
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,580
Since a death sentence is not necessary,

302
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,300
and we only need her to suffer, it's better not to punish her.

303
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:38,010
Su Jin, stop showing off your intelligence in front of me.

304
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,950
I wouldn't dare to do that.

305
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:46,730
I'm also afraid that woman will be a hindrance to His Highness the Crown Prince.

306
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:56,260
Hence, I am willing to help you legally get rid of that mortal, Su Su.

307
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,520
Su Jin,

308
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,720
when you first wanted to share my burdens and enter the palace as a consort,

309
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,790
you helped me win the people's support,

310
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:16,200
and I granted you a wish.

311
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,370
Now, you are going to help me to get rid of this woman.

312
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,050
What is your request now?

313
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,090
My request is still the same.

314
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,540
Same request?

315
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:38,020
Tell me. Why are you being so persistent?

316
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,960
I only have one request.

317
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,700
If I am able to let that mortal die,

318
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,190
Your Majesty will make me a side consort of the Crown Prince.

319
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:08,100
You want to enter Pure Wutong Palace?

320
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,600
In my lifetime, I only have this wish.

321
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,120
Tell me.

322
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:19,100
When you first wanted to be a heavenly consort, was it to pave the way for this?

323
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,460
That's right.

324
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,290
Excellent.

325
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:29,660
Ye Hua should have someone like you by his side.

326
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:36,500
You know what you want and what you should do in order to obtain what you want.

327
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,900
Fine, I agree.

328
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:47,780
Rewarding my grandson with a few consorts is not a big deal.

329
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,550
After all, I did not patronize you,

330
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:55,280
so there is no need to retain you in the palace to waste away your youth.

331
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,580
Heavenly Monarch, you've agreed?

332
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,680
That's right.

333
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,800
I've agreed.

334
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,050
Thank you, Heavenly Monarch.

335
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,090
But...

336
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:16,090
you must remember what you promised me.

337
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,060
Heavenly Monarch, don't worry.

338
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:26,090
I will think of a way such that even His Highness the Crown Prince won't be able to protect her.

339
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,770
Could it be the beast mistook Miss Su Su for Ah Yin, too?

340
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:57,610
Mighty Monarch, Miss Su Su was protected by the Lord of Lingbao

341
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:01,430
and was brought back to Pure Wutong Palace and confined in the Courtyard of Moonlight.

342
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,440
Confined?

343
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:08,250
It's obvious that someone in the palace wants to kill her.

344
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:12,990
As a mortal, she won't be able to defend herself in Nine Heavens.

345
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,790
Mighty Monarch, you are worrying too much.

346
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,030
She's already pregnant with His Highness the Crown Prince's child.

347
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,970
She won't be in any danger in Heavenly Palace.

348
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,630
It's hard to say.

349
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,790
Mighty Monarch, aren't you overly concerned about that mortal?

350
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,140
Ever since you've been pregnant, I tried to accommodate you as much as possible.

351
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,520
Why are you becoming more and more unreasonable?

352
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,210
Mighty Monarch, I'm doing this all for you.

353
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,140
For me?

354
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,160
Do you think that my affections for you are false?

355
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,330
I don't want to talk to you about this.

356
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,340
Mighty Monarch!

357
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,730
Don't worry, I won't go to Pure Wutong to look for that lady.

358
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,190
- Emperor...
- Keep quiet.

359
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,020
Emperor, are you saving me?

360
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,870
If you save me again,

361
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:47,860
then how can I possibly repay... repay this debt?

362
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,410
Keep quiet.

363
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,330
Emperor...

364
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,970
My Lady, it's my fault for trusting others and implicating you.

365
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,640
Please punish me.

366
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,740
I don't have any authority or power here.

367
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,140
I don't even have the rights to talk.

368
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,160
Actually, I'm the one implicating you.

369
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,980
I was stupid.

370
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:56,670
Nai Nai, do you know what the relationship between Ye Hua and Heavenly Consort Su Jin is?

371
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:02,360
I only heard that Consort Su Jin was raised by His Highness the Crown Prince's mother.

372
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,750
She was His Highness the Crown Prince's childhood companion.

373
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,910
I see.

374
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,660
Su Su.

375
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,700
I originally wanted to repay my debt but dragged the Emperor into this.

376
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,590
He depleted his divine power to treat my injury.

377
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:28,640
If I continue to stay, I will completely embarrass Green Hill.

378
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,520
I'm doomed. I'm doomed.

379
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,600
I can't walk anymore.

380
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,680
Fengjiu, don't faint.

381
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,980
- Su Su.
- Ye Hua.

382
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,070
Sorry.

383
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:50,580
Ever since I've been pregnant, my mood hasn't been stable.

384
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,900
This is not your fault.

385
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,120
It's just that there are too many rules in Heavenly Palace.

386
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,220
It's not that carefree compared to Junji Mountain.

387
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:06,510
- What happened yesterday—
- What happened yesterday is not your fault.

388
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,600
I have been thinking.

389
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:16,850
I think Heavenly Monarch is biased towards me because you secretly married me in the mortal realm.

390
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:32,740
Ye Hua, I want to live my days here with you just like when we were in Junji Mountain, okay?

391
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,250
Will you still come to see me tonight?

392
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,200
I won't.

393
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,540
I understand.

394
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,050
You are the Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

395
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,590
You must be diligent in your official duties.

396
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,990
If I don't let you go, they will say that I'm a femme fatale.

397
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:14,320
That's how it's performed in the operas.

398
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,420
There are no such mortal operas in the Heavenly Palace.

399
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,240
I'm leaving first.

400
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,600
Emperor.

401
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:25,560
Go and tell Heavenly Monarch that the young empress of Green Hill is okay now.

402
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,580
It's good that she's fine.

403
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,450
Did Her Young Highness go back to Green Hill?

404
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,480
I'm taking my leave.

405
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,040
Mighty Monarch.

406
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,840
Did you find Li Yuan?

407
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,480
Yes, I did.

408
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,130
But he's in Northern Wilderness.

409
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,990
- Northern Wilderness?
- Yes.

410
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:06,010
Li Yuan has defected to the Northern Wilderness,

411
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,870
Winged Monarch.

412
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:19,470
Heavenly Monarch has an urgent matter and has invited you to the Grand Hall to discuss it.

413
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:23,210
Yes. I understand.

414
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,400
- Where are you going?
- To the Grand Hall to discuss something urgent with the Heavenly Monarch.

415
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,360
I don't believe you. Why would he look for you to discuss an urgent matter?

416
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,880
You are not even from the Heavenly Palace.

417
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,250
Why would he discuss anything important with you?

418
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,460
It's obvious you are going to look for that mortal.

419
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,890
You're taking advantage of the fact that I'm restricted here, so I can't control you.

420
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,040
Enough!

421
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,780
I will tell you why Heavenly Monarch is looking for me.

422
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,890
It's because you stole the commander seal.

423
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,790
You gave it to Yan Zhi, and Yan Zhi rescued Li Yuan.

424
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,250
They have defected to the Northern Wilderness,

425
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,920
Defect?

426
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,650
If Heavenly Monarch pins this blame on us and wants to punish you,

427
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,510
I won't be able to save you.

428
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,390
You better stay here.

429
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,160
It really feels great to be hugged by the Emperor.

430
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:42,550
But lying to your life savior isn't a good idea, right?

431
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,400
Emperor?

432
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,580
Come here.

433
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,410
Heavenly Monarch is furious?

434
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:18,760
That's right. Winged Monarch and His Highness the Crown Prince have been summoned.

435
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:50,350
It's said in the scroll that the Fiery Golden Lion showed up in the rebel camp in Northern Wilderness.

436
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,810
Fiery Golden Lion?

437
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:22,440

♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

439

♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:32,490
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

443

♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

444
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:57,340
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

♫ All are just illusions ♫

♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

bloom again? ♫
