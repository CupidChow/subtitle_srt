”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,580
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,100
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,710
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,040
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,440
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,270
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,790
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,290
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,990
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,380
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,070
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,560
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,150
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,600
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,570
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,620
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,900
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,080
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,810
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,280
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,910
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,050
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,920
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,700
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,430
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,120
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,190
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

29
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:05,220
[Eternal Love]

00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,980
[Episode 25]

31
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,550
How presumptuous! How dare you barge into His Highness the Crown Prince's chamber?

32
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,080
I need to see His Highness! My Lady is giving birth.

33
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,060
Please find someone to help her!

34
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,770
His Highness the Crown Prince has ordered that no one is to enter.

35
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,990
I beg of you! My Lady can't wait any longer.

36
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,090
Please let me go in!

37
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,540
- Your Third Highness.
- Nai Nai, what's wrong?

38
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,170
Your Third Highness, My Lady is about to give birth!

39
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,370
What are you saying?!

40
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,750
Hurry, get up.

41
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,420
- Bring me there first. Okay?
- But His Highness...

42
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,510
Forget him. Let's go!

43
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,670
Yes.

44
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,350
- Hurry! Medicine King, protect the mother and the child!
- My Lady...

45
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,470
Yes. Greetings, My Lady.

46
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,320
Forget the formalities!

47
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,380
- Remember, you need to protect the both of them.
- Yes.

48
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,760
She can't be in the wind.

49
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,480
- Hurry up and close all the doors.
 - Yes.

50
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,410
- Hurry!
- You're fine.
- Your Third Highness,

51
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,200
- you should leave.
- Okay. I will.

52
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,960
My Lady, the Medicine King is here.

53
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,560
You must be safe, My Lady.

54
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,780
Ye Hua.

55
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,800
My Lady, believe me.

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,320
His Highness the Crown Prince will surely come.

57
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,020
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

58
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,810
Is it a boy or a girl?

59
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,360
- Your Highness, he...
- Tell me!

60
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,750
Your Highness, the child was really born sick!

61
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,400
Please spare me, Your Highness. Please spare me, Your Highness.

62
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,180
It was you! You killed my son!

63
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,990
Xuan Nü, you just gave birth. You shouldn't stand so soon. Lay back down.

64
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,920
Mighty Monarch, this shaman made me eat some pregnancy pill

65
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,590
that caused me to give birth early and birth a sickly child!

66
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,290
What did you say?!

67
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,230
Mighty Monarch, I'm innocent!

68
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,360
Mighty Monarch, I had detected problems with this child half a year ago in her womb,

69
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,350
but Winged Monarchess forced me to use... use a forbidden spell to help her give birth.

70
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,020
This... This had nothing to do with me, Mighty Monarch!

71
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,360
How dare you accuse me?!

72
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,440
You clearly poisoned and killed my son.

73
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,310
Guards! Drag him out and execute him!

74
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,090
Yes!

75
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,700
Mighty Monarch, I'm innocent! Mighty Monarch, I'm innocent!

76
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,020
Mighty Monarch, I'm innocent!

77
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,040
Winged Monarchess, you deserve a tragic death!

78
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,630
Mighty Monarch, I have been loyal to three generations of Winged Monarchs!

79
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,240
I'm innocent! Mighty Monarch!

80
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,040
You can't treat me like this!

81
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,000
Mighty Monarch!

82
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,620
Son,

83
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,880
I will surely save you.

84
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,660
Mighty Monarch!

85
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,340
In ancient times, ill-fated couples would be condemned.

86
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,150
For example, someone named Jie Yu was in such an ill-fated relationship

87
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,920
that all three of his children were born sickly.

88
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,890
- Really?
- Of course.

89
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,610
My mother told me when I was young.

90
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,770
That's called retribution.

91
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,600
That's why you can't do any more bad things now that you're with me, understand?

92
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,810
Yes, I will abide.

93
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:15,400
Si Yin, you want to break my seal?

94
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:25,100
That's not possible unless either I die... or you die.

95
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,680
Your Highness.

96
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,910
Third Uncle! How is Su Su?

97
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,010
I don't know what the situation is, but the Medicine King is inside.

98
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,540
Don't be too worried.

99
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,020
It's born! It's finally born!

100
00:08:53,790 --> 00:09:00,660
Congratulations, My Lady, for giving birth to a son.

101
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,130
Congratulations, Your Highness, for having a son.

102
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,850
Congratulations, My Lady, for giving birth to a son.

103
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,810
He looks so much like you.

104
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,080
Feel him.

105
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,280
I won't stay here in Nine Heavens, son.

106
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,980
You're the young prince.

107
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,780
They definitely won't burden you.

108
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,740
Nai Nai.

109
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,490
- My Lady.
- Is he hungry?

110
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,740
Heavenly Monarch sent a wet nurse.

111
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,920
I'll take him to be fed.

112
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,630
Go. I'm tired. I'll sleep now.

113
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,210
Please rest.

114
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,820
What?!

115
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,840
She actually gave birth to a son?!

116
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,430
Yes, Your Highness.

117
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,620
That mortal is so lucky.

118
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,540
Her first child is a son.

119
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,290
Now, her status will rise because of her son.

120
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,440
It will definitely be an obstacle for Your Highness in the future.

121
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,400
Why?

122
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,580
Why is she so fortunate?

123
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,830
She's just a mortal.

124
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,060
She married someone I can't marry,

125
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:58,280
and she gave birth to a prince on her first time!

126
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,530
Xin Nu, you tell me why.

127
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,450
Why is she so fortunate?!

128
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,280
I'm a princess of the Heavenly Tribe and the descendant of martyrs!

129
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,790
How am I not comparable to her?! How am I not comparable to her?!

130
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,290
Your Highness. Your Highness, don't be like this.

131
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,620
I know you're hurt, but you shouldn't panic.

132
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,910
Heavenly Monarch already offered your marriage to His Highness the Crown Prince.

133
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:37,440
As long as you marry into Pure Wutong Palace, you can give birth to his child, too.

134
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,450
Besides, His Highness the Crown Prince is a man.

135
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,540
You will be his side consort.

136
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:50,880
After some time, His Highness the Crown Prince will surely realize your feelings for him.

137
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,320
I'm not content. Not content at all!

138
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,320
I grew up with Ye Hua.

139
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,930
Since young, he's the only one I cared about!

140
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,790
Why?

141
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,880
Why did that woman cut in front of me?

142
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:41,630
Last night, you maids stopped people from Pure Wutong Palace when His Highness wasn't here.

143
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,460
You almost put Lady Su Su and His Young Highness in danger.

144
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:51,270
His Highness is kind, so he won't kill you, but you will surely receive punishment.

145
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,250
Today, accept your punishment of going down to the mortal world for a hundred-year tribulation.

146
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:00,560
Yes. Your Highness, thank you for not killing us.

147
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,380
I believe the color must be nice.

148
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,100
It's the plain colors you like.

149
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,480
But during the wedding, you can't pick the dress as you wish.

150
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,570
Wedding dress?

151
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,580
Didn't I tell you earlier that I have to marry you?

152
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,540
My Lady.

153
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,570
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

154
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,550
I'll be going first.

155
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,840
- My Lady, did His Highness gift you all of this?
- Yes.

156
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,740
It's real.

157
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:19,960
Everyone at Pure Wutong Palace is talking about how the two of you are getting married soon!

158
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:28,410
Are you not happy?

159
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:36,080
His Highness is only marrying me now out of pity.

160
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,820
My Lady, don't think nonsense.

161
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,330
I'm kidding.

162
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,540
Can you take care of these fabrics?

163
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,570
Nai Nai, take a walk with me to the Immortal Execution Platform.

164
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:57,530
My Lady, why do you keep going to Immortal Execution Platform?

165
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:02,310
That's an... ominous place.

166
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,290
I want to smell the flowers on the road there.

167
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,460
All right.

168
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,370
You don't have to help me. I can't always rely on you.

169
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:25,540
We walked this road yesterday, too. Right?

170
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,930
Yes, My Lady. This is the shortest route from Pure Wutong Palace to the Immortal Execution Platform.

171
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,910
The flower fragrance here is most comforting.

172
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,720
From now on, I want to walk on my own.

173
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,360
You can just follow me.

174
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,220
You work hard to take care of the young prince.

175
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,650
I can walk alone once in a while, too.

176
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,170
Understood, My Lady.

177
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:54,090
His Highness the Crown Prince has lifted the ban on the Courtyard of Moonlight now.

178
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,780
You also gave birth to a son for the Heavenly Crown Prince.

179
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,060
From now on, you can go wherever you want in the Heavenly Palace.

180
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,470
Really?

181
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,750
- Oh, Nai Nai.
- What would you like me to do?

182
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,670
Has Ye Hua given His Young Highness a name?

183
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,610
Not yet. I've asked about it,

184
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,890
but he said he's waiting for you to name him.

185
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,880
I want to call him Ah Li.

186
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,300
Does it sound nice?

187
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:32,920
It sounds nice, but which "Li" character are you going to use?

188
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,290
The "Li" that means separation.

189
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,600
This... doesn't sound very auspicious.

190
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,150
Didn't you say that starting now, I will be favored?

191
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,480
I want to name him Ah Li. Is that not allowed?

192
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,800
I said the wrong thing, forgive me.

193
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:03,190
Nai Nai, ever since I lost my eyes, my mood keeps going up and down.

194
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,130
I don't mean to make you uncomfortable. Don't take it seriously.

195
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,920
I understand your pain the most.

196
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,710
How can I ever blame you?

197
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,040
That's good. Follow me.

198
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,530
I want to go to the Immortal Execution Palace on my own.

199
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,470
Yes.

200
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,940
Zhe Yan?

201
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,670
Don't tell me... Don't tell me he's taking me home?

202
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,210
You've worked hard.

203
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,470
You're too gracious, High God.

204
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,870
Are you here to ask about Qing Cang being sealed?

205
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,220
Bai Qian from Green Hill sealed Qing Cang,

206
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,490
and you have a close relationship with Green Hill.

207
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,260
Why did you come so far to ask me instead?

208
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,110
Could I ask you to leave for a while?

209
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,520
Sorry.

210
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,020
I don't know which palace she is from.

211
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,290
She didn't even excuse herself when you have something to discuss.

212
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,230
Don't tell me...

213
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,300
That's Ye Hua's younger cousin.

214
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,410
She always comes here.

215
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,740
She's a junior, so I can't say much to her.

216
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,390
Please continue, High God.

217
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,250
It's nothing big actually.

218
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,680
This definitely needs to be kept a secret,

219
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,600
so I can't tell you too much right now.

220
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,110
I came here today just to test out my luck.

221
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,810
I want to see if I can find out anything I don't know about from you.

222
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,280
Since you're not willing to tell me the whole story,

223
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,780
I won't force you.

224
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,890
I just guessed that Bai Qian is actually High Immortal Si Yin from Kunlun Void.

225
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,900
As for everything else, I know just as much as you do.

226
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,410
I never would've thought you could guess that.

227
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,950
Fengjiu told me.

228
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,150
Fengjiu?

229
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,410
I had almost forgotten if you hadn't mentioned.

230
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,790
That child has been gone from Green Hill for a while now.

231
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,440
She said she's here to repay you.

232
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,550
That's right. She has been here for a while.

233
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,120
Then, has she repaid her debts?

234
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,520
I didn't need her to repay anything.

235
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,550
Are you saying she caused trouble for you?

236
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,930
It was a little troublesome.

237
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,860
In his eyes,

238
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,500
I'm just a bother.

239
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,970
Don't come here! I... I'm Bai Fengjiu from Green Hill!

240
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,530
Don't!

241
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,320
Thank you for your hospitality.

242
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,780
- I will take my leave.
- You're too kind.

243
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,660
My Lady, there's a step here.

244
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,620
Be careful.

245
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,900
Thank you.

246
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,910
Miss, you...

247
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,440
The bottom half of her face looks extremely like Young Fifth.

248
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,330
This faint peach blossom smell is familiar, too.

249
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,730
High God Zhe Yan.

250
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,640
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

251
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,210
Has Su Su caused trouble for you?

252
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,830
Su Su? She's called Su Su?

253
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,980
Yes. She's from Pure Wutong Palace.

254
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,570
So she's your woman.

255
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:04,350
Earlier, I mistook her for someone I knew.

256
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,860
She's a mortal and has never been to Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms.

257
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,620
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

258
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,070
Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms?

259
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,920
Do you know about it?

260
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,480
I won't be able to see Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms again.

261
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,770
I'll plant a plot for you.

262
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,430
Then I want ten miles, too.

263
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,440
I don't know.

264
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,590
The name just sounds special.

265
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,460
If you have a chance, you can take a walk there.

266
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,790
Take a walk there?

267
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,340
I hope I can.

268
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,410
Be careful.

269
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,150
Ye Hua,

270
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:19,010
I just wanted to take a walk by myself.

271
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,950
The fragrance of the flowers on that road smells good.

272
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,330
Su Su, you don't have to explain anything to me.

273
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:28,900
In the future, you will be the Crown Princess.

274
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,650
No one can question your actions from now on.

275
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,700
Ye Hua, don't worry.

276
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,200
I won't go anywhere anymore.

277
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,010
I won't cause any more trouble for you.

278
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,060
Are you thirsty?

279
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,250
I'll pour you a cup of tea.

280
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,130
Su Su,

281
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,090
we're getting married in 10 days.

282
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,090
Married?

283
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,210
Ye Hua,

284
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,270
I... can't see.

285
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,320
There's probably going to be a lot of etiquettes at the wedding.

286
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,970
I'll be laughed at.

287
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,720
No.

288
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,720
I'll be there.

289
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,070
That's good.

290
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,430
Your First Highness.

291
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,660
You may go.

292
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,110
Yes.

293
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,320
Your Highness.

294
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,650
- Father Monarch.
- You saw it.

295
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,870
Ye Hua wants to tell the Four Seas that he plans on marrying that mortal,

296
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,120
and he's defying the decree to have Su Jin enter Pure Wutong Palace.

297
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,760
I taught him poorly.

298
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,850
Please punish me.

299
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,880
After he received the crown prince seal, he first changed the divine maids in Pure Wutong Palace,

300
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,770
then he assigned his own guards to protect Pure Wutong Palace,

301
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,250
and now he accepted her as a side consort.

302
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,670
Everything he's done is watertight.

303
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:03,410
If even I can't do anything to him, what can you do?

304
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,630
Father Monarch, Ye Hua just received the crown prince seal,

305
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,910
so he is the leader chosen by Heaven.

306
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,730
Even I have to greet him with the highest honor.

307
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,750
I can't do anything to him from now on, either.

308
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,050
Let him do what he wants.

309
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,440
I don't believe he'll only care about this woman for the rest of his life.

310
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,450
But Green Hill...

311
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,130
Bai Qian of Green Hill is the number one beauty of all the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

312
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:46,760
She'll be able to change Ye Hua's mind once she marries in.

313
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,320
Let's hope that's the case.

314
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,790
You know I hate it when women cry.

315
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,910
If I ask you, you answer.

316
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,480
Don't say anything more.

317
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,710
I... I threw the fox into the Demon Tower.

318
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,570
Don't come here!

319
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:42,190
Why is Emperor's power so evil? It's blood red.

320
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:47,770
How dare a mere tower demon have such impudicity in front of me?

321
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,900
My tail!

322
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,540
Oh no.

323
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,470
Why is she bleeding so much? I don't think I can help.

324
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,620
You're wrong. That's the Emperor's blood on the young empress's body.

325
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,150
The Emperor is injured?!

326
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,310
Who in this world can harm the Emperor?

327
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,450
Emperor used quite a bit of his magic to save the young empress a while ago.

328
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,520
And now, he killed the tower demon inside the Demon Tower.

329
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,410
This injury is caused by the tower demon.

330
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,420
The tower demon?

331
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:09,330
That's the king of all demons left by Father God to frighten the Nine Heavens!

332
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,620
That's enough talk. Heal him first.

333
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,360
Yes.

334
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:37,270
♫ My dreamlike encounters with you have made me forget everything ♫

335
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:44,400
♫ At that moment, was your heart also racing? ♫

336
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:51,810
♫ The twilight of love has condensed in my heart ♫

337
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:58,990
♫ Through rounds of reincarnation, I persist in you ♫

338
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:06,340
♫ I see you waiting for me among the colorful lights ♫

339
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,070
♫ You’ve smiled  ♫

340
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,380
I'm not dead.

341
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:18,830
- Where am I?
- This is the Emperor's bedchambers.

342
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,130
Bedchambers?

343
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,000
It's my first time here.

344
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,240
♫ Even if short-lived, I will wait for you ♫

345
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:35,370
♫ Perhaps the moment I fell in love with you is destined to no result ♫

346
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,190
- Where is the Emperor?
- He's resting.

347
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:43,120
- Is he injured? Did I cause him trouble again?
- No.

348
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,840
He's really resting.

349
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,070
He said you cause too much trouble.

350
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,020
You should go back to Green Hill.

351
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,310
He said he never cared about you repaying him.

352
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,970
Your Young Highness, don't cry.

353
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:04,160
I don't know what to do if you cry.

354
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,750
Is the Emperor... kicking me out?

355
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,920
Your Young Highness has been here for a while.

356
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,220
Don't you know his temper by now?

357
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,400
He's a stone-faced immortal.

358
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,180
He has no affections or desires.

359
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,520
Don't waste your time.

360
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,700
Please say goodbye to him for me.

361
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:41,860
♫ The moment I fell for you, even if I am like a moth
chasing fire ♫

362
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,890
♫ I will still courageously endure the pain ♫

363
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:49,070
I've followed your orders and have told her to leave Nine Heavens.

364
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:56,370
♫ The moment I fell for you, even if I am like a moth
chasing fire ♫

365
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:03,650
♫ My yearnings will still coat the moonlight and merge into the warmth of my tears ♫

366
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:10,530
♫ Perhaps the moment I fell in love with you is destined to no result ♫

367
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:24,180
♫ Even so, I will persevere in my love for you without
complaints ♫

368
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,380
Your Young Highness!

369
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,450
Didn't you go to repay a debt?

370
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,720
Why have you become like this?

371
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:37,290
Where is my aunt? I want to talk to her about something.

372
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,410
Great Lady is not in Green Hill anymore.

373
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,180
Why did Aunt go out?

374
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,340
Did something happen?

375
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,750
Let's go back first. I'll tell you in detail later.

376
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,610
Let's go.

377
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,000
I remember now.

378
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,630
Did my aunt tell you anything?

379
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,280
No one has seen her after her battle with Qing Cang.

380
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,680
What?!

381
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,760
Why didn't anyone tell me when I was in Heaven?

382
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,330
Take it easy.

383
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:33,010
Fox Emperor and High God Zhe Yan said according to the stars, your aunt is fine.

384
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,450
We just don't know where she is.

385
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,960
You know her personality, too.

386
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,110
She's probably enjoying her freedom somewhere.

387
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,760
That's true, too.

388
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,780
Because Great Lady and Crown Prince Ye Hua are engaged,

389
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,350
and we're afraid to alarm the Heavenly Tribe if everyone finds out,

390
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:52,770
High God Zhe Yan said not to tell anyone.

391
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:00,160
Then, did no one punish Shao Xin for stealing Aunt's first marriage arrangement?

392
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,090
Who cares about that snake?

393
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,890
No, I must take revenge for Aunt.

394
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,650
The Emperor stopped me from scolding her in Heavenly Palace before.

395
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,690
No one can stop me today.

396
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,360
Your Young Highness, why do you change moods so quickly?

397
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,630
You just came back listlessly, how are you going to get revenge now?

398
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:25,080
I want to do something that'll distract me from thinking about the Emperor.

399
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,800
Let me go. Please?

400
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,570
What's... What's wrong, Your Young Highness?

401
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,780
You look like you're about to cry.

402
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,640
How can I cry?

403
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,170
I'm just going to punish a maid for my aunt.

404
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,320
Why would I cry?

405
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,780
Your Young Highness already made things difficult for Shao Xin at the Heavenly Palace before.

406
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,350
I had let you off because you were from Green Hill.

407
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,990
Why are you here to cause trouble again today?

408
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:07,130
- For someone like her who betrayed her savior, yelling at her once isn't enough.
- You!

409
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,810
You best not take it too far.

410
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,280
Mighty Monarch, don't be angry.

411
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,030
You forgave her once before in the Heavenly Palace.

412
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:22,340
Do you want her to insult you again today?

413
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,810
I deserve this.

414
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,510
Your Young Highness, you came at a good time.

415
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:39,030
I was just about to take this fan to Green Hill and ask Great Lady for forgiveness.

416
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,420
Ask for forgiveness?

417
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,840
You're not lying to me, are you?

418
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,120
I'm her maid yet I betrayed her.

419
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,040
Of course, I need to ask for forgiveness.

420
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,110
Since you're here today, I'll go with you.

421
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:58,470
Let's resolve this business.

422
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,230
You want to go back with me to the fox den?

423
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:05,290
That's right. I'll go now.

424
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,770
Wait, Aunt's not at Green Hill right now.

425
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:15,360
No one knows about this.

426
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,540
The snake can't find out.

427
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,760
I'm just here to yell at her to release my anger.

428
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,600
I can't end up causing trouble.

429
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,770
You don't need to ask for forgiveness.

430
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,020
My aunt said she doesn't want to see you.

431
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,880
- But—
- There's no but.

432
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,850
Aunt may not want to see you, but the Cloud-Breaking Fan is still hers.

433
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,070
You still need to give it back.

434
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,540
Please take care of it, Young Highness.

435
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,060
I don't dare take her things.

436
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,550
You betrayed my aunt and I shouldn't forgive you.

437
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,310
But after you left,

438
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,270
you haven't told any outsiders about the matters of Green Hill

439
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,320
and you even willingly returned the Cloud-Breaking Fan,

440
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,060
so you pass in my books.

441
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,650
The matters in Green Hill?

442
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,150
Is Your Young Highness talking about the person in Splendid Flame Cave?

443
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,730
That's right.

444
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,380
Please don't worry, Your Young Highness.

445
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,900
I will keep my mouth shut forever.

446
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,850
I hope you will remember what you said.

447
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:31,000
If I lie, may I be struck with lightning.

448
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,480
That makes me feel relieved.

449
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:40,090
I'll keep the Cloud-Breaking Fan, but I can't be the judge as to if Aunt will forgive you.

450
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,670
I understand.

451
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,990
Mi Gu? Mi Gu!

452
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,310
Young Highness.

453
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,310
Bai Fengjiu!

454
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,760
Dad.

455
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,800
Kneel!

456
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,140
Dad, I know I was wrong.

457
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,630
I shouldn't have gone to the Heavenly Palace to repay my debt.

458

♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

464
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:37,780
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

465
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:45,180
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

466
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,980
♫ All are just illusions ♫

467
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:56,760
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

468

♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

472
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:23,290
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

473
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:26,100
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

474
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:34,800
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

475
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:47,010
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden

♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:57,020
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

478
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:03,190
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

479
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:08,670
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

480
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:14,080
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

481
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,710
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

482
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:25,580
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

483
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:38,520
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
