”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,530
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,140
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,630
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,090
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,370
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,160
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,810
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,180
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,670
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,390
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,040
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,430
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,860
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,300
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,100
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,560
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,070
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,970
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,860
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,200
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,540
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,980
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,930
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,530
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,930
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,110
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,850
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,230
[Episode 47]

31
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,890
Heavenly Monarch has ordered to invite High God Zhe Yan to Nine Heavens to save someone.

32
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,270
There's a Medicine King in Heavenly Palace.

33
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,600
Why does Heavenly Monarch want you to go all the way there?

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,510
Must be serious. Looks like it can't be cured by medicine if even Medicine King is helpless.

35
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,460
Could it be Monarch Ye Hua again?

36
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,040
I didn't expect you to exhaust your entire cultivation to refine the pill.

37
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,410
No wonder, Heavenly Monarch wants me to come here to save you.

38
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,080
You are just lucky.

39
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,780
If I were late by a few hours, not even I could save you.

40
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,310
High God, did you give the medicinal pill to Qian Qian?

41
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,700
- I gave it to her.
- That's good then.

42
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,940
What's so good about it?

43
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,330
Look at your condition.

44
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,070
You are the dignified crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

45
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,310
Not only did you lose an arm, you even exhausted your lifetime's cultivation.

46
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,020
You...

47
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,830
If you want to succeed as the Heavenly Monarch, you need to receive all those fires and bolts of lightning.

48
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,910
I wonder when that can happen.

49
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,310
This is not important.

50
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,990
Yes, it's not important.

51
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,330
What's important is that little fox in your heart.

52
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,010
She just needs to happily save her teacher without knowing the situation.

53
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,930
Right?

54
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,030
Why don't I see your son?

55
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,010
His father is dying soon and he's not here to cry?

56
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:13,510
I raised Ah Li, but I'm most afraid to see him cry.

57
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:19,150
So as soon as I was back, I told someone to take him to the Buddhist assembly at Ling Mountain to avoid me.

58
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,770
Indeed.

59
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,490
Acting as both his father and mother.

60
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,350
Honestly, it's not easy.

61
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,370
It's not easy.

62
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,220
Immortal.

63
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,180
You are awake.

64
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,770
You are almost fully recovered now.

65
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,180
I slept for several days and you were here keeping watch over me?

66
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,820
Do you still feel unwell anywhere else?

67
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,980
I wonder whether you remember the content of the notice that my father posted in Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

68
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,270
I do. Whoever can cure Your Highness can marry into the Western Sea's family.

69
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,540
When my father posted that, I didn't agree with it.

70
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,330
Although you are very beautiful,

71
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,790
your appearance is not my type.

72
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,490
Do you still feel unwell anywhere else?

73
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,690
I'm very grateful that you've been taking care of me day and night.

74
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,050
If the palace attendants didn't tell me, I wouldn't have known about your feelings.

75
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,890
I only read about this kind of situation in the plays which Second Younger Brother brought for me to read.

76
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,170
I didn't imagine we would be just like in the story.

77
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,110
I heard from my attendants that His Highness the Crown Prince came to see you.

78
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,230
Since he's interested in you, why would you leave your heart with me?

79
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,960
That's right, too.

80
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,690
Why would I pay so much attention to you?

81
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,570
How... How dare you!

82
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,100
What's making you so happy?

83
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,420
Eldest Senior Brother, don't laugh at me.

84
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,750
Do you know since I have been taking care of your older brother day and night,

85
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,970
what he just said to me?

86
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,130
What did he say?

87
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:09,440
He was very grateful to me and rejected my infatuation with him.

88
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,140
My older brother has never been exposed to love, and when you look at him, you are looking at Teacher.

89
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,470
Unavoidably, he would think too much into it. If it's inconvenient for you, let me take care of him.

90
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,270
In any case, he's already awake. It won't be a major problem.

91
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,620
This is good. I will have to trouble you then.

92
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,620
I went to check his pulse just now. It's very stable.

93
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,250
Use the Soul-Pursuing Spell to check on him later.

94
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,730
See if Zhe Yan's energy has plateaued,

95
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,830
then take care of Teacher's spirit.

96
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,410
Okay.

97
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,650
I'm leaving first.

98
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,760
What's wrong? Is there a problem with Teacher's spirit?

99
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,870
Come with me.

100
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,080
- Your Second Highness.
- Keep guard here. Don't let anyone disturb us.

101
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,970
Yes.

102
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:10,050
Go now. I already used a spell on him, so he's sleeping soundly now.

103
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,620
Gently use the Soul-Pursuing Spell and you'll know.

104
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:05,240
Last time I came, only Die Yong's weak divine aura nurturing Teacher.

105
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,900
This time, the divine aura nurturing Teacher is quite huge and turbulent.

106
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,360
I can't enter his body.

107
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,520
This kind of power can only be attained by thousands of years of cultivation.

108
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,010
Seems like Teacher's awakening is just around the corner.

109
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,700
But the divine aura around Teacher isn't Zhe Yan's.

110
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,950
This divine aura is turbulent yet calm, introverted yet majestic.

111
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:34,350
This is... Ye Hua.

112
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,370
I have known His Highness the Crown Prince for many years.

113
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,950
I know very well that this is his divine aura.

114
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:09,120
No wonder Zhe Yan was hesitant to speak when he came.

115
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,860
No wonder he wasn't injured.

116
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,320
He never went to Yingzhou.

117
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,380
Why did he lie to me?

118
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,610
Seventeenth, don't panic yet.

119
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,620
His Highness the Crown Prince's power is extraordinary.

120
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,400
He must've been worried you wouldn't take the medicine, so he sent Zhe Yan to give it to you.

121
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,610
What's wrong with you?

122
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,050
Your Highness' health is fine now.

123
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,050
You don't need my help anymore.

124
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,180
Please tell Water Monarch that I have something urgent,

125
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,570
so I'll be going back to the Peach Forest.

126
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,530
Immortal.

127
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,710
Why have you arrived at Heavenly Palace in such a hurry?

128
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,120
I'm here to see His Highness the Crown Prince, Monarch Ye Hua.

129
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,560
Please wait here. I will report this to Pure Wutong Palace first.

130
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,270
Don't say anything when you see High Goddess Bai Qian later.

131
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:07,040
If she questions, just say I've been busy.

132
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,700
Yes.

133
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,400
I recall you.

134
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,970
Are you the one who helps the Crown Prince in his study?

135
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,560
How is His Mighty Monarch lately?

136
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,050
What is he doing now?

137
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,670
He is fine.

138
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,540
He's just done discussing things with the Star Monarchs Tan Lang, Ju Men, and Lian Zhen.

139
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,460
He's currently waiting for you in his study.

140
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,920
He just lost several thousand years of cultivation

141
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,430
and, today, he secured himself in the study to discuss official matters.

142
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,940
He recovered a little too fast.

143
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,620
But it seems like he's fine.

144
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,490
You are here.

145
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,150
Sit.

146
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,740
What is this?

147
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,560
A few hours ago,

148
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,900
when I used the Soul-Pursuing Spell to enter the spirit of the Eldest Prince of the Western Sea,

149
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,250
I got distracted and coughed out some blood.

150
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,970
I know you have been diligently taking care of Mo Yuan,

151
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,730
but you should take more care of yourself.

152
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:06,360
If Mo Yuan wakes up and you faint, wouldn't you be putting the cart before the horse?

153
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:14,160
Can you guess what I saw in the prince's spirit?

154
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,970
Mo Yuan?

155
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,250
Can you tell me,

156
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:34,720
what the four ferocious beasts who guard the Mystical Mushrooms look like?

157
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:42,670
You refined the pill that Zhe Yan gave me, right?

158
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,220
How much cultivation do you have left?

159
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,960
All right, this did happen.

160
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,250
A while ago, Heavenly Monarch sent me to the Eastern Sea.

161
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,980
When I passed by Yingzhou, I suddenly remembered that you need the Mystical Mushroom,

162
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,690
so I took some for you on the way.

163
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,170
As for those four beasts,

164
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,210
their appearances are not that pleasant.

165
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,310
If they had better appearances,

166
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,980
perhaps, I could have caught one for you to raise.

167
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,720
When you are bored, you can play with it.

168
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,340
It so happens that you have a lot of idle time.

169
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,820
You are making this sound so easy.

170
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,860
I remember when my father came back from Yingzhou,

171
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,560
his injury was very serious.

172
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,420
How many years of cultivation did it take for you to refine that pill?

173
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,040
Why did you hide this from me when you entrusted Zhe Yan to deliver it to me?

174
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,660
Did that really happen?

175
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,310
Zhe Yan didn't tell you that I personally refined that medicinal pill?

176
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,320
Looks like I shouldn't have let him give it to you.

177
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,880
He took credit for my work.

178
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,620
Don't worry.

179
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,620
I'm naturally more advanced in cultivation than the average immortals.

180
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,650
Heavenly Monarch has also transferred quite a bit to me before, too.

181
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,900
Refining that medicinal pill is nothing.

182
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,780
Just a piece of cake.

183
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,860
You've been using your left hand to pour and drink tea all day today.

184
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:58,430
Isn't it about time you move your right hand?

185
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,090
I blame myself for being careless.

186
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,760
When I went to get the Mystical Mushroom, I was bitten by the Taowu beast.

187
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,400
But it's not that serious.

188
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,910
Medicine King already treated me. I will recover after a month of rest.

189
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,140
Ye Hua, I have been living for a long time.

190
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,390
Of course, I know that you are lying,

191
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:27,220
but I also know that you are just lying to comfort me.

192
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,260
Since this is the case, I'm not worried.

193
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:46,630
Qian Qian, what about me keeps you worrying?

194
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,650
You, on the other hand.

195
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,470
That first prince of the Western Sea took the medicinal pill recently.

196
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:57,620
There might be some adverse reactions, but you are in Heaven right now.

197
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,700
Be careful. Something may go wrong.

198
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,410
Seeing how he's putting up such a front, he probably won't be able to last any longer.

199
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,220
You are right.

200
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,800
I'm leaving first.

201
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,660
Recuperate well.

202
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,820
Fourth Older Brother, did you see Zhe Yan?

203
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,930
Zhe Yan is working in Peach Blossoms forest.

204
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,340
He said that he did something wrong recently.

205
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:20,010
Since it has been many years since he did anything wrong, he feels especially guilty.

206
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,820
He wanted to go to Peach Blossoms forest to work and clear his mind.

207
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,120
What exactly is going on?

208
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,820
Can you tell me?

209
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,420
I'm very anxious now.

210
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,680
Can't you tell me anything?

211
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,550
Just tell me a bit. Okay?

212
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,510
If you don't speak, I'm leaving.

213
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,480
I'm really leaving.

214
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,280
I'm leaving now.

215
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,120
Mighty Monarch.

216
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,950
Mighty Monarch, why did you leave the bed?

217
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,350
High God Zhe Yan said you must rest well to recuperate.

218
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,740
It's best not to leave the bed and walk around.

219
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,500
Although your husband is young,

220
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,430
he's steady in planning.

221
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:47,650
After he told you to guard the Soul-Gathering Lamp for three days and nights, he passed a memorial to Heavenly Monarch

222
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,950
and told him about the Mystical Mushrooms in Yingzhou in the Eastern Sea, and etc, etc, about violating immortal's rules.

223
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,270
He even cited many examples

224
00:20:55,270 --> 00:21:00,540
and asked Heavenly Monarch to allow him to go to Yingzhou in the Eastern Sea to destroy the Mystical Mushrooms.

225
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,200
After Heavenly Monarch read it, he deeply considered it and allowed him to go.

226
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,650
Later, when he returned with injuries,

227
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,560
Heavenly Monarch thought that his grandson

228
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,950
was in that condition because he was injured by the four ferocious beasts who guarded the Mystical Mushrooms.

229
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,700
Heavenly Monarch regretted that he overestimated his grandson

230
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,180
and that he didn't send more men to go along with him.

231
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:30,910
Because of this memorial, Heavenly Monarch would never even imagine that Ye Hua fell into this condition because of you.

232
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,460
Tell me. Isn't his plan water-tight?

233
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,310
No wonder, before he left the Western Sea,

234
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:42,260
he kept telling me to keep watch over Eldest Prince for three days without leaving.

235
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,120
I was even wondering why he, a man of few words, suddenly became so naggy.

236
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,860
Turns out, he wanted me to remain safely in the Western Sea

237
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,880
and he went to Yingzhou alone.

238
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,240
Don't worry. I already gave him medication for him to recover.

239
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,120
It's just that his arm is crippled.

240
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,840
It's not completely crippled. I made a false arm for him.

241
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,180
He can't use it now but after maintaining it for thousands of years, it will gradually cultivate some spirit.

242
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,570
Perhaps, he will be able to use it.

243
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Why is he so foolish?

244
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,750
He feels that since you are his future wife

245
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,000
and you owe Mo Yuan, he's helping you to return his favor.

246
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,040
He also wanted me to hide this from you because he knows your personality too well.

247
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,570
He's afraid that once you find out that he used a big portion of his cultivation to refine that pill,

248
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,670
you'd refuse to use it.

249
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,980
Although we haven't known each other for long,

250
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,470
unexpectedly, he knows me well.

251
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,400
He knows you very well.

252
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,360
There are certain things you should understand before it can be fully resolved.

253
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,810
What do I not understand?

254
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,610
He's the one hiding it from me.

255
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:56,330
That's right. To everyone's surprise, although you rarely pay attention to details, you realized it this time.

256
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,850
But Ye Hua is always shouldering burdens on his own.

257
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,750
I admire his sonorous personality very much.

258
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:09,230
At 70,000 years old, he could even kill Taowu, Qiongji, those four ferocious beasts.

259
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,750
His prospect is unlimited.

260
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,230
However, his fine cultivation disappeared in the blink of an eye.

261
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,450
It's really a pity.

262
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,440
I know Taowu has a courageous beast.

263
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,380
Once he bites,

264
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,690
he will swallow the skin and bones whole.

265
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,390
He still called it a minor injury.

266
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,950
Since it has come to this, just let him recuperate.

267
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,760
It's needless to worry about him.

268
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,610
Just rest here tonight.

269
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,920
I should keep watch over him.

270
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,000
What can you do if you go now?

271
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,620
The most you can do is watch over him.

272
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,620
Even if I can only do this small task,

273
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,920
I want to be with him immediately and watch over him.

274
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,320
Your stubborn personality. Wouldn't this be a waste of the effort he used to hide this form you?

275
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,270
Don't worry.

276
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:17,020
Since he's purposefully hiding this from me, I will pretend that I don't know anything.

277
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,420
Since this is the case, go and watch over him then.

278
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,860
I have some pills here for rejuvenating energy.

279
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,210
Take some along with you.

280
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,770
Why are you staring foolishly at me?

281
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:04,800
I feel that you look good this way.

282
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,740
Aren't you supposed to be in the Western Sea taking care of the first prince?

283
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,100
Why did you come here in the middle of the night?

284
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,790
Did something happen to the first prince?

285
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,610
Die Yong is fine.

286
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:26,900
I have completed my task for him.

287
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,620
Thinking that your arm is injured,

288
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,920
it may not be convenient for you to hold tea or carry water,

289
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,850
so I wanted to come here and take care of you.

290
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,470
Qian Qian.

291
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,850
Come here.

292
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,920
It's not a good idea.

293
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,720
I...

294
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,750
It's better for me to stay at Mochi's place.

295
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,450
I hope you have an early rest.

296
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:07,250
I will return tomorrow.

297
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,460
I only have one arm now.

298
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,960
If you don't want to, you can always push me away.

299
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:32,450
Can I... occupy half of your bed tonight?

300
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,140
With your build, you won't even occupy half of the bed.

301
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,640
Tonight, do you want to hide in the corner of the bed without any covers,

302
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,220
or do you want to sleep in my embrace under the covers?

303
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:29,050
We can both... sleep under the covers in a corner of the bed.

304
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,700
This idea is not bad.

305
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,200
You already know everything, right?

306
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,220
You're still the same.

307
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,480
Don't like to owe anyone any favors.

308
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:04,830
I don't like owing favors to others.

309
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,770
Are you sleeping?

310
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,890
Yes, I'm sleeping.

311
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,660
Grand Purple Palace is not an auspicious place.

312
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,020
A few days ago, a royal died.

313
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,730
Now, even the Winged Monarchess is dead.

314
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,590
Why did the water turn red?

315
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:38,080
Former Winged Monarch! This is his Overlay of Red Clouds!

316
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,450
The Red Lotus Fire!

317
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,610
Yan Zhi!

318
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,420
What's wrong with you?

319
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:14,860
Why? Even when I inserted my cultivation, it didn't work.

320
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,390
Don't be foolish.

321
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,500
Refining pills in Winged Realm is going against the will of Heaven.

322
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,880
Fortunately, your cultivation is still low and won't cause any big mistakes.

323
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,280
This medicinal pill can't be done.

324
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,460
Second Older Brother, can we refine the medicinal pill only if we go to Heavenly Realm?

325
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:48,210
In Heaven and Earth, only the previous Mo Yuan's Pellet-Cultivating Furnace can accept demonic energy.

326
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,020
Do you think the people at Kunlun Void will let you use it?

327
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,100
Even if the Winged Realm are on good terms with the Heavenly Realm,

328
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,870
the old grudge with our father and Mo Yuan still exists.

329
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,530
Stop dreaming.

330
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:03,520
No. Since I can go to Kunlun Void to refine it, I'm going to Kunlun Void.

331
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,620
- Nonsense!
- No, Second Older Brother!

332
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,640
I must go to Kunlun Void.

333
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,600
Men.

334
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,600
- Mighty Monarch.
- Her Highness Princess needs proper rest.

335
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,260
Unless I decree it, no one is allowed in or out.

336
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,260
She's not allowed to go out.

337
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,210
Yes.

338
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,980
Mighty Monarch, the Ruoshui River suddenly turned red.

339
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,260
There was also an overlay of thick red clouds in the sky, and we saw the Red Lotus Fire.

340
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,060
These are the signs that the former Winged Monarch will be back soon.

341
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,280
Did you hear? The former Winged Monarch is returning.

342
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,320
Winged Realm is going to stage a comeback.

343
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,190
I already heard about this.

344
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,070
But I wonder if this rumor is true.

345
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:11,420
If it's really true, wouldn't Winged Realm rise again?

346
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,690
Lie low. You are not afraid to be beheaded?

347
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,390
Okay, let's go.

348
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,330
Bai Qian sneaked into Purple Morning Hall?

349
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:30,220
Your Highness, it is true.

350
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,370
She wasn't there when His Mighty Monarch went to bed.

351
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,540
But when I went to relight the lamp in the middle of the night,

352
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,210
I heard her voice in there.

353
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,260
She was talking to him.

354
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,940
I didn't dare stay too long so I came here.

355
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,210
You need to keep track of her activities and report them to me.

356
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,310
Yes, Your Highness.

357
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:03,500
Xin Nu. Tell me, don't you think this High Goddess disregards the rules of Heavenly Tribe?

358
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,430
Xin Nu. Tell me, don't you think this High Goddess disregards the rules of Heavenly Tribe?the rules of Heavenly Tribe?

359
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,590
She only stayed in Pure Wutong Palace the last time she came.

360
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:14,450
She never went to greet Heavenly Monarch, His Eldest Highness, nor Consort Le Xu.

361
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,760
She left on her own accord later.

362
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,470
Now, she's back again.

363
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,990
Your Highness, I think she looks down on you.

364
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:35,490
Yes, she does look down on me.

365
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:41,410
A while ago when she lectured me, she already said that she's the High Goddess Bai Qian of Green Hill,

366
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:46,290
that even if His Mighty Monarch sees her and greets her with the proprieties of a junior,

367
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,490
she's qualified to accept it.

368
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,910
She even looks down on His Mighty Monarch,

369
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,150
not to mention a mere side consort like me.

370
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,300
What should we do then?

371
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,460
She's not even married to His Mighty Monarch yet,

372
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,200
but she's looking down on you like this.

373
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,510
I fear that when she's married to him in the future,

374
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:10,610
Your Highness will have to suffer.

375
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:18,670
Ever since she showed up, we have been fighting with each other, both in public and private,

376
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,730
but I lost to all of them.

377
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:25,690
Even when you went to Green Hill to criticize her actions, when Yuan Zhen got drunk,

378
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:29,800
or when Miao Qing seduced His Mighty Monarch, it didn't affect her at all.

379
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Even when I took the opportunity to instigate her and His Mighty Monarch, I didn't succeed.

380
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,210
She's really not easy to deal with.

381
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:50,600
But I found her weakness.

382
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,990
Your Highness, what did you find out?

383
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,000
Her weakness is the same as mine.

384
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,640
It's that she's also in love with His Mighty Monarch.

385
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,030
Hence, my weakness is definitely her weakness, too.

386
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:13,900
I will find the opportunity to have a good chat with her about Su Su.

387
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,560
You are awake.

388
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,710
How was your sleep?

389
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,970
With you next to me, naturally, I slept well.

390
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,600
How about you?

391
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,260
I miss Mochi.

392
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,780
There is a religious assembly on Ling Mountain.

393
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,260
Lord of Lingbao will be taking the podium to make a speech.

394
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,980
Cheng Yu brought Ah Li to join in the fun.

395
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,580
I told Jia Yun to pick them up.

396
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,770
They will be back tomorrow.

397
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,930
Mochi is still very young.

398
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,400
Aren't you afraid you will bore him?

399
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,010
Ah Li went to Ling Mountain just to eat sugar canes.

400
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,270
Even more so, Cheng Yu is with him.

401
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:11,100
Do you think he will be bored?

402
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,150
I admire your role as a father.

403
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,870
Why do you say this?

404
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:25,400
I bet you sent him away because you didn't want him to see how injured you are.

405
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:13,650
All these sugar canes should be enough for Mother to eat.

406
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,770
Yes, that's right.

407
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,590
It's really so tiring for me.

408
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,360
It's the emperor and Lord of Lingbao.

409
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,590
Hurry. Hurry. Ah Li.

410
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,640
Hurry. Come here now.

411
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,670
Quick.

412
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:40,210
All the ancient immortals have complied with their tribulations

413
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,910
and returned to the formless mass.

414
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,930
There are now only a few left.

415
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,790
I say, Emperor, you have also complied with your tribulation. Right?

416
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,880
It can be considered so.

417
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,530
A heartbreaking tribulation.

418
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,400
Cheng Yu, what's wrong with you?

419
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,850
Since you heard Emperor's conversation, you've been down.

420
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,910
Do you know what it means to comply with tribulation?

421
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,480
It's going through tribulation. Don't all immortals do that?

422
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,350
Father said that all naturally born immortals obtained their immortality status so easily,

423
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,990
so they frequently undergo tribulations.

424
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,390
It's only fair if we're struck by a few bolts of lightning.

425
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,950
If they do well, they will transcend to another rank.

426
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:49,470
If they don't, they will go back to ashes.

427
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,950
No.

428
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,680
Complying to tribulation is scarier than the usual tribulations.

429
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,530
Judging by Lord of Lingbao's tone of voice just now,

430
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,570
I fear the emperor will be in danger.

431
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,390
Danger?

432
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,710
All ancient immortals have to comply with tribulations.

433
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,470
Very few can pass them.

434
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:13,810
In other words, having to comply with tribulations means your body will return to the formless mass.

435
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,520
Formless mass? Like dying?

436
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,140
Is Emperor going to die?

437
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,610
Didn't Emperor say he has complied with his tribulation?

438
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:28,450
I thought such an immortal like the emperor would live for a long time.

439
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,740
Even Father God complied with his tribulation,

440
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,420
never mind anyone else.

441
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,520
I need to quickly tell Her Highness Fengjiu.

442
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,350
Mother is a high goddess, too.

443
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:40,430
She will need to go through it one day.

444
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,330
What should we do?

445
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,660
For every day you live, it's one day less from your life.

446
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,530
It's the same for everyone.

447
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:55,110
You just need to cherish the remaining time and honor your mother.

448
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,950
Yes! Let's go back to Heavenly Palace soon.

449
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,320
I'll ask my father to take me to see Mother.

450
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,030
Let's go.

451
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:37,520
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

452
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,540
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

453
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,120
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

454
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:47,580
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

455
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:56,900
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

456
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,890
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

457
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:06,110
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

458
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:12,520
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

459
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,540
♫ All are just illusions ♫

460
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:25,160
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

461
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,320
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

462
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,850
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

463
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:41,090
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

464
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:46,480
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

465
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,610
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

466
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:54,480
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

467
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:04,230
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

468
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,560
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:21,130
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

470
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:25,480
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

471
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:31,650
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

472
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:36,990
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

473
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:42,320
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

474
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,090
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

475
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:54,640
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

476
00:44:55,790 --> 00:45:06,280
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
