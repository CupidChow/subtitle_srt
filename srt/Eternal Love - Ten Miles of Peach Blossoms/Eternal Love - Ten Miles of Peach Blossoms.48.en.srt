”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,560
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,070
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,630
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,030
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,400
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,240
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,810
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,020
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,910
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,220
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,010
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,430
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,960
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,500
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,170
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,480
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,020
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,010
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,770
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,000
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,570
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,920
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,910
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,390
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,920
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,100
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,940
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

29

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,350
[Episode 48]

31
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,570
If I remember correctly,

32
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:41,320
you are among the female generals who fought against us at the riverbank of Ruoshui 70,000 years ago, right?

33
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,130
That's right.

34
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,620
I'm from the Winged Tribe.

35
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,000
Kunlun Void and the Winged Realm have zero contacts with each other.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,810
Miss, please go back.

37
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,770
Please let me see your Daoist Priest Zi Lan.

38
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,120
Zi Lan?

39
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,370
Why would Zi Lan see you? Please leave.

40
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,440
Please let me meet him.

41
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,380
I'm not here to cause trouble.

42
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,580
I just... want to see him for a favor.

43
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,300
Miss, although the Heavenly Tribe and Winged Tribe are currently getting along,

44
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,650
the disciples of Kunlun Void won't forget the pain of losing our teacher.

45
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,890
I won't let you in.

46
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,650
If you dare come any closer, you are trespassing Heavenly Tribe's sacred territory.

47
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,100
- Daoist Priest, I'm begging you...
- High Immortal, please show sympathy.

48
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,610
My younger sister doesn't mean to barge in.

49
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,560
She's here to request a meeting with High Immortal Zi Lan for me.

50
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,700
Why would the Winged Monarch sneak into Heavenly Tribe's sacred territory?

51
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,110
My younger sister and I are only here to borrow your Pellet-Cultivating Furnace.

52
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,660
Is there a need to refuse us?

53
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,630
Kunlun Void is different from the Heavenly Tribe.

54
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,240
High God Mo Yuan is the ruler of Kunlun Void.

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,930
Our conflict with you can't be resolved.

56
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,010
It never will.

57
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,290
Second Older Brother, you can't!

58
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,690
Don't you see he wants us dead?

59
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,640
You can't do this. This is our only chance.

60
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,290
We can't cause trouble. I still have to see Zi Lan.

61
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,900
That's enough.

62
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,390
You're more important to me than this child.

63
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,430
Yan Zhi, what's wrong?

64
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,370
Why are you suddenly here?

65
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,390
Did something happen?

66
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,570
Little Constable.

67
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,390
Could you let us use your Pellet-Cultivating Furnace?

68
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,640
Pellet-Cultivating Furnace?

69
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,000
My apologies, Yan Zhi.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,460
I'm no longer the constable from the Mortal Realm.

71
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,190
Currently, I'm the disciple of Kunlun Void.

72
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:14,910
Tell me why you need it in front of my senior brother, my junior cousins and me.

73
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,190
To save this child.

74
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,390
I want to save him.

75
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,280
Teacher, I have been unfilial.

76
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,560
Today, I'm going to open the Pellet-Cultivating Furnace for the Winged Tribe to refine the medicinal pill.

77
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,760
I feel ashamed in front of Teacher and my disciple brothers.

78
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,740
I swear that

79
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:20,440
when Teacher returns, I will guard the Sea of Innocence every day for the rest of my life.

80
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,110
I will never step into the Winged Realm again.

81
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,040
Nor will I have anything to do with the witch again.

82
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,710
I apologize for this sin.

83
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,120
Ye Hua, I don't understand your battle formation map.

84
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,430
When I was at Kunlun Void learning from Teacher,

85
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,180
I was always ranked tenth in class for tactical formation.

86
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,320
Whenever I look at battle formations, my head and body hurt.

87
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,890
Why did you come and sit here, then?

88
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,850
Previously, I was worried that you wouldn't be able to hold your brush properly.

89
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,220
But looking at it, you have good posture in holding your brush,

90
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,610
so I wanted to look at it longer.

91
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,670
Mother! Mother!

92
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,720
My Mochi is back.

93
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,860
And he's carrying so many things.

94
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,070
Let him come over on his own.

95
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,200
- Mother! Mother!
- You're back.

96
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,820
Cheng Yu! Cheng Yu, this is my mother.

97
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,510
Isn't she pretty?

98
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,720
So, this is the so-called powerful Primary Monarchess Cheng Yu?

99
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,570
Your Highness.

100
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,780
Can I... touch her?

101
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,230
Mother is my father's!

102
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,150
Only he can touch her.

103
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,600
Why are you trying to touch her?

104
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,290
This is the first time I've seen a high goddess.

105
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,600
Can't I touch her a bit?

106
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,950
You're trying to take advantage of my wife in front of me.

107
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,670
Cheng Yu, you're getting bolder.

108
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,140
You're so petty.

109
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,910
Ah Li, what're you holding?

110
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,310
These are sugar canes which I brought back for you from Ling Mountain.

111
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,160
You're the best.

112
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,540
Come.

113
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:41,520
When Jia Yun came to pick me up, he kept reminding me that your right arm is injured.

114
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,970
He told me not to act shameless and ask you to carry me.

115
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,650
Does your arm hurt, Father Monarch?

116
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,300
It doesn't.

117
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,100
I can grab you with one arm.

118
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,840
Are you all right? Be careful.

119
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,460
Don't worry. Since a few days ago, I've been starting to feel my right arm.

120
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,670
I know your arm will be fine soon.

121
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,400
It's a pity that you are good at ancient Chinese paintings.

122
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,240
If you can't paint because of this and one day, if I want a painting of Mochi and me, we will have to trouble others.

123
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,430
It won't be convenient.

124
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,760
Why don't I paint you now?

125
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,840
Now?

126
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,600
With your outstanding and elegant demeanor, ordinary painters are afraid to draw you.

127
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,750
I fear His Highness is the only one who can paint you.

128
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,560
You're good with words.

129
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,420
Let's go, Mochi.

130
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,780
Cheng Yu, come and sit here.

131
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,840
Sure.

132
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:15,640
I heard that you're Her Young Highness Fengjiu's aunt.

133
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,480
That's right.

134
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,650
Then, can I dare ask you to relay her a message?

135
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,160
Tell her that I ran into a problem at Nine Heavens,

136
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,970
so I need her to come here.

137
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,620
I will send someone to deliver your message,

138
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,440
but she's not in a good mood, so I don't know if she'll come.

139
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,270
You don't have to worry about that.

140
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,500
My relationship with Her Young Highness is deep.

141
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,920
Are you two that close?

142
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,870
No, fate.

143
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,780
Fate.

144
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,360
All right.

145
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,110
You all can rest.

146
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,760
Your Highness, I sat for so long, my neck is slanted.

147
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,310
But why didn't you draw me at all?

148
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,410
Cheng Yu, why aren't you in the painting?

149
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,850
Ye Hua's physical strength hasn't been good lately. It's very tiring for him to draw with one arm.

150
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,950
Please forgive him.

151
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,560
Physical strength is not good?

152
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,200
What does this mean?

153
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,310
Does it mean that even though you can carry me,

154
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,170
you don't have the strength to carry Mother?

155
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:11,050
- Ye Hua!
- Cheng Yu, take Ah Li to the hall to rest.

156
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,730
- Ye Hua!
- Yes...

157
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,210
Ye Hua.

158
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,800
Put me down.

159
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,360
Ye Hua, don't take it to heart that I said earlier that I don't want to go to the Courtyard of Moonlight.

160
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,720
- What?
- Well... After all, she's Mochi's biological mother.

161
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,440
I don't know why she abandoned you two and jumped off the Immortal Execution Platform,

162
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,380
but the dead should be respected.

163
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:03,000
It's not good if we do this where she once lived.

164
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,760
I know.

165
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,650
There's one more thing.

166
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,020
Tell me.

167
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,650
I told Nai Nai to lock her things away.

168
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:23,590
And also, I told myself not to open it to save myself from sadness.

169
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:27,550
I've burned all of her things.

170
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,540
One more thing!

171
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,950
Qian Qian, why do you have so many things to tell me today?

172
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,660
Just now, I was only talking about the past.

173
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,860
But what I have to say next is the most important issue.

174
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:06,040
Do you still remember what I told you at the Western Sea that I wanted you to cancel the engagement?

175
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,570
I remember.

176
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,230
I didn't realize how I felt back then.

177
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,400
Don't take what I said to heart.

178
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,750
Of course, we can't cancel our engagement now that we have mutual affections.

179
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,260
When I was bored at the Western Sea, I analyzed the dates.

180
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,920
The second day of September is a good day for the wedding and for moving.

181
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,880
In any case, it's a suitable and auspicious day.

182
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:54,850
Why don't you ask Heavenly Monarch to host the wedding that day?

183
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,750
What did you just say?

184
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:07,350
I know that I don't appear very mature talking about this.

185
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,830
It's not good for you to propose the marriage.

186
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,080
How about I ask my parents to go ask?

187
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,990
After all, this is marriage.

188
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,590
It might be better if the older generation talks it over.

189
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,870
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

190
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,700
Qian Qian.

191
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,750
Say it again.

192
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,370
You want to do what?

193
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:41,360
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

194
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,920
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

195
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,300
Ye Hua...

196
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,250
I love you.

197
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,130
I really love you.

198
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,270
I want to be with you forever.

199
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,950
Women from Green Hill have always been direct.

200
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,960
We say what's on our mind.

201
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,920
But he grew up in this uptight Nine Heavens.

202
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,820
Does he think that what I said is too frivolous?

203
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:32,010
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

204
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,320
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms bloom again? ♫

205
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,310
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

206
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,590
Qian Qian, bear another child for me.

207
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:04,340
70,000 years ago, I used to frequent here and look into the distance at Kunlun Void.

208
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,730
Thinking about the person here.

209
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:15,530
Sometimes I thought how nice would it be if I weren't the second prince of the Winged Tribe.

210
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,140
Do you mean High Immortal Si Yin?

211
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,700
Yes.

212
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,200
I thought she was part of the Heavenly Tribe at that time.

213
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,630
I thought what was between us wasn't only the gap between the Heavenly Tribe and Winged Tribe.

214
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,070
There was also the rule against intermarriage between us.

215
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,200
You thought he was part of the Heavenly Tribe?!

216
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,180
What do you mean?

217
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,670
Si Yin is a male from the Heavenly Tribe.

218
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,990
Do you still not know?

219
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,260
Si Yin is Bai Qian from Green Hill. High Goddess Bai Qian.

220
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,850
High Goddess Bai Qian?!

221
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,560
So you didn't fall in love with the wrong person.

222
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,090
I was the one who was wrong and fell in love with Si Yin.

223
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:17,730
I was too young and admired him for his identity as an immortal.

224
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:22,780
I felt that immortal men should be like him, candid and unaffected.

225
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:31,010
They can love or hate completely without any complexities, and no hidden agendas.

226
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,190
But now...

227
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,820
All right. Even if I know now that she's a female,

228
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,130
I think she's also a high goddess who loves and hates completely.

229
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,330
You're right.

230
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,380
Ah Yin is like that.

231
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,300
If she wants to break off your relationship,

232
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,830
she will break it off cleanly.

233
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,580
Not leaving a single trace.

234
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,680
Why aren't you sleeping?

235
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,720
You are going to tire me out.

236
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,210
Qian Qian.

237
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,360
If Li Jing is right, once High God Mo Yuan's spirit returns,

238
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,120
the seal on the Donghuang Bell will weaken,

239
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,710
and Qing Cang will break out.

240
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,260
What will you do then?

241
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,190
What's wrong?

242
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,530
70,000 years ago,

243
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,650
if you had the chance to seal the Donghuang Bell first,

244
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,070
would you really have done it in High God Mo Yuan's place?

245
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,150
Teacher's kindness to me is as vast as a mountain.

246
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,690
If I had the chance to do it in his place, I would have.

247
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,590
All of the disciples at Kunlun Void would willingly do it.

248
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,970
What's wrong?

249
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,900
Let's sleep.

250
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,510
Second Older Brother,

251
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,380
why haven't you ever looked at your child properly?

252
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,820
He should've left 300 years ago.

253
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,210
No! He didn't do anything wrong.

254
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,300
He shouldn't suffer on behalf of his mother.

255
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,090
I believe he'll wake up soon.

256
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,410
Be good. Uncle Zi Lan will be here soon.

257
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,080
Junior Brother Zi Lan entrusted me to bring this pill.

258
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,730
Is Zi Lan...

259
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,410
Zi Lan wrote this list on how to regulate your body.

260
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,780
He said that since you lost all of your cultivation, if you don't carefully regulate your body,

261
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,490
in the future, on every first and fifteenth day of the month,

262
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,030
your entire body will collapse from the pain.

263
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:22,360
Now, we have helped you with both what we could and couldn't.

264
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,200
Please don't come back here to Kunlun Void.

265
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,240
I'm taking my leave.

266
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,010
Give it to the child.

267
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,800
Sure.

268
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,900
Ying'er, good boy.

269
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,950
Cry.

270
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,880
Hurry! Cry! Be good.

271
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,290
He's awake!

272
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,890
Zi Lan, I don't understand.

273
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,650
How could you bear to give away half of your cultivation?

274
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,100
That child's demonic energy is very strong.

275
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,930
Yan Zhi's cultivation can't save him alone.

276
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,320
So, of course, I need to help.

277
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,490
She's indeed a femme fatale.

278
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,570
Second Senior Brother, why are you more rueful than I am?

279
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,780
I don't think it's a big deal.

280
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,630
Now that the world is in peace, having too much cultivation is useless.

281
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,660
I just need enough cultivation to guard the Sea of Innocence.

282
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,240
Ye Hua.

283
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,290
What're you smiling at?

284
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,180
What're you smiling at?

285
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,710
Many people mistake you and my teacher,

286
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,610
but I've never mixed you two up,

287
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,040
besides the first time I met you at the Eastern Sea which surprised me.

288
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,200
You and Teacher are very different.

289
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,490
- Is that so?
- Yes.

290
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,070
Teacher's eyes are not as pitch black as yours.

291
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,910
He's not as quiet and calm as you.

292
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,920
In terms of immortals, you are quite young.

293
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,410
Why are you so mature? You appear more mature than Emperor Dong Hua.

294
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,220
There's no harm in looking some more.

295
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,380
When you are tired from looking, you can sleep in my arm.

296
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,510
It's bright outside.

297
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,140
Then, do you want to get up or sleep some more?

298
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,760
I'm a bit thirsty.

299
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,300
Get someone to brew tea.

300
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,160
Sure.

301
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,850
Starting today, send someone to keep an eye on the Donghuang Bell.

302
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:17,110
Report to me as soon as there's movement.

303
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,960
Do you mean Qing Cang is coming out soon?

304
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,440
You don't need to know any more.

305
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,490
You just need to remember that

306
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:29,300
if there's any movement from the Donghuang Bell, don't alert anyone and notify me immediately.

307
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,030
Yes.

308
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:41,620
You said that you personally saw High Goddess Bai Qian add a drug into His Mighty Monarch's pot of tea?

309
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,850
Are you sure it's High Goddess Bai Qian?

310
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,880
I don't dare lie.

311
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,360
How can that be?

312
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,980
She and Ye Hua are bound to marry.

313
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,150
She doesn't need to do this.

314
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:02,680
I have always been suspicious of the situation between High Goddess and His Mighty Monarch.

315
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,860
Don't you?

316
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,120
What are you suspicious about?

317
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,220
- You may go.
- Yes.

318
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,380
What happened 300 years ago is still fresh in my memory.

319
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,640
Don't you think it's strange?

320
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,070
His Mighty Monarch once loved that mortal very much.

321
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,060
Over 300 years, he kept guarding the flame in the lamp.

322
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,080
He was so persistent in creating a fake version of her.

323
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,360
After he went to the Eastern Sea, why did he suddenly change?

324
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,090
Even if he changed, he changed too suddenly.

325
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:48,590
You said exactly what I was thinking.

326
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:57,580
I've always wondered what happened to Ye Hua that he moved on so fast?

327
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,230
It's said that the Nine-Tailed Foxes of Green Hill are good at using seduction spells.

328
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:06,620
Maybe what the maid saw today was a seduction drug.

329
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,960
We're only guessing.

330
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,870
After all, she's a high goddess and she's engaged to Ye Hua.

331
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,740
She wouldn't go this far.

332
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,570
Even if Ye Hua doesn't feel anything for her, he still needs to marry her.

333
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,930
There's something I fear you may not know.

334
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,120
What other fishy matters are there?

335
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,830
Before His Mighty Monarch went to the Eastern Sea,

336
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,150
Bai Fengjiu of Green Hill pretended to be me.

337
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,380
She went to Purple Morning Hall to steal the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

338
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,010
What?

339
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,790
She stole the Soul-Gathering Lamp?

340
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,220
That Bai Fengjiu is a dignified empress.

341
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,170
How can she do this?

342
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,110
Why are you only telling me now?

343
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,540
His Third Highness and Si Ming specially came to apologize for her crime.

344
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,700
They said that she was immature, fooled around and stole the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

345
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,180
They begged me not to pursue this further.

346
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,740
Considering Si Ming and Emperor Dong Hua's reputation,

347
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,270
I suppressed this incident.

348
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,630
I've heard about Bai Fengjiu using the excuse of repaying her gratitude

349
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:27,130
to act wildly against the law and public opinions, and created chaos in Early Dawn Palace.

350
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,160
I originally thought the emperor would dislike her.

351
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,320
I didn't expect him to protect her.

352
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,010
The emperor is unpredictable. Who would have guessed?

353
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,040
But when I think about this,

354
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,630
I find it very fishy.

355
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,270
Your Highness, think about this.

356
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:51,410
Bai Fengjiu first stole the Soul-Gathering Lamp that was nurturing Su Su.

357
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,640
Bai Qian subsequently met His Mighty Monarch in the Eastern Sea.

358
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,130
When His Mighty Monarch saw her, he immediately moved on

359
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:01,600
and didn't do anything to try and recreate Su Su again.

360
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,820
Isn't this series of events too coincidental?

361
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,390
Absolutely so.

362
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:18,200
Hence, whether Bai Qian is engaged to His Mighty Monarch or not,

363
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,050
we should investigate this thoroughly.

364
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,380
If Bai Qian has such devious thoughts in her mind,

365
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,800
you should immediately report to Heavenly Monarch and His Mighty Monarch.

366
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:35,490
If this woman becomes the crown prince's consort or the future heavenly consort, it's too dangerous.

367
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,380
You're right.

368
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,330
But we're still just guessing right now.

369
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,930
After all, she's a high goddess and Monarchess Bai Qian of Green Hill.

370
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,710
We can't offend her.

371
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,080
She's come to Heavenly Palace twice, but she still hasn't greeted me.

372
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,780
Let's pay her a visit today.

373
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,540
Mother you're reading too fast.

374
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,780
A child like you shouldn't read this too intently.

375
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,720
I'll read it to you when I'm done.

376
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,540
Okay.

377
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,980
- Your Highness.
- Rise.

378
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,600
Greetings, Grandmother.

379
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,240
- Stand up.
- Yes.

380
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,930
Greetings, Mighty Monarch and High Goddess.

381
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,470
- High Goddess Bai Qian.
- Consort Le Xu.

382
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:04,000
Based on proprieties, I should extend my greetings to you.

383
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,890
but in view of your engagement with my son,

384
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,160
we can skip on greeting each other.

385
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,970
Let's go with the seniority of Ye Hua in the family.

386
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:17,820
Greetings, Consort Le Xu.

387
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,770
Then, I will accept your greetings as my future daughter-in-law.

388
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,540
Mighty Monarch!

389
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,070
Ye Hua, look at how busy you have been with official work.

390
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,410
Your tea's cold before you could even drink it.

391
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:40,130
I will get someone to brew a fresh batch of tea for you. Okay?

392
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,650
No need.

393
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,930
I like this temperature.

394
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,930
You can't drink that!

395
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,570
Is there something wrong with it?

396
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:58,150
I'm worried you might get sick if you drink cold tea.

397
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,680
After all, you recently recovered.

398
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,010
What if you fall sick again after drinking cold tea?

399
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,880
Mother, don't worry.

400
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,400
Qian Qian made this tea for me.

401
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,710
She added lots of Zhe Yan's medicinal pills for boosting energy.

402
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,440
It's for recuperation.

403
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,620
How did he know I secretly put in recuperative medicine?

404
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,300
I see.

405
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,480
High Goddess, you are very caring.

406
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,470
Your Highness, there's no need to be courteous.

407
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,900
After all, Ye Hua is my future husband.

408
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,770
I also hope he can get well soon.

409
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,650
Talking about this, I remembered your wedding.

410
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:54,430
You have already come to Nine Heavens twice.

411
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,880
Now, it seems you don't have any intentions to leave.

412
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,350
Why don't we set the wedding date and conduct this wedding in advance?

413
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,330
First, we will follow the tradition of the Heavenly Tribe.

414
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:11,660
Second, it'll bring Heavenly Monarch and Ye Hua's father's intentions to closure.

415
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,270
High Goddess, what do you think?

416
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:18,190
Although I'm the Monarchess of Green Hill,

417
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,820
I do have my parents above me.

418
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,810
I need to ask them first about the wedding.

419
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,550
That's fine.

420
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:31,190
Then, I'll go discuss this with Heavenly Monarch to start with the preparations.

421
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:35,210
After all, the marriage between the Heavenly Tribe and Green Hill is an important event.

422
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,630
It shouldn't be sloppy.

423
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,360
Grandma! I like you.

424
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,480
Does this mean that you usually don't like me?

425
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,590
I normally do but I like you even more today.

426
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,850
I've always hoped Mother and Father can get married soon.

427
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:57,170
This way, I can publicly visit Mother in the future.

428
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,780
Oh? So, if they don't get married, you can't find your mother?

429
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:06,870
If they are not married, Mother would have to worry about the proprieties of the Heavenly Tribe and secretly visit Father.

430
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:11,350
Look. She sneaked here at night to visit Father in his bedroom again.

431
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:17,200
It's not convenient for me to find her if she keeps doing this.

432
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,880
Ye Hua, why aren't you saying anything?

433
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,070
As you said, it's an important event of the Heavenly Tribe and Green Hill.

434
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:32,610
We need Heavenly Monarch and Fox Emperor to discuss this.

435
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,950
Let's not rush it.

436
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,290
I'm glad you know.

437
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,400
I won't bother Your Highness the Crown Prince from your work then.

438
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,220
I'll be leaving first.

439
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,350
Respectfully sending off Grandma.

440
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,360
Go read.

441
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,490
How did you know that I added recuperative medicine in your tea?

442
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,200
Even my mother knew something was in the tea.

443
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,000
If I didn't know about this, wouldn't I be incompetent?

444
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,420
So, Consort Le Xu came for this.

445
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,030
I was wondering why she rushed over.

446
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,210
There are too many rules here in the Heavenly Tribe.

447
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,360
Think too much.

448
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,600
Why're you looking at me like that?

449
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,640
It's nothing.

450
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,120
I felt that it was worth going to Yingzhou in the Eastern Sea.

451
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,990
When you talk to me now, you are more vivacious.

452
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,530
I've been like this since I was young.

453
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:55,510
It's just because I have lived for 140,000 years, and the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses call me Great Lady,

454
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:59,120
I dare not be too frivolous in my speech.

455
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:04,200
Hey, what are you preparing for our wedding?

456
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:10,320
It's an important event. We need to take time to carefully consider and discuss this.

457
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,330
Emperor Dong Hua came back a few days ago.

458
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:15,240
He has many matters to discuss with the Heavenly Monarch.

459
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,880
Once Heavenly Monarch is available after a few days,

460
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,620
I will personally request him to complete our wedding.

461
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,190
I wonder how long I'll have to wait for this taciturn person to take action.

462
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,280
I will go and sound out my older brothers first

463
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,680
and let them speak to my parents about him.

464
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,980
Lest when he goes, he will be given a hard time.

465
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,430
Your Highness.

466
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,640
What are you doing?

467
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,280
Are you preparing for His Young Highness's birthday?

468
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,570
His Mighty Monarch has never liked red colors.

469
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,150
Change it.

470
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,440
His Mighty Monarch personally requested it.

471
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,910
He said that the Great Lady of Green Hill will be marrying into this family,

472
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,440
so we should prepare for it.

473
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,210
That makes sense.

474
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,910
She's the High Goddess of Green Hill and also the future wife of His Mighty Monarch.

475
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,860
It shouldn't be sloppy.

476
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:25,590
When I go back to the palace later, I'm bound to discuss with His Mighty Monarch and Consort Le Xu

477
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:30,060
on how to prepare for his wedding with his main consort.

478
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,340
- You may go.
- Yes.

479
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,270
Yes.

480
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,400
Your Highness, when you first married into Pure Wutong Palace,

481
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,170
there wasn't any ceremony for making an oath to Heaven.

482
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:55,400
It was better... It was better when you were still the heavenly consort.

483
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,760
My sincere feelings for Ye Hua since I was young, can be seen day and night.

484
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:07,030
As of now, it's not confirmed who will be the legitimate mistress of Pure Wutong Palace.

485
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,660
Yes, Your Highness.

486
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:16,740
Ye Hua, are you set on this wedding?

487
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,450
Let's discuss the betrothal gifts;

488
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,880
and also, the welcome ceremony of the bride. This is a very important event.

489
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,600
Yes.

490
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,130
Father Monarch, don't be prematurely too happy.

491
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,910
Ye Hua still needs to go to the Mortal Realm for tribulation.

492
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,450
Why must he experience it?

493
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,480
The four beasts of Yingzhou in the Eastern Sea inherited half of Father God's power,

494
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,360
but Ye Hua slashed them.

495
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,680
This is disrespectful to Father God.

496
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,340
For the past two days, I checked the rules of Heaven.

497
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,280
Ye Hua needs to go down to the Mortal Realm for tribulation.

498
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,970
If others don't dispute this,

499
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,850
don't dispute the minor mistake that our son made.

500
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,540
Heavenly Tribe has their rules.

501
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,760
If we commit mistakes, we should be punished.

502
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,910
We are talking about a happy matter.

503
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,000
You are too disappointing.

504
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,120
Ye Hua, your father is right.

505
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,970
If you destroy Father God's things, you need to go through a tribulation.

506
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,690
I understand.

507
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:21,260
But since you destroyed the Mystical Mushrooms, this makes up for your mistake.

508
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,010
I'll punish you by letting you go down to the Mortal Realm, but it's not for tribulation.

509
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:29,560
I'll have Si Ming leave your Book of Fate blank, and let you have a chance encounter.

510
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,950
Heaven will call the cards. What do you think?

511
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,220
I understand.

512
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,800
It's just a tribulation. You should be back in two months at most.

513
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,320
Based on yours and Bai Qian of Green Hill's status,

514
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:47,190
I fear when you return to Heavenly Palace, our betrothal gifts still won't be ready.

515
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,920
Father, you are right.

516
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,120
I'll go make preparations right now.

517
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:24,170
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

518
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,250
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

519
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,810
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

520
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:34,200
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

521
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:43,660
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

522
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,510
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

523
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:52,730
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

524
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:58,520
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

525
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:05,460
♫ All are just illusions ♫

526
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:11,800
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

527
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,070
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

528
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:21,500
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

529
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:27,600
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

530
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:33,050
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

531
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:38,280
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

532
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,150
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

533
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:51,220
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

534
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:02,240
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

535
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,720
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

536
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,160
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

537
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:18,340
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

538
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:23,570
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

539
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:29,050
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

540
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:31,860
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

541
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:41,060
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

542
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:53,220
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
