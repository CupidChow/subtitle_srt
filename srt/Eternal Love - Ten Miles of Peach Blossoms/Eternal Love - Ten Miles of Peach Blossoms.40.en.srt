”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,560
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,060
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,610
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,120
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,470
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,230
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,800
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,340
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,890
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,420
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,970
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,490
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,090
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,560
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,110
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,600
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,110
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

19
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,030
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,830
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,350
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,840
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,050
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,870
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,570
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,010
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,200
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,750
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

29
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,010
[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,950
[Episode 40]

31
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,010
Pure Wutong Palace is huge.

32
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,430
Can you even find the Courtyard of Moonlight?

33
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,920
I should be fine.

34
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,510
I'll take you.

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,800
Your Highness!

36
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,890
Please beg His Mighty Monarch, Your Highness!

37
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,470
Tell him you told me to do it!

38
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,260
Your Highness...

39
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,910
You said I told you to do it?

40
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,380
I...

41
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,400
Miao Qing, I took pity on your infatuation with His Mighty Monarch,

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,470
and you want to frame me for not being moral?!

43
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,560
That's not what I meant, Your Highness.

44
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,720
I was wrong about you.

45
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,190
Your Highness, I spoke without thinking just now.

46
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,480
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

47
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,940
Since His Mighty Monarch has told you to leave, don't waste time.

48
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,850
Leave right now.

49
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,280
Your Highness...

50
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,300
Your Highness!

51
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,230
Are you all right? Did it go well?

52
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,050
Xin Nu,

53
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:57,390
I finally know why Yue Hua is obsessed with her.

54
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,560
Your Highness, what do you mean?

55
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,320
Just now...

56
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,590
I just saw Bai Qian of Green Hill.

57
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,450
Do you know who she looks like?

58
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,620
She looks exactly like that mortal.

59
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,100
Your Highness!

60
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,460
What are you saying?

61
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,890
Su Su.

62
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,950
It's Su Su!

63
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:43,300
She and that Su Su look exactly alike.

64
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,080
Your Highness!

65
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,400
Just stop right here. I know the rest of the way.

66
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,750
Hey. I really do remember the rest of the way.

67
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,330
I didn't escort you here really to show you the way.

68
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,600
I want to ask you.

69
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,890
Why are you making the princess go back to the Eastern Sea?

70
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,580
Didn't you want her to go back, too?

71
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,140
Is that the only reason?

72
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,110
I don't know how to answer you.

73
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,070
As I expected.

74
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,990
Expect what?

75
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,510
I didn't forget my promise to you.

76
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,700
I will help you to accept a few side consorts.

77
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,960
It's just... you don't like that princess,

78
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,140
so having her go back to the Eastern Sea is for the best.

79
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,590
Talking about this, this princess was very scheming.

80
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,450
If she can drug your soup today,

81
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:10,510
she might do something even more shocking on another day.

82
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,280
It's better for the harem to be more peaceful.

83
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,830
What do you think?

84
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,990
I shouldn't have asked this.

85
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,060
When I told you to enter the room, it was to make you jealous.

86
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,520
I didn't expect that, from the beginning till the end,

87
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,450
it was just a spectacle to you.

88
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:43,320
I have no place in your heart at all.

89
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,600
Bai Qian,

90
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,630
is your heart only for that person?

91
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,430
How long are you going to wait for him?

92
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,220
I have no place in your heart at all.

93
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,690
Bai Qian, is your heart only for that person?

94
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,080
How long are you going to wait for him?

95
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,390
I was distinctly very drowsy earlier,

96
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,940
but now that I'm sleeping under this warm blanket,

97
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,770
I can't sleep at all.

98
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,960
I have no place in your heart at all.

99
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,950
Bai Qian,

100
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,400
is your heart only for that person?

101
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,270
Ah Yin.

102
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,280
Ah Yin, where are you?

103
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,170
Ah Yin.

104
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:39,490
♫ The wind blows the lock to my memories open ♫

105
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,840
♫ I remembered our past ♫

106
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,910
♫ We once promised in love ♫

107
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,350
♫ We once missed out in regret ♫

108
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,990
♫ Peach blossoms drift down ♫

109
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:00,000
♫ The light fragrant hiding the bitter anguish ♫

110
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,620
♫ The moon paints ten miles of night with light ♫

111
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,290
♫ It brings up the loneliness in my eyes ♫

112
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:19,840
♫ My unwillingness to leave you has been drowned by vicissitudes of life ♫

113
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,460
♫ Three thousand years have flown by, my heart is driven to distraction ♫

114
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,580
I, Li Jing, will only be with Ah Yin in my life.

115
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,980
If I go back on my words, may my family line be cut off and may I spend my life alone.

116
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,150
♫ Bleak yearning, my heart has shattered beyond repair ♫

117
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:39,790
That time you said, no matter who I am, you would always be with me.

118
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,700
But now...

119
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,260
Fine.

120
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,140
I will fulfill your wish.

121
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,550
Li Jing,

122
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:56,610
it's true that you were the only person I loved in these 140,000 years,

123
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,910
but time changes everything.

124
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,990
We can't go back.

125
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,420
♫ The causality cannot be determined ♫

126
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,670
♫ Three lifetimes’ peach blossom are tender ♫

127
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,910
♫ Love is hard to abandon ♫

128
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,340
♫ I admire a flower ♫

129
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:25,540
♫  I’m willing to spend eternity with you, watching the flowers of youth in the spring wind ♫

130
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,300
I can't die.

131
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,750
I still have thousands of people.

132
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,290
Mighty Monarch!

133
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,180
Mighty Monarch! Mighty Monarch!

134
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,720
Mighty Monarch, criminal Xuan Nü escaped prison last night.

135
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,900
She also pierced Li Yuan through the heart before she left!

136
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,960
What did you say? My oldest brother is dead?

137
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes!

138
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,140
Cut off the head and hang it outside Grand Purple Palace for seven days for all to see,

139
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,820
then burn his body.

140
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,270
No matter what, he was the former Winged Monarch's oldest son.

141
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,560
He's also your oldest brother.

142
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,160
If this spread outs,

143
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,420
I fear a few of the generals won't be happy.

144
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,830
The people will talk about this, too.

145
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:55,290
His death will bring catastrophe to the Winged Realm and the entire world.

146
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:02,260
By doing this, we are already being kind to him.

147
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,970
Go and find the whereabouts of the princess immediately.

148
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,430
Bring her back to the Winged Realm at all costs.

149
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,630
If you encounter Xuan Nü,

150
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,920
no need to report to me and kill her immediately.

151
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,520
Bring her corpse back to the Winged Realm.

152
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,170
No matter what, she's the woman whom I legally married and brought into Grand Purple Palace.

153
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,540
When I'm dead, I want to be buried with her.

154
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,490
Yes.

155
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,340
They really flew past.

156
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,230
No, I must find Yan Zhi as soon as possible.

157
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,390
I must find her quickly.

158
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,240
Selling baozi!

159
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,130
Linhe Inn has wines and meats.

160
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,330
Our prices are reasonable. We don't deceive elders and children.

161
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,520
Don't miss it.

162
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,440
Sir, having a meal?

163
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,780
Please come in.

164
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,590
Sir, are you hungry?

165
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,670
- Yeah.
- Please come in.

166
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,860
Come look at this!

167
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,110
The jade is getting hotter.

168
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,260
Yan Zhi must be nearby.

169
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,050
We don't deceive elders and children.

170
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,310
Don't miss it.

171
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,030
Miss, are you hungry?

172
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,280
Sir, is there a lady nearby?

173
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,970
She's beautiful and pale with big eyes.

174
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,530
She's the same build as me.

175
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,740
She's looking for Yan Zhi.

176
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,690
Why aren't you saying anything?

177
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,300
Is she not here?

178
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,150
Miss, what's wrong with your eyes?

179
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,870
Should I find a physician for you?

180
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,140
A lowlife ruined my eyes.

181
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,840
Sir, please tell me!

182
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,410
Is that lady here?

183
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,390
There's someone similar who's in this store.

184
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,120
Take me to her!

185
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,800
Sure.

186
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,530
Watch your step.

187
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,210
Miss, wait a bit.

188
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,330
Sure.

189
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,590
Look. She's looking for you.

190
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,550
This jade is really hot.

191
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,950
That's right. Li Yuan was right.

192
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,270
The one in the front is Yan Zhi.

193
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,900
It's Yan Zhi!

194
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,140
Yan Zhi! Yan Zhi!

195
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,910
I'm Xuan Nü. Xuan Nü.

196
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,810
Xuan Nü? She's Xuan Nü?

197
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,510
No way! She doesn't look like that.

198
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,130
- Are you Second Sister-in-Law?
- Yes.

199
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,060
Why has your appearance become like this?

200
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,680
I know I look different.

201
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,520
It's because of Bai Qian, that lowlife.

202
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,030
She took away my beauty.

203
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,420
Yan Zhi, am I ugly?

204
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,990
Am I?

205
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,080
You're not, Second Sister-in-Law. Not at all.

206
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,460
Don't be afraid.

207
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,150
Mute, you... You can talk!

208
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,320
Yes. I can speak.

209
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,310
There's no time to explain to you right now.

210
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,770
Can you take care of the guests downstairs?

211
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,240
Okay. Okay.

212
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,310
Fortunately, I don't have to work today.

213
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,930
Take your time chatting.

214
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,090
There's no need for you to come out that soon.

215
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,700
About that...

216
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,890
If your second sister-in-law needs a doctor, just call me.

217
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,690
I will call you if I need anything. Go now.

218
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,540
Okay.

219
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,330
Yan Zhi,

220
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,060
who was that man?

221
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,530
Did you bring him along when you left the Winged Realm?

222
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,010
No, I left the Winged Realm alone.

223
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,910
Second Sister-in-Law, don't worry.

224
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,220
He's just an ordinary mortal.

225
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,860
He has been taking care of me for the past few years.

226
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,790
He has been taking care of you?

227
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,400
Yes.

228
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,190
Is this your child?

229
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,840
He's my son.

230
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,510
A prince?

231
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,520
Let me take a look at him.

232
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,030
Good boy. He's so obedient.

233
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,610
Why isn't he breathing?

234
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,210
There's no sign of breathing at all.

235
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,170
Doesn't my son look exactly like me?

236
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,920
Yes, he does.

237
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,490
I personally raised him since he was born.

238
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,270
It has been 300 years.

239
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,080
He doesn't cry or kick up a fuss.

240
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,970
He's very well behaved.

241
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,360
Yan Zhi, isn't he very well behaved?

242
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,640
Yes.

243
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:46,460
How could a mother not know whether her child is a boy or girl?

244
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,200
The child didn't grow up or cry for 300 years.

245
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,130
Could it be that when she gave birth to the child...

246
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,980
I'm afraid she's refused to accept reality since then.

247
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,900
That's why she...

248
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,670
Second Sister-in-Law,

249
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:08,080
did you find out that he doesn't cry, create a fuss and he's not breathing?

250
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,510
He's only asleep.

251
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,680
Yan Zhi, trust me.

252
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:20,310
If I can find a method, he will definitely wake up.

253
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,170
My son will definitely wake up.

254
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:38,290
I have been with the princess of the Winged Tribe for almost three years and there are still no clues.

255
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,630
Now, Xuan Nü's here with a disfigured face and an injured body.

256
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,220
It seems like there hasn't been any peace in the Winged Realm.

257
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,230
If I continue to follow her, I may be able to find out something.

258
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,250
This is not right.

259
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,730
What if Yan Zhi cures her eyes? What should I do?

260
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,370
Xuan Nü will recognize me.

261
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,860
I must not let her see my face.

262
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:52,060
Second Sister-in-Law, give it a try and check if you can see clearly.

263
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,510
No, it's still bloody and blurry.

264
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,090
This is strange.

265
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,940
It's just an ordinary injury.

266
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,360
Why can't they recover?

267
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,800
It's okay.

268
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,610
Anyway, I don't want to look at my fake face.

269
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,340
It's too ugly.

270
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,950
Sister-in-Law, don't be afraid.

271
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,980
I will try another method on another day.

272
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,830
Your eyes can be cured.

273
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,450
First, tell me what happened.

274
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,070
How did you turn out this way?

275
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,860
Your second older brother killed your eldest brother

276
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,380
and hung his head publicly outside Grand Purple Palace for several days.

277
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,590
His body was burned to ashes, too.

278
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:26,900
I only advised him a little, but your second older brother was furious with me.

279
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,160
He scolded me for birthing a stillborn and severing his lineage,

280
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,310
and damaged my eyes,

281
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:40,630
and wanted to drive me and my child out of the Winged Realm.

282
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,510
You... Why are you crying?

283
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,440
There is a change in my family.

284
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,480
My eldest brother is dead.

285
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,800
Li Yuan is dead?

286
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,750
Life and death is human nature.

287
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,660
Don't be sad.

288
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:30,430
All those years, I have never talked

289
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:34,150
because I didn't want to communicate with those irrelevant people.

290
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,740
I really didn't mean to trick you.

291
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,480
It's okay. It's okay.

292
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:57,300
Thank you for taking care of me for these past years.

293
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,320
I... I didn't do much.

294
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,630
I remember now.

295
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,750
I have some matters at the government office today.

296
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,140
I'm leaving first.

297
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,520
I thought you didn't have anything to do today.

298
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,640
I... I forgot about this earlier.

299
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,330
The people are uneasy.

300
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,360
The people are saying that the Old Winged Monarch will be back.

301
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,310
Is this true?

302
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:45,120
Wasn't Old Winged Monarch sealed by Mo Yuan at Ruoshui?

303
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,680
There were some movements in the Ruoshui River.

304
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,750
This is the sign.

305
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:55,790
If Old Monarch is released, with his temper, he will definitely fight to the death with the Heavenly Tribe.

306
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,270
Yes.

307
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,000
How many people will die again?

308
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,420
I'd rather die in the wilderness than to keep paying tribute to the Heavenly Tribe!

309
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,640
What do you think has gotten into His Majesty?

310
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,610
Not only does he favor Virtuous Consort Chen, he even decreed that he will not make any consort selections for the next five years.

311
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:04,430
Since Noble Consort went to the Daoist temple over a decade ago, the consorts in the harem haven't given birth to any children.

312
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,820
I thought His Majesty would impart his power to the crown prince.

313
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,080
But now, there's a Virtuous Consort Chen who's receiving favors.

314
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:18,280
If she has a good life and gives birth to another royal son, the crown prince's post will be vulnerable.

315
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,610
With a flick of a finger, more than ten years have passed in mortal time.

316
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,700
If we go back to Nine Heavens,

317
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,270
will the emperor blame me for ruining his original tribulation of love?

318
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,260
But I can't bear to hurt him,

319
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,280
even if this is a tribulation he has to experience.

320
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,020
Even if you can't bear to, you still need to.

321
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:13,950
Every time when you see me, why do you always feel uneasy?

322
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,770
I was momentarily absentminded.

323
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,570
Your Majesty, stay put.

324
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,040
I will get someone to clean this up.

325
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:33,220
What? You want me to give the Noble Consort a hard time?

326
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,480
That's right. Think of a way to make her jealous and fight for favors.

327
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,570
Didn't I give you some good novels?

328
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,150
There are many methods there.

329
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:43,850
But Noble Consort has been living in the Daoist temple for a long time.

330
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,360
What's there to be jealous about?

331
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,640
Her son has been conferred as the crown prince.

332
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,610
Just that should be enough to make the women in the harem jealous.

333
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:57,690
But you have been favored for a long time and there's still no direct descendant.

334
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,400
There's no hatred in your heart at all?

335
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,280
There isn't any.

336
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,220
Have you ever felt jealous?

337
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,750
I merely want to have a short fate with the emperor.

338
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,910
When would I find the time to be jealous?

339
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,590
You are really suitable to be with the emperor.

340
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,620
Really?

341
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,210
Following is following, but you two are destined to have no love fate with each other.

342
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,810
I know that I don't have a place in the emperor's heart

343
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,420
but can you help me to complete this beautiful dream?

344
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,010
What I need to do is to ruin your beautiful dream.

345
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,480
Young Highness, remember this.

346
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,120
You must make the emperor hate women and be totally disappointed.

347
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,830
Then, his task for coming to the Mortal Realm will be accomplished.

348
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,240
Must I do this?

349
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,480
Yes.

350
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,770
What is this?

351
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,840
This is the latest drama script.

352
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,000
The harem fighting for favor and framing Noble Consort.

353
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,480
Just do according to what's written here.

354
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,790
[Three Deities Hall]

355
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,480
Your Highness.

356
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,530
I should be greeting you instead, Older Sister.

357
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,050
I'm no longer the noble consort.

358
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,690
There's no need to greet me.

359
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,040
Older Sister, before I received the favors of His Majesty,

360
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,010
I was living in the Cold Palace and often heard stories about you.

361
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:43,680
I can finally meet this legendary person today.

362
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,780
I merely saw through the vanity of the world and became focused on cultivating Daoism.

363
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,580
Your Highness, you are exaggerating.

364
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,140
This is the first time we have met.

365
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,100
There's no need to be so formal.

366
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,340
By the way, Older Sister, I heard there are the best teas from the palace in this Daoist temple.

367
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,350
I wonder if I could ask for a cup of tea from you.

368
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,240
Okay. Your Highness, please come with me.

369
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,990
Your Majesty, Virtuous Consort has been having bad abdominal pains since an hour ago.

370
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,520
She fainted several times.

371
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,050
Why is this so?

372
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:26,300
The physician said she ate some unhygienic food.

373
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,260
Unhygienic food?

374
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:36,000
I heard that Virtuous Consort went to visit Noble Consort at the Daoist temple and drank some tea.

375
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,460
When she came back, she was in this condition.

376
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,020
She went to the Daoist temple?

377
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

378
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:50,490
Didn't I give instructions not to let Virtuous Consort go to the Daoist temple?

379
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:55,910
Your Majesty, who in this palace can stop Virtuous Consort other than you?

380
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,130
Your Majesty, you should visit her immediately.

381
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,290
One minute, she faints; and the next, she vomits.

382
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,960
What should we do?

383
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,490
Well.. It can't be...

384
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,790
Can't be what?

385
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:12,970
It can't be that Noble Consort is afraid that Virtuous Consort will give birth to a son

386
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:16,390
who'll take the crown prince's position, so she intentionally poisoned her?

387
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,570
How presumptuous!

388
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,820
How could you defame the birth mother of the crown prince?

389
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,960
I deserve to die! I deserve to die!

390
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,690
She gave birth to the crown prince.

391
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,350
Don't give such indiscriminate comments.

392
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,950
Yes.

393
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,020
Go with me to visit Virtuous Consort.

394
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,050
This act is too sinister.

395
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,440
Greetings, Your Majesty.

396
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,860
Your Majesty.

397
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,480
Why is your abdomen suddenly in pain?

398
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,020
You are perspiring a lot, too.

399
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,620
I heard you went to Noble Consort's Daoist temple.

400
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,530
Yes, I did go.

401
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,830
Since young, Aunt taught me that I must be worthy of my status as the monarchess of Green Hill.

402
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:58,300
How could I talk nonsense and harm a kind woman who's also religious?

403
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,010
Jiu'er.

404
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,390
This won't do.

405
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:04,860
If I do this, I will disregard and embarrass Aunt's teachings.

406
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,200
I must change to another method.

407
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,400
I did go to the Daoist temple,

408
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:19,710
but this has nothing to do with Noble Consort.

409
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,490
Your Majesty, please don't let your imagination run wild.

410
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:25,790
A few days ago, I sneaked off to play with water and caught a cold.

411
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,040
This has nothing to do with the Noble Consort.

412
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,310
Of course, I won't blame her.

413
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,060
I know her character very well,

414
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:41,370
but how could you not take care of your own health?

415
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,140
Did you even think about how I would feel?

416
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:50,730
I was too playful and caused you to worry.

417
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,090
Jiu'er,

418
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:07,410
just now, I was afraid that you would say Noble Consort harmed you.

419
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,360
Your Majesty, why would you speculate?

420
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,200
If I had really said that,

421
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,470
would you have believed me?

422
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,550
I wouldn't.

423
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,020
That's right.

424
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,890
I forgot that when I was still of the noble person rank,

425
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:37,230
you once lamented to me the heartbreak you felt with the noble consort.

426
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,250
You will definitely believe her and not me.

427
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,390
I believe the both of you.

428
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,850
Noble Consort has distanced herself from the world a long time ago.

429
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:57,280
As for you, you are the one I love the most, who's naturally kind and pure.

430
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,800
You would never harm her.

431
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,380
When I was walking here, I was very confused.

432
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,740
I clearly knew that with Noble Consort's human nature,

433
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,520
she would never do this.

434
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:17,050
But then, I thought that if you had any mishaps,

435
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:21,060
I will never spare anyone from the Daoist temple.

436
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:27,980
Looks like I have the ability to be an incompetent king.

437
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,180
Do you mean what you said?

438
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,350
Definitely.

439
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,240
Jiu'er,

440
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:48,190
if anything were to happen to you, I wouldn't be so sensible again.

441
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:56,060
Then, what if I do something wrong one day?

442
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,500
No matter what mistake you make,

443
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,820
I'll always pardon you.

444
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,660
Please wait two more years.

445
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:17,870
I'll do everything I can to make him hate me after those two years.

446
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,790
Young Highness,

447
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,070
don't think that just because you know me, you can prolong this.

448
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:29,030
The emperor is an immortal who has lived for hundreds of thousands of years.

449
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:32,460
Will he really remember this fate that only lasted a few days?

450
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,750
Who cares if it's just a few days?

451
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,050
I'll spend as much time as I can with him.

452
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,580
Fine.

453
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,340
I will give you two years deadline.

454
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,050
I will return when it's time to return.

455
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,890
Your Majesty.

456
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,410
It's late. Why did you come here?

457
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,490
I made some cakes.

458
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:23,130
I wanted to appreciate the moon with you.

459
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,200
Appreciate the moon?

460
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,980
Didn't you say you were unwell?

461
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,150
Did you forget what the imperial physician said?

462
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,020
That's why I sneaked here.

463
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,330
The imperial physician doesn't know.

464
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,870
Jiu'er, you seem somewhat different today.

465
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,560
Is that so?

466
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,620
Where am I different?

467
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:55,590
This past year, I kept thinking that you were troubled by something.

468
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:02,930
But tonight, I feel that you have let go of your problems in your heart.

469
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:06,570
You are finally willing to be honest and open with me.

470
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,090
I thought through everything.

471
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,740
Life is short.

472
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,220
Since I have you in my heart, I must treat you well.

473
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,350
If not, when I think back,

474
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,790
I will definitely regret it.

475
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,430
Is this true?

476
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,380
Since you have thought it through, come here.

477
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,890
Your Majesty, you must promise me.

478
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:43,090
No matter what, you must not forget these two years.

479
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,800
I promise you.

480
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,670
Yan Zhi, don't blame me for being cold-hearted.

481
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,900
Your father can only get stronger if I kill you.

482
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,530
Then, he can break from the bondage of the Donghuang Bell.

483
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:35,200
Only your father can slaughter all the people of Green Hill and get revenge for me.

484
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,380
Who are you? Are you from the Winged Tribe?

485
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,890
Do you not recognize my voice?

486
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,410
You're Zi Lan?!

487
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,380
That's right. It's me.

488
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,740
Why are you here?

489
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,350
If I weren't here,

490
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,520
you would've already killed Yan Zhi, who saved you!

491
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,710
Xuan Nü, it's been 70,000 years,

492
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,090
yet you're still this ungrateful!

493
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:36,090
What I do is none of your business!

494
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:40,450
Did you forget how your teacher died?

495
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:44,440
Did you forget your hatred against the Grand Purple Palace?!

496
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,670
Yet you're protecting the Winged Tribe's princess.

497
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,930
Are you not afraid of being punished?!

498
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:52,990
A traitor like you has no right talking about my punishment!

499
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,700
I don't know why you're trying to kill Yan Zhi!

500
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,260
But I'm warning you, as long as I'm here,

501
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,090
and you try to kill her again,

502
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:06,100
I'll make sure you know the price of betraying the Heavenly Tribe!

503
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,260
I won't harm you tonight

504
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,030
since you lost your position

505
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,960
and you have a child.

506
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,760
That's why I have a bit of compassion towards you.

507
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,690
Don't force me.

508
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:25,930
If you stay with Yan Zhi and treat her well, I won't touch you.

509
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,060
Do you understand?

510
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,020
I understand.

511
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,280
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

512
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,410
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

513
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:16,820
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

514
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:22,420
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

515
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:32,030
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

516
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,760
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

517
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,990
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

518
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:46,640
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

519
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:53,040
♫ All are just illusions ♫

520
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:59,960
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

521
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:05,160
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

522
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,680
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

523
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,800
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

524
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:21,260
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

525
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:26,460
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

526
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,290
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

527
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:38,230
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

528
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:50,410
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

529
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:55,890
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

530
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:00,190
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

531
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:06,540
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

532
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:11,880
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

533
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,120
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

534
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,000
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

535
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:28,970
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

536
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:41,560
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
