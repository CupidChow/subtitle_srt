”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,540
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,170
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,660
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,020
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,430
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,170
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,760
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,310
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,010
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,430
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,260
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,450
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,080
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,530
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,020
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,550
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,090
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,010
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,740
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,190
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,310
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,800
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,840
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,460
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,420
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,000
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,580
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,990
[Episode 54]

31
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,790
That's because I'm stupid.

32
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,100
I thought that what happened in the past,

33
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,790
I didn't need to care too much about it.

34
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:32,620
I only know today when I saw that he didn't recognize me but that woman,

35
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,610
I then realized,

36
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:43,800
what he couldn't let go was someone else not me.

37
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:53,230
I know that he loves that woman more deeply than me.

38
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:06,360
Perhaps, it's because I look like his first wife when my eyes are covered.

39
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,280
That's why he fell in love with me.

40
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:18,610
Aunt, why don't you wait till His Highness the Crown Prince is back and ask him in person?

41
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,090
If he really regards you as a substitute, we will cancel the engagement then.

42
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,810
I have never seen you being so heartbroken.

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:37,450
Fourth Uncle always said that when High God Mo Yuan's soul was dispersed, you seemed to had lost half your life.

44
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,960
But you look even worse today.

45
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,710
My heart breaks.

46
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,860
Don't say anymore. I want to stay here for a while.

47
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,450
Aunt, you really don't need me to keep you company. We can chat.

48
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,560
Don't say anymore. Don't say anything anymore.

49
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,550
I really don't understand,

50
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,620
so I can only torture myself.

51
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,520
Then, Aunt, you must take care of your health for Green Hill's sake.

52
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,640
For Green Hill?

53
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,440
That's right.

54
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,750
If I cancel the engagement,

55
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,710
I can only go back to Green Hill and be the monarchess of Green Hill.

56
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,730
Leave.

57
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,110
Yes.

58
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,010
Why is it so dazzling?

59
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,700
I don't believe that I can't put you out.

60
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,330
Since we've made an oath to the Great Lake of the Eastern Wilderness,

61
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,970
we're now a married couple for eternity.

62
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,020
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

63
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,160
This Nine Heavens is not a place for a woman like you.

64
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,460
You should jump from the Immortal Execution Platform and go back to where you belong.

65
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,990
Ye Hua, believe me. I didn't push her.

66
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,570
- I didn't push her.
- It's my fault.

67
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,160
I don't have the ability to protect you.

68
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,030
- I'll surely marry you. From now on, I will be your eyes.
- No...

69
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,510
Ye Hua, I didn't do it!

70
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,860
Why do I need to pay for it?

71
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,730
Let me go and I will let you go, too.

72
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,460
Let's go our different paths.

73
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,110
Su Su? Su Su.

74
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,770
Ye Hua, I'm actually Su Su.

75
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,720
Su Su... was me.

76
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,340
Great Lady, do you still want more wine?

77
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,010
Great Lady, what's wrong with you?

78
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,820
Leave.

79
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,750
Official has been bewitched.

80
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,690
He must find Green Hill's fairyland.

81
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,480
He refused the match-maker.

82
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,190
Old Madam is sick from anger.

83
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,230
You tell me, what caused this consequence of evil?

84
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,560
I heard a few Taoists from Jianghu saying that Green Hill is where the fox spirits live.

85
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,210
Our official couldn't have been bewitched by a fox, right?

86
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,040
Don't talk behind Official's back.

87
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,090
Miss, for the past years, Old Madam wanted to force you into Official's room many times, but you refused.

88
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,930
Miss, for the past years, Old Madam wanted to force you into Official's room many times, but you refused.

89
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,430
Miss, it really wasn't easy for you, either.

90
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,100
Official has been infatuated.

91
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,140
He only has that Green Hill's immortal in his heart.

92
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,400
I'm not in his heart.

93
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,750
Aunt, let's wash your face.

94
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,850
Fengjiu,

95
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,000
when you were in Nine Heavens,

96
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,660
didn't you always transform into a little fox and go to Courtyard of Moonlight?

97
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,700
That's right.

98
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:36,280
When Su Su was pregnant, no one was with her.

99
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,010
You were the only one who kept her company.

100
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes.

101
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:47,060
When Su Su was captured to the Heavenly Palace by Heavenly Monarch,

102
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,970
you even went to scare her.

103
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:57,620
It's because you felt that she took away your aunt's future husband.

104
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,380
Aunt, how did you know?

105
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,310
Regarding this, only Emperor, Si Ming and I knew about this.

106
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,050
No one else knew.

107
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,320
It's because I was Mochi's mother in the Mortal Realm.

108
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,360
I'm Su Su.

109
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,930
Aunt, are you spouting nonsense because you are drunk?

110
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,120
I know you are angry with His Highness the Crown Prince for not being able to forget Su Su,

111
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,250
but Aunt, you are the monarchess of Green Hill whereas Su Su is a mortal.

112
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,650
How can she be compared to you, Aunt?

113
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,700
Su Su is Su Su and you are you.

114
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:57,770
It was just a tribulation for me to transcend into a high goddess.

115
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:07,250
The relationship between Ye Hua and I is my love tribulation.

116
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,940
Aunt, where are you going?

117
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,200
Great Lady.

118
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,480
Aunt!

119
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,570
Great Lady, watch your health.

120
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,130
You have been drinking for seven to eight days.

121
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,900
There's no more wine in the cellar.

122
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,640
If you want to drink again, I wouldn't dare to give you any more.

123
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,430
My health is not important.

124
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,770
Aunt, what you just said, were they spoken because you were drunk or were they true?

125
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,100
Of course, it's true.

126
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,270
In the blink of an eye, I remembered something important.

127
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,280
Great Lady, you are half drunk and half sober.

128
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,500
What did you remember?

129
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,980
When I was in the Mortal Realm experiencing a love tribulation,

130
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,480
Su Jin profited from my misfortune and obtained a pair of eyes from me.

131
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,730
Now that my tribulation is over,

132
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:15,850
leaving my eyes with her doesn't seem right.

133
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,140
It's probably not comfortable for her to take care of my eyes.

134
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,370
Shouldn't I get them back from her?

135
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,930
Great Lady, you must be drunk.

136
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,900
When did Consort Su Jin owe a pair of eyes from you?

137
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,720
If you don't know what's going on, I'm not telling you.

138
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,440
Young Jiu, tell me.

139
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,310
Should I get my eyes back?

140
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:40,220
If you are really Su Su, you suffered a lot in the Heavenly Palace back then.

141
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,100
You should get your eyes back.

142
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,530
I will be back soon.

143
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,120
Don't follow me!

144
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,500
If Aunt is really Su Su, it's too horrible.

145
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,120
What's so horrible?

146
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,690
You didn't know, when Su Su was in the Heavenly Palace, she suffered a lot and was desolate, and was also falsely accused.

147
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,230
In any case... In any case, it was horrible.

148
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,010
If it was that horrible, she should get her eyes back.

149
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,380
That's right.

150
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,910
No, this is too dangerous.

151
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,910
I can't let Aunt suffer again.

152
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,000
If she's going to Nine Heavens to fight, how can she do it without me?

153
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,650
Aunt! Aunt!

154
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,010
Who are you to stop the monarchess of Green Hill?

155
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,530
Greetings, Great Lady!

156
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,490
At ease.

157
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,210
Don't you know me?

158
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,230
Blame me for always staying in Early Dawn Palace and not going out to meet you.

159
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,650
Move aside now. I'm going in.

160
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,060
Not anyone can trespass into Nine Heavens?

161
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,630
Miss, you mentioned Early Dawn Palace.

162
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,860
Are you trying to use Emperor Dong Hua to scare us?

163
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,500
Move aside now.

164
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,030
I'm Bai Fengjiu, the young empress of Green Hill.

165
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,400
If you had just announced yourself then, we would have believed you.

166
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,190
A monarchess from Green Hill just went in and there's another empress from Green Hill again?

167
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,070
How can it be so coincidental?

168
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,420
You are really infuriating.

169
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,650
Let me tell you. If anything happens to the future Heavenly Monarchess,

170
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,900
His Highness the Crown Prince will definitely punish you!

171
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,010
High Goddess.

172
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,120
High Goddess, My Lady...

173
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,600
High Goddess is here. I'm afraid.

174
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,040
I'm trying to figure out what's on your mind.

175
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,750
You are probably here to ask about the situation of the Mighty Monarch.

176
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,850
If I want to talk about him,

177
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,420
he's doing very well with that Su Su in the Mortal Realm.

178
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,280
She's taking good care of him.

179
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,640
This is naturally the best.

180
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,990
With you taking care of Ye Hua, I don't have to worry.

181
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:02,600
Hence, I'm here to take care of you today.

182
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,400
Su Jin,

183
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,390
you have used my eyes for three hundred years.

184
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,330
Have you been using them well?

185
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,920
You...

186
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,710
What did you just say?

187
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,950
What's wrong?

188
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:32,710
You have been using these eyes and forgot about their history?

189
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,300
Three hundred years ago when I was undergoing a love tribulation,

190
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,270
I lost my pair of eyes here.

191
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:47,300
I remember about this today and am here specially to get them back.

192
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,630
You...

193
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,170
You are... Su Su?

194
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,890
Do you want to personally take action

195
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,070
or do you want me to take action instead?

196
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,390
Impossible.

197
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,910
How could you be...

198
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,830
Impossible. Impossible.

199
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,410
Impossible.

200
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,780
Are you going to dig them out or do you want me to do so?!

201
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,270
That woman... was clearly a mortal!

202
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,160
She can't be you.

203
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,710
She was distinctly a mortal.

204
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,850
She can't be you. She can't.

205
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,890
So what if she was a mortal? So what if she was an immortal?

206
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,250
Just because I reincarnated as a mortal three hundred years ago and was worthless,

207
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,830
who allowed a junior immortal like you to rob my eyes

208
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,870
and fool me into jumping off from the Immortal Execution Platform?

209
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,600
It seems like you can't bear to take action on your own.

210
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,550
I have been happy lately and drank a lot.

211
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,850
My hands may not be steady.

212
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,400
When I dig them out, it may hurt.

213
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,030
Bear with it.

214
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,700
Don't dig out my eyes! Don't dig out my eyes!

215
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,490
Excellent.

216
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,530
Three hundred years ago, you loved to pretend to be weak.

217
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,230
Every time I see you, you will pretend to be weak.

218
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,750
Why don't you show me how you are when you are not weak?

219
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,020
When Ye Hua dug out my eyes that night,

220
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,110
he told me, whatever is owed,

221
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,410
it will eventually be paid back.

222
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,440
How you lost your eyes in the past,

223
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,220
we know it very well.

224
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,220
How did my eyes get into your eye sockets?

225
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,850
We know this very well, too.

226
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,000
I want to ask you.

227
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,110
Why can't I get back what used to belong to me?

228
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,080
My eyes were in your eye sockets for three hundred years!

229
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,120
Since when do they belong to you?!

230
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,270
Three hundred years ago,

231
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,560
Heavenly Monarch did this quietly.

232
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,220
It's my turn to do it quietly today.

233
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,660
There are two things you owe me.

234
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,490
One is my pair of eyes.

235
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,820
The other is the Immortal Execution Platform.

236
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,380
I will consider that you have returned your debt for my eyes.

237
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,080
As for the Immortal Execution Platform...

238
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:50,840
why don't you be serious and jump down from there?

239
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,890
Or perhaps, you can go and tell Heavenly Monarch that

240
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:04,620
you will use your weak divine strength to guard Qing Cang who was imprisoned in Donghuang Bell

241
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,170
and will never go up to the Heavenly Palace again.

242
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,280
No.

243
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,890
No, I won't.

244
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,260
That's right.

245
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,750
You are finally showing your strength.

246
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:38,330
Are you saying that you want me to personally go and tell Heavenly Monarch?

247
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,950
But you also know that I'm a mercurial person.

248
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:51,460
What I will tell Heavenly Monarch is not only this.

249
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,020
Virtue has its rewards.

250
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,640
Evil has its retributions.

251
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,060
Go and get the Medicine King.

252
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,380
My Lady!

253
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:14,650
My Lady! My Lady!

254
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:23,940
Bai Qian, I will never let you off!

255
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,350
For the days that Ye Hua is not in the Heavenly Palace,

256
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:43,380
he wanted Star Monarch Tian Shu to guard Ruoshui.

257
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,260
Could there be something out there that's not right?

258
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,530
I reckon that because His Highness the Crown Prince is getting married soon,

259
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,520
he fears there will be abnormal movement from the Winged Tribe.

260
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,740
After all, Ruoshui River is near the borders of the Heavenly Tribe and Winged Tribe.

261
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,110
We need to keep guarding that place.

262
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,470
It won't be that simple.

263
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:05,740
Emperor, are you suspecting that it's related to Donghuang Bell then?

264
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,060
If it's really related to the Donghuang Bell, it's something major then.

265
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,230
His Highness the Crown Prince shouldn't conceal this.

266
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,230
Ye Hua must have his reasons for not revealing this.

267
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,030
Come to Ruoshui with me.

268
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,060
Yes.

269
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,950
You are really infuriating me.

270
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,900
Don't you know who I am?

271
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,200
I'm good friends with Si Ming and also Primary Monarch Cheng Yu.

272
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,010
If you don't believe me, just ask them.

273
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,360
I'm Bai Fengjiu of Green Hill, the young empress of Green Hill.

274
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,860
That lady seems to be Young Empress.

275
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,780
You can't trespass into Nine Heavens.

276
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,210
- Miss, stop pestering us.
- Go and take a look.

277
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,090
Yes.

278
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,260
Young Highness, why do you have the time to come here today?

279
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,760
Si Ming, tell them who I am now.

280
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,330
She's the Young Highness of Green Hill.

281
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,090
Please be accommodating. Emperor Dong Hua is waiting for her in Early Dawn Palace.

282
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,620
Stop messing around. It's strict in Heaven.

283
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,900
If you court disaster, the emperor won't be able to help you, either.

284
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,660
I'm not messing around. My aunt is here to look for Lady Su Jin.

285
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,620
I can't let her suffer again.

286
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,690
What?

287
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:31,540
Let me tell you. My aunt was Su Su, that mortal wife of His Highness the Crown Prince whom he has been yearning for.

288
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,380
High Goddess was Su Su? Don't lie to me.

289
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,740
I'm not lying to you. It's true.

290
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,580
My aunt broke the Soul-Gathering Lamp and remembered the past.

291
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,600
She said when she was Su Su,

292
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,870
it was her love tribulation for transcending into a high goddess.

293
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,520
I see. I understand now.

294
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,960
That's right. Now that Aunt has remembered, she's here to get back her eyes from Lady Su Jin.

295
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,390
I still remember when Lady Su Jin fell from the Immortal Execution Platform,

296
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,560
- she said that Su Su pushed her.
- That's right.

297
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,700
After Aunt recalled everything, she knew that she was falsely accused.

298
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,580
Hence, she came to look for Lady Su Jin to retrieve her eyes.

299
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,550
Will there be a disaster then?

300
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,100
Hence, I can't talk much to you anymore.

301
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,170
I'm afraid that my aunt will suffer. I'm going to Pure Wutong Palace now.

302
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,570
Young Highness! Young Highness!

303
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,870
Quick, Xin Nu.

304
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:28,490
- We will be there soon, My Lady.
- Quick.

305
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,390
Su Jin, what's wrong with your eyes?

306
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,010
Uncle.

307
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,530
Uncle, you must help him to make the decision.

308
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,960
Quick. Take me to the Great Hall now. Quick!

309
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,170
Su Jin, stop there!

310
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,440
- Where's my aunt?
- Your aunt?

311
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,870
Your aunt took my eyes!

312
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,240
I was just about to make my statement to the Heavenly Monarch!

313
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
You are really evil.

314
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,600
When you framed my aunt for pushing you down Immortal Execution Platform,

315
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,770
you even caused His Highness the Crown Prince to dig out her eyes!

316
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,790
My aunt was heartbroken and jumped from the Immortal Execution Platform.

317
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,610
Your eyes belonged to my aunt in the first place. You should return them to her!

318
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,890
You are making slanderous remarks!

319
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,980
How could I have known that Su Su was your aunt then?

320
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,210
Even if she was your aunt, so what?

321
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,430
She pretended to be weak and pushed me down the Immortal Executive Platform.

322
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,860
She ruined my eyes. She needed to repay me.

323
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,840
Even if she's a high goddess, she should repay me, too!

324
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,760
You!

325
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,620
The women in Green Hill are noble and distinguished.

326
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,640
Every one of them is an empress when they are born.

327
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,300
So what?

328
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,000
Should I, who's from the Heavenly Tribe, be bullied?

329
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,880
How could you be so evil?

330
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,390
At this moment, you are still slandering Green Hill!

331
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,470
Your aunt pushed me on the Immortal Execution Platform first and ruined my eyes.

332
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,010
What did I do wrong?

333
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,410
Just because she's a high goddess, she can do whatever she likes?

334
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,330
What do you think this place is?

335
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,250
This is Nine Heavens!

336
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,950
Let me tell you, Bai Fengjiu!

337
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,680
Don't think that what you and your aunt said, you can change the truth!

338
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:59,580
No matter what you say, your aunt needs to give me justice and return my eyes!

339
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,540
Su Jin, why don't I understand what you are saying?

340
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,250
What's going on?

341
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,900
Why are you having a conflict with the people from Green Hill?

342
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:13,010
Uncle, it's Bai Qian of Green Hill who dug out my eyes.

343
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,790
What? Why would she dig out your eyes?

344
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,210
She... She was Su Su from the past.

345
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,440
High Goddess Bai Qian was that mortal then?

346
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,840
- That's right.
- Don't listen to her nonsense.

347
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,940
- She's talking nonsense!
- How presumptuous!

348
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,330
Can't you see what place this is?

349
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,110
Don't think that just because you have the support of Green Hill,

350
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,450
you can create a scene here!

351
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,970
So unruly!

352
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:39,080
Uncle, take me to the Great Hall now.

353
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,370
I want to report every single detail to the Heavenly Monarch!

354
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,400
Even if we eventually need to bow to Green Hill,

355
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,670
I must explain everything!

356
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,250
My eyes are not important.

357
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,570
What's important is the reputation of the Heavenly Tribe!

358
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,980
Su Jin, don't worry.

359
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,920
What's right and wrong? Just tell the Heavenly Monarch and he will know.

360
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,890
- Don't worry. We will go with you.
- Okay.

361
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,390
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

362
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
I must not let her delude the Heavenly Monarch.

363
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,180
She's a person who distorts facts.

364
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,080
Don't stop me!

365
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,280
Come with me.

366
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,820
Greetings, High Goddess.

367
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,680
Ye Hua, do you know?

368
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,380
The pain from three hundred years ago seems like yesterday.

369
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,060
What righteous cause? What justification?

370
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,030
What you must do in order to protect me, a mortal?

371
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,790
I didn't want to care about anything.

372
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:23,730
I only remember every lonely night of mine in the Courtyard of Moonlight and gradually being worn out.

373
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,920
And my humble hopes.

374
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:36,560
Ye Hua, how do you expect me to marry you?

375
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,140
I heard you drank all the wines in your Fourth Older Brother's cellar.

376
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,740
Are you here to ask for wines from me?

377
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,860
You found your eyes after three hundred years.

378
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,880
What a miracle.

379
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,400
You drank my medicine and you could still remember the painful past.

380
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,840
It's really a miracle.

381
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,210
These eyes were dug out from an immortal.

382
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:45,070
It can't go beyond 7 times 7, which is 49 days or they won't be usable. Right?

383
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,100
I thought when you lost your eyes, that would be it.

384
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,510
I didn't expect them to be in someone else's eye sockets.

385
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,230
You even found them now.

386
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,500
Help me to put the eyes back safely.

387
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,930
I can do it,

388
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:05,360
but you must wait for me to cleanse the foul odor first.

389
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,210
After I'm done, I will put them back safely for you.

390
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,990
No hurry.

391
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,460
Young Fifth, you haven't told me who took your eyes.

392
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,940
It was a love tribulation.

393
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,940
Don't bother to talk about it.

394
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,880
Su Su.

395
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,270
Official.

396
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:04,580
Do you know why I gave you the name, Su Su?

397
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,470
Official, you've never mentioned it.

398
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:15,700
It's because when I first saw you, you were dressed plainly.

399
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,220
Su Su,

400
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:35,070
I have been waiting for someone in my entire life.

401
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:43,430
I know that you have been waiting for that immortal in Green Hill.

402
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,220
That's right.

403
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:52,290
When I was eleven years old, she came to find me.

404
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:59,720
She said that she would marry me when I become an adult.

405
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,740
A pity that she didn't come.

406
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,240
They said that immortals live for a long time.

407
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,430
Thinking about my short life,

408
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:21,110
it's probably just a few days to her.

409
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:31,130
It seems like I won't be able to wait anymore.

410
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:45,050
Official, you never married anyone and never disappointed that immortal.

411
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,460
She wouldn't blame me for breaking my promise, right?

412
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:17,170
After I die, burn my corpse into ashes and bury it with this pearl bracelet.

413
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,280
Official.

414
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,890
- Official!
- Official!

415
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,610
Official.

416
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,400
Official! Official!

417
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,360
Kunlun Void?

418
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,870
Why am I here?

419
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,530
Ye Hua.

420
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,630
High God Mo Yuan?

421
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:44,050
Ye Hua, perhaps, you should call me Oldest Brother.

422
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,300
Oldest Brother?

423
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,770
You are Father God's son, my twin younger brother.

424
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:05,190
Because of an accident, it caused your spirit to go into a deep sleep.

425
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:10,010
Thus, Father God took your spirit and placed it in a golden lotus.

426
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,140
When Father God returned to a formless mass,

427
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,270
he entrusted you to me.

428
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:20,320
I brought you back to Kunlun Void and placed you in this lotus pond till you woke up.

429
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:33,390
When Bai Qian was learning skills here, what she loved to take care of was you, the golden lotus.

430
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:40,600
Perhaps, this is fate and the will of Heaven.

431
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,280
It's also a fate that the both of you should treasure.

432
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,140
I was originally in seclusion.

433
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,950
Later, I still wanted to meet you.

434
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:04,450
After all, I have been waiting for you for tens of thousands of years.

435
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,350
Heavenly Monarch! Heavenly Monarch!

436
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,430
Su Jin.

437
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,000
- Heavenly Monarch.
- Heavenly Monarch.

438
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,090
- Emperor.
- Heavenly Monarch.

439
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,320
You must make the judgment for me.

440
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,480
Heavenly Monarch, you are very clear about what happened that year.

441
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,330
You must make the judgment, Heavenly Monarch.

442
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,090
Get up first.

443
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,120
No, I can't get up.

444
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,990
If I get up, I will be admitting to this sin.

445
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,520
High Goddess Bai Qian not only dug out my eyes,

446
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:09,110
but she also wants me to jump from the Immortal Execution Platform to pay for my sin.

447
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,190
She wants to remove my immortality

448
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:15,060
and let me go to Ruoshui to guard Qing Cang who was sealed in the Donghuang Bell

449
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,750
and never return to Heaven again.

450
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,750
Although we owe Green Hill a debt because of Sang Ji,

451
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,540
you can't let that high goddess do whatever she likes

452
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,120
and falsely accuse the people of the Heavenly Tribe.

453
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,570
That's right. If others were to bully Su Jin,

454
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,530
how can we be worthy of our deceased brothers?

455
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:37,300
You! You can't listen to only one side of Su Jin's story.

456
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,120
You should listen to mine. You should listen to my aunt's.

457
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,420
Your aunt dug out her eyes and simply left.

458
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,560
She's the monarchess of Green Hill

459
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,980
and also the Great Lady respected by Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

460
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,570
How can we act against her?

461
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,790
If your aunt wanted to give the Heavenly Tribe an explanation,

462
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,080
she shouldn't have done this on the sly and secretly left, too.

463
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,520
My aunt secretly left in order to give dignity to the Heavenly Tribe.

464
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,220
Do you want my aunt to tell everyone in Four Seas that

465
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,470
Lady Su Jin, a heavenly concubine, had done many vicious and evil deeds?

466
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,880
She bullied the weak, snatched her husband, took away her eyes,

467
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,780
and made her jump from the Immortal Execution Platform?

468
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,280
Young Lady, how could be you so evil?

469
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,260
Your aunt dug out my eyes

470
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,940
and you are even distorting the truth for her.

471
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,240
You... Heavenly Tribe's people are bullies.

472
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,360
Why do you only listen to her?

473
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,110
You already harmed my aunt once and are you going to harm her twice?

474
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,840
How presumptuous!

475
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,800
I...

476
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,340
It's definitely presumptuous.

477
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,830
Emperor, aren't you here to help me?

478
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,960
Why are you helping to speak up for Su Jin now?

479
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:49,330
This matter is confusing.

480
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:52,040
Everyone has their own versions.

481
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:59,090
I have something to say. Although it may offend Heavenly Monarch, I think that I still need to speak.

482
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,770
Emperor, please speak.

483
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:04,400
This concerns the Heavenly Tribe and Green Hill.

484
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,370
Su Jin was once your Heavenly Concubine.

485
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:12,260
Hence, you shouldn't preside over this or you will be maneuvered by others

486
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,560
and will let Green Hill think that when we are judging this case, that we have selfish motives.

487
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,020
Emperor, are you saying that...

488
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,700
Everyone in Heaven knows that,

489
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,650
I used to be the co-owner of Heaven

490
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,040
and has no close relationship with anyone and tribes.

491
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,080
The harem is vacant and a distance from the secular world.

492
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,120
Hence, I should preside over this case

493
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,800
so that it will stop people from talking.

494
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,140
But Emperor, you and Bai Fengjiu of Green Hill...

495
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,670
What's wrong?

496
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,180
Wasn't what I just said clear enough?

497
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,240
The Emperor wants me to stay out of this.

498
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,010
He wants to give Green Hill a justification.

499
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:57,690
In this situation, I can't protect her again.

500
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,620
This will depend on her luck.

501
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:06,860
I think the emperor's remarks make sense.

502
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,520
I will listen by the side then and not interject.

503
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,380
Su Jin,

504
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,900
do you think I will take sides with Green Hill?

505
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,030
I wouldn't dare to doubt you.

506
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,310
What about you?

507
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:32,200
Do you think I will take sides with Bai Qian?

508
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,410
- I wouldn't dare.
- I wouldn't dare.

509
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:41,280
Then, Su Jin, take your time to tell us.

510
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,560
Start from 70,000 years ago.

511
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,690
I have always lived in the Early Morning Dawn Palace and don't know about your matters.

512
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:54,320
I will give you the opportunity now to clarify yourself.

513
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,400
Yes.

514
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,540
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

515
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,630
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

516
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,210
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

517
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:37,620
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

518
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:46,790
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

519
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,840
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

520
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:56,150
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

521
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:01,750
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

522
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:08,850
♫ All are just illusions ♫

523
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:15,150
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

524
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:20,430
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

525
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:24,930
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

526
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:31,150
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

527
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:36,490
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

528
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:41,690
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

529
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:44,570
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

530
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:53,660
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

531
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:05,550
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

532
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:11,170
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

533
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:15,540
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

534
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:21,880
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

535
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,980
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

536
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:32,420
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

537
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,230
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

538
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:44,050
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

539
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:56,660
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
