”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,000
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,600
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,000
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,400
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,200
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,800
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,200
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,700
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,400
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,800
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,400
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,800
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,600
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,800
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,600
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,200
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,050
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,800
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,200
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,800
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,000
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,800
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,600
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,800
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,000
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,900
[Episode 20]

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Greetings, Your Highness Le Xu.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,800
Although I pleaded for your life at the grand hall that day,

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
I didn't do it for you.

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,010
I did it for Ye Hua's child in your womb.

35
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,800
Do you understand this?

36
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,560
I do.

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,800
But Ye Hua and I already swore to the Great Wilderness and Heaven in our wedding in the Mortal Realm.

38
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,200
Thus, we are already a married couple.

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,800
He's the Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe. He has his predestined marriage.

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,700
What the both of you did in the Mortal Realm doesn't count.

41
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,800
But even if it's in the Mortal Realm—

42
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,600
How presumptuous.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,670
When I'm talking, you can only listen.

44
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,100
This is the rule of the Heavenly Tribe.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,300
Yes.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,400
Greetings, Heavenly Monarch.

47
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,800
Su Jin,

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,800
take me to see the Crown Prince.

49
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,300
Yes.

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,400
No need to stand on ceremony.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,500
Why were you so careless in doing your task?

52
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,200
I was too impatient.

53
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,600
When the Heavenly army arrived at Long Sea, they fought the war on the same night.

54
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,000
It's considered as putting the soldiers in danger.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,100
I'm willing to accept punishment.

56
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,700
Father Monarch, when Ye Hua was severely stabbed, it also aroused the fighting spirit of the soldiers.

57
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,800
They used three days to have a complete victory.

58
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,200
Ye Hua has established merit.

59
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,000
Everyone, leave.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,100
A few days ago, I brought back a mortal who's pregnant with your child.

62
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,700
What's going on exactly?

63
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Heavenly Monarch, are you referring to the lady from Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness?

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
That's right.

65
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,400
When I was ordered to eliminate the Fiery Golden Lion,

66
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,000
I suffered some injuries and was saved by her.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,800
The child in her womb was a payment in gratitude.

68
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,970
Since it was a payment in gratitude, it's not a big deal.

69
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,000
You are going to wear my robe in the future.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,600
It's not good to be blinded by affections.

71
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,600
As long as you remember this, I have nothing much to worry about.

72
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,800
But since she's pregnant with your child,

73
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,900
let her remain in Heaven then.

74
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:43,620
I think it's against the Heavenly Tribe's proprietaries for a mortal to remain in Heaven.

75
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,200
Why bother?

76
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,400
A child of the Heavenly family should stay in Heaven.

77
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,000
Being left in the wilderness is even more improper.

78
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,170
She's already in Nine Heavens.

79
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,700
Once you have recovered from your injuries and return from Long Sea,

80
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,600
then we can make other arrangements.

81
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,240
I will abide.

82
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
Heavenly Monarch, I have something to say.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,400
What do you want to say?

84
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,600
Although that woman is only a mortal,

85
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,600
she's pregnant with the Crown Prince's child.

86
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,200
I was thinking,

87
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,600
since you have decreed to let the mortal remain in Heaven,

88
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,300
why not issue another gracious decree to confer her as a side consort?

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,400
Side consort?

90
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,800
If the mother of the child has no title,

91
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,200
the baby might be mocked after he is born.

92
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,400
No.

93
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,800
She's a mortal woman. She cannot be the Crown Prince's side consort.

94
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,700
Correct. If this woman is made side consort so easily, it'll be a violation of the Heavenly Tribe's proprieties.

95
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,800
We will also be unable to explain to Bai Qian of Green Hill.

96
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,000
That is why Consort Su Jin's idea is inappropriate.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,700
Enough.

98
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,100
Since Ye Hua is nursing his wounds, I will not stay any longer.

99
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,700
Take good care of Ye Hua for me.

100
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,570
Don't worry, Father Monarch.

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,100
I watched Su Jin grow up,

102
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,800
but how come it's getting harder to understand what she is thinking?

103
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,000
Ye Hua, Father Monarch values you more than anyone.

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,800
You might be able to protect Su Su for now.

105
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,200
But if you want to keep her safe in the Heavenly Palace long-term,

106
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,060
it's absolutely impossible.

107
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,800
After she has safely given birth to the child,

108
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,960
I will have her drink the water from the River of Forgetfulness to forget me completely

109
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,020
and this relationship will end.

110
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,700
I thought you were the most sensible.

111
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,800
I never expected you to say such preposterous things.

112
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,900
Heavenly Monarch.

113
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,530
This copper mirror is an item the Crown Prince carried with him.

114
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,780
I picked it up on the day His Highness was injured.

115
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:57,510
Can you guess whose voice I heard from inside this?

116
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,930
It's the voice of the mortal woman.

117
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,310
Are you saying that this mirror is what she and Ye Hua used to communicate?

118
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,790
You know best the Crown Prince's personality.

119
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,440
If it's as His Highness said, that he does not value this mortal,

120
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,650
why would he bestow the copper mirror to her?

121
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:25,430
Heavenly Monarch, aren't you always worried that His Highness will be like His Second Highness?

122
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,000
So, what I said just now was in hope that the mortal will stay in the Heavenly Palace.

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,400
She will be easy to get rid of under our control.

124
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,880
All right.

125
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,520
Continue to keep an eye on this matter for me.

126
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,280
Yes.

127
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,850
Greetings, Heavenly Consort.

128
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,680
You are...?

129
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,040
I'm Lü Xiu, the second daughter of the Long Sea Water Monarch.

130
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,060
It's already late. Are you here for an urgent matter?

131
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,170
I came to deliver His Highness the Crown Prince some nourishing medicine.

132
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,370
This is the Water Spiritual Mushroom, a special product of Long Seas. It only grows once every 1,000 years.

133
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,990
It's very useful for the recovery of His Highness's wounds.

134
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,560
How about this? I will bring this in for you.

135
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,560
Here.

136
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,780
Your Highness Princess, you should go rest.

137
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,570
- But—
- What's wrong?

138
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,850
- Is there another urgent matter?
- I—

139
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,870
I'm taking my leave.

140
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,060
Your Highness, you still need to quietly recuperate for 20 days, so your wounds—

141
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,150
It's fine.

142
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,930
- Leave now.
- Yes.

143
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,520
Your Highness the Crown Prince. Third Highness.

144
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,030
Rise.

145
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,820
- Yes.
- Yes.

146
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,780
Is there any strange activity in the palace?

147
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,600
Your Third Highness, just yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in Zhaohua Palace.

148
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,860
That mortal lady almost... almost got hurt.

149
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,030
Why was there suddenly a fire?

150
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,260
I'm not sure, either.

151
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,030
I heard that it was initiated by the carriage creature of the Winged Monarch Li Jing.

152
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,840
It was an accident.

153
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,110
Leave for Heavenly Palace immediately.

154
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,710
Yes!

155
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,310
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

156
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,080
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

157
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,340
- Ye Hua!
- How presumptuous!

158
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:24,050
With your status, when you see the Crown Prince, how should you address him?

159
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:43,010
I, Su Su, greet Your Highness the Crown Prince.

160
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,510
Mother.

161
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,330
You're pregnant.

162
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,430
No need to make such grand bows the next time.

163
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,170
Leave.

164
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,640
Yes.

165
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,580
My Lady.

166
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,960
His Highness the Crown Prince returned to the palace this soon!?

167
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,930
Maybe, his injuries aren't as severe as the rumors say.

168
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,760
Heavenly Monarch has sealed the mouth of the Medicine King.

169
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,620
Also, Ye Hua has a personality of keeping everything in.

170
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,310
Whether he's really gravely injured or not,

171
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,930
only he and the people around him will know.

172
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,090
Emperor.

173
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:27,710
Fengjiu, I passed by Pure Wutong Palace that day and saw you coming out from there.

174
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,210
Huh?

175
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,020
Why would I go to Pure Wutong Palace?

176
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,880
In that area, it's either Pure Wutong Palace or Immortal Execution Platform.

177
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,320
Could it be you went to the Immortal Execution Platform to admire the moon?

178
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,180
Right. The moon was very pretty that night.

179
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,530
It made me remember Green Hill, so unconsciously, I walked to the Immortal Execution Platform.

180
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,410
You went to the Immortal Execution Platform to admire the moon?

181
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,990
Yes. The scenery was so pleasant that night.

182
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,080
The moonlight was also very, very good.

183
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,560
Then, I felt that being in the Nine Heavens was really great.

184
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,130
You can even see the moon so clearly from here.

185
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,180
The moon was so big. The moon—

186
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,900
Is that so?

187
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,570
If you like it, then go there frequently.

188
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,680
Thank you, Emperor.

189
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,840
What?

190
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,910
Si Ming.

191
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,650
I'm here.

192
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,420
Remember to remind her that Pure Wutong Palace isn't a peaceful place.

193
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,020
She better limit herself going there.

194
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,500
I understand.

195
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,160
Did I say anything wrong?

196
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,510
Hey.

197
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,300
Si Ming,

198
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,130
what place is the Immortal Execution Platform?

199
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,630
How come when I told Emperor that I went to the Immortal Execution Platform to admire the moon,

200
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,480
Emperor behaved strangely. Did I say anything wrong?

201
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,640
Young Highness, you've been living here in the Heavenly Palace for quite some time.

202
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,120
Didn't you hear anyone mention it?

203
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,690
- I never heard anyone mention it.
- That's understandable.

204
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,460
You live in the side palace for the divine maids.

205
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,850
Naturally, those people will never mention it.

206
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:42,210
For immortals, the Immortal Execution Platform has been an ominous place all these years.

207
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,790
A low-level immortal would not be able to use any of her powers if she stood there.

208
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,820
That's an ominous place.

209
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,530
What? Really?

210
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,140
You are not lying to me, right?

211
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,730
Usually, immortals would avoid that place.

212
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,620
Going to the Immortal Execution Platform to admire the moon?

213
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,040
Emperor was just too lazy to be bothered by you.

214
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,670
This Courtyard of Moonlight has been deserted for thousands of years.

215
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,820
We're only able to make it a bit cleaner after exhausting ourselves.

216
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,070
That's right. What's our future if we follow this woman?

217
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,590
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

218
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,750
Who told you to come here?

219
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:40,840
Your Highness, Consort Le Xu sent us here to attend to this newly arrived My Lady.

220
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,140
Here in Nine Heavens,

221
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,450
she hasn't been given any titles.

222
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,040
You are disobeying Heavenly rules.

223
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,770
Her Highness Le Xu is worried that since no one has lived in the Courtyard of Moonlight for thousands of years,

224
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,150
the divine aura might be too thin which is bad for a pregnant woman. Hence, she sent us—

225
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,310
- Leave now!
- Yes.

226
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,370
Ye Hua.

227
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,910
Were you seriously injured earlier?

228
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,540
- How's your injury?
- I'm fine.

229
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,050
How about you?

230
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,710
Where are you hurt? Are you all right?

231
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,020
Are you talking about this?

232
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,110
It's okay now.

233
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,060
The wound made by the Red Lotus Fire won't heal.

234
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,330
I can just cover it up with my sleeve.

235
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,170
Su Su,

236
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,170
I've caused you to suffer.

237
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,660
Now that I'm back in the palace, you can be at ease.

238
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,220
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

239
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,100
No wonder.

240
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,440
No wonder you never talked to me about your family before,

241
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,720
nor brought me to meet them.

242
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:24,390
Why did you never tell me that you were the crown prince of Nine Heavens?

243
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,240
Sorry.

244
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,870
If I had told you back then, it wouldn't have benefited you at all.

245
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,880
What should we do from now on?

246
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:44,080
From now on, in the Heavenly Palace, we must always be careful with our actions and speech.

247
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,430
In front of others, I must treat you coldly.

248
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,590
But you must believe me

249
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,900
that all these are to protect you.

250
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,790
Su Su,

251
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,570
I only wish that in the Pure Wutong Palace,

252
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,530
you can peacefully nurse your health

253
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,400
and safely deliver our child.

254
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,820
Remember, you mustn't have any interaction with anyone.

255
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,590
Nai Nai.

256
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,660
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

257
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,260
This is the divine maid that will attend to you from now on.

258
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,190
My Lady, my name is Nai Nai.

259
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,230
I'm a divine maid brought up here by His Highness from the divine mountain in the lower realm.

260
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,860
From now on... From now on, I will stay here to attend to you.

261
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:15,320
[Courtyard of Moonlight]

262
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,560
My Lady, I'll go prepare your dinner.

263
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:37,340
[Courtyard of Moonlight]

264
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,520
Did the Crown Prince really send you back?

265
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,180
Your Highness, the Crown Prince indeed sent us back.

266
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,320
Although she's a woman without any official title, she is bearing the child of the Crown Prince after all.

267
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,750
If no one attends to her, what if something bad happens to her?

268
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,390
On our way back here, we heard from servants in the palace of the Crown Prince

269
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,490
that His Highness chose a maid from his chamber palace,

270
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:11,280
who was just newly promoted here from the divine mountain in the lower realm to attend to that new lady.

271
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,700
A maid who's new here doesn't know the rules of our palace.

272
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,510
How could she attend to her properly?

273
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,110
Her Highness, people from the Pure Wutong Palace said that when His Highness returned,

274
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,950
he casually chose this maid from his chamber servants to serve her.

275
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,660
That maid doesn't have any experience.

276
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,720
I fear that she doesn't even know the palace rules.

277
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,720
Leave.

278
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,790
Yes.

279
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,980
Your Highness, you look troubled.

280
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,540
Heavenly Monarch hates the fact that the princes overly value affection.

281
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:59,420
What happened to the Second Prince is still being kept silent.

282
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:05,210
A distinguished prince of the Heavenly Tribe got demoted to the Northern Seas to become a Water Monarch.

283
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,950
I'm worried that he will follow the steps of the Second Prince,

284
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:16,610
and end up with a farce of only wanting a woman and not his throne.

285
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,030
Heavenly Monarch said that His Highness the Crown Prince still hasn't requested to marry this mortal.

286
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:28,590
Even if he does, Heavenly Monarch won't approve it.

287
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,750
That Su Su is a mortal to start with.

288
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,270
After giving birth, she will naturally go back to the mortal realm.

289
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,090
I'm just worried that if this leaks out,

290
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:46,710
it will more or less affect His Highness and invite discontent from Green Hill.

291
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,330
Heavenly Monarch also considered Green Hill.

292
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:53,150
He has decreed that this must be suppressed.

293
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,260
Pure Wutong Palace has hundreds of courtyards.

294
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,810
There are so many divine maids serving there.

295
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:06,060
As long as the subordinates don't discuss it, no one would know that Courtyard of Moonlight exists in Pure Wutong Palace,

296
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,900
and that a mortal is living inside it.

297
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,410
That would be for the best.

298
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:21,910
Although Crown Prince didn't put this woman to his heart, she's still his woman after all.

299
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,850
You grew up by my side.

300
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,540
You know the customs and etiquette of the Nine Heavens the most.

301
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,390
If you have time, go teach her for me.

302
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,220
I understand.

303
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,760
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

304
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,800
- Rise.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

305
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:55,790
Your Highness, we saw you getting hacked by the leader of the merpeople in that battle.

306
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,290
You really had scared all of us.

307
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:02,550
That's right. Seeing how you're now full of energy,

308
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,930
you don't seem to have suffered any injuries at all.

309
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,210
Could it be that it was just a strategy,

310
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,420
so you could drive up the military morale and make us completely eliminate the merpeople?

311
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,630
I heard that Winged Monarch Li Jing submitted a memorial,

312
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,340
saying that someone has successively taken three of our cities in the Northern Wilderness.

313
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:27,140
Your Highness Crown Prince, that is indeed true.

314
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,940
Just as one trouble is pacified, another one arises.

315
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,950
When Li Jing was supported by Heavenly Monarch to the Winged Monarch throne,

316
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,500
his eldest brother Li Yuan got dragged into the Land of Extreme Coldness.

317
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,960
To everyone's surprise, Li Yuan suddenly escaped and started an uprising.

318
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,520
In short, all of these are disasters brought about by that great war 70,000 years ago.

319
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,820
[Pure Wutong Palace]

320
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:57,280
Everyone, you all experienced the great war 70,000 years ago.

321
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,890
Please slowly narrate it to me.

322
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,720
Please sit down.

323
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,470
Yes, Your Highness.

324
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,320
Nai Nai.

325
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,400
My Lady.

326
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,600
Does His Highness have other noble ladies in his palace?

327
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,370
You're the only one in Pure Wutong Palace.

328
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,830
Is he... usually this busy?

329
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:32,660
I heard that before, His Highness the Crown Prince would handle official documents until late at night.

330
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,620
My Lady, are you thirsty? I will get you a cup of tea.

331
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:40,550
Wrong. You are pregnant. You can't have tea.

332
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,490
I'll pour you some water instead. Pour you some water.

333
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,980
My Lady, what's wrong?

334
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,440
Have some water.

335
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,610
Nai Nai?

336
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,770
My Lady, someone, who claims he's your friend, is here to see you.

337
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,310
I don't have any friends in the Heavenly Palace.

338
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,520
It's a man. He looks like a nobleman.

339
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,670
- A nobleman?
- Yes.

340
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:58,500
After you left yesterday, my shaman said you are with child and it's very unstable, so I came to visit you.

341
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,790
How did you know My Lady is at Courtyard of Moonlight?

342
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,170
- Her Lady?
- That's right.

343
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,380
Lady Su Su is His Highness the Crown Prince's...

344
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,930
I mean she's the only noble lady at Pure Wutong Palace.

345
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,690
I didn't expect that it's only been a day,

346
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,350
and you have already married into Pure Wutong Palace.

347
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,370
How come His Highness the Crown Prince didn't send out the wedding announcement?

348
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,390
He... He was seriously injured and just returned.

349
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,310
Please let me examine My Lady's pulse one more time.

350
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:40,680
I don't know if that's within the rules here.

351
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,300
It's just a pulse reading.

352
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,670
It shouldn't break the rules.

353
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,020
Winged Monarch, you must be mistaken.

354
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,360
There are so many rules at the Heavenly Palace.

355
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,130
If we let the shaman from the Winged Realm examine a noble lady of Pure Wutong Palace,

356
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,600
people might think that the Medicine King of the Heavenly Palace is useless.

357
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,670
It's better for me to summon Medicine King to examine Su Su.

358
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,460
And you are...?

359
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,770
Winged Monarch, Her Highness is Heavenly Monarch's new heavenly consort, Su Jin.

360
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,210
My apologies.

361
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:21,040
It's fine. I just saw the fire kirin by the door and guessed the Winged Monarch must be inside.

362
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,710
Since Consort Su Jin has made it clear,

363
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,310
I will not do more than what's necessary.

364
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,290
Farewell.

365
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,280
Your Highness.

366
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,450
My Lady, quickly make your salute.

367
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,250
Your Highness.

368
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,790
You are His Highness the Crown Prince's woman, so you only need to salute me in front of other people.

369
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,930
There is no need to stand on ceremony in private.

370
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,650
Thank you, Your Highness.

371
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,850
Since you are pregnant, you must be more careful.

372
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,620
Have a seat.

373
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,950
Your Mighty Monarch.

374
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,020
Where have you been?

375
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,760
I went to Pure Wutong Palace.

376
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,460
Did you go to apologize to His Highness the Crown Prince?

377
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,770
His Highness the Crown Prince was not in the palace.

378
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:29,990
I took the chance to pay a visit to the woman from yesterday.

379
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,910
The woman from yesterday?

380
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,250
You've only met her once.

381
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,640
Why did you pay her a special visit?

382
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,870
Don't forget, she is His Highness the Crown Prince's woman.

383
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,700
You are thinking too much.

384
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,680
I only feel guilty that my fire kirin injured her.

385
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,650
I brought the shaman to see her.

386
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,490
The Heavenly Palace has the Medicine King. Why would she need our shaman?

387
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,110
Enough.

388
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,760
I have no notion for this woman.

389
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,680
Speak no more of it.

390
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:07,930
Mighty Monarch, I was just afraid you'd offend His Highness the Crown Prince.

391
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,660
That's why I was so concerned.

392
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,640
I know.

393
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,320
Let's not talk about it anymore.

394
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,550
The religious assembly is about to start.

395
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,950
I'll take you around.

396
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,450
- What are you doing?
- Winged Monarch, you are an honored guest,

397
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,340
but Her Highness is a traitor of the Heavenly Tribe.

398
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:44,680
Please go back inside your guest room to rest until you return to the Winged Realm.

399
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,080
You cannot confine me like this.

400
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,770
I'm the Winged Monarchess.

401
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,830
Please return inside, Your Highness.

402
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,150
How dare you treat me like this?

403
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,310
Go inside to rest.

404
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,050
There is a banquet tonight. I must attend.

405
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,430
Wait for me in the guest room.

406
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:07,720
Mighty Monarch, I'm the Winged Monarchess and your wife.

407
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,860
If they treat me like this, isn't it an insult to you?

408
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,900
So what if it's an insult to me?

409
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,090
The peace of the Winged Tribe is most important.

410
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,300
Go back inside.

411
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,920
When you were brought up to the Nine Heavens by Heavenly Monarch,

412
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,560
I had wanted to plea for leniency for you.

413
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,070
But the Heavenly Palace's rules are strict.

414
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:40,790
Fortunately, Consort Le Xu protected you.

415
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,880
Don't be afraid.

416
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,980
Once you've given birth to the child, everything will get better.

417
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,530
The name of this courtyard, "Courtyard of Moonlight" does sound nice.

418
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:08,500
But why is the interior so simple and crude?

419
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:16,080
The ink and brush are not ones Ye Hua likes, either.

420
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,080
Did Ye Hua not say to have them changed?

421
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,970
These were arranged by Nai Nai.

422
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,540
Ye Hua has not noticed.

423
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,570
That's true, too.

424
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,410
He nearly lost his life in the war against the Merpeople Tribe.

425
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,290
He just returned and is busy day and night with official matters.

426
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,900
Why would he pay attention to these things?

427
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,680
He almost lost his life?

428
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,210
Didn't you see his wound?

429
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,260
It is an injury caused by the Soul Severing Blade.

430
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,400
I was also at Long Sea at the time.

431
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,810
I was afraid he would die, so I stayed by his side for several days and nights.

432
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,530
Yet, I dared not look at his wound.

433
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:02,030
He has always been one to keep everything to himself.

434
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:05,300
Of course, he wouldn't say how severe his injuries are.

435
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,800
In the past, when we would play around,

436
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,990
he wouldn't say anything if he got hurt.

437
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,890
Is that so?

438
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:16,230
That's right. He likes to keep things to himself.

439
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,470
Don't think too much to it.

440
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:22,200
He's always been like this since he was young.

441
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,330
Ever since he was young?

442
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,470
I grew up with Ye Hua.

443
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:34,930
Later on, after I married Heavenly Monarch, he hasn't spoken to me often anymore.

444
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,630
Let's not talk about this.

445
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:48,150
Lord of Lingbao is hosting a religious assembly these days.

446
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,780
Immortals of all the realms will be there.

447
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,010
He is also the senior brother of the Crown Prince,

448
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:55,780
so His Highness will naturally attend.

449
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,860
Also, those who have ranks in the palace have also received an invitation.

450
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,980
Would you like to take a look?

451
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:08,670
Without Ye Hua's permission, I cannot leave this place.

452
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:12,440
If you leave with me, no one will block your way.

453
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,220
It was Consort Le Xu who had me come here to take you around.

454
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:25,290
Younger Sister, since you are already in His Highness the Crown Prince's palace,

455
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,020
you must learn to handle these things.

456
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,210
Consort Le Xu?

457
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,550
Consort Le Xu also knows that Ye Hua cannot spend much time with you and was afraid you'd be bored,

458
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,190
so she told me to take you to the assembly.

459
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:48,680
Younger Sister, since you are already living in the Crown Prince's palace,

460
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,260
you should think of yourself as part of the Heavenly Tribe.

461
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,980
The Heavenly Tribe is the master of all the realms.

462
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,220
He's the ruler. Everyone else is a subject.

463
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,830
If you are even afraid to walk outside,

464
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:05,990
in the future, when you accompany Ye Hua to receive bows from other immortals,

465
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,590
wouldn't you be even more flustered?

466
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,850
I don't understand the rules of the Heavenly Tribe.

467
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:20,190
If I say something wrong in the future, please teach me.

468
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,550
All right. Don't worry.

469
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:27,240
I will surely teach you properly so that Heavenly Monarch will be satisfied with you.

470
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,230
Thank you, Older Sister.

471
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,410
That's better.

472
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,520
This fan seems like a weapon of Kunlun Void.

473
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,080
Kunlun Fan of Yuqing?

474
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:52,460
This fan is fake, but in the past, I did have the opportunity to have the real Kunlun Fan of Yuqing.

475
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,500
In the Mortal Realm, someone had tried to trick me for it.

476
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,350
Fortunately, I later gave the fan to someone and I got this fake one.

477
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:07,130
Since it is a fake, don't carry it with you so as to avoid attracting unwanted attention.

478
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,760
I don't bring it around with me.

479
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,630
I leave it in my chamber.

480
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,680
Nai Nai, please put the fan away.

481
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,530
Yes.

482
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,280
Be careful.

483
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,400
You are pregnant after all.

484
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,100
You can rest assured and leave Your Lady with me.

485
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,010
Yes.

”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

487
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:19,800
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

488
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,440
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

489
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,710
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

490
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:37,110
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

491
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:41,030
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

492
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:46,380
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

493
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:51,500
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

494
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:59,930
♫ All are just illusions ♫

495
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:05,380
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

496
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:10,630
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

497
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:15,010
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

498
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:21,410
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

499
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:26,740
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

500
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:31,870
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

501
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,710
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

502
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:44,240
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

503
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:55,870
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

504
00:44:55,870 --> 00:45:01,340
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

505
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:05,730
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

506
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:11,900
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

507
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:17,220
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

508
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:22,570
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

509
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:25,150
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

510
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:34,360
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

511
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:46,500
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
