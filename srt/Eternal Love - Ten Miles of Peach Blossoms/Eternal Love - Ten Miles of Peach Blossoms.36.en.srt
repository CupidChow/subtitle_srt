”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,490
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,010
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,650
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,930
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,370
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,140
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,770
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,280
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,860
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,420
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,810
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,400
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,900
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,560
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,990
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,500
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,040
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,030
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,800
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,270
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,760
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,070
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,840
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,550
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,890
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,000
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,830
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,990
[Episode 36]

31
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,870
But don't be scared,

32
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,750
only Xin Nu and I know about this.

33
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,900
Let's find a way to help you quickly become the crown prince's woman.

34
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,430
Let's use this celebration to cover this situation.

35
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,050
- Is this true?
- Of course.

36
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,620
I sincerely like you, so, of course, I'll help you. Don't worry.

37
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,010
Okay.

38
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,020
No matter what, the problem has been solved.

39
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,600
You can leave now.

40
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,230
Thank you, High Goddess, for saving my son.

41
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,880
I will definitely return the favor one day.

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,770
That's not needed.

43
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,040
This is really because of the master-servant affection between me and Shao Xin.

44
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,450
It has nothing to do with you.

45
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,800
If you came, you probably wouldn't have been able to enter my fox den.

46
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,400
Leave now.

47
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,370
I will take my leave.

48
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,420
Your Majesty, you can't leave me. Your Majesty...

49
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,570
I won't leave you.

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,170
If you leave me...

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,200
I've embarrassed myself again.

52
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,790
Your Majesty...

53
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,530
Her Majesty and the others have been waiting.

54
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,610
I should--

55
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,960
If I tell you to stay, then stay.

56
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,830
How about I promote you to the rank of Virtuous Consort?

57
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,890
Your Majesty... that's against etiquette.

58
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,850
I've done many things against etiquette in my harem.

59
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,550
What is your name?

60
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,590
Young Jiu.

61
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,120
Then from now on, I will call you Jiu'er. Okay?

62
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,410
The sun has set.

63
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,980
That girl should be back to normal.

64
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,380
Come.

65
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,420
Daoist Priest, do you want your dinner?

66
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,340
- Take me to Lotus Courtyard.
- Yes.

67
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,490
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

68
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,190
Teacher, there was something I wanted to talk to you about.

69
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:53,200
Can you come stand with me over there?

70
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,700
Teacher, look.

71
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,710
Teacher, look. Isn't he cute?

72
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,400
Immortal-Locking Bell?

73
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,430
My previous teacher gave it to me.

74
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,510
She had no reason to keep it.

75
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,570
Now, I am able to use it on Little Dearie.

76
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,260
Pity, the one you're holding already has an owner.

77
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,390
If you keep it for yourself, you might face future trouble once its owner starts looking for it.

78
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,160
That's why I wanted to talk to you about it.

79
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,580
You are a master that's beyond this world. Can you go ask them if I can have Little Dearie?

80
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,180
I'm just a mortal and my lifespan is limited.

81
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,390
Once I die, I will surely return Little Dearie to its owner.

82
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,260
High Goddess, don't! Please don't!

83
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,260
Look! Little Dearie's so happy hearing that I want to raise him.

84
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,210
Since I'm your teacher, I'll help you. Okay.

85
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,480
I'll help you inform its owner.

86
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,800
It shouldn't be a big issue for it to stay.

87
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,290
Really?

88
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,770
Teacher, you've really agreed to my request?

89
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,030
I'm not dreaming, right?

90
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,080
What are you two doing?

91
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,450
The night is quite dark and the wind is strong.

92
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,470
You two better come down now; or else, you might scare them.

93
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,470
Real immortals? I actually am seeing real immortals?

94
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,190
This is the first time I'm seeing one.

95
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,550
Did you two visit this late night

96
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,880
because the prestige of my father's benevolent governance has reached Heaven?

97
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,680
I'm afraid to disappoint you, Crown Prince.

98
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,180
I'm here to pick up my wife.

99
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,500
Pick... Pick me up?

100
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,240
Now that I think about it, it's indeed time for me to say farewell to you.

101
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,290
Pick up your wife?

102
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,410
Great Lady, don't worry. I just removed his memory.

103
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,550
Thanks to your clever plan, Yuan Zhen's fortune has been completed,

104
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,000
but Emperor's fortune has been slightly changed.

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,420
Could you lead the way?

106
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,790
I need to find Her Young Highness Fengjiu to help me.

107
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,940
If you ask her to lead the way, you won't even find Fengjiu by morning.

108
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,140
It's better that you ask a tutelary.

109
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,210
Immortal Monarch.

110
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,930
- Take us to Lotus Courtyard.
- Yes.

111
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,650
Wait.

112
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,340
My powers have been sealed.

113
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:59,200
Star Monarch, please use your magic to send my disciple back to his bedchamber.

114
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,050
Qian Qian, you're treating my cousin well.

115
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,910
He's my only disciple.

116
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,760
Then, he can't call me cousin anymore.

117
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,470
He has to call me "Teacher's husband."

118
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,650
Why are you trying to take advantage of him?

119
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,870
Is it because he dallied with your side consort?

120
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,330
Are you holding a grudge?

121
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,940
If you hadn't mentioned it, I almost forgot why he was sent down here.

122
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,450
He dallied with a side consort who's not a side consort, but he was sent to spend 60 years down here.

123
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:40,330
So, how would he be punished for holding my wife's hand in front of me?

124
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,490
Let's go.

125
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,600
Earlier, you said you were here to look for your wife.

126
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,810
Why then are you rushing to see Fengjiu?

127
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,090
Si Ming is here to fix Emperor Dong Hua's fate, so I came along to visit you.

128
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,510
To see me?

129
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,320
Today, His Highness called me in the middle of the Peach Meeting to come down here,

130
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,280
so we could see how you ordered someone to push Emperor into the water.

131
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,390
If Emperor finds out in the future, he might send me down here, too.

132
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,310
If that happens, His Highness the Crown Prince will surely plead on your behalf.

133
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,820
Young Highness Fengjiu and Emperor's fates have intersected.

134
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,880
This is the reason why I'm asking for your help, High Goddess.

135
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,640
What does this have to do with Fengjiu?

136
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,610
Please take a walk with me.

137
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,580
You'll understand soon. This way, please.

138
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,280
Your Highness the Crown Prince. High Goddess. Star Monarch.

139
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,310
This is Lotus Courtyard.

140
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,390
I will leave first.

141
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,520
Go ahead.

142
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,410
Since Your Highness the Crown Prince had removed High Goddess' magic seal earlier,

143
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,080
let's go in invisibly.

144
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,010
Yu Dang, we have guests. Serve them teas.

145
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,130
Your Highness, snap out of your daze.

146
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,790
Aunt! I embarrassed myself in the morning again.

147
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,950
It's good you're borrowing Noble Lady Chen's body.

148
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:45,260
It's not Green Hill you embarrassed so I won't tell your father.

149
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,250
But I ruined Emperor's fate.

150
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,490
It has happened. It's fate.

151
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,920
Why is His Highness the Crown Prince here?

152
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,520
Does my father know, too?

153
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,590
It's because Star Monarch Si Ming and I learned that the plan had deviated, so we rushed here.

154
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,920
No one knows besides us.

155
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,620
Don't worry.

156
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,200
Aunt, what do I do?

157
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,310
The emperor held onto my hand when he was passed out all day.

158
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,900
When he woke up, he kept looking at me.

159
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,080
Deep love was spilling from his eyes.

160
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,610
Did you see wrong?

161
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,850
Maybe it's because he was in the water for too long.

162
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,900
But he said that he's also promoting my consort rank.

163
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,890
You're his savior.

164
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,620
That's normal.

165
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,070
Are you saying the emperor has fallen for you?

166
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,710
Si Ming! What kind of fate did you write?

167
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,010
Since he's fallen for you,

168
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,260
I can only ask you to help him finish this act.

169
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,760
What act?

170
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,020
Originally, this love was between Emperor and the maiden who fell into the water.

171
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,570
But now, I'll have to ask you to replace her.

172
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,450
Instead of helping me think of a way to get out of this,

173
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,310
you're asking me to stay and create his tribulation?

174
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,810
Such a waste of our friendship.

175
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,550
Young Highness, you're the one who messed up his fate.

176
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,020
I don't care. I don't want to go to his Early Dawn Palace anymore, anyway.

177
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,710
Actually, this wasn't her fault.

178
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,490
It must be because I changed Yuan Zhen's fate that it became like this.

179
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,770
Since Young Highness has been dragged into this,

180
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:38,060
if Emperor's fate gets greatly changed, Young Highness will surely suffer some side effects.

181
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,120
The method I mentioned earlier is the only way

182
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,010
that can allow Emperor to go through his love tribulation and prevent Young Highness from suffering side effects.

183
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,520
Seems like this is the only way.

184
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,400
Then...

185
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,840
- Then, what am I supposed to help him with?
- That's easy.

186
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,570
You just need to let Emperor taste some sweetness first and obtain his sincere love.

187
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,870
Once he's already fallen deeply in love with you,

188
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,110
just take that sincere love away and repeatedly trample on it.

189
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,460
You want me to trample on his sincere love?

190
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,490
I will also hand you some novels

191
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,740
that can teach you how to trample on a person's sincere love.

192
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,110
Aunt.

193
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,760
Your Highness the Crown Prince...

194
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,460
What kind of debt am I repaying?

195
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,510
Greetings, Your Majesty.

196
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,070
I've removed your Two Lives Spell.

197
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,320
Just slowly repay our debt of kindness.

198
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,700
Your Majesty.

199
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,400
You're not sleeping yet?

200
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,500
I can't sleep.

201
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,280
Me neither.

202
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,100
I wanted to see you.

203
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,570
If you had fallen asleep, I wanted to just stand here and look at the place where you sleep.

204
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,890
The dew is quite strong on this late night.

205
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,010
Your Majesty, please come in first.

206
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,700
I have some things to take care of.

207
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,320
Go back to Green Hill first.

208
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,670
I'll go see you in a few days.

209
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,220
High Goddess, I hope you don't mind. We had sneaked out of the Peach Meeting.

210
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,110
We still need to rush back.

211
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,170
I'll take my leave.

212
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,150
Jiu'er, are you still not sleeping?

213
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,750
It might be because I got severely traumatized today.

214
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,810
I can't sleep.

215
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,800
Then let's play chess all night.

216
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,060
I don't know how to play.

217
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,330
Do as you wish.

218
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,840
I will let you win.

219
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,480
You just need to let Emperor taste some sweetness first

220
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,920
and obtain his sincere love.

221
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,210
Once he's fallen deeply in love with you,

222
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:23,950
take that sincere love out and repeatedly trample on it.

223
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,790
Sweetness?

224
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,120
Back in the Heavenly Palace,I wasn't able to obtain his sincere love.

225
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,100
So now, what should I do?

226
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,350
Jiu'er,

227
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,950
when did you enter the palace?

228
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,380
When I was 17.

229
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,850
Earlier, while in my bedchamber,

230
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,360
I tried to recall my first meeting with you,

231
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,470
but I couldn't come up with anything.

232
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,730
Although you're now a Noble Lady and you've attended to me before,

233
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:11,020
I'm unable to clearly recall that night you'd become my wife.

234
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,020
Do you bear any grudge against me?

235
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,890
I dare not.

236
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,850
Your Majesty has so many state affairs to take care of every day.

237
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,980
I dare not bear a grudge.

238
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,970
What are you looking at?

239
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,000
The empress told me that I took an interest in you at first

240
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,970
because you were good at chess.

241
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,380
What?

242
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,380
You forgot how to play after falling in the water?

243
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,460
I think the empress was mistaken.

244
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:47,250
I'm good at cooking, not chess.

245
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:55,400
Then, can I eat your cooking tomorrow morning?

246
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,350
Does Your Majesty really wish to stay here tonight?

247
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,460
Am I not allowed?

248
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,150
No.

249
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,050
Are you blaming me for being cold to you previously?

250
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,110
Your Majesty is busy with state affairs every day. How could I dare—

251
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,640
Is that all you can say?

252
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,040
What do I do now?

253
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,190
Although the culture in Green Hill has always been simple and honest,

254
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,480
and if they have mutual affection, they can just be together.

255
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,620
But... if Father learns that Emperor and I...

256
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,050
I'll give you back a wedding ceremony.

257
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:36,340
Let's just follow the ordinary folk customs and I'll marry you again.

258
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,990
[Celebration]

259
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,950
♫ My countenance when I met you ♫

260
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:13,970
♫ Was as cool breeze and bright moon in this seemingly familiar mundane world ♫

261
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:19,520
♫ I look around for your lingering to like the stranded time ♫

262
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,690
♫ It’s a reunion but also as we first met ♫

263
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:31,330
♫ I sleep deep in inseparable love which has your yearning ♫

264
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:37,610
♫ This warmth spreads in my palm ♫

265
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:43,010
♫ In the boundless wilderness, who has forgotten the time?  ♫

266
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:50,050
♫ Half inexperienced and half innocent ♫

267
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,850
Your Majesty, we are acting against palace rules.

268
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,670
If Her Majesty Empress learns about it, she might punish me.

269
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,350
♫ I foresaw all of your joy and sadness ♫

270
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:16,720
♫ Three thousand flowers just to remember you ♫

271
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:32,710
♫ My countenance when I met you ♫

272
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:38,830
In this palace, no one can make things difficult for you anymore.

273
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:44,770
♫ Counting years and months only to see your face when the flower blossoms ♫

274
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:50,610
♫ Even if we miss out on each other over and over again ♫

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:56,390

♫ Three thousand flowers just to remember you ♫

277
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:09,170
[Celebration]

278
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,960
Your Highness the Crown Prince. Third Highness.

279
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,930
Your conversation with Bai Fengjiu was full of loopholes.

280
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,820
Are you hiding something from me?

281
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,900
Since you'd noticed, I'll tell you.

282
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,340
Emperor Dong Hua went to the Mortal Realm this time to pay back an emotional debt to Bai Fengjiu.

283
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,420
Emotional debt?

284
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,330
Bai Fengjiu developed deep affection towards Emperor Dong Hua while in Early Dawn Palace.

285
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,850
However, Emperor and Bai Fengjiu are not fated to be together.

286
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:51,880
So, he went to the Mortal Realm to give her an experience.

287
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,590
But this is just a short fate for a lifetime in the mundane world.

288
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,760
There will not be a good ending.

289
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,420
Hence, this time, not only did you fulfill the wish of Qian Qian to help Yuan Zhen,

290
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,470
you also fulfilled the wish of Emperor Dong Hua and Bai Fengjiu to go through a love tribulation together.

291
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,450
Thank goodness Great Lady acted on her plan.

292
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,730
Otherwise, I'd have to find a different way to make the mortal Emperor fall in love with Bai Fengjiu.

293
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,350
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

294
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:28,190
I found what you wanted me to investigate, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

295
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,780
Speak.

296
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,040
Those immortals that got attacked don't have much in common.

297
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,840
Other than... they are all of the High Immortal rank.

298
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,320
High Immortal rank...

299
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,660
Great Lady, you're back!

300
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,090
Mi Gu, you seem so carefree in the few days I was gone.

301
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,990
Didn't you just come back yesterday?

302
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,510
You even accomplished a big task.

303
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,130
Why're you talking as if you just got back?

304
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,020
I was in the Mortal Realm yesterday.

305
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,570
When did I come back?

306
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:13,970
What? No, you did come back.

307
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,910
It seems that you also told me to stay in the fox den.

308
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,550
That I'm not allowed to go anywhere.

309
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,950
Who cast an Enchanting Spell on you?

310
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,630
Enchanting Spell?

311
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,570
No one.

312
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,650
- What happened?
- Great Lady! Bad news!

313
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:39,730
You're finally back! Xuan Nü pretended to be you and took High God Mo Yuan's body!

314
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,090
She even took His Young Highness!

315
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,550
This fan.

316
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:14,060
I'm afraid you'll have to experience blood again today.

317
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,000
Great Lady!

318
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,760
Why am I so stupid? How could I have sent her off alone?

319
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,190
What do I do?

320
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,820
His Highness the Crown Prince! Right!

321
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,650
His Highness the Crown Prince!

322
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,780
High Immortals of the Heavenly Tribe have successively been murdered.

323
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,350
It must be related to that sickly child that Winged Monarchess gave birth to.

324
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,140
What?!

325
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,030
This is a sinister type of magic.

326
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,130
In ancient times, there was a woman named Jie Yu,

327
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,120
who successively gave birth to sickly babies because she committed too many murders.

328
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,520
She then devised a plan.

329
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:58,050
First, she killed a high immortal, and then she turned the divine body into pellets for her child.

330
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,910
The child was recovered then.

331
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,490
How could such an evil method exist?

332
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:09,570
Being able to order around so many puppets and being bold enough to kill high immortals,

333
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,320
I doubt it's Winged Monarch Li Jing.

334
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,490
It is the woman who betrayed Kunlun Void and Heavenly Tribes 70,000 years ago,

335
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,720
Xuan Nü.

336
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,140
If it's Winged Monarchess' doing, then Li Jing must be involved, too.

337
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,640
I'll go tell Father Monarch now.

338
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,410
Third Uncle, please wait.

339
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,350
This is a matter of two tribes.

340
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,710
We can't move on my guess alone.

341
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:35,470
I should pay a visit to the Grand Purple Palace to confirm for myself.

342
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,540
Okay. Let's wait until the Peach Meeting is over, and we'll go together.

343
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,920
The palace entrance that was heavily guarded 70,000 years ago is empty today.

344
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,090
Xuan Nü, you're inviting me in.

345
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:07,420
Your Highness, Mi Gu of Green Hill requests a meeting.

346
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,250
- Bring him here.
- Yes.

347
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,520
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

348
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,170
Please help my Great Lady, Your Highness the Crown Prince!

349
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,010
She went to Grand Purple Palace alone!

350
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,710
- What did you say?!
- Winged Monarchess took High God Mo Yuan's body and His Young Highness.

351
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,680
Great Lady got angry and charged over there. Your Highness the Crown Prince!

352
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,720
Who is this tree sprite?

353
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,200
How dare he barge into the Peach Meeting?

354
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,530
No sense of propriety.

355
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,460
See? For that woman,

356
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,420
His Highness the Crown Prince is willing to ignore the Heavenly Tribe's rules.

357
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,740
If you do enter Pure Wutong Palace in the future,

358
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,980
you cannot act like this.

359
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,630
I understand.

360
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,990
Kunlun Fan of Yuqing. Go back now!

361
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,590
Qian Qian, how have you been these 70,000 years?

362
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:38,100
When His Mighty Monarch said Si Yin is a woman of the Fox Tribe,

363
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,620
I knew it was you.

364
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:45,280
When I first saw you in Kunlun Void as Si Yin, I was very surprised

365
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,960
because you looked more like Qian Qian than I do.

366
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,970
You're saying you look like me.

367
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,680
Have you forgotten what you originally looked like?

368
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,960
Good thing, High God Zhe Yan of Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms has been quite idle lately.

369
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,760
Why not have him come help you recall?

370
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,610
No matter what, I will take your life today.

371
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,650
That way, no one can look like me anymore.

372
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:28,820
Yesterday, I got Mo Yuan's divine body and your son.

373
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,470
I knew you would come to find me,

374
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,510
so I've been waiting.

375
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,560
You've preserved Mo Yuan's body well.

376
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,660
I'm so happy

377
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,730
that my son can receive High God Mo Yuan's spirit.

378
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:57,130
Based on this merit of yours, I'll let them give you a quick death.

379
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,670
That depends on if you have the ability to.

380
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:25,020
Since her eyes are bad, she fears light.

381
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,450
I've really been blessed today.

382
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,820
It hurts to see you with so many wounds.

383
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,410
Who are you going to ask to come save you now?

384
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:24,430
Since we're in this situation, I'll tell you the truth.

385
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:31,800
I used your face back then to make His Mighty Monarch fall in love with me.

386
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,300
What does it matter if you have my face?

387
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,210
You are just deceiving yourself and everyone else!

388
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,750
I loved His Mighty Monarch for so many years,

389
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,510
yet he can't forget about you.

390
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,370
I'll take your life today.

391
00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:00,000
And I'll be the only one to have this face from now on.

392
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,810
His Mighty Monarch'll naturally protect me forever.

393
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,160
I'm telling you right now, Xuan Nü,

394
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,040
even if I close my eyes,

395
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,460
I can kill all your useless people.

396
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,780
Kill her!

397
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,000
Qian Qian.

398
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:06,410
I wouldn't be this injured if you came just an hour earlier.

399
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,050
I'm sorry. I'm late.

400
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,680
Tell me.

401
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,880
Who hurt you?

402
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,620
I've killed the ones who injured me.

403
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,730
She's the only one left.

404
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,420
Do you need my help? Or will you do it yourself?

405
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,550
She insulted my teacher and harmed my family.

406
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,110
I want to personally end her.

407
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:04,150
- Ah Yin!
- Mighty Monarch!

408
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,600
I'm Xuan Nü.

409
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,780
- Why do you look like Ah Yin?
- Identical to her, right?

410
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:15,370
Mighty Monarch, now we just need to kill Bai Qian, that lowlife,

411
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:19,960
and I will be the only with this face.

412
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,320
If you like it, you can look at me all day

413
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,510
and I'll always stay by your side.

414
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,360
What's going on?

415
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:36,620
That woman stole my teacher and your son.

416
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,630
He's also your son.

417
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,620
Son?

418
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,910
Mighty Monarch, our son will recover soon.

419
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,400
Really!

420
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,320
Look. Look at Mo Yuan.

421
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,650
Let's cultivate him into a divine pellet.

422
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:54,460
Mighty Monarch, you were once jealous of Mo Yuan. Right?

423
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,380
You don't have to be like this from now on.

424
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,710
Our son will have Mo Yuan's spirit soon.

425
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,710
Shut up.

426
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,470
Did I say something wrong?

427
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,110
Before, you didn't give Bai Qian that Jaded Soul,

428
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:11,110
wasn't it because you envied Mo Yuan?

429
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,160
Don't you know?

430
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,870
She is Immortal Monarch Si Yin.

431
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:22,780
I'm warning you, my teacher's body is priceless.

432
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,660
He's received 70,000 years of my heart's blood.

433
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,020
Your son might not be able to handle it.

434
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,300
Heart's blood?

435
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,210
Don't tell me you—

436
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,150
Li Jing, let's put aside your past for now.

437
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:44,030
I want to ask you... How do you want this debt be paid?

438
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:47,150
Do you want it settled privately or publicly?

439
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,410
So what if it's publicly or privately?

440
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:55,320
Privately, you are to punish this Winged Monarchess who thinks too highly of herself

441
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,670
by skinning and pulling out her tendons to vent my anger.

442
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:04,090
Publicly, the soldiers of the Heavenly Tribe hasn't been in a war for several years.

443
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,910
They're eager to.

444
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:13,230
We can use this chance to see which tribe has trained its soldiers better.

445
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,560
Mighty Monarch!

446
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,620
Are you really going to strictly punish me?

447
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,130
You won't, right?

448
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:29,950
Have you forgotten what I've done for you?

449
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:34,770
If it were not for me, would you be the monarch today?

450
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,060
He wouldn't dare send his troops. He wouldn't dare.

451
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,370
Don't think I don't know.

452
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,920
You don't dare send troops.

453
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,180
You don't have the power.

454
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,750
You're just a crown prince of Heavenly Tribes.

455
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:57,510
The Heavenly Tribe won't send troops for a woman.

456
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,690
It's not just for a woman.

457
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,920
Mo Yuan is a respected High God in the Heavenly Tribe,

458
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,250
Bai Qian is the future Heavenly Monarchess,

459
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:11,640
and Ah Li is my heir.

460
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,310
The three of them are suffering such humiliation in your Grand Purple Palace.

461
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:22,070
Tell me. Would the Heavenly Soldiers let this pass?

462
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:32,850
Xuan Nü has been acting crazy even before this.

463
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,110
Or else, she wouldn't have committed such a grave mistake.

464
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,880
Mighty Monarch.

465
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:42,950
Can I ask you to let this pass, Your Highness the Crown Prince?

466
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,660
Qian Qian,

467
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,950
should we let them off?

468
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,560
Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

469
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,320
You're so nice to Bai Qian this lowlife,

470
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,790
but don't you know?

471
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,200
She and her teacher...

472
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,920
Qian Qian said you two look similar.

473
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,730
I don't know what's so similar.

474
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:35,580
When I first gave you my face,

475
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,950
I didn't mind it too much.

476
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:42,340
But now, when I see you wearing my face,

477
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,360
I really don't feel happy anymore.

478
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,400
What are you doing?

479
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,010
What do you want?

480
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,850
I've looked like this from the start.

481
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,810
Don't you dare take away my beauty.

482
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,970
I'm not afraid even if you bring Zhe Yan here.

483
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,210
Why would I need Zhe Yan here?

484
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,060
I was just kidding with you before.

485
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,480
You really think that in the whole Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses,

486
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,360
only Zhe Yan knows the spell of changing someone's face?

487
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,070
I'm not that talented.

488
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,480
After not doing anything for the past 70,000 years,

489
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,020
I've learned this spell, too.

490
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,110
If you are going to have your skin peeled and your tendons pulled,

491
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:34,510
you shouldn't use this face while doing it.

492
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:39,650
What are you doing? Don't. Don't. Don't!

493
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,000
Look at your original face.

494
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,420
I told you before.

495
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,510
If you did bad things with Zhe Yan's spell,

496
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,950
you'd regret it.

497
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,870
Qian Qian, can you still hold on?

498
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,250
Go to sleep if you can't.

499
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,480
Li Jing.

500
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,710
Do as you see fit.

501
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,450
How did it become like this?

502
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,200
How did it become like this?

503
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,790
I don't look like this! I don't look like this!

504
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,070
I don't want to see this face!

505
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,170
I don't want it!

506
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:28,350
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

507
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:30,520
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

508
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,960
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

509
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,300
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

510
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:47,670
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

511
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,610
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

512
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:57,050
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

513
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:02,940
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

514
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:09,620
♫ All are just illusions ♫

515
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,990
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

516
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:21,140
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

517
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,630
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

518
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:31,870
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

519
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:37,170
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

520
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:42,490
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

521
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,380
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

522
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:54,540
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from ,br>my previous life ♫

523
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:06,470
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

524
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:11,930
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

525
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:16,310
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

526
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:22,620
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

527
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:27,880
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

528
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:33,300
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

529
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,020
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

530
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:44,890
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

531
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:57,530
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
