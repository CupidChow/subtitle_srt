”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,600
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,200
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,600
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,000
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,400
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,200
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,800
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,200
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,800
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,400
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,800
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,400
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,800
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,600
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,800
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,600
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,000
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,950
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,800
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,200
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,600
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,200
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,800
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,600
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,900
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,000
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Episode 8]

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,200
The happening of this spiritual fetus is strange.

32
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,200
After just a few days, your wife is already in labor.

33
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,000
Maybe this fetus has obtained the pure energy of Kunlun Void, the blessings of the golden lotus.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,600
That's right.

35
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,200
Mo Yuan isn't an ordinary god.

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,800
He's the direct son of Father God, and his only remaining descendant.

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,000
With the blessings of the golden lotus that he took care of every day,

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,700
this child will surely be extraordinary.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Her Highness has been in labor for 7 days.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm very scared.

41
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,900
- Don't be afraid, Su Jin. Okay?
- Okay.

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,000
Heavenly Monarch, Your Highness, it's a prince!

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,900
It's a little prince!

44
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,280
Congratulations, Heavenly Monarch!

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,500
Congratulations, Your Highness!

46
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,400
Is it an auspicious sign?

47
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,000
[South Gate]

48
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,900
Heavenly Monarch!

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,400
Father Monarch, this scenery only happened when High God Mo Yuan was born.

50
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,000
Limitless good karma.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,300
My Heavenly Tribe finally has welcomed another crown prince.

52
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,690
Today, I'm going to name him...

53
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,300
Ye Hua.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Congratulations Heavenly Monarch for obtaining a crown prince!

55
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,000
Su Jin, he's younger than you by 20,000 years.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,400
You must take good care of him in the future. Understand?

57
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Yes, Princess Consort Le Xu!

58
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,900
Good girl.

59
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,200
Little snake monster, where did you come from?

60
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,200
You dare to trespass into the Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms of High God Zhe Yan?

61
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,200
I'm here to look for High God Bai Zhen.

62
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,900
Looking for me?

63
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,990
Zhe Yan, how come people looking for me are coming to your place now?

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,400
I think that everyone in all the realms know

65
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,600
that to look for you, there's no need to go to your manor in the Northern Wilderness.

66
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,200
Instead, they should come to my Peach Blossoms Forest.

67
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,130
That jade bottle... Isn't that the one Young Fifth frequently uses when she drinks alcohol?

68
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,100
That's the bottle that Mo Yuan took away from me.

69
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,000
Where did you get this?

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,400
Kunlun Void?

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,100
You! You! You dare to steal from us?

72
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,000
Stop that!

73
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,830
That's... a disciple from Kunlun Void!

74
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,400
Kunlun Void!

75
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,400
They beat you. Don't you know how to fight back?

76
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,000
If I do that, I will be beaten even more severely.

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,300
Then, are you just going to let them beat you up like that?

78
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,300
Anyway, they won't be able to kill me.

79
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,000
Go home now.

80
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,400
I don't have a home.

81
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,200
I don't know who my parents are, either.

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,600
I obtained my human form by cultivating with the dragon energy here in Kunlun Void for hundreds of years.

83
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,000
If you don't have a home, is it okay if I find you a new home?

84
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,600
A new home?

85
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,200
It's a very beautiful place.

86
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,000
Use this Spiritual Illusion Bottle as a token.

87
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,900
Take it to a person and he'll take you in.

88
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,800
But High Immortal didn't tell me his name.

89
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,600
He only gave me this bottle.

90
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,200
He told me to go to Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms to look for High God Bai Zhen and ask him to take me in.

91
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,300
Ask me to take you in?!

92
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,700
From now on, I'm yours.

93
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,800
I'm willing to serve you forever.

94
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,700
Don't. I don't need one.

95
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,200
High God, are you not willing to take in a little snake sprite like me?

96
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Don't be sad. Don't take it personally.

97
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,800
It's just that I don't need a maidservant.

98
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Si Yin wants me to take you in?

99
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,900
Do you have nowhere to go?

100
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,260
I have no home.

101
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,500
Since I was little, I've gotten bullied by sprites from my tribe.

102
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,900
Good thing, High Immortal passed by and was chivalrous that he saved me.

103
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,690
Since that's the case, I'll take you back with me to Fox Den.

104
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,300
My mother is there.

105
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,840
She doesn't have many maidservants.

106
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,900
You can keep her company.

107
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,000
Thank you, High God!

108
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,930
Since it was Young Fifth who picked you, stay then.

109
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,400
- Mi Gu.
- Here.

110
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,100
I will hand her over to you.

111
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Once Bai Qian returns, Fox Emperor and I plan to move out and leave this Fox Den to her.

112
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,200
From now on, you all take care of each other and attend to Young Fifth.

113
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,500
Yes.

114
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,000
Come with me.

115
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,900
Your luck with the ladies is quite prosperous.

116
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,800
Zhen Zhen is the most handsome among my five children.

117
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,400
If he was a woman, even Qian Qian would be inferior to him.

118
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,900
Mother.

119
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,200
All right. I'm going back to the Peach Blossoms Forest.

120
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,400
Since this son of mine was a year old, he's been sticking to you.

121
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,300
Don't you find it annoying?

122
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,300
Without him, I would be lonely.

123
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,400
Where have all the fish gone?

124
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,900
Don't be impatient. Here.

125
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,700
High Gods.

126
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,200
My Peach Blossoms Forest has been quite lively these past two days.

127
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,400
High Immortal Die Feng, you must be here for something urgent.

128
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,800
I can't find Seventeenth Junior Brother.

129
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,200
Wrong. Not only Seventeenth Junior Brother.

130
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,800
Even Teacher's divine body went missing.

131
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,300
What?

132
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,400
Qian Qian!

133
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,200
Qian Qian!

134
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,600
Qian Qian!

135
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,400
- Qian Qian!
- Qian Qian!

136
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
- Qian Qian!
- Qian Qian!

137
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,400
Silly girl, she clearly suffered grave injuries during the war.

138
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,100
Why doesn't she value her own life?

139
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,200
What should we do? What should we do?

140
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,400
She's about to die. You all think of a way.

141
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,000
What should we do?

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,910
Don't panic. We can still save them.

143
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,700
Don't panic.

144
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,000
Qian Qian fed more than half of the blood from her heart to Mo Yuan.

145
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,200
It's already not easy that she's still alive.

146
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,300
Now, passing someone's cultivation to her is the only way to save her.

147
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,200
I'll pass mine.

148
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,500
It would require more than half of your cultivation.

149
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,000
As long as it can save Qian Qian, half of my life's cultivation is nothing.

150
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,460
No! You are the Fox Emperor of Green Hill.

151
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,200
You still must keep the Five Wildernesses in order.

152
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,000
How could you lose half of your life's cultivation?

153
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Let me do it.

154
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,930
Wait.

155
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,400
Hear what I have to say first.

156
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,350
Each immortal or god has a different kind of spiritual breath in them.

157
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,180
If you transfer too much cultivation, it will affect your divine aura.

158
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,000
You and Qian Qian will both fall onto the demonic path.

159
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,580
This way won't save Young Fifth.

160
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,200
Instead, it'll harm yourself.

161
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,400
But I can't worry about all that.

162
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,800
Zhen Zhen, escort High God Zhe Yan out.

163
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,600
- Mother...
- Hurry up!

164
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,000
How come you're still like before, so impatient?!

165
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
Let me finish talking first.

166
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,500
What's wrong?

167
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,000
I stopped you because we still need something.

168
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,590
What is it?

169
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,000
Mythical Mushroom.

170
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,200
With such an item, we can purify the divine aura and ensure that you two can be safe.

171
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,800
Where can it be found?

172
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Yingzhou in the Eastern Sea.

173
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,000
But Father God thought that this item was against the mandate of Heaven.

174
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,200
He sent four mythical beasts to guard it.

175
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Those four beasts?

176
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,800
Correct. It's those four beasts.

177
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,000
Father God even gave more than half of his cultivation to them.

178
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,700
Even if Mo Yuan were alive, I fear that he wouldn't be able to easily defeat them.

179
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,100
- I'll go.
- I'll go with you!

180
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,500
- Mother, let me go instead.
- Enough!

181
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,400
You two stop fighting.

182
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
It's better that you both stay.

183
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,600
Even if I'm unable to defeat them, Green Hill can still be commanded by you.

184
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,600
Don't worry. Leave them to me.

185
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,400
But you only have about 20 hours.

186
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,200
Hurry back.

187
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,910
Wait for my return.

188
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,100
Li Jing, although the Heavenly Tribe and Winged Tribe have formed an alliance,

189
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,500
the grudge between our Kunlun Void and your Grand Purple Palace will never be resolved.

190
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,200
My Teacher and Ninth Junior Brother both died because of your father.

191
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,600
How dare you still come up here to my Kunlun Void?!

192
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,800
I have no intention of offending all of you.

193
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,000
I came this time to request that I be allowed to see High Immortal Si Yin.

194
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,600
Si Yin? You still dare to look for Si Yin?

195
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,200
Who was the one who trespassed into our mountain and looked for my Seventeenth Junior Brother every day,

196
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,400
and who colluded with that lowlife Xuan Nü to cause my Teacher's and Senior Brother's death?

197
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,940
You still have the nerve to look for Si Yin?!

198
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,900
You!

199
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,400
Please relay this message for me.

200
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,200
The Winged Monarch Li Jing asks to see High Immortal Si Yin.

201
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
You better just go back.

202
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:12,300
Please notify High Immortal Si Yin that the Winged Monarch Li Jing asks to see him.

203
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,700
I've brought what he wants.

204
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,600
Si Yin has left Kunlun Void and gone to travel the world.

205
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,200
Hence, regardless of what you brought, he wouldn't want it.

206
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,800
Ah Yin left?!

207
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,700
Winged Monarch, please leave.

208
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,700
Teacher, as the eldest disciple of Kunlun Void,

209
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,210
I wasn't able to take good care of Seventeenth.

210
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,820
Don't worry.

211
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:04,090
No matter where Seventeenth has brought you to, I will find you both.

212
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,200
From today, I'm leaving the mountain.

213
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,400
No matter how far I go and how long I search,

214
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,700
I will find the divine body of Teacher and Seventeenth and bring them back here.

215
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,190
You all have parents.

216
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:42,300
Since Teacher is gone, don't stay in Kunlun Void to fritter away your days.

217
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,300
All of you should leave the mountain.

218
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,700
Eldest Senior Brother!

219
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,600
Remember what I said.

220
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,400
Teacher chose to offer his own life as a sacrifice to the Donghuang Bell for the sake of all realms

221
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,400
and not for any personal grudges.

222
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,000
Now that the Heavenly Tribe and Winged Tribe have formed an alliance, there is now peace everywhere.

223
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,600
Hence, you all mustn't seek vengeance with the Winged Realm.

224
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,200
No more battles within the Four Seas,

225
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,000
no more displaced refugees within the Eight Wildernesses.

226
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,400
That is Teacher's wish.

227
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,240
Si Yin is so troublesome.

228
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,710
Not only does he refuse to allow the body to be buried in the Sea of Innocence,

229
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,900
he even took away the divine body of Mo Yuan.

230
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,790
How will I explain this to the Heavenly Tribe?

231
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,410
Don't you have a lot of divine officials that fabricate the history of Heavenly Realm?

232
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,760
Just randomly write something.

233
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,530
What you mean is...?

234
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:03,980
Just find a high-sounding reason on where the God of War has gone to for the sake of the succeeding generations.

235
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,000
What kind of reason can convince the Four Seas?

236
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,690
On the autumn of the 63,082nd year of Monarch Haode, the uprising of the Winged Tribe ended.

237
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:26,050
The direct son of Father God, Mo Yuan, went into seclusion with his seventeenth disciple Si Yin.

238
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,390
No news about them was heard of again.

239
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,720
What do you think?

240
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,400
Both went into seclusion?

241
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,870
Right.

242
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,530
Going into seclusion together.

243
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,100
Emperor, you're really quite biased towards the disciples of Kunlun Void.

244
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,250
Earlier, Heavenly Monarch looked like he wanted to send out 100,000 heavenly soldiers

245
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,240
to every corner of all the realms to capture High Immortal Si Yin.

246
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,340
A chest full of anger just got dissipated by you like that.

247
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,340
Why arrest him?

248
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,300
Mo Yuan favored Si Yin the most.

249
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:16,100
Being able to be with this youngest disciple after his death might be his greatest wish.

250
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,570
Father! Father!

251
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,830
Hurry! Hurry and hand this to Zhe Yan.

252
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,150
Okay.

253
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,560
We are pressed for time, so I can't refine your cultivation into a pill.

254
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,380
When you transfer your cultivation to Young Fifth later, if demonic voices try to disturb you, you mustn't stop.

255
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,890
Continue with transferring your cultivation.

256
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,080
Leave the rest to me.

257
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,740
Okay.

258
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,760
You're awake.

259
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,580
Mother.

260
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,090
Did I not die?

261
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,640
I transferred half of my cultivation to you.

262
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,640
Finally, we're able to save you.

263
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,670
Half of your cultivation?

264
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,460
A High Goddess transferred half of her cultivation to me.

265
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,340
Don't I have limitless power now?

266
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,870
I won't be afraid even if I encounter another heavenly tribulation.

267
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,900
That's right. You can commit outrages again.

268
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,590
Where's my teacher? Mother, where's my teacher?

269
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,350
He's inside Splendid Flame Cave.

270
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,660
That place is the best place to preserve divine bodies.

271
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,480
That's good.

272
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,670
Mother, I missed you so much.

273
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,200
I missed you, too.

274
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,420
I never thought that you'd return with half of your life gone.

275
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,550
It looks like even if Mo Yuan blocked heavenly lightning for you,

276
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:56,390
you still have to go through this tribulation of ascending to a High Immortal.

277
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:01,970
The heavens are only using a different method to torment you.

278
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,860
You said it right.

279
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,700
I got promoted to a High Immortal too easily.

280
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,220
Even the heavens can't take it.

281
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:15,300
You used your blood from your own heart to preserve your teacher

282
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,280
as a payment for the debt you owe him for blocking those three heavenly lightning strikes.

283
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,980
But Young Fifth, you must be clear about this.

284
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,710
Since Mo Yuan has received your blood to preserve his divine body,

285
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,990
he must keep receiving yours.

286
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,840
We can't replace it with another fox's.

287
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,280
I know everything, Mom.

288
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,710
I owe Teacher so much.

289
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,040
Preserving him like that still isn't enough to repay all of it.

290
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,000
Mom, do you think Teacher can wake up?

291
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,120
You're awake?

292
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,050
Is that my Second Older Brother's daughter?

293
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,710
Yes, I especially carried her here for you to see.

294
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,560
Come closer. Let me see.

295
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,100
Quickly come.

296
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,430
She's so pretty.

297
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,790
She even has a birthmark on her forehead. This birthmark...?

298
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,110
- Phoenix flower.
- Yes.

299
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:24,430
It's because of this phoenix flower and the fact that she was born during the ninth month,

300
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:28,950
I named her Fengjiu, a not so elegant but not so vulgar name.

301
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:34,400
With the surname of our Bai family, her full name is Bai Fengjiu.

302
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,500
Bai Fengjiu?

303
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:44,870
Little Fengjiu, did you know that because I wanted to see you,

304
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,690
Ninth Senior Brother and I secretly went down the mountain,

305
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:52,170
and then because of some freak accidents, we got taken to Grand Purple Palace?

306
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,680
Young Fifth, it's not that I want to scold you,

307
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,660
but only you would dare to steal the divine body of High God Mo Yuan.

308
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,540
Totally stirring and turning Kunlun Void and Heavenly Palace upside down.

309
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:07,190
Your senior brothers are searching like crazy for news about you and High God Mo Yuan.

310
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:11,910
That time, I was heavily injured,

311
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,420
and I didn't know how long Teacher had before he completely disappeared,

312
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,170
so I thought of coming here to give it a try.

313
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,610
Maybe, I'll find a way.

314
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,690
Do you still remember that you're not really Si Yin?

315
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,470
You are Bai Qian, the daughter of the Fox Emperor of Green Hill.

316
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:28,230
Above you are your father, mother, and four older brothers.

317
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,960
If you were going to feed your teacher some blood from the heart, you could have just asked me nicely.

318
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,620
I would have done it for you.

319
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,070
Fourth Older Brother, I want to repay the debt of kindness I obtained from Teacher.

320
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,960
It has nothing to do with you.

321
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,720
You girl...

322
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,800
Young Fifth is right.

323
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,190
Mo Yuan blocked her heavenly tribulation.

324
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,570
She used her blood from her heart to repay this debt.

325
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,020
This is actually within reasons.

326
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:59,780
But if you do it in her stead, if one day, Mo Yuan wakes up,

327
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,930
he would randomly be in debt to you.

328
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,440
How then can he repay it?

329
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,620
Mom, you're right.

330
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,800
You...

331
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,120
All right. Enough of this.

332
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,910
Take good care of Young Fifth first.

333
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:18,110
Your father and I will go to the Heavenly Palace.

334
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,160
Is it for that newborn crown prince?

335
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,590
Yes. I'll get going now.

336
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,440
Oh, right. Don't get too naughty.

337
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,890
Young Fifth is currently very weak.

338
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,740
She wouldn't be able to endure such torment.

339
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,060
Mom, don't worry.

340
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,340
Zhe Yan and I will just chat with her and play with little Fengjiu.

341
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,250
- Mom, don't worry.
- Don't worry.

342
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:46,260
You two are most similar to to each other, and are the most disobedient.

343
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,520
Little Fengjiu.

344
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,690
Teacher,

345
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,980
I've received half of my mother's cultivation,

346
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,810
and I was finally able to preserve your divine body.

347
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:27,910
I will wait here for your quick return,

348
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:32,960
for you to relive your life at Kunlun Void of being worshiped by all immortals.

349
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:10,340
Ever since I took Teacher away from Kunlun Void 70,000 years ago, I had never left Green Hill by a step.

350
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,540
I heard that my senior brothers all returned to their tribes.

351
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:19,530
The Kunlun Void that was once a place where immortals would go to pay their respects has become a no-man's land.

352
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,470
The Heavenly Tribe and Winged Tribe have also patched up their differences.

353
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:27,330
Slowly, the names of the God of War Mo Yuan and the Winged Monarch Qing Cang

354
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:33,440
got buried under the never-ending falling leaves of Kunlun Void and the muddy sand of Ruoshui River.

355
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,740
No one mentioned it again.

356
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,170
[70,000 years later]

357
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:45,000
Teacher, in 7 days, it will be the day when Qing Cang removes his seal and breaks out of the bell.

358
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,160
Teacher, don't worry.

359
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:55,840
Even if I give all my life, I will reseal it again and not disappoint you.

360
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,280
- This is not bad. Great Lady.
- Great Lady.

361
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,350
- Great Lady.
- Great Lady.

362
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,450
- Great Lady.
- Great Lady.

363
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,780
- Great Lady.
- Great Lady.
- Great Lady.

364
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,280
- Great Lady, you are so beautiful.
- Great Lady.

365
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,510
- Great Lady.
- Fresh fruits!

366
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,980
- Here, what do you think about this one? Okay.
- You're right.

367
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,430
- Great Lady.
- Great Lady, hello.

368
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,580
Great Lady, you've come out of cultivation?

369
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,420
It's all my fault.

370
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,390
I shouldn't have locked you and Shao Xin inside the den.

371
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,610
Look at how sickly you look.

372
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,220
You haven't even gotten married yet.

373
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,160
Why do you have so much in your mind?

374
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,640
Great Lady, we have a big problem.

375
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,500
What has happened?

376
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,030
Forget it. Great Lady, come.

377
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,340
Mi Gu, what really happened? Quickly say it.

378
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,430
Sang Ji has come to the Fox Den.

379
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,580
I should just continue staying in the retreat.

380
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,130
No, you can't.

381
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,880
You might be able to avoid him for a month, but not for a year.

382
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,280
The marriage between you and Second Highness was personally set by Heavenly Monarch and Fox Emperor.

383
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,940
You will be married off to him sooner or later.

384
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,120
It's just right for Second Highness to come to our Fox Den to visit you.

385
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,790
The only constant thing in life is change.

386
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:46,740
What if in a few days, I turn into ashes?

387
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,170
Isn't it too aggrieving for me to still waste time in attending to him?

388
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,100
Great Lady, if you don't want to marry him, then don't.

389
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
Why must you curse yourself?

390
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,920
Let's not talk about this anymore.

391
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,940
Mi Gu, you and Shao Xin should just properly serve that man inside Fox Den.

392
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,860
I'll go to Peach Blossoms Forest to hide for a while.

393
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,570
Great Lady, he's after all the Second Highness of the Heavenly Tribe.

394
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,560
It's not a good idea to keep avoiding him.

395
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,160
You're not listening to my words now?

396
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,010
I dare not.

397
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,670
Quickly go then.

398
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,820
Just come to Peach Blossoms Forest to find me once he's gone.

399
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,460
Yes.

400
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,270
What?

401
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,610
She went to the cultivating retreat again?

402
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,550
Your Second Highness, that is indeed the case.

403
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,740
Doesn't she know that I'm here?

404
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:53,500
She knows, but as the female monarch of Green Hill of Eastern Wilderness, she has to prioritize its citizens.

405
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,750
Going into the cultivating retreat so she can progress to a High Goddess sooner is the female monarch's duty.

406
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,850
What you said is right.

407
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,700
But I've been waiting for her here for a month.

408
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,300
I didn't even get to see her face.

409
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,110
Isn't that so absurd?

410
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,930
Second Highness, eat some fruits first.

411
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,760
These were just bought from the Mushroom Market earlier.

412
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,910
Second Highness is quite nice to Shao Xin.

413
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,960
That's also good. I don't need to be the one to deal with him.

414
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,470
Your Second Highness.

415
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,410
In the Nine Heavens, I'm the most favored prince.

416
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,920
But how come it's so hard for me to be with the person I love?

417
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:04,910
If Your Second Highness really wants to be with me, then officially cancel your wedding with Great Lady.

418
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:09,410
Great Lady previously saved my life and she treats me so well.

419
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,220
I can't just leave with you like this.

420
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:28,190
Bai Qian is indeed good to you.

421
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,370
She even gifted you Lord of Lingbao's Cloud-Breaking Fan for self-defense.

422
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,910
Do you know who Lord of Lingbao is?

423
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,570
I don't.

424
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,570
He's the closed-door disciple of Primeval Lord of Heaven.

425
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,300
Oh, wrong. Wrong.

426
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,210
He's not a closed-door disciple.

427
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,050
I forgot.

428
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:57,020
My nephew Ye Hua is the true closed door disciple of Primeval Lord of Heaven.

429
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,300
About the name Ye Hua,

430
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,490
I heard Fourth Uncle and High God Zhe Yan mention him before.

431
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:13,330
But talking about this fan, I heard that Lord of Lingbao gifted it to someone before.

432
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:17,840
But how come it ended up in the hands of Bai Qian?

433
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:29,650
I heard from Great Lady that Lord of Lingbao gifted this fan to a High Immortal in Kunlun Void named Si Yin.

434
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:33,100
Afterward, just to greet High God Zhe Yan for his birthday,

435
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,050
Si Yin asked someone to deliver this Cloud-Breaking Fan to the Peach Blossoms Forest.

436
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:42,100
Then, this fan ended up with Great Lady.

437
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,950
The course was full of twists and turns.

438
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,760
And then, Great Lady gifted it to me for a reason.

439
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,310
So it's Si Yin.

440
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,330
Let's not talk about these people unrelated to us.

441
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,920
Shao Xin, listen to me.

442
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,610
The marriage between me and Bai Qian was personally set by Heavenly Monarch and Fox Emperor.

443
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,350
Hence, we must slowly think of a solution to this problem.

444
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,990
Since young, you had a hard life.

445
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,870
You don't have any family nor friends.

446
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:17,760
Although Bai Qian took you in, you can never stay by her side forever.

447
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,540
Based on the rules of Green Hill,

448
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,370
she will personally choose a husband for you if you want to get married.

449
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,680
Do you want to live the rest of your life with another man, whom you don't even know?

450
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,790
No! I will never marry another man.

451
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:36,450
Since I already have you in my heart, even if as a maidservant, I will stay by your side.

452
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,540
Since you have this kind of thought, why must we drag this out?

453
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,510
Go back to Heavenly Palace with me today.

454
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,480
- No.
- Second Highness!

455
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,010
The two of us have been together for a month.

456
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,460
Can't you still discern my true feelings for you?

457
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,160
No. But I can't betray Great Lady.

458
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,200
I haven't even seen her, so how could there be any wronging?

459
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,860
We both are being restrained by a marriage agreement.

460
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,960
Think about it. If not because she refused to see me this past month,

461
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,630
how could I have the chance to meet and know you in this Fox Den?

462
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,000
Isn't this Heaven's will?

463
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,800
From now on, let me be the one to protect you.

464
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,430
I won't let you become a servant.

465
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:27,160
I will marry you.

466
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,930
Sending off Second Highness on behalf of Great Lady.

467
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,000
Finally was able to send off that guest that can't be offended.

468
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,150
Shao Xin! Quickly clean things up!

469
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,540
I'll go to the Peach Blossoms Forest to fetch Great Lady!

470
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,360
Shao Xin!

471
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,440
Shao Xin!

472
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,080
Where is she?

473
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,340
- Second Highness!
- Second Highness!

474
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,710
Second Uncle.

475
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,790
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

476
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,650
Will Heavenly Monarch be returning to the Heavenly Palace soon?

477
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,410
I heard that he will be back by today.

478
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,470
[Purple Throne Hall]

479
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,960
Third Uncle.

480
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,010
Do you need me for something?

481
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,770
The memorials these past days were all about the disaster of Zhongrong Empire in the mortal world.

482
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,100
May I ask if you know anything about the Fiery Golden Lion?

483
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,460
What?

484
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,890
Fiery Golden Lion used to be the ride of Qing Cang.

485
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:02,110
After Qing Cang was sealed in the Donghuang Bell 70,000 years ago, it disappeared.

486
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:06,800
Only recently was he rediscovered in the vicinity of the Zhongrong Empire under the Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness.

487
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,610
This beast is very fierce, good in fighting, and ruthlessly wreaking havoc.

488
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:15,860
Not only has it caused the Zhongrong Kingdom to suffer ten years of drought, it even abducted their empress.

489
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,870
Out of humiliation, the emperor slashed his throat.

490
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,280
That tragic?

491
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,050
And then?

492
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,780
This emperor used to be a small divine official under Emperor Dong Hua.

493
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:41,020
After dying, he returned here in the Heavenly Palace and filed a complaint about the evil deeds of that Golden Lion.

494
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,100
You asked me to come here just for this?

495
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:59,880
Since you were 50,000 years old, you are the one reading all these official memorials,

496
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,700
but you've never talked to me about it.

497
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,020
What's wrong with you tonight?

498
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,380
I saw Second Uncle today.

499
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,520
Second Older Brother is back?

500
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,860
That fast?

501
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,830
Didn't Father Monarch ask him to stay in Green Hill for at least 3 months

502
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,360
to have a chat with Bai Qian and improve on their relationship as husband and wife?

503
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,500
I'm not clear about the relationship between Second Uncle and Bai Qian of Green Hill.

504
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:27,010
What I only know is that he brought a little bashe snake when he returned.

505
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,730
A little bashe snake?

506
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,660
It's a lady.

507
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,610
It's really a lady?

508
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,880
Oh, no!

509
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,850
Mighty Monarch, I don't get it.

510
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,950
So what if it's a lady?

511
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,540
Second Highness has female attendants in his palace.

512
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,880
Bai Qian of Green Hill once took in a little bashe snake 70,000 years ago.

513
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,970
It was a lady.

514
00:41:54,970 --> 00:42:01,230
What you mean is Second Highness secretly brought back the maidservant of his fiancée?

515
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:08,000
Mighty Monarch wants Third Highness to think of a way.

516
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,060
That Bai Qian of Green Hill is really a strange lady.

517
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:17,350
She just casually gave the Cloud-Breaking Fan gifted to her by Lord of Lingbao, the senior of Mighty Monarch, to that little bashe snake.

518
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:21,170
This news has long been well known throughout the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

519
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,140
All of you can leave now.

520
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,020
Yes.

521
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,350
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

522
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,330
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

523
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,970
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

524
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:11,400
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

525
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:20,200
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

526
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,630
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

527
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,920
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

528
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,100
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

529
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:41,670
♫ All are just illusions ♫

530
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,960
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

531
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,180
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

532
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:58,600
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

533
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:04,890
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

534
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:10,260
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

535
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:15,520
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

536
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,220
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

537
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:26,400
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

538
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:39,400
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

539
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,840
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

540
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,220
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

541
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:55,450
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

542
00:44:55,450 --> 00:45:00,950
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

543
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:06,350
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

544
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,990
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

545
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:18,200
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

546
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:29,900
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
