”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,510
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,110
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,600
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,000
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,460
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,200
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,820
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,330
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,980
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,350
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,940
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,360
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,120
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,560
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,030
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,610
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,050
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,090
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,740
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,300
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,780
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,990
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,880
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,420
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,350
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,070
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,740
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Episode 37]

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,910
Mighty Monarch. Mighty Monarch!

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,560
Mighty Monarch!

33
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,650
Mighty Monarch!

34
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,000
Mighty Monarch!

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,300
Mighty Monarch! Mighty Monarch!

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,090
Mighty Monarch! Don't believe Bai Qian that lowlife! She used witchcraft.

37
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,190
She used witchcraft and turned me into this.

38
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,720
Mighty Monarch! Mighty Monarch!

39
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,630
Bai Qian that lowlife never liked me since we were young.

40
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,580
Don't believe her! Don't believe her!

41
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,810
We've been married for 70,000 years,

42
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,840
yet I had never really understood you.

43
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,880
70,000 years.

44
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,640
70,000 years.

45
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,180
Mighty Monarch, you can't do this to me.

46
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,430
You can't.

47
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,720
You've offended the entire Heavenly Tribes and Green Hill.

48
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,320
How am I supposed to help you?

49
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:36,210
Do you want me to make enemies of the entire Heavenly Tribes and Green Hill for you?

50
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,450
And let soldiers of the Winged Tribe die?

51
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,360
Heavenly Monarch, Bai Qian hates me

52
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,450
because I went to Kunlun Void to steal the battle formation map

53
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,060
and caused the death of her teacher.

54
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,750
That's why she has hated me for 70,000 years.

55
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,160
She's using this opportunity to put me to death.

56
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,930
But Mighty Monarch!

57
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,240
I stole the formation map all because of you!

58
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,420
Because your father wanted to kill you!

59
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,170
I protected your life, Mighty Monarch!

60
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,260
I betrayed the Heavenly Tribes and Green Hill for you.

61
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,700
You can't do this to me now.

62
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,930
Even if I neglect my official duties,

63
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm the ruler of the Winged Tribe.

64
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,840
The ones I have to protect... are my people.

65
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,230
Guards.

66
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,080
Detain the Monarchess in the Land of Extreme Coldness Prison.

67
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,870
On some other day...

68
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,690
- carry out the punishment.
- Yes.

69
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,620
No! No!

70
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,330
Mighty Monarch! Mighty Monarch!

71
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,140
Let me out!

72
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,880
I'm the Winged Monarchess.

73
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,400
You dare to imprison me here?

74
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,930
I'll kill you all! I'll kill you all!

75
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,140
Mighty Monarch, you can't do this to me.

76
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,250
I did so much for you.

77
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,290
If I weren't here,

78
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,850
you wouldn't be where you are today.

79
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,730
For 70,000 years...

80
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,440
We were married for 70,000 years.

81
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:31,780
Just because of that lowlife, Bai Qian, you want to go as far as to pull out my tendons and strip my skin.

82
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,260
Who's there?

83
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,380
Who is it?

84
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,290
Is it you, Mighty Monarch?

85
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,250
Mighty Monarch! Is it you?

86
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,210
You're not His Mighty Monarch.

87
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,300
Who are you?

88
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,580
Xuan Nü?

89
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,940
Li Yuan?

90
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,320
You're Li Yuan!

91
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,330
That's not possible.

92
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,900
Three hundred years ago, when you rebelled in Northern Wilderness,

93
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,140
didn't His Mighty Monarch kill you?

94
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,970
Is that what Li Jing told you?

95
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:42,880
I have been imprisoned in this complete dark place for three hundred years.

96
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:49,920
So, the people of the Winged Realm think I'm already dead?

97
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,000
Whether you live or die, it has nothing to do with me.

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,410
He locked you up to let you live.

99
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:06,030
But he is willing to pull my tendons and skin me for that lowlife Bai Qian!

100
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,880
If he wanted to pull your tendons and strip your skin,

101
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,280
why didn't he use the immortal lock to lock you?

102
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:22,130
I know he couldn't bear it.

103
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,020
I was his wife for 70,000 years.

104
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,610
I even gave him a son.

105
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,900
He even protected me from Bai Qian's Kunlun Fan today.

106
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,420
But who cares about marriage?

107
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:46,980
If he really cared, he should be willing to fight the Heavenly Tribes for me.

108
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,660
And not just kill me to hold me accountable.

109
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,230
He's the mighty Winged Monarch,

110
00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:03,720
yet... yet he couldn't protect his wife just because of one word by the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribes.

111
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,400
Even if he doesn't want to protect you,

112
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,180
are you not willing to protect yourself?

113
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,130
I can help you.

114
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,810
You?

115
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:31,210
If you did have a way, you wouldn't be trapped here for 300 years.

116
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,510
I was sealed here by Li Jing.

117
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,820
He sealed my magic

118
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,950
and tied me up here, too.

119
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,210
Of course, I can't escape.

120
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,870
But you can.

121
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,850
Unless... you don't want to leave this place alive?

122
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,190
I want to!

123
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,670
I can't die like this.

124
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:13,120
Even if I die, I must kill Bai Qian that lowlife first!

125
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,510
Tell me.

126
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,140
Are you really a woman?

127
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,480
Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribes,

128
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,430
you treat Bai Qian that lowlife so well,

129
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,850
but did you know?

130
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,190
She and her teacher...

131
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,270
I'm warning you.

132
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,050
My teacher's body is priceless.

133
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,620
He's recieved 70,000 years of my heart's blood.

134
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,110
Your son might not be able to handle it.

135
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,610
I heard from Tian Shu that you rushed to the Winged Realm to save your lover.

136
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,960
I was guessing that it would be at least a fight of 300 rounds.

137
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,260
How come you've returned unscathed?

138
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,880
You always rush to get injured if it has anything to do with Bai Qian.

139
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,280
In the past, were you close to High God Mo Yuan?

140
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,060
And also that High Immortal Si Yin,

141
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,930
is the rumor true that he was High God Mo Yuan's favorite disciple?

142
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,720
Why are you suddenly bringing them up?

143
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,860
It's true that I've met those two before.

144
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:12,360
High God Mo Yuan's treatment towards this youngest disciple of his was very special.

145
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,030
Even at Lord of Lingbao's religious assembly, he only brought him along.

146
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,540
I've also heard a rumor.

147
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,090
What?

148
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,420
It's rumored that because High Goddess Yao Guang loved High God Mo Yuan,

149
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,720
she forcibly moved her manor into Kunlun Void.

150
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,820
And then because of jealousy, she kidnapped Si Yin, but then Mo Yuan found out,

151
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:42,220
grew angry, and took his Xuanyuan Sword to break into Yao Guang's water prison overnight to save Si Yin.

152
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,410
What happened after?

153
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,910
Then High God Mo Yuan fought High Goddess Yao Guang because of this,

154
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,400
and he kicked High Goddess Yao Guang out of Kunlun Void.

155
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,570
If this is true,

156
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:59,220
High God Mo Yuan must really treasure this disciple.

157
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,090
Qian Qian,

158
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,550
did you forget me not because you hate me for taking your eyes,

159
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,800
but because you wanted to forget about our relationship?

160
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,100
Has the person you've been waiting for, for 70,000 years, always been High God Mo Yuan?

161
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,040
Did I say something wrong?

162
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,510
Qian Qian should be awake now.

163
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,420
I'm going to Green Hill to concoct her medicine.

164
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:42,080
Our Heavenly Crown Prince will never be able to escape from the grasp of Bai Qian.

165
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,850
Where is His Majesty?

166
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,860
He just instructed me to brew a new pot of tea for Your Third Highness. Where is he?

167
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,090
He went to Green Hill.

168
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,510
Went to Green Hill again?

169
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,570
Princess Miao Qian, I want to give you a word of advice.

170
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,430
You've set your heart on the wrong person.

171
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,850
You should go home and have your oldest brother arrange a better marriage for you.

172
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,210
Even if you're a servant here for 100,000 years,

173
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,290
Ye Hua wouldn't give you a second glance.

174
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,520
I'll be leaving first.

175
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,730
Bi Fang, why are you here?

176
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,680
How are you feeling?

177
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,550
Better?

178
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,360
Much better now that I've slept.

179
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,700
Didn't you go to the West Side?

180
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,490
Didn't Fourth Older Brother go look for you?

181
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,810
Are you thirsty? Do you need water?

182
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,420
Sure.

183
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,890
Thank you, Fourth Older Brother.

184
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,080
You're Fourth Older Brother, right?

185
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,780
I'm weak because I just had a big battle.

186
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,950
I couldn't recognize you from your transformation spell.

187
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,850
Don't pretend to be Bi Fang to amuse me.

188
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:04,560
All right. You might look like him but your attitudes are different.

189
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,900
Bi Fang usually treats me coldly and doesn't respect me.

190
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,390
I didn't transform myself.

191
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,560
I'm the true Bi Fang.

192
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,460
High God Zhe Yan went with His Highness to the Western Sea to complete some tasks.

193
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,360
I was bored guarding Peach Blossoms forest and came back to see you.

194
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,080
You're really Bi Fang?

195
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,930
That's right.

196
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:35,710
You birds are always aloof, unlike land creatures like us.

197
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:40,330
I was kidding. Don't take it to heart.

198
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:50,940
If I had been with you back there, I would've made sure you didn't get hurt, no matter how much effort I must use.

199
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,370
That's natural since we come from the same home.

200
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:02,660
Someday, if you were to fight other people, I'd help you, too.

201
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,690
Qian Qian, why are you pretending?

202
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,880
You know I've liked you since I came here to Green Hill,

203
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,340
yet you say these things to make me mad.

204
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,530
What are you saying?

205
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,580
Because I know you have a marriage arrangement with the Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribes,

206
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,760
I had no choice but to hide my feelings. But look at you now...

207
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,120
You faced such big trouble, but that Ye Hua couldn't protect you at all.

208
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,720
I have been out for the past few days and checked thoroughly.

209
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,260
I heard he has a side consort in the Heavenly Palace.

210
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,980
He is so fickle.

211
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,010
He may not treat you well.

212
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,150
How can I rest assured and give you to him?

213
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,010
- I...
- Qian Qian.

214
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,370
This Bi Fang is very stubborn.

215
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,500
He distinctly knows that Great Lady and the Heavenly Tribe have a marriage agreement,

216
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,490
but he still doesn't want to give up.

217
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,150
People say that birds mate for life,

218
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,280
that they will only stay with one partner for life.

219
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,140
Bi Fang, what are you going to do?

220
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,960
But this is very strange.

221
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,450
When His Highness the Crown Prince brought High God Mo Yuan back, he didn't say anything.

222
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,580
Did he already know that Great Lady is Si Yin?

223
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,620
Drink your medicine.

224
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:48,220
You see, after all, I'm engaged to be married to the Heavenly Tribe.

225
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,910
You said that you admire me and I'm very happy,

226
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,420
but we are not fated.

227
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,520
In everything, there must be first come, first serve. Right?

228
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,720
If you agree to be with me, I'm willing to offend the Heavenly Tribes.

229
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,590
Why don't you... you go out first?

230
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,090
You only need to tell me if you are wiling to be with me or not.

231
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,950
I'm a person with proprieties.

232
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,180
Since I'm engaged to the Heavenly Tribes,

233
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,860
I definitely can't do anything to embarrass Green Hill and Heavenly Tribes. Right?

234
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,080
You said that you admire me and I'm very thankful,

235
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,370
but we don't have any fate between us.

236
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,920
As for the rest, there's nothing else to be said.

237
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,330
If you still can't stop thinking about me,

238
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,540
you should continue to hide it.

239
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,720
I already know your sincerity.

240
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,890
I won't forget it for a long time.

241
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,830
Come.

242
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,330
Drink your medicine.

243
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,410
I can drink it myself.

244
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,720
I'm done. You go do your job.

245
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,370
I'm sleepy. I'm sleepy.

246
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Qian Qian,

247
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,810
do you know that every time you don't want me around,

248
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,450
your excuse is that you're sleepy?

249
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,910
Really?

250
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,450
Isn't this the first time I... said this?

251
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,080
Qian Qian,

252
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,340
was what you just said true?

253
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,820
What do I do?

254
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,540
It's one suitor after another.

255
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,530
How close you are allowing me to be to you,

256
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,790
everything you did for me in Green Hill,

257
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,840
was it all because of our engagement?

258
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,320
If you were engaged with someone else,

259
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,250
would you still be like this?

260
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,320
What a strange question.

261
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,000
Isn't it obvious?

262
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,620
If we didn't have this marriage, would he be able to do whatever he wants here?

263
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,500
He would've been kicked out by Mi Gu when he lived in Green Hill.

264
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:32,030
He wouldn't have the chance to come into the fox den and get such a nice room.

265
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:39,360
Of course, I'm nice to you not just because of our engagement.

266
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,190
See, in the time you've been here,

267
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,460
you still needed to approve your official documents. It must be hard.

268
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,770
You even cooked for us.

269
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:03,460
I'm thankful for everything you've done for us. I keep that in my heart.

270
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,910
There's a good saying.

271
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,780
"There's give and take."

272
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,500
If you gift me a peach, of course, I'd give you back a plum.

273
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,610
Even if I didn't have a plum, I'd have to use a loquat as a substitute.

274
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,580
Although we have an engagement, if it were someone else,

275
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,340
he wouldn't be as nice to me as you.

276
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,020
I've never made food for anyone else.

277
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,080
I've only made it for you.

278
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,080
Your cooking is great!

279
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,420
You should find a chance to cook for your family.

280
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,140
This is a demonstration of filial piety.

281
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,250
I did all this for you not because we have an engagement,

282
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,070
I didn't come to live here because Ah Li misses you, either.

283
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,420
So cooking is your hobby?

284
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,990
It's a good hobby.

285
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,100
It's very useful.

286
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,170
Qian Qian, I love you.

287
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,660
What's wrong... today?

288
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,650
An iron tree like me that never bloomed had to bloom two flowers in a day.

289
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,740
Each one saying that they love me.

290
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,760
What's going on?

291
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,450
You shouldn't joke about this.

292
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,860
I've never been more serious than now.

293
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:36,440
Without love, we can still be husband and wife for a long time,

294
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,030
but I hope that I can have longlasting love with you.

295
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,910
M-My parents said

296
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,560
after a couple has been married for a long time,

297
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,280
those romance will diminish.

298
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,160
They will gradually get along with each other like family.

299
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,450
Look! Just like us now,

300
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,680
we are like family. Right?

301
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:13,500
Thus, I think we can skip this middle part.

302
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,250
What do you think?

303
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,030
I also know that,

304
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,870
young people like you should love and hate a few times.

305
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:34,060
Hence, while the root of your ill-fated love for me hasn't been planted deep enough,

306
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,070
you should pull it out.

307
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,860
You will know once you reach my age,

308
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,390
and you will take many things less seriously.

309
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,360
You wouldn't be interested to talk about love.

310
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,540
It's quite lonely in this place.

311
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:02,170
I've always felt that Heavenly Monarch pairing us together is really not fair to you.

312
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,520
You are still young.

313
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,850
But don't be too sad.

314
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,110
If we really get married,

315
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:14,140
I will arrange for a few beautiful and young women to be your side consorts.

316
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,860
Do you really mean it?

317
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,180
It's even truer than real gold.

318
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,530
Are you saying this to make me feel bad?

319
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,370
He's really fallen in love with me.

320
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,070
What do I do?

321
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,050
I should have a long term plan.

322
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,380
I only love you.

323
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,000
I'll never love anyone else.

324
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,160
Ah Li has already gone back to Heavenly Palace.

325
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,830
He's fine. He can recover after recuperating for a few days.

326
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,120
I originally wanted to bring you back, too.

327
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,280
Lord of Lingbao has a Heavenly Water Spring in High Clear Plane that's good for your recuperation.

328
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,320
But that mount creature was desperate to stop me.

329
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,220
You can make the decision.

330
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,810
I will do as you say.

331
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,910
Go to sleep.

332
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,960
If I hadn't have seen High God Mo Yuan's face,

333
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,470
even I couldn't believe someone looks so similar to me.

334
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,250
Qian Qian,

335
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:30,610
did you let me stay here because I look like High God Mo Yuan?

336
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,760
That Xuan Nü and our Kunlun Void has so much ill-fate between them.

337
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,390
What I regret the most is that 70,000 years ago,

338
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,440
I fell for her trick of pretending to be injured

339
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,400
and brought her back to Kunlun Void

340
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,260
to let her steal the map of the battle formation.

341
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:55,550
It caused the death of Teacher and many Heavenly Tribe's soldiers.

342
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,410
There's something I'm unclear of.

343
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:04,870
How did High Immortal Si Yin take High God Mo Yuan's body with your fellow disciple brothers there?

344
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:09,540
Since you've asked, I won't hide it anymore.

345
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,620
Talking about this, I feel ashamed.

346
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,700
70,000 years ago, Teacher sacrificed his spirit to seal the Donghuang Bell,

347
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:24,760
then Seventeenth Junior Brother got us all drunk and took away Teacher's body.

348
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,880
Is that all?

349
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,420
When we were drowning in pain,

350
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,680
we didn't think Seventeenth would do such a thing.

351
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,440
But I know Seventeenth just doesn't want Teacher's body to be buried in the Sea of Innocence

352
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,310
because he doesn't believe Teacher is dead.

353
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,730
Do you know why for the past 70,000 years,

354
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,970
High Immortal Si Yin avoided seeing you and your fellow disciples?

355
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,660
I don't know, either.

356
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:58,790
From my understanding of Seventeenth, he has not appeared during these 70,000 years

357
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,780
perhaps because he has a way to bring Teacher back.

358
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:09,520
If you don't have any more questions, I need to return to the Western Sea.

359
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,420
A few days ago, my mother wrote a letter and cried that my elder brother's illness has gotten worse.

360
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,300
It's also time for me to go back to see him.

361
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,850
What's wrong?

362
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,150
He suddenly fell sick and is weak right now.

363
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,140
Fortunately, a few days ago, fate intervened and we were lucky enough to invite High God Zhe Yan there.

364
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,880
I hope he can find out the reason for his illness.

365
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,500
With High God Zhe Yan there, you can be at ease.

366
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,030
Thank you for your kind blessings.

367
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,380
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

368
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,040
Tidy up the house.

369
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,070
Someone will be coming here to live tomorrow.

370
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,460
Come live here at the Courtyard of Moonlight?

371
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,070
Ah Li will be very happy to see her

372
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,080
and won't let her live anywhere else.

373
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,660
Is it that High Goddess?

374
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,770
Before Ah Li fell asleep, he kept calling her name.

375
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,070
He also said he liked eating with his mother at Green Hill.

376
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,080
He liked buying food and toys at Mushroom Market.

377
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,310
He thinks it's more fun than the Heavenly Palace.

378
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:38,220
His Majesty hasn't allowed anyone to enter this courtyard for the past 300 years.

379
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,540
That High Goddess is being given this special treatment because she's the next Heavenly Monarchess?

380
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,650
Your Highness.

381
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,310
I heard His Majesty has returned to the palace.

382
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,040
He left again.

383
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,290
Again?

384
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,620
Did he go to Green Hill again?

385
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,190
Did you speak to His Majesty?

386
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,830
No.

387
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,630
It's okay. There will eventually be an opportunity.

388
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,460
He's the crown prince.

389
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,100
He won't always be living in Green Hill.

390
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,930
And it doesn't matter if Bai Qian is the monarchess of Green Hill.

391
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:53,330
She has to enter our Pure Wutong Palace sooner or later.

392
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,640
After all, she's the Heavenly Tribe's crown princess.

393
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,160
We only need to wait patiently.

394
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,960
I understand.

395
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,390
Don't disappoint me.

396
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,600
I don't know how Teacher's body is doing.

397
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,870
I should go check.

398
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,390
Why are you up?

399
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,490
I want to see Teacher.

400
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,880
Did Ye Hua's immortal send these cases here again?

401
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,570
Yes. I fear Heavenly Monarch is going to let His Highness the Crown Prince succeed him.

402
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:07,040
The documents have been increasing.

403
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,240
Because His Highness was taking care of you for the past few days,

404
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,690
he didn't even read them, so I have been tidying up for him.

405
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,130
Where is Ye Hua?

406
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,340
He went back to the Heavenly Palace.

407
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,290
I think he should be back soon.

408
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,480
Go back to work.

409
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,940
I will take my time to walk to Splendid Flame Cave.

410
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,190
With Mi Gu here, he can indeed take care of you.

411
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,550
Teacher,

412
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:02,250
300 years ago, Zhe Yan told Seventeenth that you will wake up soon.

413
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,600
It's been 300 years,

414
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,330
yet you haven't moved.

415
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:11,250
I don't know if he was lying.

416
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:17,780
I've always been thinking when you wake up,

417
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:25,090
how happy everyone will be to reunite with everyone back at Kunlun Void.

418
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,970
No matter how I look at it, the scenery in Green Hill is still the best.

419
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,860
It's a shame that Ye Hua's just been making food for us since he's come here,

420
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,480
so I haven't gotten the chance to walk around with him.

421
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,290
Qian Qian.

422
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,770
Ye Hua! Ye Hua! You!

423
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,810
What are you doing, Ye Hua?

424
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,050
I thought you were going to throw yourself into the lake.

425
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:23,040
It was hot, so I...

426
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,190
Qian Qian,

427
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,000
I will never let you go again.

428
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,600
Weren't you reading documents inside the den?

429
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,010
Why did you... you suddenly come here?

430
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,020
Mi Gu brought food for you and discovered that you were missing.

431
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,470
He told me and I came looking for you.

432
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,970
Let's go back.

433
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,340
Ever since we came back from Grand Purple Palace, he has not asked me about Teacher.

434
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,440
It's strange.

435
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,780
Young Fifth, have you been drinking?

436
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,000
Why are you so red?

437
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,250
Our scenery at Green Hill is pleasant.

438
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:50,300
Hence, I brought His Highness the Crown Prince for a walk here.

439
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:55,290
A setting sun, mild wind, a pond full of floating lily fragrance.

440
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,490
It's fitting for a tryst.

441
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:06,090
Bi Fang wrote a letter day today to say that you were beaten by someone till you were half dead.

442
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:09,030
Your Fourth Older Brother and I used this once in a lifetime opportunity

443
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:13,390
to specially visit you and see how you were beaten till you were half dead.

444
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:21,010
When I was previously half dead, I definitely was a bit rude to recover before you had a chance to see.

445
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,410
I'm very sorry.

446
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,660
This time around, although the injuries were serious,

447
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,900
they were not enough to make me half dead.

448
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,810
I must have disappointed you.

449
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,700
Where did this anger come from?

450
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,880
Forget it.

451
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,850
Since you are angry, if I didn't bring this precious item, your anger won't dissipate.

452
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:47,460
Here. This fan is for you.

453
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,600
The painting was still personally drawn by the Water Monarch of the Western Sea.

454
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,370
You picked up a treasure this time.

455
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:56,090
Old phoenix, you really know to play by my interest in giving me an apology gift.

456
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,250
You're indeed smart.

457
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,600
But why did you two go to the Western Sea?

458
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,870
We bumped into the second prince of the Western Sea a few days ago,

459
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,300
and he said that he needed help from Zhe Yan.

460
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,980
Hence, we went there.

461
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,490
Is something wrong with Eldest Senior Brother?

462
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:15,780
So, you already told Ye Hua everything?

463
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:22,830
Old folks like us had to help you hide your past at Kunlun Void for so many years.

464
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:26,050
Since this is the case now, we can stop lying.

465
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:31,110
When Xuan Nü stole the divine body of Teacher,

466
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,130
Ye Hua helped me rescue him and bring him back.

467
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,620
Let's not talk about this. Your Fourth Brother and I went to the Western Sea, and we're very tired.

468
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,470
Let's go back to the fox den.

469
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,050
I never thought that someone could mock you to anger in a word fight.

470
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,310
High God Zhe Yan is really something.

471
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,510
He's much older than me. It's not a big deal to be angry with him.

472
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,960
If the junior immortals talk and offend me,

473
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,940
I wouldn't argue with them.

474
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,720
I hope you would argue with me.

475
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,550
What do I have to argue with you about?

476
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,460
Great Lady!

477
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,150
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

478
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:19,860
Li Jing, the Winged Monarch, sent an invitation. He would like to meet you.

479
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,380
He has been waiting at the entrance of the valley for half a day.

480
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,780
What does he want?

481
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,190
What a perfect time to be here.

482
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:31,030
Wow! We're so lucky today. We're just in time to watch a lively show.

483
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,550
Kick him out of the den.

484
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:38,760
Huh? Great Lady, he's waiting at the entrance of the valley.

485
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,100
He hasn't come to the den yet.

486
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,120
Let him be.

487
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,590
Whether it's kindness or a grudge, it needs to be resolved.

488
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,660
If you drag this out, it will be more troublesome.

489
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,110
There's no time like the present. Let's conclude this with him tonight.

490
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,370
I have nothing to conclude with him.

491
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,620
It ended a long time ago.

492
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,460
Your Fourth Brother came back and took over the study from me.

493
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,330
I won't be able to read the official documents tonight.

494
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:16,540
I could only come here to play chess with you.

495
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,920
I told Mi Gu to pack your clothes.

496
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,700
Come back to the Heavenly Palace with me tomorrow, okay?

497
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:09,340
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

498
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,490
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

499
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,090
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

500
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:19,430
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

501
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:28,530
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

502
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,650
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

503
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:37,910
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

504
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:43,860
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

505
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:50,520
♫ All are just illusions ♫

506
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:57,040
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

507
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,140
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

508
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:06,650
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

509
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:12,860
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

510
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:18,310
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

511
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:23,430
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

512
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:26,380
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

513
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:35,860
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

514
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,390
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

515
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:52,940
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

516
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,220
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

517
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:03,530
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

518
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:08,810
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

519
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:14,200
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

520
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,930
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

521
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:25,980
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

522
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:38,240
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
