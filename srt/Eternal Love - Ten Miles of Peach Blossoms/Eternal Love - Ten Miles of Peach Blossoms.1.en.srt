”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,490
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,990
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,580
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,160
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,380
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,180
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,780
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,290
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,990
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,450
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,930
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,420
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,000
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,600
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,060
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,520
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,050
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,060
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,790
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,210
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,790
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,940
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,890
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,330
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,900
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,090
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,800
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,920
[Episode 1]

31
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,310
Here! Here! Here!

32
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,450
Congratulations, Teacher, for obtaining this magical weapon!

33
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,660
Since the Donghuang Bell, no new weapon has come out of Kunlun Void.

34
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,060
Could it be I'll still have a new disciple?

35
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,050
Hurry!

36
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,300
This is Kunlun Void?

37
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,140
There's a shining object up there.

38
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,680
Once we get up there, you'll know if you just look at what it is.

39
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,610
Why did you turn me into a man?

40
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,850
Kunlun Void doesn't accept female disciples.

41
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,240
If you want to study from your teacher, you then must be a male. Young Fifth, remember this.

42
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,880
Starting now, you are no longer Bai Qian, the daughter of the Fox Emperor of Green Hills, but are Si Yin.

43
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,870
You are a wild fox that I've picked up

44
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,940
that I especially brought up to Kunlun Void to be a disciple of High God Mo Yuan.

45
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,220
Will others see through my disguise?

46
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,460
- It depends on luck.
- On luck?

47
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,520
Those disciples of Mo Yuan aren't that skilled to do so.

48
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,390
But as to if Mo Yuan will be able to find out that you're a female will depend on your luck today.

49
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,050
What?

50
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,870
Where did this stinky rascal come from?

51
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,610
He is actually competing with me in being taken in as a disciple.

52
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,780
Another ignorant and incompetent lad.

53
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,260
Relying on your family's elders to be your backers in getting a teacher.

54
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,270
High God Mo Yuan is the God of War, well-respected and worshiped in all realms.

55
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,370
Why would he accept a thin and weak fox like you?

56
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,410
This...

57
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,850
- Teacher!
- Teacher!

58
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,110
High God Zhe Yan.

59
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,660
Weird. This fan actually chose him to be its master.

60
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,370
I thought that the God of War in all realms would have three heads and six arms.

61
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,670
Turns out, he's a more handsome guy than Zhe Yan.

62
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,410
Could he have seen through the magic of Zhe Yan?

63
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,400
Si Yin, why don't you quickly greet High God Mo Yuan?

64
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,220
High God, I'm Si Yin from the Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms.

65
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,020
Because I've long admired your mighty name, I traveled far to take you as my teacher.

66
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,610
I hope you will accept me as your disciple.

67
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,870
This magical weapon has very strong power.

68
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,100
I mustn't give it to a non-member of Kunlun Void.

69
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,480
Looks like, she's fated to be my disciple.

70
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,630
High God.

71
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,550
What did you say your name was earlier?

72
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,530
High God, my name is Si Yin.

73
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,560
I'm Zi Lan.

74
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,180
My Kunlun Void already has 15 disciples.

75
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,960
Today, you two came at the same time to be my disciples.

76
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,720
If I agree, who should be the senior?

77
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,140
High God Zhe Yan, do you have any suggestions?

78
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,170
Zhe Yan, please. I don't want to be the junior.

79
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,720
This wild fox that I brought doesn't look very reliable.

80
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,150
How about let him be the junior then.

81
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,910
I won't be your disciple anymore then.

82
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,110
You rascal. You just said that you want to be taken in, and now you don't?!

83
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,810
What do you treat our Kunlun Void as?

84
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,540
Even if High God Zhe Yan was the one who brought you here, you're not allowed to insult our Kunlun Void like that!

85
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,140
Why don't you want to be my disciple now?

86
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,130
At home, I'm already the youngest just because I was born the latest.

87
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,080
How come I've to become the most junior again here?

88
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,980
Is it because I came up the mountain later than he did?

89
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,920
It's too unfair.

90
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,820
Then, I'll gift this fan to you as your magical weapon.

91
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,840
This should make it fair.

92
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,130
Teacher, this is the magical weapon that you just got today.

93
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,760
I don't know what good luck this little guy has.

94
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,520
Kunlun Void finally gets a magical weapon in thousands of years, and it was given to him?!

95
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,910
- That's right. That's right.
- That is too unfair.

96
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,370
High God, you mustn't lie to me.

97
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,350
I've never lied to anyone.

98
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,950
Okay then.

99
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,120
Then, I'll acknowledge you as my teacher.

100
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,180
Bow.

101
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,310
Rise.

102
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,400
Bow again.

103
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,070
Rise.

104
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,840
Third bow.

105
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,540
Rise.

106
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,250
From today, you two will be disciples of God of War, Mo Yuan, of Kunlun Void.

107
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,250
You will be the sixteenth disciple, Divine Monarch Zi Lan.

108
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,980
Thank you, Teacher!

109
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,000
You will be the seventeenth disciple, Divine Monarch Si Yin.

110
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,770
Thank you, Teacher!

111
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,380
Teacher, what's the name of this fan?

112
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,830
Kunlun Fan of Yuqing.

113
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,580
Greetings, Heavenly Monarch.

114
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,250
- Rise.
- Thank you, Heavenly Monarch.

115
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,310
Greetings, Father Monarch.

116
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,960
Our messenger from Kunlun Void said that Mo Yuan had accepted two disciples today.

117
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,680
He also gifted the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing to his most junior disciple.

118
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,080
His name is Si Yin.

119
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,300
He was a wild fox that High God Zhe Yan picked up during his travels.

120
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,620
What?

121
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,170
The magical weapons of Kunlun Void have the power to send a frightening shock throughout the four oceans.

122
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,630
Mo Yuan actually gave it to a wild fox?!

123
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,660
Ten thousand years ago, Father God returned to a formless mass.

124
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,840
The gods of the ancient world also left one by one.

125
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,030
As of today, in all realms, only the Dragon Tribe of the Heavenly Tribes,

126
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,210
the Phoenix Tribe, and the Nine-Tailed White Fox Tribe have descendants remaining.

127
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,580
Among these divine tribes, their statuses are very noble.

128
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,510
I'm a descendant of the Nine-Tailed White Fox Tribe,

129
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,170
the only daughter of the Fox Emperor Bai Zhi, and named Bai Qian.

130
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,200
Too bad, because I was too naughty when I was younger, I had caused a lot of troubles.

131
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,090
Just to look for someone to control me, my parents had Zhe Yan, that old phoenix, turn me into a man.

132
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:33,190
I changed my name to Si Yin and got sent to Kunlun Void to be a disciple of Zhe Yan's little brother, High God Mo Yuan.

133
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,840
In the blink of an eye, it's already been 20,000 years.

134
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,800
Extend your hand.

135
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,390
Aiya, Miss, upon rubbing your bone, your love fate seems to be a rough one.

136
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,230
How dare you!

137
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,570
Hey, Miss, Miss, don't listen to his nonsense.

138
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,450
He doesn't really know any fortune telling.

139
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,480
Come to my stall. I'll calculate your fortune.

140
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,300
You want to steal my business, is that it?

141
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,660
Hey, why don't you consider that you've stolen so many of my clients just because you're fairer and more handsome?

142
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,270
Miss, this way please. This way please.

143
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,110
Here. Sit down.

144
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,270
Miss, have you encountered any problems?

145
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,580
Let go.

146
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,380
You even have a strong personality.

147
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,420
- It's starting again.
- Every time we come down to the mortal realm, we always encounter a good maiden getting harassed by a local tyrant.

148
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,940
As long as she's not yet married, there surely will be a hero passing by who will save her.

149
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,530
If she's married, her husband would surely come out of nowhere to save her.

150
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,660
- No matter if he's a hero...
- Or a husband...

151
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,630
- He swill urely be dressed in white.
- He will surely be dressed in white.

152
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,290
Stop that!

153
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,130
Local tyrant! Let that lady go!

154
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,650
- Let's go.
- Yes. If we stay a bit longer, we'll get found out by Teacher.

155
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,190
Men, attack!

156
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,690
Hit him!

157
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,500
Hit him!

158
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,980
Hurry! Teacher will soon realize we ran out.

159
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,370
What he's holding is the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing.

160
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,240
Looks like he's Si Yin.

161
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,970
High God, do you want us to teach him a lesson?

162
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,450
No need to do it now.

163
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,840
- Teacher, please have some tea.
- Hurry. Kneel down. Kneel down.

164
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,050
You went to the mortal realm again?

165
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,730
Teacher, don't make things difficult for them.

166
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,340
They went to the mortal realm this time just to touch bones and predict fortunes for fun.

167
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,780
They didn't really induce any huge trouble.

168
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,910
Eldest Senior, you're the best.

169
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,640
Are you saying that I am deliberately making things hard on you two?

170
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,980
No. I... Eldest Senior!

171
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,100
Teacher, you just came back to Kunlun Void today. Go rest early.

172
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,820
My juniors will surely not cause any big trouble.

173
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,180
Just leave them to my care.

174
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,620
I'm a bit tired. You all can leave.

175
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,810
- Yes, Teacher!
- Yes, Teacher!

176
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,390
Seventeenth, you stay behind.

177
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:41,260
Yesterday, I passed by Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms and got you three jugs of peach blossoms wine from Zhe Yan.

178
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,870
Peach blossoms wine that Zhe Yan personally made?

179
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,530
It is indeed a wine that Zhe Yan made.

180
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,500
Thank you, Teacher.

181
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,070
The wine is indeed good, but don't drink too much, so you won't harm your health.

182
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,170
Teacher, don't worry.

183
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,370
I understand.

184
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,320
Small sips of wine can make one happy, but getting drunk will harm the body.

185
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,250
Teacher, why did you get me some wine?

186
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,740
Isn't it your birthday tomorrow?

187
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,510
That's right! Tomorrow is my birthday.

188
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,100
I even forgot about it.

189
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,340
Thank you, Teacher. You really treat me so well.

190
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,150
You treat me better than that old phoenix.

191
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,560
Who could that be? She can even travel freely in Kunlun Void.

192
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,400
Are you that lady?

193
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,670
That's right. Who you had met today is our High Goddess.

194
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,890
Do you know who she is?

195
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:33,370
She's High Goddess Yao Guang, the one who once fought alongside High God Mo Yuan.

196
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,090
High Goddess Yao Guang?

197
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:40,970
Oh, no! Eldest Senior said that High Goddess Yao Guang has always loved Teacher.

198
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,990
She even transferred her immortal manor to Kunlun Void just for Teacher.

199
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,090
Could it be that just to lure Teacher to duel with her

200
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,660
and use it to develop a bit of mutual respect and affection,

201
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,570
she's especially using me as a bait?

202
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,840
Don't go in a daze. We're not done speaking.

203
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,310
Although you have committed such a grave crime, my High Goddess is very benevolent.

204
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,560
Starting today, just follow my High Goddess and be her disciple.

205
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,470
Focus on cultivating, so your naughty attitude to play in the secular world can decrease.

206
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,980
I'm already the seventeenth disciple of High God Mo Yuan, Si Yin.

207
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,510
How could I transfer to another teacher? Don't even think about it.

208
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,900
How dare you!

209
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,230
Mo Yuan is such a magnificent god.

210
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,270
How could he have a naughty and mischievous disciple like you?

211
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:39,290
As a woman, it's not embarrassing to admire an outstanding man.

212
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:45,430
But to abduct his disciple, so you can have interactions with him, is very shameful.

213
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,150
Stop making up lies.

214
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,500
You're the one who's lying.

215
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,870
My teacher is good to me because he pities my background, and I was entrusted to him by an old friend.

216
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,190
But you abducted me here.

217
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,860
Not only do you want me to accept you as my teacher, you even immobilized me.

218
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,150
A single finger of my teacher is a thousand times stronger than you.

219
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,500
You want me to acknowledge you as my teacher? Don't even think about it.

220
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,620
Do you dare say that again?

221
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,860
A single finger of my teacher is a thousand times stronger than you.

222
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,990
You want me to acknowledge you as my teacher? Don't even think about it.

223
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,590
Okay. Okay.

224
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,460
Since you are this stubborn, take him to the Water Prison.

225
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,350
- Lock him up for three days first.
- Yes.

226
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,310
A little fox monster like you dared to contradict a high goddess?

227
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,550
You deserve to suffer in this Water Prison.

228
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,840
The Water Prison of our immortal manor can really wear an individual down.

229
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,670
Every hour, it will fill up to the brim.

230
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,850
Just slowly enjoy it, little fox.

231
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,350
Isn't it just a water prison?

232
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,020
You guys are for real?! Hey!

233
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,510
Let go of me!

234
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,570
Let me out! Let me out!

235
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,550
Help!

236
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,490
Help! Let me out!

237
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,790
Let me out!

238
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,280
Let me out! Help!

239
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,030
She's not in the forest.

240
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,780
- We didn't find him.
- He's not by the lotus pond, either.

241
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,760
- Not in the back mountain, either.
- He's also not in the back palace hall.

242
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,090
- Nobody found him?
- No.

243
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,420
Seventeenth loves to drink. How could he let the wine jars just shatter like that?

244
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,090
He must have been taken away in a hurry for the wine jars to shatter on the ground.

245
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,910
Who dares to abduct people in our Kunlun Void?

246
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,370
Could it be the Winged Tribe?

247
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,750
- Winged Tribe?
- No, it can't be.

248
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,700
Unless it's Winged Monarch Qing Cang.

249
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,840
Other than him, any Winged Tribesmen daring to enter Kunlun Void will get his evil power suppressed by the dragon energy.

250
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,230
They couldn't have defeated Seventeenth.

251
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,300
It must be someone other than the Winged Tribe.

252
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,940
Even I couldn't catch up with him, and he was able to abduct Seventeenth.

253
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,970
It means that person is very familiar with Kunlun Void.

254
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,800
But other than disciples of Kunlun Void, who else is very familiar with...

255
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,410
Could it be High Goddess Yao Guang?

256
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:54,160
That's right. Other than us, High Goddess Yao Guang is the most familiar with this place.

257
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,160
You all look again. Ling Yu and I will go find Teacher.

258
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,100
- Yes!
- Yes!

259
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,130
- Teacher.
- Teacher.

260
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,260
Seventeenth is missing.

261
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,840
Missing?

262
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,740
- Have you looked for him in the wine cellar?
- We did.

263
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,000
Teacher, we are guessing that...

264
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,470
Say it.

265
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,920
Ninth Junior Brother heard wine jars breaking before he saw a black shadow pass by.

266
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,910
He tried to pursue it, but he failed.

267
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,350
Afterwards, we discovered that Seventeenth was missing.

268
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,780
Teacher, think about it. Even Ninth Junior couldn't catch up with her.

269
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,690
That person must be very familiar with Kunlun Void.

270
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,510
Also, other than us, only High Goddess Yao Guang has set up her manor here in Kunlun Void.

271
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:55,030
We are guessing that Seventeenth might have been tactless and offended one of High Goddess Yao Guang's subordinates,

272
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,120
but we can't dare to just go there and ask for him.

273
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:20,180
After an hour, bring him up.

274
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,580
- Convince him in a nice way to leave Mo Yuan.
- Yes.

275
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,710
I don't know why High God Mo Yuan favors him a lot.

276
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,690
Could it be he was really bewitched by this lad's face?

277
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,960
Mo Yuan?

278
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,830
Is my disciple in your water prison?

279
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,710
High God Mo Yuan, are you listening to other people's instagations?

280
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,920
How could my water prison have a disciple from Kunlun Void?

281
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,000
We have known each other for tens of thousands of years.

282
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,860
You know that I don't like wasting time talking. Move aside.

283
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,350
Mo Yuan,

284
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,050
this place is my, Yao Guang's, immortal manor.

285
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,350
How could I allow you to trespass just as you want?

286
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,060
Move aside.

287
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,480
I respect you as the God of War, but this place is a restricted area of my manor.

288
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,100
Without my permission, even the Heavenly Monarch won't dare to take a step in.

289
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,880
- High Goddess!
- High Goddess!

290
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,630
Mo Yuan!

291
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,690
- Teacher, you're here.
- Seventeenth, can you still hold on?

292
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,940
I just got submerged in the water a few times.

293
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,810
I'm not that delicate.

294
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,540
Overnight, you have made progress.

295
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,540
You now know to act tough.

296
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:26,930
I still want to drink some peach blossoms wine and celebrate my birthday.

297
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,540
Seventeenth!

298
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,330
- Mo Yuan. Mo Yuan, listen to me!
- No need for more words.

299
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:44,950
I was afraid that if you overly spoiled this disciple, you'd invite gossip from the Heavenly Palace.

300
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,840
When have I feared that gossip of others?

301
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,220
I'm doing all these things for your sake.

302
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,200
You are a direct son of Father God.

303
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,890
You are the God of War. You should be respected by all realms.

304
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:04,120
You shouldn't get criticized just because of a measly disciple like him.

305
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:11,640
On the 17th day of the second month, at the peak of Cangwu, I will clear this debt with you on that day.

306
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,700
He actually invited me to the peak of Cangwu?!

307
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,150
He actually wants to clear this debt with me?!

308
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,230
Teacher.

309
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,280
Teacher...

310
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,250
Teacher!

311
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,890
Teacher!

312
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:01,320
- Teacher! I'm in pain.
- Teacher...

313
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,470
It's fine.

314
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,950
I'll take care of him.

315
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,460
I'll go check the medicine if it's ready.

316
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,770
Teacher...

317
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,160
- Teacher...
- It's fine now.

318
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,800
I will protect you.

319
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:25,780
That high goddess isn't good enough for my teacher.

320
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,190
She's not worthy.

321
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,300
- High God.
- Your First Highness.

322
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,400
Why did you come at this late hour to Kunlun Void?

323
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,390
My father heard that you will be having a duel with High Goddess Yao Guang at the peak of Cangwu.

324
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,710
He especially sent me to mediate.

325
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,490
High God, you know that the relationship between the Heavenly and Winged Tribes are not the same as before.

326
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,290
The Winged Monarch, Qing Cang, can come up with any reason any time to start a war with the Heavenly Tribes.

327
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:17,620
It is indeed inappropriate for the harmonious relationship between you two high gods to be destroyed just for a trifle matter like that.

328
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,380
High God, must you really fight her?

329
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,840
I must fight.

330
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,880
Or else, I cannot give everyone in Kunlun Void an explanation.

331
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,050
The Kunlun Void is a sacred place of the Divine Tribes.

332
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:38,210
How could anyone just trespass or abduct anyone as they please?

333
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,190
Your First Highness, am I right?

334
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,760
You are right, High God.

335
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,610
But Your First Highness, don't worry.

336
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,540
Ask Heavenly Monarch not to worry, either.

337
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,900
This is just a private conflict between me and Yao Guang.

338
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,230
If one day, the Heavenly Tribes and Winged Tribe go to war,

339
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:04,620
both Kunlun Void and the Yao Guang Manor will do our best to join in the fight.

340
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,670
This is great righteousness.

341
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,640
High God, you are right.

342
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:29,000
Father Monarch, that is what High God Mo Yuan said.

343
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,320
Before, that wild fox obtained the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing.

344
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,270
It already shocked me.

345
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,030
Today, High God Mo Yuan got angry because of him,

346
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,970
to the point that he doesn't mind fighting with High Goddess Yao Guang.

347
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,710
If given a chance, I really want to meet that lad.

348
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:52,580
I want to see what qualities he has for High God Mo Yuan to give so much importance to him.

349
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,890
Wow! Look!

350
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,570
Teacher won.

351
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,010
Our teacher is the God of War. How could he lose?

352
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,490
- Correct!
- Hey!

353
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,340
I lost.

354
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,950
I don't have any complaints.

355
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,970
High Goddess, please leave Kunlun Void then.

356
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,790
Mo Yuan!

357
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,680
High Goddess, what else do you need?

358
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,950
In the past, during the great battle between the gods and demons,

359
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,580
we were comrades.

360
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,510
But now....

361
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:46,220
Now, I fear that that affection has weakened.

362
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,460
We never had a close relationship.

363
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,240
High Goddess, you are exaggerating.

364
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:12,060
Another female immortal who got brokenhearted because of Teacher.

365
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,980
Teacher dotes on Seventeenth the most.

366
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,710
That's her fault for messing with Seventeenth.

367
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,910
Enough already. Let's not let Teacher discover us.

368
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,730
- Quickly go back.
- Hurry! Hurry!

369
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,560
Little Seventeenth, you're awake. Do you feel better?

370
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,420
I'm fine, Eldest Senior Brother.

371
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,340
I even thought that I'd be locked up in that water prison for half a month.

372
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,360
You fell asleep the moment we came back to Kunlun Void.

373
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,150
You were even hugging Teacher's hand, complaining of how painful you felt.

374
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,650
He couldn't pull his hand away no matter how he tried.

375
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:12,300
Teacher felt bad hearing your complaints, and would pat your back while saying comforting words.

376
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,820
"Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. I am here."

377
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:20,100
You really looked like a little child at that time.

378
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:28,500
- I'm going to look for Teacher.
- Teacher is having a duel with High Goddess Yao Guang at the peak of Cangwu.

379
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,450
I still have to see Teacher!

380
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,840
With your weak cloud-riding technique, Teacher would be back before you even reach Cangwu.

381
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,530
Eldest Senior. Seventeenth, you're awake.

382
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,430
Eat something.

383
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,750
Also, Teacher instructed me to tell you

384
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,720
that you must copy the Chongxu Sutra 30,000 times in half a month as your punishment.

385
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,710
30,000 times?

386
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,970
Oh, right. A woman is in the adjacent receiving hall. She said that she's from Green Hill.

387
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,080
Woman?

388
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,990
Xuan Nü?

389
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,310
There is actually someone who looks like Bai Qian more than I do?

390
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,800
He's even a male.

391
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,790
Where did you come from, Younger Sister?

392
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:40,790
You look quite a lot like me.

393
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,610
Divine Monarch Si Yin, my name is Xuan Nü.

394
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,980
I'm the little sister of High God Bai Xuan's wife.

395
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,930
Oh, you're from Green Hill?

396
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,710
I seem to have heard them mention you.

397
00:34:54,710 --> 00:35:00,120
I heard from my older sister that you had lived with High God Zhe Yan for thousands of years.

398
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,280
You have a good relationship with the gods of Green Hill.

399
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,500
Right. Before, when I was living in Zhe Yan's place, I would frequently call them older brothers together with Bai Qian.

400
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,010
I would frequently call them older brothers together with Bai Qian.

401
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,480
Are you talking about Qian Qian?

402
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,680
Talking about it, it's been more than ten thousand years since I last saw her.

403
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,880
She is the little sister of Green Hill's Bai Xuan's wife.

404
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,650
He is Die Feng, my eldest senior, the first disciple of God of War Mo Yuan,

405
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:36,510
and the second prince of the Water Monarch of the West Sea.

406
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,970
Previously, I didn't know that you had such a noble status.

407
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,530
I was disrespectful.

408
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,410
Here in Kunlun Void, we don't have any past status.

409
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,610
We're all just disciples of Teacher. No need to be that courteous.

410
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,140
Yes.

411
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,760
Since you are acquainted, you two can chat. I'll get going now.

412
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,270
Okay.

413
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,720
Divine Monarch Si Yin, this is a letter from High God Bai Zhen.

414
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,800
Everything that he wants to relay to you are in this letter.

415
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,530
A letter from Fourth Older Brother? Why didn't he personally come?

416
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:18,020
The young princess of High God Bai Yi will soon be born.

417
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,730
All the gods of Green Hill have gone there.

418
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:26,410
When I left Green Hill, Second Older Brother and Second Sister-in-Law were just married.

419
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,080
How come she's already giving birth?

420
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,380
You already know that it's a girl even if it hasn't been born yet?

421
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,520
With Zhe Yan around, it would be hard not to know it.

422
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,100
Let me... Let me just read this.

423
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:49,210
Young Fifth, Xuan Nü is being forced by her parents to marry a blind bear.

424
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,130
She escaped and hid in Eldest Brother's manor.

425
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,810
Eldest Sister-in-Law was afraid that she couldn't hide her,

426
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,100
so then I thought of you.

427
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,920
Kunlun Void is a sacred place of the Heavenly Tribe.

428
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,180
Ordinary people will not think about searching there.

429
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,770
- Let Xuan Nü hide there for a while. Just treat it as helping Eldest Sister-in-Law.
- Me?

430
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:06,330
Why aren't you the one accepting this hot potato? You just have to throw it to me.

431
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,930
I also feel that throwing you this hot potato is unfair.

432
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:13,970
But here in Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms, there are only me and Zhe Yan, who are two men.

433
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,630
How could we take care of an unmarried lady? You are a girl.

434
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,100
You've also known Xuan Nü since you were little.

435
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,740
I'm at ease to hand her to you.

436
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,070
Oh, right. She doesn't know that you're Bai Qian of Green Hill.

437
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,350
I didn't tell her.

438
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,150
I'm done reading.

439
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:40,780
Fourth Older Brother just throwing you to me like this is quite a difficult matter for me to handle.

440
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:47,360
Divine Monarch, if you really find it difficult, I'll then...

441
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,630
- I...
- Don't cry!

442
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:55,120
I must ask my teacher if I can let you stay here.

443
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,120
Wait for me here.

444
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,080
Don't cry.

445
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,920
- Eldest Senior Brother.
- Seventeenth?

446
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,400
Didn't you want to keep your cousin company? Why are you here?

447
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,440
There are some things that I need Teacher's permission first.

448
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,970
If you say that she's not your little sister, I really wouldn't believe it.

449
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,040
Standing side by side, you two look very much alike.

450
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,080
The universe is so vast.

451
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,070
There will always be coincidences.

452
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:39,720
Eldest Senior Brother, should I allow Xuan Nü to stay?

453
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,820
You said that Xuan Nü ran away from home because she was being forced to marry.

454
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,090
She has nowhere to go, so she came to Kunlun Void.

455
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:50,130
If that's the case, it's not a problem to let her live here for a few days.

456
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,810
Will Teacher agree to that?

457
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,220
Before, when High Goddess Yao Guang had an unrequited love towards Teacher,

458
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,740
she even moved her whole manor here.

459
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,870
Teacher didn't give too much attention to it.

460
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,380
He even instructed us saying that all who come are guests.

461
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,860
We should try to accommodate them as much as we can.

462
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,800
Now, Xuan Nü is just going to live here for a few days.

463
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,980
I think Teacher will not mind it.

464
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,500
But there are only male disciples here in the whole Kunlun Void.

465
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,510
Where will she live?

466
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,470
Live in your courtyard.

467
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,450
- Teacher.
- Teacher.

468
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,740
The whole Kunlun Void is made up of male disciples.

469
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,770
It's not convenient for her to live in another place.

470
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:31,280
Since she came here to look for you, it's most proper for her to live in your courtyard.

471
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,570
I'm also a male.

472
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,960
Teacher, your words are very reasonable.

473
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,290
Since she came to look for me, I must take care of her.

474
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,470
How is your punishment going?

475
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,610
What?

476
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:58,250
Didn't Ling Yu tell you?

477
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:09,850
Teacher, after copying the Chongxu Sutra 30,000 times, my fox claws will become crippled.

478
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,550
Can you decrease it a little?

479
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,090
No.

480
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:18,060
Okay, Teacher. I'll do my punishment after settling down Xuan Nü.

481
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,100
Master, I'll go back to organizing the scrolls then.

482
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,450
This place is adjacent to where I live.

483
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,870
Just live here first. Tell me if you need anything.

484
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,520
Thank you, Divine Monarch, for taking me in.

485
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:54,580
Don't thank me. If not because my teacher agreed, no one would dare let a woman stay in Kunlun Void.

486
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,240
Divine Monarch!

487
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,350
When you were living in Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms,

488
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,580
did anyone tell you that you look identical to Qian Qian?

489
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,930
People frequently said that.

490
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,880
Fourth Older Brother even said that she and I were like twins.

491
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,480
You also look quite like her.

492
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,490
It's just a coincidence.

493
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,580
She's the future female monarch of Green Hills.

494
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,750
How could I compare to her?

495
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,560
I fear that hiding here might not work, either.

496
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,130
In the end, I still have to marry that black bear sprite.

497
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,100
Don't be pessimistic.

498
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,030
Maybe, after sleeping, everything will change by tomorrow.

499
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:37,410
I won't talk to you anymore. I'm going to do my punishment.

500
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:05,750
Little golden lotus, starting today,

501
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,900
I'm going to copy the Chongxu Sutra 30,000 times.

502
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,190
I won't be able to take care of you anymore.

503
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,720
I'll just take care of you when I'm back.

504
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,730
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

505
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,680
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

506
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,430
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

507
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:14,850
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

508
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:23,780
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

509
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,030
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

510
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:33,380
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

511
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:40,700
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

512
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,430
♫ All are just illusions ♫

513
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,440
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

514
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,630
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

515
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:02,010
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

516
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:08,390
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

517
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:13,720
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

518
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:18,980
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

519
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,700
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

520
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:30,780
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

521
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:42,870
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden as a dream ♫

522
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:48,400
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

523
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,790
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

524
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:59,000
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

525
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,290
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms bloom again? ♫

526
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:09,750
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

527
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,410
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

528
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:21,620
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

529
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:34,050
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
