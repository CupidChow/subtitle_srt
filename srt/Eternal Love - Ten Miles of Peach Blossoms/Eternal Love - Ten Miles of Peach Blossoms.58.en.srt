”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,540
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,030
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,560
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,110
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,380
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,140
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,740
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,210
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,820
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,340
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,850
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,350
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,990
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,470
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,170
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,490
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,070
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,990
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,680
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,160
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,700
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,960
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,830
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,480
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,840
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,060
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,730
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Episode 58]

31
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,230
Husband! Husband!

32
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,860
- Husband!
- Let go!

33
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,570
I don't want to see you ever again!

34
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,010
Husband, don't leave! Husband!

35
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,580
I know what you're going to say, Fourth Older Brother.

36
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,180
I think this tribulation from the Heavenly Monarch to her is too harsh, too.

37
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,720
It must be because of Ye Hua.

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,490
I've gotten everything she owed me.

39
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,720
She has nothing to do with me anymore.

40
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,920
Fourth Older Brother, you especially brought me here to see her, didn't you?

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,050
If you say so.

42
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,540
I'm tired from walking.

43
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,790
Let's go drink some tea.

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,630
Owner, some tea, please.

45
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,530
Sure.

46
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,140
Customers—

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,360
Si Yin?

48
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,730
Yan Zhi.

49
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,160
It's been 70,000 years since we last saw each other, right?

50
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,220
You two talk. I'll go shop around.

51
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,160
That's right.

52
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,680
We haven't seen each other since the battle at Ruoshui.

53
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,420
Thank you for talking to me.

54
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,940
Si Yin, you were Si Yin when I knew you.

55
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,940
So... can I call you that?

56
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,760
Sure.

57
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,090
Do you know, Si Yin?

58
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:32,810
As soon as I saw you, I recalled when I was younger.

59
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,610
When we created a scene at Grand Purple Palace,

60
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,130
my second older brother was there, too.

61
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,680
Mother, this lady is so pretty.

62
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,990
You're pretty, too.

63
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,370
Mother!

64
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,270
Mother, do you not want me anymore?

65
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,660
Why wouldn't I want you anymore?

66
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,080
I've been thinking about you these past 3 years.

67
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,420
Then, why haven't you visited me?

68
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,680
I've been sleeping for the past 3 years.

69
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,840
I wasn't awake.

70
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,020
I finally woke up yesterday.

71
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,960
I was planning on taking a walk in the Mortal Realm, then going to find you in the Heavenly Palace.

72
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,680
Who knew you would come to me instead.

73
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,600
When I was on the cloud and passing by, I saw an auspicious aura from a high god.

74
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,800
I wanted to see which high god it was.

75
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,320
That's why I saw you.

76
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,860
- Ah Li!
- Greetings, Uncle.

77
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,270
You're so polite, Young Heavenly Grandchild.

78
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,890
Greetings, High Goddess and High God.

79
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,200
Where are you taking little Ah Li?

80
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,780
Is it not convenient for you to say?

81
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,980
What's there that's not convenient to say?

82
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,450
Mother, I'm going to the Sea of Innocence to worship Father.

83
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,590
Come with me, okay?

84
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,150
Sea of Innocence?

85
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,260
Greetings, Heavenly Monarch.

86
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,330
Rise.

87
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,170
Thank you, Heavenly Monarch.

88
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,740
A few years ago, you were falsely accused.

89
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,190
I mistakenly blamed you and caused you to undergo tribulation for sixty years.

90
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:38,360
Yuan Zhen, tell me how I should repay you?

91
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,620
Heavenly Monarch, I don't think that I had suffered for those sixty years.

92
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,260
Hence, I don't need any rewards from you.

93
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,570
So stubborn.

94
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,620
How presumptuous.

95
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,570
It's fine.

96
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,090
I always differentiate between rewards and punishments.

97
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,230
Speak.

98
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,350
I want to see High Goddess Bai Qian.

99
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,650
It's just because High Goddess has too much seniority that I didn't dare to request to see her in Green Hill.

100
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,990
Why are you so stupid?

101
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,860
What you shouldn't talk about, you insist on doing so.

102
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,510
You can't mention Bai Qian here.

103
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,450
Don't you know that?

104
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,160
Ye Hua had passed away 3 years ago.

105
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,200
There's not much taboo about this.

106
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,330
Yuan Zhen, tell me.

107
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:57,020
Why do you want to go to Green Hill to see High Goddess Bai Qian?

108
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,960
She was my teacher in the Mortal Realm.

109
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,530
Being a teacher for a day will be my father forever.

110
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,660
So I want to greet her and thank her for taking care of me in the Mortal Realm.

111
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:17,020
I believe High Goddess Bai Qian will be glad to hear your words.

112
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:22,880
But regarding this, let's talk about it another time.

113
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,150
His Highness the Crown Prince used his spirit as a sacrifice to the Donghuang Bell at an early age.

114
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:47,060
Didn't I tell you the worst thing to mention here is the deceased crown prince and his wife who didn't get to marry him?

115
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,130
I don't understand. Why can't I mention it?

116
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,660
Then tell me, what do you understand?

117
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,570
You shouldn't roughhouse, either.

118
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,320
Although you are His Highness the Crown Prince's cousin,

119
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,760
we're still male and female and cannot touch one another.

120
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,270
That's right!

121
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,820
Are you holding onto any treasures?

122
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,930
What do you want?

123
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,710
I borrowed some silver from an immortal friend and wanted to return it to her.

124
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,900
I don't believe you. You always fool me.

125
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,000
Your words are never true.

126
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,280
You always hold this Cloud-Breaking Fan as if it's a treasure.

127
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,160
So I'm going to steal it to make you mad.

128
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,830
Mother, who was that lady?

129
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,190
She's the former monarchess of Green Hill, High Goddess Bai Qian.

130
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,110
I understand.

131
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,570
It's going to rain.

132
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,390
Let's pack everything and go inside.

133
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,930
Mother, do you miss Father?

134
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,520
I always miss your father.

135
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:33,160
I remember when your father single-handedly slashed the four ferocious beasts kept by the Heavenly Monarch

136
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,400
and also sank Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea.

137
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,410
It was a heroic moment.

138
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,580
Father was the son of Father God.

139
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,450
Of course, no one can defeat him.

140
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,180
Thinking about this, I'm fortunate.

141
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,500
Father God had two sons.

142
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,550
One was my teacher and the other was my husband.

143
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:04,900
Since then, I have never looked at any other men.

144
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:13,400
Seventeenth, you really know how to boast that you don't even want your reputation.

145
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,960
For the past 3 years, it has indeed been lonely.

146
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,580
Someone is finally here to see me.

147
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,280
Let's go.

148
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,010
That's His Highness the Crown Prince's mystic crystal coffin.

149
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,580
I know. His parents carried him out from Green Hill in this mystic crystal coffin back then.

150
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,080
Father Monarch, I'm not filial.

151
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,610
I only visited you in this Sea of Innocence after three years.

152
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,750
For the past three years, I was confined in Pure Wutong Palace and had to study every day.

153
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,800
Grandmother kept watch on me and refused to let me leave.

154
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,490
Father Monarch, I miss you.

155
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,880
You are sleeping here.

156
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,540
It's considered as resting, too.

157
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,500
There won't be endless official documents again or expeditions to the universe again.

158
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,700
Come here.

159
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:44,210
♫ The wind blows the lock to my memories open ♫

00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:50,090
♫ I remembered our past ♫

161
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,470
♫ We once promised in love ♫

162
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,820
♫ We once missed out in regret ♫

163
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,550
♫ Peach blossoms drift down ♫

164
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:03,580
♫ The light fragrant hiding the bitter anguish ♫

165
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,470
♫ The moon paints ten miles of night with light ♫

166
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:16,860
♫ It brings up the loneliness in my eyes ♫

167
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:23,460
♫ My unwillingness to leave you has been drowned by vicissitudes of life ♫

168
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,140
♫ Three thousand years have flown by ♫

169
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:30,120
♫ My heart is driven to distraction ♫

170
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,440
♫ My heart is driven to distraction ♫

171
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,790
♫ Bleak yearning, my heart has shattered beyond repair ♫

172
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,360
♫ I cannot cut apart our entanglements ♫

173
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,520
♫ The harder I try to forget, the more it engraved ♫

174
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,850
♫ I’ve forgotten and become drunk ♫

175
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,050
♫ I thought I could let go ♫

176
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:56,520
♫ But after I awake from my dream, I remember you and my tears flow ♫

177
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,560
Ye Hua?

178
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,560
Ah Li.

179
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,630
Mother, I'm going back to the Heavenly Palace.

180
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,450
It's your birthday next month.

181
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,160
I will visit you at Green Hill.

182
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,740
Ah Li, if you have too many books to read, you can read less.

183
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,380
I only want you to be happy.

184
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,850
I don't wish you to become the emperor of Heaven.

185
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,640
I'm the eldest son of Crown Prince Ye Hua of Nine Heavens.

186
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,270
I can't slack off in my studies.

187
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:04,330
Although I'm not that smart as Father Monarch, I still need to work hard for him.

188
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,860
You are indeed like Ye Hua and unlike me at all.

189
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,330
Fourth Older Brother, I listened to a performance yesterday and haven't fully enjoyed myself yet.

190
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,970
Go back to Peace Blossom first.

191
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,900
I'm going to listen again.

192
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,290
Fine. Don't listen till you forget the time.

193
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,450
[Gathering Teahouse]

194
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,310
Reporting, Heavenly Monarch.

195
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:37,450
Since this morning, the Icy Mystic Crystal Coffin that holds His Highness the Crown Prince's body has created a lot of divine mist suddenly.

196
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,090
No one can get close.

197
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,640
I thought something was not right and came here to report.

198
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,950
Ye Hua's spirit has dispersed.

199
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,320
How could there be such a big and strong immortal mist protecting him?

200
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,440
Maybe... Ye Hua isn't dead at all!

201
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,390
Ye Hua. Ye Hua is coming back!

202
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,710
Leave now, younger generation.

203
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,100
Don't tell this matter to anyone.

204
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,520
- Yes.
- Yes.

205
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:20,130
Can you go ask High God Mo Yuan to personally check the Sea of Innocence?

206
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,100
I'll go to Kunlun Void to ask my teacher immediately.

207
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,160
Ye Hua,

208
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,390
if it weren't for this Icy Mystic Crystal Coffin and Sea of Innocence,

209
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,490
Seventeenth would have had to wait for you for many more years.

210
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,630
Mo Yuan.

211
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,200
High God Mo Yuan.

212
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,460
Go find Seventeenth.

213
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,130
She's been waiting for 3 years.

214
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,000
She made a cenotaph for you.

215
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,210
It's in Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms.

216
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,520
Thank you,

217
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,070
Big Brother.

218
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,940
Nice! Nice!

219
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,010
Please go upstairs.

220
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,630
You're here!

221
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,940
You came to find me?

222
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,550
Yes, it's hard to find a playmate.

223
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:02,320
But why is this play still so miserable?

224
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,590
Life can't always be smooth.

225
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,410
This performance is already considered not bad.

226
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:14,620
But every time when I watch this play, I would think of my talented older cousin who died early.

227
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,920
- You have an older cousin?
- Yes.

228
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,590
He's really handsome.

229
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,190
All the women who see him fall in love.

230
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,160
They all want to marry him.

231
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,800
It's a shame that his fate was unfortunate.

232
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,310
He was young but died on a battlefield.

233
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:36,450
He left behind a pair of old sorrowful parents and one young son who cries all day long.

234
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,690
He's pitiful.

235
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,020
What's most scary is white-haired people who have to send off the black-haired people.

236
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,050
Your older cousin is pitiful, but his parents are more pitiful.

237
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,360
That child he left behind is the most pitiful.

238
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,750
Three years ago, everyone in the tribes thought that my cousin was only a corpse.

239
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,080
His soul already dispersed.

240
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,610
They made an Icy Mystic Crystal Coffin and sank it into the sea.

241
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,460
When I went to take a look, there was nothing abnormal about it.

242
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,320
But who knew later, the sea which had been sinking for tens of thousand of years, suddenly created problems.

243
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,920
They said what stirred up the sea was the divine mist that was surrounding that Crystal Coffin.

244
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,300
Tell me. Isn't it strange?

245
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,320
My older cousin's soul already dispersed.

246
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,540
How could he still be possibly protected by such a great divine mist?

247
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,870
Anyway, my parents said that my older cousin might not be dead!

248
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,450
Excellent!

249
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:39,590
Good! Good!

250
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,090
Wh-What's wrong?

251
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,180
Keep going.

252
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:01,290
If he's not dead, poor little Ah Li wouldn't cry all day.

253
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,320
Is the sea you're talking about the Sea of Innocence??

254
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:18,760
Is your older cousin... the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe, Ye Hua?!

255
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,480
How did you... know?

256
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,290
Did I reveal a big secret?

257
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,890
Don't tell anyone!

258
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,690
If my parents found out, they won't give me money to watch dramas anymore!

259
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,330
Nice! Nice!

260
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,190
It wasn't easy for me to steal this Cloud-Breaking Fan.

261
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,200
I want to pay you for the pearl that you gave me.

262
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,290
- Isn't that High Goddess Bai Qian?
- Yes.

263
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,610
I thought I was mistaken.

264
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,360
- High Goddess.
- Where's Mighty Monarch?! Where's Mighty Monarch?!

265
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,430
Isn't Mighty Monarch already buried in the Sea of Innocence a long time ago?

266
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,960
Teacher! Teacher!

267
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,900
Where is Ye Hua?

268
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,520
I knew you'd come here.

269
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,740
Where is Ye Hua?

270
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,980
Don't be afraid.

271
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,970
I came to tell you about this matter.

272
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,240
Father God used half of his divine power to create the immortal fetus of the Golden Lotus.

273
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,720
Subsequently, this divine power has always followed him and was hidden in his spirit.

274
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:42,260
Three years ago, when Ye Hua slashed the four ferocious beasts of Yingzhou,

275
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,180
he obtained half of Father God's divine power.

276
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:51,810
I believe Ye Hua used the full divine power of Father God to resist the destructive power of the Donghuang Bell.

277
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:58,050
His spirit was injured by these two forces and fell into a deep sleep.

278
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,720
- Ye Hua.
- He should have slept deeply

279
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,590
- for decades.
- Ye Hua!

280
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,770
But the Icy Mystic Crystal Coffin is a good object.

281
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,270
Although the Sea of Innocence is a Heavenly Tribe's place for remains,
- Ye Hua!

282
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,730
it's also a sacred place for recuperation.

283
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:16,380
That's why Ye Hua could wake up in three years.

Go now. Thank High Immortal Zi Lan for saving your life.

315
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,650
Thank you, High Immortal Zi Lan for saving my life.

316
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,000
Here. Stand up.

317
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,730
Shouldn't she be a boy?

318
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,890
Xuan Nu always called her her son.

319
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,040
I thought...

320
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,860
No, she's a girl.

321
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:37,080
It must be because Xuan Nu wanted a son to succeed Second Older Brother's Winged Monarch position,

322
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,520
she called her that way.

323
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,710
Xuan Nu had always been deceiving others and herself all her life.

324
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:05,610
Have... you been at Kunlun Void all these years?

325
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,600
Yes. Always.

326
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,630
I've never left.

327
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,210
I heard your teacher had returned.

328
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,390
Did he blame you for refining a medicinal pill for me?

329
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,930
No.

330
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,440
Then, how about your fellow disciples. Did they make things hard for you because of me?

331
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,470
Never.

332
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,590
Then I can rest assured.

333
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,420
I'll be taking my leave.

334
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,260
Wait!

335
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,480
After all, this is my Kunlun Void.

336
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,190
Don't come again in the future.

337
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,910
Don't come

338
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,950
to look for me again.

339
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,870
Sure.

340
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,330
Goodbye.

341
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,760
Teacher, you're back.

342
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,290
Zi Lan just rushed back and said that His Highness the Crown Prince is waking up soon.

343
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,540
He's awake.

344
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,280
That's great. Seventeenth can finally get married.

345
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,270
Play properly.

346
00:36:55,270 --> 00:37:00,150
Your father told me you must win 7 times against me or you can't go find him.

347
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,330
How can I win against you?

348
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,840
It's fine. I'll let you win.

349
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:15,400
Your father cares about women too much.

350
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,950
Let's stop playing. Let's stop playing.

351
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,990
How about this? I'll tell you stories about your mother's childhood,

352
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,170
or about your parent's love-hate relationship?

353
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,780
How can my parents have a love-hate relationship?

354
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,210
They only have great tenderness between lovers.

355
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,810
Fine, okay.

356
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:36,300
In Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses, only your parents have the greatest love.

357
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,960
Then let's talk about your mother's childhood stories. Okay.

358
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,590
Where should we start, Zhen Zhen?

359
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:50,120
Just start from when his mother was 20,000 years old, she wandered around the Four Seas with me and caused troubles.

360
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,510
We can talk till Mochi's younger sibling is born.

361
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,320
Your mother was naughty when she was a child.

362
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,060
She caused trouble every day.

363
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,950
She actually went around taking other's items.

364
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:03,880
She even forgot to return everything she took from others.

365
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,450
Your mother was...

366
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,660
Ye Hua.

367
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,160
I've constantly dreamed about you these past three years.

368
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,630
I couldn't separate my dreams from reality.

369
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:29,500
You'd always chat with me in my dreams.

370
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,960
You'd even play chess with me.

371
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:38,040
I told Fourth Older Brother that it was fine that way.

372
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,280
I can see you as long as I sleep.

373
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,820
So I've been sleeping a lot these past 3 years.

374
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,880
I slept from morning to afternoon.

375
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,460
I'd drink some more and sleep again till the afternoon the next day.

376
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,780
You're not dreaming now.

377
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,000
Ye Hua,

378
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,380
tell me.

379
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,400
This isn't a dream, right?

380
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,670
No.

381
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,850
Qian Qian.

382
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,400
Previously, when we first met in Mount Junji in the Eastern Wild,

383
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,170
you thought I was a black snake.

384
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:53,160
You raised me and even fed raw meat to me.

385
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,720
Subsequently, I approached you in order to repay you.

386
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,740
You actually asked me to marry you.

387
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:07,030
We were then confused and bowed to Heaven and Earth and became husband and wife.

388
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,190
Those days were the first time I felt happiness.

389
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:27,960
But not long after, you were brought to the heavens and jumped off the Immortal Execution Platform at the end.

390
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,900
If it weren't for Ah Li, I don't know how I would have lived.

391
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:45,430
Fortunately, I met you again after 300 years.

392
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:54,420
I remember, at Crystal Palace, I saw you scolding my second uncle's wife.

393
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,490
You were holding a fan in your right hand.

394
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,560
Your left hand was doing the move you always like to do.

395
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:09,920
The tone you lectured her and the mark of Red Lotus Fire on your hand made me very certain that,

396
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,780
no matter if you're Su Su or Qian Qian,

397
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,080
you are you.

398
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:32,910
Look. I remember everything so clearly.

399
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,490
Can I do that in a dream?

400
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,230
So this isn't a dream.

401
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,740
It's not a dream.

402
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,580
This is everything we've been through.

403
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,060
How do you remember it so clearly?

404
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,490
I still remember the first words I said to you at the Crystal Palace.

405
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,700
I don't remember them.

406
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:14,570
I was ignorant that you were High Goddess Bai Qian of Green Hill.

”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

420
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,060
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

421
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,570
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

422
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:15,920
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

423
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:25,550
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

424
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,210
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

425
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:34,530
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

426
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:40,420
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

427
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:46,770
♫ All are just illusions ♫

428
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:53,630
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

429
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:58,720
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

430
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,190
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

431
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:09,380
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

432
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:14,910
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

433
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:20,020
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

434
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,940
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

435
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:34,120
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

436
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:44,010
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

437
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:49,610
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

438
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:53,900
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

439
00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:00,130
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

440
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:05,350
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

441
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:10,690
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

442
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:13,550
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

443
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:22,780
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

444
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:35,020
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
