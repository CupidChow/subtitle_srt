”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,460
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,960
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,580
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,090
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,420
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,130
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,710
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,260
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,810
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,380
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,880
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,400
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,040
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,470
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,700
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,460
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,030
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,970
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,760
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,160
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,700
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,960
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,770
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,470
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,840
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,980
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,600
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,020
[Episode 41]

31
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,690
- High God.
- Let's go to the Western Sea.

32
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,580
Western Sea? Are we not going back to Green Hill?

33
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,450
It's not Green Hill, but the Western Sea.

34
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,530
This can't be delayed. If we do, someone will die.

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,940
High Goddess! High Goddess!

36
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,980
High Goddess!

37
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,990
High Goddess!

38
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,210
Yesterday, you said His Young Highness would wake up by midnight,

39
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,490
but it's already past midnight, and he hasn't shown any signs of waking up.

40
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,530
His face is turning redder and redder.

41
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,870
I was very worried, and I didn't know what to do,

42
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,400
so I came to find you.

43
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,790
Usually, when kids drink fruit wines, they can wake up around midnight.

44
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,580
Seems like I overestimated Ah Li.

45
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,200
From the looks of it, he'll be sleeping till tomorrow morning.

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,670
But look at how red he is.

47
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,420
That means the alcohol is being flushed out.

48
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,580
You don't have to worry.

49
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:40,450
Have you been awake since you took Mochi back last night?

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,520
Don't worry. In a little bit, I'll pass some of my divine aurae to him.

51
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,080
I guarantee he'll be up and about tomorrow.

52
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,390
Since he drank fruit wines, he should have some thick porridge on the second day.

53
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,590
Go rest up and bring the porridge tomorrow morning.

54
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,020
But if His Young Highness disturbs your rest...

55
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,080
Look at how deeply asleep he is.

56
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,690
Even if we roll him back to Qingyun Hall, he still won't wake up.

57
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,100
How would he disturb me?

58
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,190
Taking care of a child isn't easy.

59
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,130
Ye Hua has quite the patience.

60
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,020
Come.

61
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,740
Is His Young Highness still not awake?

62
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,150
Thank you for making the porridge.

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,690
It's not good if the porridge gets cold.

64
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,340
You haven't eaten breakfast yet, right?

65
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,290
If you'd like, please have a taste of my cooking.

66
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,410
No need.

67
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,850
I cooked this for four hours.

68
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,720
It'll be a waste if I threw it out.

69
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,740
Moreover, you need to go to the Heavenly Spring in High Clear Plane later.

70
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,890
It's not good to go on an empty stomach.

71
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,520
You're right.

72
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,700
Then I'll have some.

73
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,810
This is indeed good.

74
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,730
High Goddess.

75
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,320
Such a grand parade.

76
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,700
Lord of Lingbao is very considerate.

77
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,210
Your Highness.

78
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,320
While I was taking a stroll,

79
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,140
I was guided by a pure gust of divine aura and accidentally wandered over here.

80
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,470
What is it? Is there a special guest here in the Courtyard of Moonlight?

81
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,850
Your Highness, it's High Goddess Bai Qian.

82
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,660
The Great Lady from Green Hill?

83
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,130
Why didn't you report this to me?

84
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,100
Your Highness, His Mighty Monarch said no one is to bother Great Lady.

85
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,910
Don't be afraid.

86
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,520
I know you are obedient.

87
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,360
You just don't understand.

88
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,490
I'm the only side consort here,

89
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,220
and Great Lady is the future crown princess.

90
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,300
Whether based on sentiment or reason, I should pay her a visit.

91
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:54,290
Your Highness, His Mighty Monarch instructed that no one is allowed to go near the Courtyard of Moonlight.

92
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,520
But the Great Lady of Green Hill is here today.

93
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,940
As her junior, if I don't greet her,

94
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,930
this would break the etiquette of the Heavenly Palace.

95
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,550
Even more so, it has been a long time since I have seen His Young Highness.

96
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,450
It's timely that I visit him.

97
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,920
But... But High Goddess just went to High Clear Plane.

98
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,840
His Young Highness is also resting. Please don't go in, Your Highness.

99
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,170
She went to High Clear Plane?

100
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:25,620
Hasn't Lord of Lingbao's High Clear Plane been closed for a long time?

101
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,100
Has it been reopened?

102
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,930
His Mighty Monarch said that High Goddess fought in the Winged Realm and was injured,

103
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,390
so she needs to go to the Heavenly Spring to treat her injuries.

104
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,400
Is that so?

105
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:43,590
I must take care of the High Goddess on behalf of His Mighty Monarch.

106
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,780
I'll come back another time.

107
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,900
When I first met her, I knew that she was not law-abiding.

108
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,240
Something indeed happened to that Miao Qing of the Eastern Sea last night.

109
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,480
I wonder what she did.

110
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,170
I heard Her Highness even pleaded for mercy on Miao Qing's behalf last night

111
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,350
and even knelt down for a long time in His Mighty Monarch's study.

112
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,950
Her Highness is still the one and only.

113
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,290
She's beautiful and kindhearted,

114
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,020
yet Mighty Monarch doesn't care about her for some reason.

115
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,960
I've been serving her for so long,

116
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,020
yet he's never visited her once.

117
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,150
- She's going through so much.
- Right.

118
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,740
Her Highness is kind and compassionate.

119
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,560
In the future, she will suffer under the High Goddess of Green Hill.

120
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,990
Let them finish talking.

121
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,530
Have you heard the Great Lady from Green Hill is nearing 140,000 years old?

122
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,590
She's 140,000 years old?

123
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,440
Then... isn't she a grandma?

124
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,490
So old, yet so shameless. She must have bewitched His Mighty Monarch with a spell.

125
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:06,160
I vaguely remember there's a rule in Heavenly Palace to not talk disrespectfully about High Gods and Goddesses.

126
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,750
Isn't that so?

127
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,740
Yes.

128
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,820
These two palace maids are disrespectful.

129
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,710
They made you angry, High Goddess.

130
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,000
It's not that they've angered me,

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,760
it's just that accidentally hearing someone talk like this doesn't sound pleasing to the ears.

132
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,840
Although I'm not bothered by this, the Heavenly Palace is a big place,

133
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,000
so I need to let people know rules aren't meant to be ignored.

134
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,020
What do you think?

135
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,270
You're right, High Goddess.

136
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,800
Besides, it's taboo for the harem to be too noisy.

137
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,480
I can see that these two divine maids are too lively.

138
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,730
I fear they are not suitable to work here.

139
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,390
Why don't you pick and choose and help them to run errands elsewhere?

140
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,030
Yes.

141
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,410
Since Ah Li is not here today, it's boring for me to go to the Heavenly Spring alone.

142
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,120
Wait here.

143
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,930
I'm going to choose some books.

144
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,780
Yes.

145
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,780
Did you give Ah Li alcohol?

146
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,000
He hasn't woken up since yesterday afternoon.

147
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,260
What's going on?

148
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,850
I fed him a little too much fruit wine and caused him to be drunk yesterday.

149
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,160
Why didn't you tell me he hasn't woken up yet?

150
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,750
Why didn't you ask the Medicine King to check on him?

151
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,680
Ah Li is still a child.

152
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,960
Why are you so worried?

153
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:03,200
My parents never said anything when I slept for 4-5 days after drinking Zhe Yan's alcohol when I was little.

154
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,830
Besides, Ah Li is a boy.

155
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:11,430
If you coddle him too much, he'll become too girly when he's grown.

156
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:16,190
You didn't raise Ah Li, so you have always regarded him as your stepchild.

157
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,000
Would you say the same thing if you gave birth to him?

158
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,370
You're right.

159
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,210
I can't give birth to such an energetic and likable child.

160
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:32,310
It's a shame that a strong lady who gave birth to Ah Li already jumped down the Immortal Execution Platform.

161
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,940
My teacher at Kunlun Void only taught me the cultivation of being unrestrained.

162
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,830
He didn't cultivate me to be kind, so I can't take good care of your Ah Li.

163
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,840
I seem to recall your side consort is very kindhearted.

164
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:53,740
She can surely take better care of Ah Li, then he wouldn't have to suffer with me.

165
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,700
Don't say that to anger me.

166
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,170
You know that's not what I mean.

167
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,500
Not only did I suffer bias from two Heavenly maids early in the morning,

168
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,820
when I'm back, I was lectured by the Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

169
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,280
I'm here to nurse my wounds, not to be lashed out at.

170
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,920
High Goddess!

171
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,720
Did you see who just left this yard, High Goddess?

172
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,380
What's wrong? Tell me slowly.

173
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,730
Please punish me, High Goddess.

174
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,560
It's all my fault.

175
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,540
You treat His Young Highness very well.

176
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,920
Even if my mistress were reborn, she'd be grateful to you.

177
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,340
If I'm the reason

178
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,680
that His Young Highness falls victim to Consort Su Jin, I will...

179
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,800
You just mentioned Mochi falling victim to Su Jin.

180
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,650
What do you mean?

181
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,130
I was too anxious.

182
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,290
Earlier, right after you left, Consort Su Jin arrived.

183
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,650
She said that she sensed a pure divine aura and came to the Courtyard of Moonlight to visit the distinguished guest,

184
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,250
and at the same time, visit His Young Highness.

185
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,170
- That Su Jin came to see me?
- Yes.

186
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,550
But His Mighty Monarch said three hundred years ago that Consort Su Jin cannot come anywhere near here.

187
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,670
She's always followed that rule, but for some reason, she suddenly came today.

188
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,160
I did my best to stop her,

189
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,130
but who knew... who knew I just went to get water in the backyard,

190
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,820
came back and found His Young Highness missing.

191
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,620
Don't worry.

192
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,250
Ye Hua took Mochi.

193
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,410
Su Jin has nothing to do with this.

194
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,400
Is that true, High Goddess?

195
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,380
Why would I lie to you?

196
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:41,970
If Su Jin really took Mochi, I'd have already been gone to save him, not here comforting you.

197
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,290
That's good. That's good.

198
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:51,680
Speaking of which, you're very guarded against Su Jin.

199
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:59,660
Does Su Jin have anything to do with Mochi's mom jumping off the Immortal Execution Platform?

200
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,590
Heavenly Monarch said no one is to talk about this.

201
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:10,990
All the divine maids who knew about this were demoted and aren't here anymore.

202
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,170
It's fine, you don't have to tell me.

203
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,500
I understand.

204
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,840
Take me to where they are now.

205
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,700
- If Mochi's fine, I will carry him back.
- Yes.

206
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,370
Your Mighty Monarch, don't worry.

207
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,810
His Young Highness is a lightweight. He's fine.

208
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,990
He'll wake up before dusk after soaking in this sobering bath.

209
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,590
What's wrong with Ah Li?

210
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:03,140
Your Third Highness, His Young Highness can't hold his alcohol and drank a little too much.

211
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,790
What?

212
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,230
- Okay. You may go.
- Yes.

213
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:24,070
Someone told me you rushed Ah Li over here from the Courtyard of Moonlight.

214
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,320
I thought something happened to him to make you this worried.

215
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,480
I thought when you brought Bai Qian to Heaven,

216
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,130
it would be a good thing and you would be happy.

217
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:48,000
But judging by your face, you're not any happier.

218
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,000
Are you anxious because you are going to be a bridegroom?

219
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:04,250
I heard High God Zhe Yan personally went to the Western Sea to treat the Water Monarch's eldest son's illness.

220
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,990
Heavenly Monarch,

221
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,560
High God Zhe Yan is currently at my Crystal Palace.

222
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,670
You're lucky.

223
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:20,120
When Ye Hua fell sick years ago, High God Zhe Yan saved him.

224
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,720
It seems like your son will recover soon.

225
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,500
Thank you, Heavenly Monarch, for your kind words.

226
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,850
Where is the emperor?

227
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,870
Why hasn't the emperor returned?

228
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,620
Heavenly Monarch, based on the emperor's instructions, he wanted to live in the mortal realm for sixty years

229
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,450
and experience the hardships of mortals.

230
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,990
Today is the fortieth year. There are still twenty more years left.

231
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,800
Is he satisfied with the fate that you wrote for him?

232
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,990
I wouldn't dare to say that he's satisfied, but there are enough twists and turns.

233
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,400
I wrote down every hardship that the emperor wanted to experience.

234
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,030
Is that so?

235
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,940
He's traveling incognito now and will encounter an assassination attempt and fall into dire straits.

236
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,580
Assassination attempt?

237
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,610
This is good.

238
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,920
When he was the Ruler of the Heavens and Earth, he had never lost.

239
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,240
No one in this world dares to offend him.

240
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,560
Now that he's in the mortal realm, he should experience what an assassination is.

241
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,330
And what it means to fall into dire straits.

242
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,780
Your Highness Fengjiu, you must protect yourself.

243
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,760
Jiu'er. Jiu'er!

244
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,560
Emperor, it really hurts.

245
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,390
Emperor?

246
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,710
Jiu'er, who are you calling for?

247
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,550
I'm calling for the emperor.

248
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,560
Who's the emperor she's calling for?

249
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,650
Forget it. Don't bother about him first.

250
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,640
Jiu'er.

251
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,400
If you are in pain, why don't you cry?

252
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:19,200
Before I entered the palace, I had an extremely good relationship with my aunt.

253
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,060
Aunt would always teach me that,

254
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,180
although I'm a girl,

255
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,350
I must not fear death.

256
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:38,540
Protect... I must protect the people I want to protect.

257
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,350
Fengjiu, you are the Empress of Green Hill.

258
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,370
You will succeed me in the future.

259
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,970
You must protect the people of Green Hill.

260
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,640
Don't be a crybaby.

261
00:20:53,990 --> 00:21:00,610
Jiu'er, I'm the man who wants to protect you.

262
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,130
Don't!

263
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:23,720
Tonight, either you assassinate me, the emperor, or I kill you, the rebels!

264
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,420
There's nothing strange about it. Normal mortals.

265
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,220
There's an unexpected homicide.

266
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,830
You and you, check if there are any survivors.

267
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,570
Yes.

268
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,350
Where's the physician?

269
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,240
Where is the physician?!

270
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,710
Physician! Physician!

271
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,710
Miss, do you know where a physician is?

272
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,270
Emperor.

273
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,810
Jiu'er, tell me.

274
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:00,110
Who's the emperor that you are calling for?

275
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,420
It's you, Emperor.

276
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:18,420
I've liked you since the day you saved me.

277
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,930
I like you so much I could die.

278
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:28,810
Emperor, please promise me.

279
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:35,480
No matter what, you can't forget this pact of two years.

280
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,960
The pact for two years?

281
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,980
Is it between me and her?

282
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,620
But the emperor...

283
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:50,330
Could it be that in Jiu'er's hometown, they call the son of heaven as emperor?

284
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,230
Jiu'er,

285
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,500
don't be afraid.

286
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,370
I'll... make sure you live.

287
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,750
Whether I live or die is not important.

288
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:18,200
I'm just afraid that you'll forget me as soon as I die.

289
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,590
You...

290
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,700
You won't die.

291
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,400
You won't die.

292
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,930
Hero. Hero.

293
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,600
Be careful.

294
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,430
This is a sharp sword.

295
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,310
Yan Zhi, where did you pick her up from?

296
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:54,930
I saw that she was injured on the streets and brought her here.

297
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,860
She's from the Nine-Tailed Fox Tribe.

298
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,510
How do you know?

299
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:09,390
Even if I can't see, I can recognize the smell of nine-tailed foxes.

300
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,760
Yan Zhi, is she young?

301
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,530
You're right.

302
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,120
There is only one girl in the youngest generation of the nine-tailed foxes.

303
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,890
She's Bai Fengjiu.

304
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,890
If I'm not wrong,

305
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:30,990
she's Bai Fengjiu, Bai Qian's niece from Green Hill.

306
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,130
Bai Fengjiu?

307
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,740
She was born after I left Green Hill.

308
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,930
Even though I've never met her,

309
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:47,610
I know that she has a Phoenix flower mark on her forehead.

310
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,450
Yes, there's a birthmark.

311
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,290
It's red like a phoenix flower.

312
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,630
What are you trying to do to her by bringing her here?

313
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,000
That's not it, Second Sister-In-Law.

314
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,630
I didn't know who she was.

315
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,190
I just wanted to treat her injuries, so I brought her here.

316
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,810
I didn't know she was the empress of Green Hill.

317
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,090
That's good then.

318
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,390
Even if it's a coincidence that you brought her here,

319
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:29,970
her aunt, Bai Qian, was the one who took away my beauty because she hates me!

320
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,620
Good.

321
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,280
Very good.

322
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,150
The heavens sent her here today.

323
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:52,200
Son, let's endure a little and use her body to wake you up.

324
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,560
Afterward, I'll find a suitable immortal body for you.

325
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,720
What are you saying? What are you trying to do?

326
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,450
What I'm trying to do?

327
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:07,120
I want to use her body to wake my Ying'er up.

328
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,550
You can't do that!

329
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:16,890
Yan Zhi, do you not want to see your own nephew wake up?

330
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:21,400
We can only use a high immortal's body to wake up my son.

331
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,560
Yan Zhi, this is a chance granted to us by the heavens!

332
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,070
I will never let you use this kind of ancient black magic.

333
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:35,240
Second Sister-in-Law, you should give him up and bury him.

334
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,500
Your child has been dead since the day it was born.

335
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,730
No! No!

336
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,050
He's not dead!

337
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:48,980
He's just sleeping and won't wake up.

338
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:54,080
Even if his dad doesn't want him, I still want to wake up him!

339
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,300
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears to give birth to Ying'er.

340
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,460
I'll surely revive him!

341
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,600
Second Sister-in-Law, I didn't plan to tell you so soon

342
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,380
but there's really no other choice now.

343
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,390
Do you know about the Mythical Mushroom?

344
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,330
Mythical Mushroom?

345
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:26,050
In the Heavenly Tribe, the mythical mushroom can purify an immortal.

346
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,880
It's also a sacred product of the Heavenly Tribe.

347
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,510
The people from the Heavenly Tribe use it to transfer their cultivation to save others.

348
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:36,490
I think, as he's partly from the Immortal Tribe,

349
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,330
if we have this sacred product,

350
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:43,320
he might be able to wake up.

351
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,950
Mythical Mushroom?

352
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,150
Why haven't I heard about this?

353
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,940
Why hasn't anyone told me about this?

354
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,980
I accidentally heard my father mention this.

355
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:59,620
If we have this Mystical Mushroom, I can transfer my cultivation to him.

356
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,730
He can have a chance to live then.

357
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,600
Since this is a sacred product, it will be very tightly guarded.

358
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,210
Can you really take me there?

359
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,740
Second Sister-in-Law, trust me. I will definitely take you there.

360
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:20,430
If it's for Second Older Brother's child, I'm willing to give it a try.

361
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,120
Hence, let me save Bai Fengjiu first.

362
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,200
Even if Bai Qian did this to you, Bai Fengjiu has never harmed you.

363
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,850
Once I have saved her, let's depart for Yingzhou in the Eastern Sea.

364
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,650
I wonder if she's telling the truth.

365
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,430
I'm no longer the monarchess of Winged Tribe.

366
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,020
I can't obtain the body of a high immortal.

367
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,520
This is a hard to come by chance.

368
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,390
- Second Sister-in-Law.
- I'm right out here.

369
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,620
If you dare to have any evil thoughts, be careful that I will kill you now.

370
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,130
What's wrong, Second Sister-in-Law?

371
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,700
Nothing.

372
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,600
I think you're right.

373
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,760
I've decided to go.

374
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,950
I'm the Winged Tribe's princess,

375
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:29,110
yet I have no home and am in the Mortal Realm.

376
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,860
You're the Green Hill's princess.

377
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,100
Why did you come here?

378
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:09,540
Is she telling the truth? Impossible.

379
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,430
How is she so kindhearted?

380
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,550
No, who cares what she's after?

381
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,020
I just need to follow her.

382
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,390
There'll eventually be a time that Zi Lan is not around.

383
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,660
As a last resort, I will kill her

384
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,040
and let Qing Cang be unsealed from the Donghuang Bell.

385
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:34,550
Son, once your grandfather comes back, he'll love you and save you.

386
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,990
Mute! Tell him I'm a good person!

387
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,720
Your wife is awake.

388
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,100
Go see her.

389
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,430
My goodness, that scared me.

390
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,730
Why are you here?

391
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,900
There was a homicide out there.

392
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,980
I was supposed to investigate it,

393
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,730
but later, I heard that you brought a bleeding man and woman back.

394
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,310
I was worried about you.

395
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,430
How long have we known each other for?

396
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,600
About 5 years.

397
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,670
That fast?

398
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,500
I've been here for 5 years.

399
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,630
I should move soon.

400
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,500
Move? To where?

401
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,670
Anywhere is fine.

402
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:06,440
I'll just head to any direction.

403
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:12,690
Then... I'll go with you.

404
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,340
You want to come with me?

405
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,100
You are a weak woman who needs a man to protect you.

406
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,420
Besides, I have no parents.

407
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:30,700
I'll go wherever with you and protect you.

408
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,010
- Surround them.
- Yes.

409
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,040
Your Majesty, I was late to save you.

410
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,540
Since I came late to save you,

411
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,390
I deserve to die.

412
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:16,380
I'm not a merciful emperor.

413
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,660
Cao Jing rebelled.

414
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,660
Not only must I execute his entire clan,

415
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:32,540
any officials, merchants, and civilians who had connections with the Cao Clan in the past 20 years, must be put on trial

416
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,430
- and be thoroughly investigated!
- Your Majesty.

417
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,560
Are we interrogating the crown prince, too?

418
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,380
Interrogate him.

419
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,960
Your Majesty.

420
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:02,390
Sleep a little more if you're tired.

421
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,700
I've slept for a while.

422
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,320
My head hurts from sleeping for so long.

423
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,660
Jiu'er.

424
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,340
This arrow...

425
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,950
Your Majesty, you don't need to say anything.

426
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:29,430
You only need to know that I accepted the arrow willingly on your behalf.

427
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,500
I don't need any rewards.

428
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:38,860
I only ask that you remember me in your heart for eternity.

429
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:44,030
I will never abandon you.

430
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:50,740
♫ My dreamlike encounters with you have made me forget everything ♫

431
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:56,260
♫ At that moment, was your heart also racing? ♫

432
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,310
Are you looking for that copper bell?

433
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:02,490
Your Majesty, you saw it?

434
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,020
I kept it.

435
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:09,190
That's good then. That's good then.

436
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,520
Your Majesty, can you get it for me?

437
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:19,790
♫ I see you waiting for me among the colorful lights ♫

438
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:27,080
♫ You’ve smiled, and the bustling world suddenly
loses its color ♫

439
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:33,860
♫ The way you touch my heart is a continuation of the dream from my previous life ♫

440
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,820
♫ Even if short-lived, I will wait for you ♫

441
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,530
What is this?

442
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,510
This is the arrow that wounded you.

443
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,900
♫ The moment I fell for you, even if I am like a moth
chasing fire ♫

444
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,950
Your Majesty, you even kept it.

445
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,250
♫ I will still courageously endure the pain and deeply love you ♫

446
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,680
Not only will I keep it...

447
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,840
♫ Even if we do not end up together ♫

448
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,990
I'm going to keep it forever.

449
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,970
This copper bell...

450
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:14,530
Since I've been with you, you have been wearing it.

451
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,610
Is this very important?

452
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:22,800
♫ Even so, I will persevere in my love for you without
complaints ♫

453
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,140
A very important person gave this to me.

454
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,900
Si Ming, come here.

455
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,180
Third Highness, what instructions do you have?

456
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,830
I heard Miao Qing from the Eastern Seas was sent back.

457
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,330
It's Pure Wutong Palace's matters. I'm not very clear about this.

458
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,060
You know everything that happens in this palace.

459
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,860
I heard a rumor.

460
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:11,170
Last night, that princess added an aphrodisiac in His Highness Crown Prince's soup.

461
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,770
His Highness Crown Prince found out.

462
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,970
When Consort Su Jin tried to help ask for forgiveness, the Great Lady from Green Hill came.

463
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:20,770
One word from Great Lady and His Highness sent Miao Qing out of Pure Wutong Palace.

464
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,890
It's just a rumor.

465
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,400
- Where there's a place with many women, rumors abound.
- You're right.

466
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,650
Fortunately, High God Mo Yuan didn't accept any female disciples.

467
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,670
If he did, I wonder what kind of troubles could have occurred in Kunlun Void.

468
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,510
That's right.

469
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,090
- Is this the Book of Fate?
- Yes.

470
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,650
Let me see how Emperor was almost assassinated.

471
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,510
Sure.

472
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,880
This is wrong.

473
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,200
What's wrong?

474
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:02,060
Emperor has already encountered the assassins, but why are there words missing?

475
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,460
Look at this empty spot.

476
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,150
Did someone from Heavenly Tribe or Winged Tribe show up by Emperor's side?

477
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,930
It's fine that the emperor is safe.

478
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,870
This is a minor issue. Never mind it.

479
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,050
If he really met someone, it's destined by Heaven.

480
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,370
It's not for us to bother about it.

481
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,120
Let's go.

482
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,200
- High Goddess.
- How's Mochi?

483
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,900
High Goddess, His Young Highness is already awake.

484
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,800
If he's awake, why didn't he come back with you?

485
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,510
His Mighty Monarch said that since His Young Highness bathed in medicinal water, he will stay in the Purple Morning Hall tonight.

486
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,480
You won't bring him here today, then?

487
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:56,230
Never mind. I'm going to see him.

488
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,640
What Empress of Green Hill?

489
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,100
An unmarried woman doesn't know how to take care of a child.

490
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,210
Ah Li is so young and she fed him so much wine.

491
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:22,400
He slept for a day and night and she still didn't feel guilty.

492
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,330
Once she marries into Pure Wutong Palace, I fear that Ah Li won't have any good days anymore.

493
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:33,780
People from Green Hill all love to drink wine. She didn't do it deliberately.

494
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:40,930
That's right! Mother thought I liked drinking and let me drink a little more.

495
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,270
You even call her mother. Who taught you that?

496
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,800
High Goddess Bai Qian?

497
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,140
She's my mother!

498
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,030
She's the mother on Father's portrait.

499
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,870
Portrait?

500
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:58,630
Your Highness, when I saw Great Lady a few days ago, I was also surprised.

501
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,090
They do look similar.

502
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,100
I've always wanted you to forget what happened 300 years ago.

503
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:23,890
Yet I'm uneasy of the High Goddess you're fond of today.

504

”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

505
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,470
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

506
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,200
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

507
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,540
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

508
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:14,990
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

509
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,770
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

510
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:24,260
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

511
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:31,570
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

512
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:37,660
♫ All are just illusions ♫

513
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:43,210
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

514
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:48,350
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

515
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:52,800
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

516
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,990
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

517
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:04,480
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

518
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,660
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

519
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,440
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

520
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:21,640
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

521
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:33,570
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

522
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:39,040
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

523
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,440
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

524
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,700
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

525
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:55,020
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

526
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:00,400
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

527
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,120
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

528
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:12,310
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

529
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:24,130
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
