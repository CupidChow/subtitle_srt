”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,460
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,880
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,570
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,020
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,430
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,170
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,730
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,200
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,870
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,350
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,910
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,290
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,070
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,460
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,080
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,480
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,050
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,020
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,790
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,110
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,780
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,750
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,850
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,450
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,880
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,030
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,760
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,190
[Episode 2]

31
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,670
Father, please say it.

32
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,460
I am going to hand you a golden lotus.

33
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,690
Plant it in the lotus pond of Kunlun Void.

34
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:58,070
Protect it with your magic until it becomes a human.

35
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,190
A golden lotus?

36
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,190
Sorry to disturb you.

37
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,620
You are Si Yin's friend?

38
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,260
Yes. I just came from the Pellet-Cultivating Furnace area.

39
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm strolling around.

40
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,610
I will take my leave.

41
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,540
Teacher, that Xuan Nü's looks are very delicate.

42
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,650
She looks very much like Seventeenth.

43
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,080
I am going into retreat tonight.

44
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,380
I will be there for at least ten days, and at most half a month.

45
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,740
While I am in retreat, I will leave Seventeenth to your care.

46
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,520
But... Seventeenth has the most tricks!

47
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,580
Even if he's full of tricks, copying the Chongxu Sutra 30,000 times would keep him occupied for half a month.

48
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,310
Turns out, your punishment was just to keep Seventeenth in Kunlun Void instead of running around.

49
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,870
Correct.

50
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,690
Seventeenth is undisciplined by nature and doesn't like to cultivate.

51
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,360
He doesn't know that his heavenly tribulation of transcension will be in half a month.

52
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,960
Protect him for now. We will make plans after I leave the retreat.

53
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,100
Yes, Teacher.

54
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,530
Senior Brother, please examine this.

55
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,900
- Senior Brother.
- Save your flowery words.

56
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,980
Copying the sutra is the main matter.

57
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,520
I want to talk to you about Green Hill!

58
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,220
I heard there will be a big celebration in Green Hill in a few days!

59
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,720
The Fox Emperor Bai Zhi's first grandchild is going to be born!

60
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,940
I heard you admire Fox Emperor Bai Zhi and High God Zhe Yan the most, right?

61
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,300
Both of them will be there!

62
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,970
Why don't we go participate in the festivities?

63
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,540
Fox Emperor has not appeared for tens of thousands of years. Is this news true?

64
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,970
It's completely accurate!

65
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,250
I got it. Continue copying.

66
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,550
Senior Brother, I'm not done talking yet.

67
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,400
Everyone knows that to get to Green Hill, you must travel across the Rebirth Sea, but I know a shortcut.

68
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,360
In addition to your cloud-riding technique,

69
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,460
going there and coming back won't take more than half a day for us!

70
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,630
Think about it! After we go, we'll watch the two high gods from afar, drink a little wine,

71
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,940
and then we'll come back! How about it?

72
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,310
No. Teacher told me to watch you day and night.

73
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,790
I must not leave my position without permission.

74
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,160
Let me explain it this way! Even if you watch me day and night, you can't keep an eye on me!

75
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,720
I would still find a way to escape!

76
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,130
It's true!

77
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,620
So, Senior Brother, go and come back with me.

78
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,920
You still watch me day and night!

79
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,760
You wouldn't be going against Teacher's order. How about it?

80
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,620
This place is the border between Green Hill and the Winged Realm.

81
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,160
It's been like this for thousands of years. We'll be at Green Hill in an hour.

82
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,750
This place is strange. I can't use my cloud-riding technique at all. You must be careful.

83
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,710
Also, I once heard Emperor Dong Hua and Teacher discuss the Winged Realm.

84
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,030
He said the current Winged Monarch is very ambitious,

85
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,660
He will surely begin a war with the Heavenly Tribe.

86
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,720
What is there to fight about?

87
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,110
It might be for ambition.

88
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,440
Talking about the Winged Monarch, I think I've seen a drawing of the Winged Monarch before.

89
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,000
Speak! Why did you attack us?

90
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,970
Why did he commit suicide without saying anything? We didn't kill him.

91
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,430
That loud sound is their sign to commit suicide.

92
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,340
Run!

93
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,500
Eldest Brother, their clothes are so strange.

94
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,410
They don't look like ones we're looking for.

95
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,440
Nor do they look like people from Winged Tribe.

96
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,880
That's right. They're from the Heavenly Tribe.

97
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,450
Heavenly Tribe?

98
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,800
So what if they're from the Heavenly Tribe?

99
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,460
Eventually, I'll make them bow down,

100
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,730
and become our prisoners as we dominate the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

101
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:26,490
Okay, but people from the Heavenly Tribe are so pretty.

102
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:34,310
Once they become our prisoners, you can pick a few to serve you.

103
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,700
Is that the Winged Monarch, Qing Cang?

104
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,540
Yes.

105
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,050
I lived most of my life in Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms.

106
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,050
This is my first time outside, and I didn't know that I'd get lost.

107
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,010
You are Zhe Yan's people?

108
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,960
I am an immortal under High God Zhe Yan.

109
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,360
Zhe Yan and Green Hill have always been associated together.

110
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,130
Ever since Bai Zhi ascended the throne of Fox Emperor,

111
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:38,420
he has stopped caring about the grudges between the Heavenly, Demon, and Winged Tribes.

112
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,860
By doing so, he has ensured over 10,000 years of peace to Green Hill.

113
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,030
That's right. My High God has ordered us

114
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,750
to never ask about the business between the Heavenly, Demon, and Winged Tribes

115
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,840
to keep the tranquility among Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms.

116
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,300
Winged Monarch, the woods are filled with corpses of the rebel army.

117
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,430
Did you two do this?

118
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,860
Uh... We got lost, and those people ambushed us.

119
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,720
They charged at us with weapons without even a word.

120
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,800
We were just trying to survive.

121
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,240
Good thing they died.

122
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,170
I chased them all the way here in order to catch some alive for interrogation,

123
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,100
but you two immortals killed them first.

124
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,830
Fine, then.

125
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:48,450
Starting today, if anyone dares to stop me from uniting the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses,

126
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,990
they'll suffer the same fate.

127
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,190
You're right. Then, we'll take our leave now.

128
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,350
Golden Lion!

129
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,390
They are our guests.

130
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,760
Immortals, please pay a visit to my Grand Purple Palace.

131
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,430
Return to the palace!

132
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,730
Why is Winged Monarch taking us back to his palace?

133
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,650
Did Zhe Yan offend him sometime during these 10,000 years?

134
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,030
But this is the Grand Purple Palace.

135
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,650
We, disciples of the Heavenly Tribe, can't use our magic at all.

136
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,590
I can't even lift my sword.

137
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,250
Only ones above the rank of High God can move freely.

138
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,130
Little immortal.

139
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,160
Your Highness

140
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,920
How did you know that I'm a princess?

141
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,840
You have such a wonderful body figure and astonishing looks, and you can control the army.

142
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,100
Naturally, you're the princess.

143
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,150
Everyone says that Heavenly Tribesmen are snobby.

144
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,540
I see that you are quite unique.

145
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,210
Princess, that's not right.

146
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,990
My High God withdrew to the Peach Forest a long time ago.

147
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,790
He isn't involved with worldly affairs, so we're not considered Heavenly Tribesmen.

148
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,020
That's for the best. My father hates the Heavenly Tribe the most.

149
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,070
Are you married yet?

150
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,620
- Me?
- You are?

151
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,270
No, I'm not.

152
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,630
Really? Great.

153
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,750
That princess likes you.

154
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,700
Stop joking!

155
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,550
That's how High Goddess Yao Guang looks at Teacher.

156
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,730
Here, general.

157
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,070
- Have another drink.
- Great alcohol tolerance!

158
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,500
- Here, have another drink.
- Fine, fill it up!

159
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,170
Good. Good. Good.

160
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,390
General, you have such a great alcohol tolerance.

161
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,940
I'll drink with you.

162
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,800
- Eldest Brother, it tastes good, right?
- I'll drink to you another one. Come on. Fill it up.

163
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,350
Okay.

164
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,710
- Winged Monarch.
- Winged Monarch.

165
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,230
Have a seat.

166
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,450
You outsiders... Just sit normally.

167
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:21,280
Don't kneel. Just sit properly.

168
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,240
High Immortal.

169
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,030
Please.

170
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,400
Please, drink up.

171
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,360
Here, drink up.

172
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,290
High Immortal.

173
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,800
Yan Zhi, where's your second older brother?

174
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,170
I think he's not returned yet.

175
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:05,460
We have countless beauties in the palace, but he still goes to the mortal realm for entertainment.

176
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,630
He doesn't act like a prince at all.

177
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,410
Second Older Brother, he... Today's his mother's death anniversary.

178
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,290
I think that's why he's still out.

179
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,620
Immortal, why don't I see you say anything?

180
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,690
Do you not like the service provided at my Grand Purple Palace?

181
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,130
That's not it, Monarch. I'm not good with words.

182
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,330
I'm scared that if I talk too much, it'll ruin your mood.

183
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,200
How is that possible?

184
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,490
Monarch, let me toast to you.

185
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,070
You have a natural gift.

186
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,960
I really like you.

187
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,730
Thank you, Winged Monarch.

188
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,330
Why don't you follow me and be my godson?

189
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,150
Come live in Grand Purple Palace.

190
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:10,590
The moment I saw you, I had a thought.

191
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:18,150
Could it be Heaven's fate to send you to me?

192
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,080
I already have two sons and a daughter,

193
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:26,990
but I still want to ask you if you're willing to accept this father-son relationship.

194
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:39,470
Why? Is my Grand Purple Palace not good enough for you?

195
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,890
No, no.

196
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,540
Monarch, I have yet to discuss this with my parents.

197
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,470
There's no such need.

198
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,770
But something as major as acknowledging a godfather requires a family's approval.

199
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,130
In accepting a godfather, as long as both parties are willing, parental approval is not necessary.

200
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,820
This...

201
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,110
Monarch.

202
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,680
Monarch, you said it yourself. Adoption requires mutual agreement.

203
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,100
You'd at least need both sides to be willing!

204
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:30,120
As the ruler of the Winged Tribe, do I need to discuss with others before taking a godson?

205
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,970
Monarch, you can't say that.

206
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,960
Please be calm, Monarch.

207
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:44,220
If you really want to, you have to ask my High God first.

208
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,280
- Zhe Yan?
- Precisely.

209
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:55,080
Do you think you can escape by saying you belong to Zhe Yan?

210
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,480
But last year at the Heavenly Monarch's birthday,

211
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,100
when I transformed into a small envoy to offer my birthday gift to him,

212
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,320
I clearly saw you standing next to Mo Yuan.

213
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:20,410
You called him... Teacher.

214
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,230
You two are not Zhe Yan's people at all.

215
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,950
You are disciples of Kunlun Void!

216
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,220
Arrest them!

217
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,110
Don't!

218
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,310
Let go of me! Let go of me!

219
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,010
Lock them up separately.

220
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,990
Little immortal, think over it carefully.

221
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:01,890
Do you want to be cut into pieces, or become my godson submissively?

222
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,720
- Go!
- Go!

223
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,000
Your Highness.

224
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,470
My father wants to take in someone from Kunlun Void?

225
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,050
I'm afraid he has an ulterior motive of wanting to rebel.

226
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,930
Rebel?

227
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,580
Shhh. Why are you panicking?

228
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,440
Raising an army to rebel is his problem.

229
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,770
What does it have to do with me?

230
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:20,330
It has nothing to do with you, either, pretty maiden.

231
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:35,700
High Goddess Yao Guang likes Teacher, so she captured me.

232
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,460
The Winged Monarch wants to take a godson, and captured me again!

233
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:49,790
After living for so long, I, Green Hill's Bai Qian, the daughter of the Fox Emperor, ended up as a tool.

234
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,010
I can't even use my magic.

235
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,160
You're awake, Immortal?

236
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,840
Do you want to eat first, or chat with us?

237
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,040
No, no, no.

238
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,420
Uh... Usually in Heavenly Realm at this time, I'd be doing homework.

239
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,340
We can chat some other day.

240
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,000
We have to pick a time to drink and be happy? That's not fun!

241
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,120
Yes!

242
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,250
- Princess.
- Go on.

243
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,420
Winged Monarch, the second prince of the Heavenly Realm has brought this year's bounty.

244
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,020
He's waiting in the side palace hall.

245
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,880
Bounty?

246
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,680
He said that for Heavenly Monarch's birthday, he's rewarding all rulers of the Four Seas and Winged Realm with bounties.

247
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,480
That old thing.

248
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,200
For his every birthday, he rewards the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

249
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,440
Does he really think that I would yield to him like the militaries of the Four Seas?

250
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,970
It's been 300,000 years.

251
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,720
The Heavenly Tribe has ruled the heavens for too long!

252
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,100
It's time to get someone new.

253
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,570
Drive them out!

254
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,200
Yes!

255
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,110
All right.

256
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,100
You can all leave.

257
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,050
Father Monarch.

258
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,700
Qing Cang of the Winged Tribe doesn't know what's good for him.

259
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:46,210
Not only did he refuse the bounty, he even kept me outside the door!

260
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,950
The Winged Monarch is becoming increasingly ridiculous.

261
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,610
He even dares to return my gifts.

262
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:00,080
It's nothing valuable.

263
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,860
Emperor, you must not know, but the current Winged Monarch is very willful.

264
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:12,360
I am just afraid he will rebel one day and endanger the world.

265
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,130
With Mo Yuan around, why are you afraid?

266
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:24,750
But he has the Donghuang Bell that can destroy the world.

267
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,570
Since Mo Yuan created the Donghuang Bell,

268
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,610
Mo Yuan naturally will have a way to suppress it.

269
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,890
Mo Yuan isn't afraid, so why are you afraid?

270
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,260
Ninth Junior Brother and little Seventeenth have been missing for days.

271
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,760
Should I report to Teacher?

272
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,940
When Father God first gave the Donghuang Bell to the Winged Tribe,

273
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,910
it was in exchange for an alliance between the two tribes, and gained tens of thousands of years of peace.

274
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:08,230
I never guessed that today, the Donghuang Bell that can destroy the world,

275
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,280
has become a danger to the Heavenly Tribe.

276
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,540
Where are the chieftains of the different branches of the Heavenly Tribe?

277
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,560
They didn't come again.

278
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,490
As of today, the Heavenly Tribe is facing both external and internal turmoils.

279
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,480
Emperor, do you have a good plan?

280
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,960
Good plan?

281
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,720
Haven't you always wanted to ally with Green Hill?

282
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,040
That's right.

283
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:50,380
Green Hill's Fox Emperor is also close to Zhe Yan of the Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms.

284
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:56,340
If we form an alliance through marriage, the benefits of the Heavenly, Phoenix, and Nine-Tailed Fox Tribes will be combined.

285
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,820
By then, even if war arises,

286
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,220
our chances of winning will be much higher!

287
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,150
Correct.

288
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,880
Not bad.

289
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,200
We should really get to it.

290
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,810
I don't think those chieftains will avoid it.

291
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,110
At the end of the day, they're on our side.

292
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,770
They can't possibly allow the Winged Tribe to rule the world, can they?

293
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:27,030
Who knows?

294
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:36,890
Excuse me. Who is the immortal who just passed by earlier?

295
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,430
- Emperor Dong Hua.
- Emperor Dong Hua?

296
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,890
Are you new here?

297
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:47,160
Earlier, why did Heavenly Monarch agree to everything he said?

298
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,570
Hundreds of thousands of years ago, Emperor Dong Hua was the ruler of the heavens and Earth.

299
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,630
He was the master of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

300
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:57,350
Later, our world obtained peace, so Emperor voluntarily offered up his position.

301
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,790
That's how the Heavenly Monarch has his position today.

302
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,910
In the mortal realm, he is called a supreme ruler.

303
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,660
Emperor is the supreme ruler of the Heavenly Tribe.

304
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,650
- Thank you for telling me.
- You're welcome.

305
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,360
Hey, I still don't know your name.

306
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:16,420
I am Star Monarch Si Ming, Emperor Dong Hua's subordinate who controls mortal fates.

307
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,810
Oh, so you're Star Monarch Si Ming.

308
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,040
Eldest Senior Brother!

309
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:26,160
Eldest Senior Brother, we haven't found them yet.

310
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,390
Ninth Junior Brother and Seventeenth have been missing for 7 or 8 days.

311
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,810
Where did they actually go?

312
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:36,440
He's caused trouble again. This time, he even involved Ninth Senior Brother.

313
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,300
Aren't you worried that they're in danger?

314
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,110
Seventeenth is so good with words.

315
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,720
How could he be in danger? No way.

316
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,280
He... He must have abducted Ninth Senior Brother to drink alcohol in secret.

317
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,400
Typically, they would go to the mortal realm, set up a booth, and tell some fortunes for amusement.

318
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,810
Maybe they'll be back tomorrow.

319
00:28:55,810 --> 00:29:00,030
Other than High Goddess Yao Guang, our Kunlun Void hasn't offended anyone else.

320
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:05,410
Granted, even if Seventeenth is in trouble, he won't allow himself to suffer.

321
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,470
I'm not worried about them suffering.

322
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,940
- However...
- However what?

323
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,000
Teacher said that Seventeenth's transcension tribulation into the High Immortal rank will take place in a few days.

324
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,510
- What tribulation?
- Although he has already studied for 20,000 years,

325
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:22,470
he can't predict when and where the heavenly tribulation will take place.

326
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,080
If it happens in these few days,

327
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,850
- that'll be big trouble!
- Heavenly tribulation?

328
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,320
Heavenly tribulation of transcension?

329
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,560
If Seventeenth receives the tribulation in these few days,

330
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,510
even with Ninth Junior Brother's help, it'll be dangerous.

331
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,620
We can't keep waiting. Second Junior Brother, you stay in Kunlun Void.

332
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,910
Once Teacher returns from his retreat, tell him.

333
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,770
The other disciples and I will keep looking. Maybe we'll find them.

334
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,600
Okay.

335
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,540
- Eldest Senior Brother! Take me with you.
- Are you worried now?

336
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,520
Eldest Senior Brother, stop mocking me. Hurry and go!

337
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,930
A heavenly tribulation is no joke.

338
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,010
Little Immortal, the palace won't be heavily guarded tonight. Hurry and leave.

339
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:16,140
Your senior is being guarded by my eldest brother. I don't know where they're keeping him.

340
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,050
Just run first. Follow this black bird out of this courtyard,

341
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,790
travel north, and you'll eventually exit the palace.

342
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,400
Trying to lure me? That's not right.

343
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,840
I'm already imprisoned. What's the point in tricking me?

344
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,370
Slow down! Slow down!

345
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,280
I'm glad to have you; otherwise, I'd get lost.

346
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,710
Where did it go?

347
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,990
The weather is so nice today.

348
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,560
Come here.

349
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,550
Come here.

350
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:51,280
The color of your clothes is strange, but it looks nice.

351
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,420
Where did you buy it?

352
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,890
Green... Green Hill.

353
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,220
I was just worried about not having a birthday gift for my father.

354
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,580
Young man, give these clothes to me. Treat it as a favor.

355
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,300
- What are you doing?
- You're not a woman. Why are you scared?

356
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,870
Take it off, and I'll ask someone...

357
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,830
No!

358
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,730
Don't come closer. You...

359
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,650
It's bad. Without magic to sustain me, I'll drown!

360
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,650
I'll pass oxygen to you.

361
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,800
Pass oxygen?

362
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,700
Did you think oxygen could only be passed orally?

363
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,170
I don't want to touch you.

364
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,260
So cold.

365
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,550
Why are you so scared of the cold? You're like a mortal.

366
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,700
In this place, I'm basically a mortal.

367
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,350
I can't even use magic.

368
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,170
You're from the Heavenly Tribe?

369
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,610
Yes, you must also be.

370
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,490
Did he take you in as his godson, too?

371
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,470
What did you say? Godson?

372
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:27,220
Yes. Doesn't this Winged Monarch like acknowledging godsons?

373
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,450
You must also be one.

374
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,300
I'm the second prince of the Grand Purple Palace, Li Jing.

375
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,090
Who are you?

376
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,070
Forget it. Since I met you, I can't escape anymore.

377
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:07,250
I'm the seventeenth disciple of High God Mo Yuan of Kunlun Void, Si Yin.

378
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,590
Your father captured me.

379
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,760
You're the godson that my father captured?

380
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,460
The one your father wants is my ninth senior brother, not me.

381
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,150
Then, you're...?

382
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,980
I was captured together with him.

383
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,740
Forget it.

384
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,350
I can't escape anymore. Your Second Highness, just arrest me.

385
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,720
Arrest? Why?

386
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,670
Arrest you and make you my godson, just like my father?

387
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,680
I won't accept even if I have to die.

388
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,200
I was kidding. I don't have that kind of hobby.

389
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,070
If you want to escape, go ahead.

390
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,240
I don't like getting involved with this kind of business.

391
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,330
So here you are! Hurry and go back with us.

392
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,400
You've become more and more unruly.

393
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,860
Do you have any respect for me, the Prince?

394
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,570
Your Second Highness, we do not dare.

395
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:03,600
- Hurry and leave.
- Does Your Second Highness know who's standing next to you?

396
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,300
Do you really think that all I ever do is drink alcohol and have fun,

397
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,550
never knowing what happened in the Grand Purple Palace?

398
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:18,490
- I don't dare.
- A bunch of idiots with no brain.

399
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,110
- Hurry and get lost!
- Yes, Your Highness.

400
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,490
Still not withdrawing?

401
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:37,340
So you're the handsome Heavenly Tribesman that my younger sister likes?

402
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,600
What do you mean?

403
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,120
I heard people from the palace say that Yan Zhi is attracted to a young, handsome man from the Heavenly Tribe.

404
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:50,810
Since she's willing to help you escape, it means she really likes you.

405
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,690
I think there's a misunderstanding.

406
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,670
Don't worry.

407
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:00,460
Since my younger sister likes you so much, I can't let them capture you again.

408
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,480
I'll trouble myself and personally take you back.

409
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,430
Back where?

410
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:10,900
Back to wherever you came from, of course!

411
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,810
What did you say?

412
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:19,810
Second Prince is drinking with Si Yin, and has been chatting all night?

413
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,520
I heard it with my very own ears.

414
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,110
They were both drenched, saying they fell into the water.

415
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,630
Send out my order: don't stop Second Prince.

416
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,150
Allow him to mess around with that immortal from Kunlun Void.

417
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,770
When we declare war with Heavenly Tribe,

418
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:41,420
I'll find a chance to tell Father Monarch.

419
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:01,430
- Second Older Brother?
- You're back?

420
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,640
Second Older Brother, why are you drinking here?

421
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,440
This Heavenly Tribe immortal really is good-looking.

422
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,590
No wonder you like him.

423
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,920
Second Older Brother, you've misunderstood.

424
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,500
I've experienced many things.

425
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,320
How could I not tell?

426
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,820
Have you fallen for him?

427
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,260
But he's from the Heavenly Tribe.

428
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:30,210
If you like him, don't worry about which tribe he's from.

429
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,860
Heavenly and Winged Tribes can't intermarry.

430
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,450
Moreover, we're about to declare war on the Heavenly Tribe.

431
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,450
Younger Sister, I'm glad you're smart enough to know.

432
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,790
What he said about taking their disciple in as a godson was a total lie.

433
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,720
What a lie.

434
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,130
Father Monarch just can't contain himself,

435
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:53,790
and wanted to use this chance to rebel.

436
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,450
However, I'm not interested in rebelling.

437
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,150
Really?

438
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,600
Then...

439
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,750
Then what? Say whatever you're thinking.

440
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,620
When did you begin biting your tongue around me?

441
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,560
Since you don't approve of the rebellion,

442
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,030
how about you help me rescue him?

443
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,080
You really like him? Come here.

444
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,850
Since you really like him, then why save him?

445
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:39,720
Just lock him up and force him to surrender to you. That'll be easier.

446
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:44,490
No, no! If Father Monarch finds out, he'll surely kill him.

447
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,420
Don't worry.

448
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,140
Since he's the hostage, he's safe right now.

449
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,510
I made this rascal drink a lot of alcohol.

450
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:57,110
He'll be asleep for at least 10 days to half a month.

451
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:01,410
We can come up with a plan on how to rescue the man you like.

452
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,670
Second Older Brother, will you really help me?

453
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:08,230
He and I get along well.

454
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:11,330
I don't want him to die in Grand Purple Palace.

455
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,710
- Mother!
- The child is born!

456
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,720
- Look. It's a girl.
- A girl?

457
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,750
Our family has so many sons, and Young Fifth is the only daughter.

458
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:34,070
Now, our fox den will have another girl.

459
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,870
Congratulations, Second Older Brother, on the birth of your daughter.

460
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:40,310
It took her ten days to leave her mother's womb.

461
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,860
I'm guessing she'll be a mischievous child in the future.

462
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,300
Mother, what if she also turns out like Young Fifth?

463
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,990
Isn't it good to be like Young Fifth?

464
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,630
Fox Emperor, look.

465
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,570
This child has a red birthmark on her forehead.

466
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:00,150
Look at what it resembles. Look! Come here.

467
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,150
It looks like a phoenix flower.

468
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,160
Right, phoenix flower.

469
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,620
Phoenix ("feng" wei) flower.

470
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,020
Let me name her for you.

471
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,140
Bai Fengjiu. What do you think?

472
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,330
Bai Fengjiu. Good! That's good.

473
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:22,450
We'll listen to you, Mother. Her name will be Bai Fengjiu.

474
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,740
In the future, we'll call you Fengjiu, little fox.

475
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,560
Jiu'er, oh, Jiu'er!

476
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,320
You have an aunt who is studying at Kunlun Void.

477
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,160
Once she returns and sees you, she'll be overjoyed!

478
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,100
Here, here.

479
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,600
Take her outside, and show her to our Green Hill people.

480
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,810
She's the young empress of Green Hill who was just born.

481
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,170
Yes, Mother.

482
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,350
- Hurry and go.
- Okay, Father.

483
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,980
They've come out. They've come out.

484
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,420
This is the first princess born of Green Hill's third generation,

485
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,630
Bai Fengjiu.

486
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:15,050
Congratulations, Fox Emperor, for gaining your first grandchild.

487
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:19,910
Congratulations, Your Second Highness, for gaining a young princess.

488
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,890
The Winged Tribe's alcohol is good,

489
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,570
but it's too strong.

490
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,030
His Second Highness gave his order to you to leave for now.

491
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,780
Yes, Your Highness.

492
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,780
- Immortal.
- Immortal.

493
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:03,520
- You two are...?
- His Second Highness asked us to wait here.

494
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,560
After you are awake, we are to take you to Soup Pond.

495
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,580
Soup Pond?

496
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:38,110
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

497
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,140
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

498
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,860
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

499
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:48,140
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

500
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:57,030
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

501
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,480
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

502
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,880
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

503
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,120
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

504
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,390
♫ All are just illusions ♫

505
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:25,720
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

506
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,980
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

507
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,520
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

508
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,620
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

509
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:47,070
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

510
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:52,290
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

511
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:55,110
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

512
00:43:55,110 --> 00:44:03,030
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

513
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:16,110
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden as a dream ♫

514
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:21,630
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

515
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:26,110
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories, ♫

516
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:32,360
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

517
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:37,650
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms bloom again? ♫

518
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:42,990
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

519
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,810
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

520
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:54,850
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

521
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:06,810
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
