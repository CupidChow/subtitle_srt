”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,550
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,150
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,710
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,090
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,420
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,210
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,800
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,260
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,920
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,450
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,110
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,460
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,950
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,670
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,110
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,600
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,080
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,030
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,810
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,190
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,570
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,860
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,870
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,470
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,330
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,110
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,540
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,000
[Episode 45]

31
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,600
Mighty Monarch, yesterday we learned that the criminal Xuan Nü had escaped to Yingzhou. She has a mortal with her.

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,560
We have already stationed people near her secretly.

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,670
If Xuan Nü endangers Her Highness Princess, we will immediately take her down.

34
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,810
Why did they go to Yingzhou?

35
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,160
Could it be for the Mythical Mushroom?

36
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,470
Mighty Monarch, there is something else.

37
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,550
Speak.

38
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,260
Xuan Nü is constantly carrying the little prince around.

39
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,120
We are afraid to harm him if we were to end up fighting, so we have never attacked.

40
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,380
I understand. We will definitely prioritize the little prince!

41
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,510
You are wrong.

42
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,010
There is no such prince.

43
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:08,300
My child... was already dead the moment he was born.

44
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,820
I understand.

45
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,610
You may leave.

46
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,950
Yes.

47
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,090
Xuan Nü, you have fooled me for 70,000 years.

48
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,800
Why do you still carry that child up till today?

49
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,290
I really do not understand you.

50
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:58,870
Do you also think that I am a lunatic for carrying this sick child all day?

51
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,870
No, I don't.

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,430
Grand Purple Palace is a place where people are cursed.

53
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,850
It is filled with hatred and desires.

54
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,060
If you stay there for too long,

55
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,330
you'll be unknowingly pushed forward without your consent.

56
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,230
If you do something wrong, you can never turn back.

57
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,120
Back then, if you never returned with my second older brother,

58
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,590
then you would not be at this stage now.

59
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,110
You have lost everything and are filled with hatred.

60
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,440
Yes.

61
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,850
Back then, if I hadn't followed your second older brother to the Winged Realm...

62
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,820
Did you know?

63
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,060
I am the youngest daughter in my family.

64
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:13,160
When I was still a baby, my eldest sister married the eldest son of the Green Hill Fox Emperor Bai Zhi.

65
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:22,360
So since young, the comments I heard most were how my eldest sister brought such glory to our family.

66
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,830
And also because of my eldest sister,

67
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,260
I grew up with Bai Qian.

68
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,290
She is the Monarchess of Green Hill,

69
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,210
the most beautiful woman in Green Hill.

70
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,900
And I...

71
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,040
I am nothing.

72
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,510
Later on,

73
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,080
my mother wanted me to marry a black bear sprite,

74
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,140
so I ran away.

75
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,450
I escaped to Kunlun Void.

76
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,430
Yan Zhi, I really do love your second older brother.

77
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,220
You could say I snatched away Si Yin's lover.

78
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,120
Since that first mistake, every other step was a mistake.

79
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,740
There were no more chances for me to turn back.

80
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,310
For your second older brother, I abandoned everything.

81
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,490
He thought I only wanted the monarchess title,

82
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,160
but if I didn't truly love him,

83
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,240
why would I end up in such a state today?

84
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,700
Has your second sister-in-law really been carrying that sick child since birth?

85
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,760
Although he is her child, this is still scary.

86
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,990
You traveled with us all the way here.

87
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,250
Are you not scared?

88
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,030
What should I be scared of?

89
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,690
I am not a mortal.

90
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,670
I am of the Winged Tribe.

91
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,310
So you are referring to this?

92
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,130
Since young, I loved listening to operas.

93
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,950
Only people in books get to meet beautiful Winged Tribe women.

94
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,570
Since I have the chance to meet one, what should I be scared of?

95
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,990
This time we are going to Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea, a place even immortals avoid.

96
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,300
Yet you insist on coming with us.

97
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,300
Are you not scared of death?

98
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,500
What is Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea?

99
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,030
I don't know.

100
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,720
If I do not know, then naturally I am not fearful.

101
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:27,470
I didn't think that you could say such educated words.

102
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,220
At the very least, I'm a constable.

103
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,220
In my daily life, I always hear the higher officials speak this way.

104
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,910
After hearing them often, I naturally remember them.

105
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,940
You should sleep soon. I will stand guard.

106
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,880
No.

107
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,210
You are definitely not so simple.

108
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,340
You women really like to overthink.

109
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,990
Have you ever liked someone?

110
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,530
Why are you suddenly asking this?

111
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,580
I really want to know.

112
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,560
70,000 years ago, I had a secret crush on someone.

113
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,600
He was an immortal.

114
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,070
At that time, I was still very young.

115
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,750
I found him very adorable.

116
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,190
After that, the feelings diminished.

117
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,840
I don't know if those counted as real feelings.

118
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,530
You are really something. Saying whatever's on your mind.

119
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,150
I've always been this way.

120
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,760
It's just that mortals like you are really hard to handle.

121
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,090
It was more peaceful to pretend to be mute.

122
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,750
I, a mere mortal constable, also have a straightforward personality.

123
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,060
Little Mute,

124
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,290
I like you.

125
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,840
- You...
- What you?

126
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,020
Aren't you straightforward?

127
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,960
Do you like me?

128
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,760
- I...
- Stop.

129
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,830
Don't tell me you don't like me.

130
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,720
Do you actually know who I am?

131
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,450
That's right.

132
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,660
I know who you are.

133
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,280
You are Yan Zhi, the princess from Winged Tribe,

134
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,360
You are Yan Zhi, the princess from Winged Tribe,

135
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,380
the Winged Monarch's younger sister.

136
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,740
You already knew?

137
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,860
I have always known.

138
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,430
Who are you then?

139
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,900
I will tell you after tomorrow.

140
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,090
For now, just pretend that you don't know anything.

141
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,590
Just regard me as a mere constable.

142
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:04,100
Let me protect you for one last time.

143
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,200
Okay?

144
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,250
Okay.

145
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,870
Simple answer.

146
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,320
This is the Yan Zhi whom I like.

147
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,700
Sleep early.

148
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,760
I'm going to do guard duty for the night.

149
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,070
Hundun, Qiongqi, Taowu, and Taotie.

150
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,190
These four beasts have half the magic power of Father God.

151
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,480
They are extremely ferocious.

152
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,350
Ordinary immortals are afraid to go near them.

153
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,220
Oh? That scary?

154
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,480
It's good then. Let me meet them today.

155
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,020
There's a divine barrier here, trapping the four beasts in there.

156
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,330
Hence, they can't enter or exit.

157
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,830
But once you go deeper into the cave, no one can stop them.

158
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,870
Thus, you two, wait for me at the entrance of the cave.

159
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,820
No matter what happens or whatever sounds you hear, don't enter.

160
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,010
If I'm not out by evening, take my sister-in-law away from here.

161
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,740
Are you saying that you are going in alone?

162
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,440
You are right.

163
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,170
I'm going in alone.

164
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,790
Second Sister-in-Law's eyes are bad.

165
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,620
It's too dangerous to leave her alone out here.

166
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,730
Little Constable, I'm leaving Second Sister-in-Law in your care.

167
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,290
Second Sister-in-Law, wait for me to come out.

168
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,470
I will definitely get the Mystical Mushroom and save your child.

169
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,140
Yan Zhi. Yan Zhi!

170
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,820
She really doesn't want her life.

171
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,920
Listen carefully. Stay here.

172
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,360
If you want to live, don't wander anywhere.

173
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,940
This won't do.

174
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,830
I must personally obtain the Mystical Mushroom.

175
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,490
Didn't I tell you to wait for me outside?

176
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,680
Are you kidding? I'm a man.

177
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,220
Does it make sense that I'm waiting outside of the cave?

178
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,450
Quick! Take my second sister-in-law out of here.

179
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,890
These four ferocious beasts are not as weak as you think.

180
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,090
Beasts, listen carefully!

181
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,800
I'm the sixteenth disciple of Kunlun Void, Zi Lan.

182
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,490
With me here, forget about injuring anyone!

183
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,100
This is bad! Yan Zhi provoked the four beasts!

184
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,200
Protect His Mighty Monarch!

185
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,910
Yan Zhi. Yan Zhi!

186
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,170
Li Jing!

187
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,690
Before your Winged soldiers die, escape now!

188
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,470
Are you not aware of these four beasts' cultivation?

189
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,570
Even if there are ten of you, you can't escape.

190
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,390
You!

191
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,220
Mighty Monarch? Are you Mighty Monarch?

192
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,590
Are you here to look for the Mystical Mushroom? Are you here to save our child, too?

193
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,500
Don't bother about the Mystical Mushroom first.

194
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,890
Take the women out of here.

195
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,100
If it weren't for your younger sister, I wouldn't need your help.

196
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,050
Let's go. I will escort you out.

197
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,470
No!

198
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,900
The Mystical Mushroom is here. I'm not leaving.

199
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,900
I'm going to save my son! I'm going to save my son!

200
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,070
Do whatever you want. If you want to die, then make it fast.

201
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,590
Looking at the current situation, I don't think we can survive.

202
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,950
Your Highness the Crown Prince?

203
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,380
Why are you here?

204
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,400
Who disturbed the beasts?

205
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,880
It's the Winged Tribe. They are here to look for the Mystical Mushroom to save a child.

206
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,610
Winged Tribe? Who?

207
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,790
Winged Monarch and Winged Monarchess are both in there.

208
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,490
Leave now!

209
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,650
Leave now!

210
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,650
- Let's go.
- I'm not leaving.

211
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,470
Why are you still here?

212
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,950
- Leave now.
- I'm not leaving! I'm not leaving!

213
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,670
The Mystical Mushroom belongs to my son. I want to save his life!

214
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,460
I'm not leaving! I'm not leaving!

215
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,260
Leave with me.

216
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,710
Your Highness, what are you doing?

217
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:38,790
Submerging Yingzhou into the Eastern Sea and completely getting rid of any traces of the Mystical Mushroom.

218
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,960
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

219
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,760
I'm begging you.

220
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,700
Could you grant a Mystical Mushroom to me?

221
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,480
It's useless giving this to you. It's a sacred item of the Heavenly Tribe.

222
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,400
I know this,

223
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,620
but this child has a part of the Heavenly Tribe bloodline.

224
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,690
I was thinking, perhaps, it can be used.

225
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,930
I'm begging you. Taking into account of 70,000 years of goodwill between the Heavenly and Winged Tribes,

226
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,110
please give a Mystical Mushroom to this child.

227
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,950
I know that since Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea is destroyed now,

228
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,210
this sacred item will no longer exist.

229
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,990
What you are holding in your hand,

230
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:00,190
perhaps, is this child's only hope of living.

231
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,950
Thank you, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

232
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,470
Second Older Brother, I obtained the Mystical Mushroom from His Highness the Crown Prince.

233
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,070
Try this now and see if your son will awaken.

234
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,300
Second Sister-in-Law, she...

235
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,700
You're awake.

236
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,250
That's right.

237
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,450
This Mystical Mushroom is for our son.

238
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,430
Mighty Monarch.

239
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,900
Don't talk.

240
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,970
I will take you back to the Grand Purple Palace.

241
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,400
You will be well soon.

242
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,140
Very soon.

243
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,800
In the mountain cave at Kunlun Void,

244
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,320
I was sincere.

245
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,050
I know.

246
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:22,070
Xuan Nü, after 70,000 years, today was the first time I saw your real face.

247
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,680
As a husband and wife, we were such a joke.

248
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,070
It was also tragic.

249
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,100
Second Older Brother,

250
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,230
where did His Highness the Crown Prince go?

251
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,150
He went to the canyon.

252
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,780
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

253
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,740
I have handed over the Mystical Mushroom to your younger sister.

254
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,110
Is there any other matter?

255
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,640
Can you tell me?

256
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,340
Who are you saving with this Mystical Mushroom?

257
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,490
Do I need to explain to you about the matters of the Heavenly Tribe?

258
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:57,100
I only have one reminder for you.

259
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:02,400
This Mystical Mushroom can save anyone, except Mo Yuan.

260
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,560
Your Highness, don't worry.

261
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,420
I won't get involved in matters of the Heavenly Tribe.

262
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:19,220
I'm giving you this advice to repay you for giving me the Mystical Mushroom to save my son.

263
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,960
Why can't I save High God Mo Yuan?

264
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:30,580
70,000 years ago, Mo Yuan used his own spirit to seal the Donghuang Bell.

265
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,660
If 70,000 years later and Mo Yuan really wake up,

266
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,730
the spirit that is in the Donghuang Bell will vanish,

267
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:44,290
and Qing Cang could possibly break out from the bell.

268
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:47,640
High God Mo Yuan created the Donghuang Bell.

269
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,100
Don't tell me he can't even control it?

270
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,940
But, Your Highness, have you ever thought,

271
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,680
if Qing Cang's demonic power increases,

272
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,740
how long do you think the Donghuang Bell can last?

273
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,960
By that time, Mo Yuan's soul will vanish.

274
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,350
I dare to say the day when Qing Cang breaks out from the bell will be near.

275
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,020
Qing Cang is sealed in Donghuang Bell.

276
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,900
How can his demonic power increase?

277
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,530
Us three siblings of the Winged Tribe are the venom for Qing Cang's demonic power.

278
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:26,150
Every time one of us dies, Qing Cang's demonic power will increase.

279
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:30,020
A few days ago, my eldest brother died.

280
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,550
Since you and Ah Yin are engaged,

281
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,690
in the future, you two will become the Heavenly Monarch and Monarchess.

282
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:47,830
But, Your Highness, why would you want to help Ah Yin wake up High God Mo Yuan?

283
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,600
High God Mo Yuan is Qian Qian's teacher.

284
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,370
Saving him... has been Qian Qian's only wish for the past 70,000 years.

285
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:02,470
What if Qing Cang really breaks out from the bell?

286
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:10,530
Will you use your own spirit to seal Qing Cang for Ah Yin's sake to fulfill the reunion of Ah Yin and Mo Yuan?

287
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,330
That's all I have to say.

288
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,940
You are holding the last Mystical Mushroom.

289
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:27,350
Whatever you want to do with it, only you can decide.

290
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,950
- Frankly, I am...
- Zi Lan, Sixteenth Disciple of Mo Yuan of Kunlun Void.

291
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,220
How did you know? When did I expose it?

292
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,630
When I was knocked unconscious by the beasts, I vaguely heard you report your status.

293
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,410
This is our habit.

294
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,530
Before any battle, we must report our identity.

295
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:26,770
Or else, if we lose to our enemies, no one will collect our corpses.

296
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,980
- Yan Zhi, I...
- You...

297
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,590
I will be frank with you.

298
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,460
Previously, your second older brother barged into Kunlun Void and said he saw Si Yin.

299
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,960
Then, I wanted to come to the Mortal Realm to find my junior brother.

300
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,900
I didn't expect to see you.

301
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,680
It so happened that you ran into trouble.

302
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,730
I used that opportunity to approach and stay with you.

303
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,850
Seeing that a princess from the Winged Tribe was in the Mortal Realm,

304
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:56,790
pretending to be mute and managing a restaurant, I wondered what you were plotting.

305
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,920
Plotting?

306
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,090
Did you discover anything?

307
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,430
I didn't. I'm a stupid person.

308
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,630
I didn't discover anything.

309
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:11,790
Frankly, it wasn't anything.

310
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:17,240
I just didn't want to remain in Grand Purple Palace and watch them fight, scheme, and kill each other.

311
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,530
Thus, I came to the Mortal Realm to have some peace.

312
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,970
I see.

313
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:36,410
So, since you didn't discover any plots,

314
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,470
will you be leaving?

315
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,680
That's right.

316
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,640
If I were to return to the Mortal Realm,

317
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,170
will you go with me?

318
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,720
I won't.

319
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,010
I already received the message from Kunlun Void.

320
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,750
All my senior brothers have returned.

321
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,420
Hence, I need to go back.

322
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:07,390
I know that I'm a woman from the Winged Tribe and you are a High Immortal, but I still asked this question.

323
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,560
I really didn't want to give up.

324
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,290
Yan Zhi, I...

325
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,110
I'm leaving.

326
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,790
Don't follow me.

327
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,100
The cranes were like this when Teacher went to the battle at Ruoshui.

328
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,470
What's wrong with them tonight again?

329
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:55,190
Unless you are a disciple of Kunlun Void, you can't trespass into Kunlun Void!

330
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,050
Teacher?

331
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,510
I'm Crown Prince, Ye Hua.

332
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,700
Your Highness the Crown Prince, why did you come to Kunlun Void at night?

333
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:32,250
I would like to use your Pellet-Cultivating Furnace.

334
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,170
Pellet-Cultivating Furnace?

335
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,940
Okay. Your Highness, please follow me.

336
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,700
This Pellet-Cultivating Furnace was frequently used by our teacher.

337
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,650
- I don't know if it's still usable now.
- Thank you.

338
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,620
- Your Highness, do you still need me to help you?
- No need.

339
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,360
- But your injury...
- It's okay.

340
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,780
- You can leave first.
- Yes.

341
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,650
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

342
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,330
Your Highness, don't worry. I will keep silent.

343
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,900
Go to Yingzhou to obtain the Mystical Mushroom.

344
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:52,770
I'll refine my 70,000 years of cultivation and the Mystical Mushroom into a pill and let Die Yong have it.

345
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:56,770
In less than three months, my teacher will be able to wake up.

346
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,840
Qian Qian, this is the final thing I can do for you.

347
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,730
Seventeenth.

348
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,230
I just heard the palace maids talking among themselves.

349
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,980
They said that you are going to marry the Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

350
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:26,090
I still don't know if he's willing to be a Heavenly Monarch without a monarchess for my sake.

351
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:29,860
For the next thousand years, I won't be able to withstand the uncultivated fires and heavenly lightning.

352
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,850
Why?

353
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,640
Don't you know me?

354
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,620
It's because I didn't cultivate well.

355
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,290
When I was transcending into a high immortal,

356
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,460
Teacher blocked the tribulation on my behalf.

357
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,860
At that time, it was three bolts of heavenly lightning.

358
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:49,490
If I become the Heavenly Monarchess now, I need to receive eighty-one uncultivated fires and nine bolts of lightning.

359
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,450
This is not a joke.

360
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,110
You... You were always lazy in training.

361
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,570
It's even affecting you getting married now.

362
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,310
I really have nothing to say now.

363
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,130
Just one more night, and you'll be done.

364
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:09,320
Eat something to kill time.

365
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,470
Thank you, Eldest Senior Brother.

366
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,250
- What's wrong with you?
- Give this to Qian Qian.

367
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,940
You are losing your life and you are still giving to this her?

368
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,820
Eldest Prince, how do you feel?

369
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,060
Eldest Prince is awake.

370
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,760
Report to your Water Monarch now.

371
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

372
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:34,890
I feel that, since 600 years ago, my energy and strength haven't been like now.

373
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:41,930
I want to swim in the Eastern Sea today

374
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,310
and see the views that I haven't seen for 600 years.

375
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,230
Go then; don't hesitate.

376
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,580
If I had slept for six hundred years like you,

377
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,290
I wouldn't have been able to take it.

378
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,110
Immortal, it has been tough for you for the past few days.

379
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,300
Go and have some rest now.

380
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,620
I'm going to sleep.

381
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,510
I have been monitoring this flame for days.

382
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,480
My eyes are tired.

383
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,540
Please tell my eldest senior brother not to look for me for these two days.

384
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,980
He was fine.

385
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,190
How did he suddenly turn out like this?

386
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:39,560
Who knows? If he can still live, he will naturally tell us.

387
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,300
Are you sure this taciturn person will tell us?

388
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,160
He's severely injured. Instead of going back to Heavenly Palace first,

389
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,510
he comes to Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms Forest instead.

390
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,160
There's definitely something that he doesn't want others to know.

391
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,660
He doesn't want Heavenly Monarch to know, so he can only entrust himself to me and tell me.

392
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,910
This sounds logical.

393
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,170
Why are you holding this?

394
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,920
He's the Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

395
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,650
He's lacking one arm now.

396
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,280
Do you know how ugly he looks?

397
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,650
Thus, I went to Green Lotus Pond and scooped up a million-year-old lotus root to make a false arm for him.

398
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,620
Can this false arm wield a sword?

399
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,850
No, it can't. It can't even move.

400
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,550
It's just for show.

401
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,590
What do you want this for then?

402
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,930
It looks nice.

403
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:31,240
On the day he marries Young Fifth,

404
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,890
you wouldn't want him to have only one arm, right?

405
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,710
That's right, too.

406
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:39,640
Make it look real so that others can't tell.

407
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:15,810
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

408
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,860
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

409
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,540
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

410
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:25,920
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

411
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:35,220
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

412
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,200
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

413
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,460
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

414
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:49,820
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

415
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,650
♫ All are just illusions ♫

416
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:03,540
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

417
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:08,720
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

418
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,160
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

419
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:19,340
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

420
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:24,760
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

421
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:30,050
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

422
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,890
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

423
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:42,490
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

424
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,930
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

425
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:59,420
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

426
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,790
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

427
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:10,100
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

428
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:15,310
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

429
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:20,630
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

430
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,480
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

431
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:32,400
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

432
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:44,960
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
