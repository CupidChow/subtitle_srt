”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,460
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,970
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,580
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,070
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,320
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,120
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,710
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,230
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,760
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,330
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,940
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,320
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,990
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,500
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,990
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,560
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,040
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,960
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,730
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,220
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,710
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,020
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,790
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,490
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,810
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,070
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,590
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,950
[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,230
[Episode 32]

31
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,180
Green Hill is a place for immortals but you've made it resemble the Mortal Realm.

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,690
Men till the land and women weave clothes.

33
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,460
There's not even a hint of divine powers.

34
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:27,680
It's not interesting if we use divine powers to solve everything.

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,130
They'll get bored, too.

36
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:40,540
I'm thinking about making a battlefield someday and have them fight each other to prevent them from getting too bored.

37
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,390
That seems interesting.

38
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,130
I'll bring some Heavenly Soldiers to add to the fun.

39
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,960
I hurt myself.

40
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,750
I told you I don't know how to cook, Great Lady.

41
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,880
Let's forget about this meal.

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,650
It's fine if we don't eat.

43
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,990
What about Mochi?

44
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,140
Mi Gu, go quickly and get Fengjiu from the Mortal Realm.

45
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,760
Tell her Green Hill is in big trouble.

46
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,450
But I don't know where she is, Great Lady.

47
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,630
How about this? Go post a flyer at the entrance of the fox den asking for a nanny immediately.

48
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,530
Okay. I'll go right now.

49
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,740
That's good.

50
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,980
You should at least know how to keep a fire going, right?

51
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,690
- Put some more firewood.
- Okay.

52
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,530
Your wife must be a good cook.

53
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,820
She taught you well, Monarch Ye Hua.

54
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,710
Wait.

55
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,720
His wife's spirit and soul dissapated.

56
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,590
Did I open old wounds mentioning it?

57
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,970
She's like you.

58
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,500
She could only keep the fire going when I cooked.

59
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,330
I have no idea how she survived on Junji Mountain before she met me.

60
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,920
Why are you not talking anymore?

61
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,900
I'm afraid you'll be sad so I don't know what to say.

62
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,790
Su Su.

63
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,710
See? You're too sad.

64
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,440
You have called me by the wrong name, haven't you?

65
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,010
Have you been to the Eastern Wilderness before?

66
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,900
Eastern Wilderness? I...

67
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,610
I used to go there with Sixteenth Senior Brother to play.

68
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,400
Don't tell me he figured something out and knows I'm Si Yin?

69
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,120
Is he using Little Mochi as an excuse to live here and try to find Teacher's body?

70
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,280
Why are you staring at me with a guilty face?

71
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,920
N-Nothing.

72
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,540
Are you almost done with this dish?

73
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:29,580
I don't know about the flavor but you do look like a chef.

74
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,560
Forget about it. I doubt he can figure out something that's been hidden for 70,000 years.

75
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,730
Father Monarch, if you keep feeding me, I'll become a ball.

76
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,050
That's a good thing to become a ball.

77
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,920
This way when I take you back to Heavenly Palace, you don't need to ride on the clouds.

78
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,910
I can just roll you into Qingyun Hall.

79
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,070
Father Monarch is a bad person!

80
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,980
You've found a good ally now.

81
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,450
It's going to be all right.

82
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,540
Qian Qian, here.

83
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,900
You need more nourishment.

84
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,220
Ah Li, here.

85
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,910
You need more nourishment. Okay?

86
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,940
Uncle Mi Gu, you need more nourishment.

87
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,890
Qian Qian, clear up a study for me to process official documents in.

88
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,440
You want to process official documents?

89
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,480
I want to live here for a few days.

90
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,280
Sure.

91
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,120
Mi Gu,

92
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,030
go clean up Fourth Older Brother's old room.

93
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,590
Sure. I'll go now.

94
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,340
Mi Gu! Come here.

95
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,090
Great Lady.

96
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,550
Is he going to sleep?

97
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,750
He's already asleep. His Young Highness sleeps every night between 9:00 and 11:00 p.m.

98
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,300
His Highness Crown Prince takes good care of him. He personally does everything.

99
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,130
When is he leaving?

100
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,480
He didn't say.

101
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,000
Didn't you say he's here for revenge?

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,290
- I'm afraid...
- Afraid of what?

103
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:10,010
I heard that Nine Heavens has been looking for High God Mo Yuan for 70,000 years.

104
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,990
I don't think His Highness the Crown Prince is here with good intentions, Great Lady.

105
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,940
You're usually not this bright yet we're thinking the same thing today.

106
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,070
I'll be going then.

107
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,280
Qian Qian.

108
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,120
Ye Hua? You haven't slept yet?

109
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,670
Ah Li just went to bed.

110
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,320
I want to play chess with you.

111
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,400
Play chess?

112
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,550
Monarch Ye Hua, that's an interesting hobby.

113
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,690
These years, other than protecting the Long Sea,

114
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,690
I haven't stopped looking for Seventeenth.

115
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,880
Yet I haven't found a single clue.

116
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,860
I'm afraid it bodes ill rather than well.

117
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,240
I'm the eldest disciple, yet I've failed my duties.

118
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,370
I can't even protect my junior brother.

119
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,160
I've let down Teacher.

120
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,140
Don't say that, Eldest Senior Brother.

121
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,770
To lose Seventeenth is all of us brothers' fault.

122
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,750
Forget it. It's been so long since we've seen each other.

123
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,170
We shouldn't talk about such sad things.

124
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,260
By the way, Sixteenth, are you still going to the Mortal Realm to train?

125
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,960
To tell the truth, I say I've been training these past 70,000 years,

126
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,560
but I've actually been looking for Seventeenth.

127
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,060
I originally planned to keep looking.

128
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,330
But after meeting Winged Monarch yesterday,

129
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,840
I change my mind.

130
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,390
Kunlun Void, once the place where immortals paid homage, is now a vacant place.

131
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,180
I haven't been able to find Seventeenth after 70,000 years.

132
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:59,570
We might as well go back to Kunlun Void and take care of everything properly for Teacher.

133
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,560
Do you remember what Teacher said before he left us?

134
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,970
Seventeenth and I believe what Teacher said.

135
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,360
Since he said to wait for him,

136
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,390
it means he'll come back then!

137
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,820
For each day that I can't find Seventeenth, I will keep continuing to search.

138
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,180
I will go back to Kunlun Void first and wait for your good news.

139
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,150
Who are you looking for?

140
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,760
Great Lady, this is the scholarly official who personally attends to His Highness the Crown Prince, Star Monarch Jia Yun.

141
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,560
This is His Highness the Crown Prince's War Official, Star Monarch Tian Shu.

142
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,130
Great Lady.

143
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:22,000
Great Lady, His Highness instructed us yesterday to deliver all his future official documents here.

144
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,220
Deliver official documents?

145
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,860
Don't worry. I'll only come here once a day in the morning.

146
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,960
I will take the ones which have been approved the day before, and deliver the ones to be approved later.

147
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,950
- Then this is...
- Great Lady, don't worry.

148
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,300
I'm here to protect His Highness and Young Highness.

149
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,850
I won't bother your life with His Highness.

150
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,640
I'll greet you and disappear.

151
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,340
Unless His Highness orders me to, I won't appear in front of you.

152
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,250
Why do people from the Winged Realm want to kill me?

153
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,600
Don't tell me the Winged Realm wants to fight the Heavenly Tribe again?

154
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,120
Did you say that His Mighty Monarch instructed Jia Yun to deliver the official documents to Green Hill?

155
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,150
Yes, Your Highness.

156
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,730
When Jia Yun came back, he told the staff at His Mighty Monarch's bedchamber.

157
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,040
His Mighty Monarch just met Bai Qian once at the Eastern Sea.

158
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,520
Why is he going to live with her so suddenly?

159
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,920
I heard that nine-tailed white foxes are attractive and seductive in nature,

160
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,590
and are good in casting enchanting spells, too.

161
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,810
I'm guessing...

162
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:41,760
She might've done something obscene to His Mighty Monarch and bewitched his soul.

163
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,170
So what if she's attractive and seductive in nature?

164
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,050
Didn't a mere snake snatch the Second Highness away from her?

165
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,690
I did so many things,

166
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:02,370
suffered the pain of changing my eyes, and offered the Soul-Gathering Lamp

167
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,210
before I could enter the Pure Wutong Palace.

168
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,240
Just because she was born as the monarchess of Green Hill,

169
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,040
she can become the main consort for no reason?

170
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,090
This world is really unfair.

171
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,680
You're right, Your Highness.

172
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,120
We need to find a way to teach her a lesson.

173
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,760
No.

174
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,230
She's the monarchess of Green Hill.

175
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,750
The entire Four Seas calls her Great Lady.

176
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,210
She's also the crown princess that Heavenly Monarch personally chose.

177
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:43,050
If we want to go heads on with her, we won't gain anything.

178
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,630
Don't tell me, you're just going to bear with it, Your Highness?

179
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,430
No.

180
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,050
It's not about bearing with it or not.

181
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,120
I finally got to where I am today.

182
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,200
I was even able to enter Pure Wutong Palace when Ye Hua was unwilling,

183
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,280
and let the Four Seas think that I am his only favored consort.

184
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,360
I didn't rely on submitting to humiliation and fighting heads on.

185
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,540
I relied...

186
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,210
on this.

187
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,520
You're right, Your Highness.

188
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,660
In the past, Heavenly Tribe withdrew the engagement because of Second Highness.

189
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,330
Hence, Heavenly Monarch won't allow Ye Hua to do anything.

190
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,070
I had originally thought Ye Hua would hang onto that deceased mortal, Su Su, and not easily marry her.

191
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,820
But who knew he would go to the Eastern Sea once and fall into her enchantment?

192
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,450
Xin Nu, if we want to get rid of this obstacle,

193
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:59,070
the best way is to make her withdraw the engagement herself.

194
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,850
Make her withdraw herself?

195
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,720
That's right.

196
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,350
She doesn't care about Ye Hua.

197
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,310
She's also the monarchess of Green Hill.

198
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:17,390
If she feels like she's trapped and uncomfortable when she's with Ye Hua,

199
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,880
she might withdraw from the engagement out of anger.

200
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,940
Even if she doesn't,

201
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,820
she wouldn't treat Ye Hua well.

202
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,530
That's right.

203
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,870
You're right.

204
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,820
Your idea is good, Your Highness.

205
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,950
Go to Green Hill right now and tell her a message according to my will.

206
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,510
Let her know the Heavenly Tribe has rules.

207
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,060
She may be engaged to His Highness, but they are not officially married.

208
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,560
It's very inappropriate for them to sleep together like that every day.

209
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,820
We need to put her in her place.

210
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,360
Yes.

211
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,620
I will go immediately.

212
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,660
Great Lady, you didn't sleep well last night?

213
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,950
That crown prince requested me to play chess with him last night.

214
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,350
I was so sleepy. I just wanted to rest for a bit,

215
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,150
but ended up sleeping like that all night.

216
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,060
I'm going to sleep for a bit longer. You take care of him.

217
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,070
Sure.

218
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,380
Raise your head.

219
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,160
Let me see your face.

220
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,170
Your Highness.

221
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,780
I hear you'd saved Young Heavenly Grandson before.

222
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,490
Your Highness, when I was passing through Junji Mountain,

223
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,350
I saw a monster bullying His Young Highness,

224
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,500
so I helped save him and brought him to the hut they stayed at.

225
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,730
Young Heavenly Grandson is the eldest son of His Mighty Monarch.

226
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,410
He's also the only child and favored.

227
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,720
You have very good luck.

228
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,240
Tell me. What should I reward you with on His Mighty Monarch's behalf?

229
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,320
I don't dare.

230
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:08,480
I just want to be an ordinary maidservant in His Mighty Monarch's palace serving him for years to come.

231
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,850
I'll be satisfied then.

232
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,920
Maidservant?

233
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,960
You are the princess of the Northern Sea.

234
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,360
With your identity, no one will say anything if you marry into Pure Wutong Palace.

235
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,640
Won't you feel wronged to just be a maid?

236
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,590
Am I right, Princess Miao Qing?

237
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,360
Stand up first.

238
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:52,940
With your identity and as a savior of His Young Highness, becoming a consort is not hard.

239
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,910
I've been the only one serving His Mighty Monarch in this palace for 70,000 years.

240
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,060
It's been lonely.

241
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:12,400
If you really want, I will help you to marry His Mighty Monarch.

242
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,840
It'll also make this palace more lively.

243
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,910
Thank you for Your Highness' blessing.

244
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,350
You don't need to thank me.

245
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,460
I just understand your infatuation.

246
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,170
It's just like how I feel about His Mighty Monarch.

247
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,560
We share the same fate.

248
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:39,770
I heard that High Goddess Bai Qian of Green Hill also went to the banquet for Water Monarch's son.

249
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,960
Did you see that High Goddess?

250
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,480
High Goddess Bai Qian?

251
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,790
What?

252
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,710
Is it hard to talk about?

253
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:04,710
It's not that. It's just that at the Eastearn Sea, I mistook High Goddess Bai Qian for Your Highness.

254
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,800
That sounds interesting.

255
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,750
Keep going.

256
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,330
Stop. Is the Great Lady in the den?

257
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,720
Are you looking for Great Lady?

258
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,670
That's right. I'm Consort Su Jin's maid.

259
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:45,310
I want to see Great Lady.

260
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:50,580
My Great Lady and His Mighty Monarch played chess last night and took a walk this morning.

261
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,620
She's tired and resting now.

262
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,500
What do you want? Just tell me.

263
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:00,230
Her Highness is tolerant.

264
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:04,560
Besides, she's the future Heavenly Monarch Consort.

265
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,280
She sent me here in good will.

266
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,250
High Goddess Bai Qian and His Highness the Crown Prince are not married,

267
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,930
yet they are passionately entangled all day like a married couple.

268
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,920
This is not appropriate after all.

269
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,600
Even Heavenly Monarch wasn't like this in the past.

270
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,220
Also, Princess Miao Qing will be invited to Heavenly Palace.

271
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,850
His Highness the Crown Prince shouldn't neglect her.

272
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,340
Green Hill doesn't have so many complicated rules like you Heavenly Tribe.

273
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,470
A mere immortal is trying to cause a ruckus here.

274
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,660
Did you think there's no one here to defend Green Hill?

275
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,670
- That's right!
- Is there no one here in Green Hill?!

276
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,610
Clearly, you randomly make up an excuse to embarrass Green Hill!

277
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,100
His Mighty Monarch has a mistress and a child.

278
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,160
Our Great Lady doesn't look down on you all, but you look down on her?

279
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,730
You... You unruly citizens!

280
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,110
How dare you say the Heavenly Tribe has too many rules?

281
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,960
Scram! Get out of Green Hill instantly!

282
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,890
That's right! Get out of here!

283
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,880
- Leave Green Hill now!
- Scram! We don't welcome you here!

284
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,670
- Leave Green Hill!
- Leave!

285
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,500
Scram!

286
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,030
- You can't do this!
- Leave Green Hill!

287
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,500
- Get! Get out of here!
- You!

288
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,350
- What are you guys doing?!
- Scram!

289
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,270
- Mi Gu.
- Yes!

290
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,980
What's the ruckus about?

291
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,690
Consort Su Jin sent someone to ask His Highness the Crown Prince to go back, Great Lady.

292
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,860
I didn't even say anything and everyone just shooed her out.

293
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,340
Su Jin? Ye Hua's side consort?

294
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,250
Yes, Great Lady!

295
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,040
Why are they so mean?

296
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,340
That little immortal doesn't have a good attitude.

297
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,390
She said that you and His Highness the Crown Prince are not married,

298
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,740
yet you are passionately entangled all day like a married couple.

299
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,570
It's not appropriate after all.

300
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,120
Even Heavenly Monarch wasn't like this in the past.

301
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,860
When everyone heard that, they got mad and kicked her out.

302
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,840
I got it.

303
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,910
It's a good drawing.

304
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:42,950
Your side consort just sent someone to ask you to go back.

305
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,480
Although what she said was not accurate,

306
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,490
after weighing it, I feel that what she said sounded reasonable.

307
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,270
What did she say?

308
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,970
She said that we are not married,

309
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,420
yet we are passionately entangled all day like a married couple.

310
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,570
Although what she said is not true,

311
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:11,770
you living here all day isn't too good, either.

312
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,510
What do you think?

313
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:17,660
I wanted to come live here, so I will.

314
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,120
You're my wife. Can other people mind our business?

315
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:28,150
If I had married when I became of age, my grandchild would be your age now.

316
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,360
Qian Qian, you keep reminding me that you are tens of thousands of years older than me.

317
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,790
What are you trying to say?

318
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,560
I just casually mentioned it.

319
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,120
That divine maid said you took Princess Miao Qing to the Heavenly Palace, too.

320
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,500
That's right.

321
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,210
Qian Qian, sit down first.

322
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,050
- Actually, lay down.
- What?

323
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:10,520
Get into a comfortable position, raise your hand and face me.

324
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,400
Smile.

325
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,890
All right.

326
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,270
Very good.

327
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,820
He wants to paint me?

328
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,400
As a crown prince, why is his mood so unstable?

329
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,790
One minute, his face is so cold; and next, he's smiling radiantly.

330
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:41,390
It seems that Miao Qing refused to marry the Second Prince of the Western Sea,

331
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,630
but she saved Ah Li's life.

332
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,390
I just sent her to the palace to be a maidservant.

333
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,650
Once she's cleared her head, she'll leave automatically.

334
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,340
Frankly, the Second Prince of the Western Sea is not that unbearable.

335
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,480
You know him?

336
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,260
Trying to probe me again.

337
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,790
I don't.

338
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,590
I merely heard Fourth Older Brother talk about him.

339
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:12,490
Besides, isn't that Second Prince High God Mo Yuan's disciple?

340
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,780
I assume that he wouldn't be a playboy.

341
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,140
She probably made up an excuse.

342
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:26,170
Qian Qian, is there anything else you want to say to me?

343
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,840
- There's something I want to say.
- Speak.

344
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,230
My... My hand is numb.

345
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:38,800
Can... Can I change to another pose?

346
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,810
As you wish.

347
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,500
Your Highness.

348
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,450
That Bai Qian of Green Hill is hard to push around.

349
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,380
Green Hill is also full of unruly people.

350
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,070
They said the Heavenly Tribe has too many rules.

351
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,750
And they said that in Green Hill,

352
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,400
it's fine as long as it is a mutual attraction, that they don't care about decorum.

353
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,170
What?

354
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,260
They really said that?

355
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,670
- Bai Qian said that?
- That's the infuriating part.

356
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,710
I couldn't even see her.

357
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:09,380
That Bai Qian uses her position as a High Goddess and let an insignificant tree spirit to dismiss me.

358
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:14,010
They didn't care that I was your maid.

359
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,260
No matter what, I was once a heavenly consort.

360
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,100
I was personally bestowed to His Mighty Monarch by the Heavenly Monarch.

361
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,280
Also, I'm the first official wife of Pure Wutong Palace.

362
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,490
Yet she looks down on me like this?!

363
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,300
That's not all.

364
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,890
Those barbarians at Green Hill also said...

365
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,950
They said you are His Mighty Monarch's concubine,

366
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,190
that we're lucky that their Great Lady doesn't mind us, but we have the nerve to teach her a lesson.

367
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,650
How presumptuous!

368
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:48,120
- It's indeed presumptuous. They are—
- Don't say anymore!

369
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,500
Your Highness, what's wrong?

370
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,700
I told you to stop talking about it!

371
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,940
Your Highness, please don't be angry.

372
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:12,180
Let me think carefully on how to bring back His Mighty Monarch from that vixen's side.

373
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,740
Your Highness, today is Heavenly Monarch's birthday.

374
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,770
You shouldn't be too agitated.

375
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,600
It's okay.

376
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,770
I just lost control momentarily.

377
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,480
It's okay.

378
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,670
You said that today is Heavenly Monarch's birthday?

379
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,240
Yes, Your Highness.

380
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,060
Did you forget?

381
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,670
I've been so distracted by this fox of Green Hill recently.

382
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,090
I actually forgot this matter.

383
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:58,650
Did you prepare the gift that I told you to prepare?

384
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,900
Yes, Your Highness.

385
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,300
Are there any special guests this year?

386
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,420
It's the same as previous years.

387
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,070
If you want to talk about special,

388
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,780
it should be the Northern Sea Water Monarch and his eldest son Yuan Zhen.

389
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,440
- Yuan Zhen?
- Yes.

390
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,130
I heard that he wrote many congratulatory messages for Heavenly Monarch.

391
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:29,500
Heavenly Monarch is very pleased and personally requested the Northern Sea Water Monarch to bring him here.

392
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:35,460
I'm guessing that the many years of estrangement between the Northern Sea Water Monarch and Heavenly Monarch

393
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,020
might be resolved because of this grandson.

394
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,980
Go and help me prepare.

395
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,210
We have to do this right.

396
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,080
Are Your Highness really going to do that? I'm afraid—

397
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,350
No need to be afraid.

398
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,590
Nothing will happen.

399
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,970
I heard you've been here since young.

400
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:15,160
You've been here since Qian Qian was 10,000 years old.

401
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,670
That's right. It's been a long time indeed.

402
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,050
If Qian Qian wanted to be a High Goddess,

403
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,280
she is supposed to go through two heavenly tribulations:

404
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,230
once to reach high immortal, and once for a high goddess.

405
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,290
That's...That's right.

406
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:36,550
Since you watched her grow up, can you tell me how she passed these two tribulations?

407
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,530
Let me think. Think.

408
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,080
It's hard to remember with my old age.

409
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,880
Great Lady transcended to a high immortal in Kunlun Void.

410
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,010
What if he's here to investigate High God Mo Yuan?

411
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,900
I must be careful.

412
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,150
She ascended a high immortal in the fox den,

413
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,960
and Fox Emperor helped her to block it.

414
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:06,350
As for High Goddess, Your Highness Crown Prince should know that she fought with Qing Cang.

415
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,980
Her battle with Qing Cang?

416
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,070
That's right.

417
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:16,420
She lost her memories and became a mortal after fighting Qing Cang.

418
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:20,040
Ye Hua, oh, Ye Hua. She's your Su Su.

419
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,730
Why do you need to repeatedly double-check?

420
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,250
It doesn't matter if she forgot or not.

421
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,020
It's good enough that she's back.

422
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,380
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

423
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,320
Did you recall something? You look happy.

424
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,560
It's nothing.

425
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,830
I'm taking your Great Lady to the Mortal Realm.

426
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,060
Mortal Realm?

427
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:55,290
This Crown Prince is really hard to figure out.

428
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:58,470
One minute, he's dark; and the next, he's bright.

429
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,210
The timing of the rain is good.

430
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,980
I finally don't have to go on walks with him.

431
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,380
Monarch Ye Hua, look.

432
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,590
I don't know which water monarch cast this rain today.

433
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,400
I'm scared it'll drench you.

434
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,190
Why don't we stay here in the fox den today?

435
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,560
Father Monarch said he's taking us to the Mortal Realm to play today.

436
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,040
It's not raining there today.

437
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,180
You are going to play in the Mortal Realm?

438
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,120
You should find a tutelary to show you the way.

439
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,650
Look, I'm always in the fox's den.

440
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,870
I'm not familiar with the Mortal Realm.

441
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,610
Mother, I want you to go.

442
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,430
Wait for me to change my clothes. Okay?

443
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,390
Have a look.

444
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,280
Sugar figurines.

445
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,350
Godfather, I want this!

446
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,440
Which one do you want, young sir?

447
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,430
Here, have this one. Hold on tight.

448
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,330
Your pearl can buy this entire street.

449
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,370
Be careful. Don't drop it.

450
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,800
Okay.

451
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,410
Herb-flavored nuts.

452
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,440
- Healthy and fragrant. Come try it!
- Thank you, godfather.

453
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,100
Herb-flavored nuts.

454
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,820
Young sir, try these herb-flavored nuts.

455
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,180
[Herb-Flavored Nuts]

456
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,450
[Herb-Flavored Nuts]

457
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,980
Godfather, I want this one!

458
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,000
- Pack a bag for me.
- Okay.

459
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,860
Why are you interested in coming to the Mortal Realm today?

460
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,770
I recall that Jia Yun brought a stack of official documents yesterday.

461
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,140
From his expression, they don't seem to be leisurely documents.

462
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,910
It's Ah Li's birthday today.

463
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,520
You're so unfair.

464
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,860
Why didn't you tell me such a big event was today?

465
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,270
He calls me mother yet I don't have a single present.

466
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,850
That's cold.

467
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,910
What do you want to get him? A luminous pearl?

468
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,750
How did you know?

469
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,430
Isn't it your habit to gift luminous pearls for all these years?

470
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,260
A junior immortal will get a small pearl and a senior immortal will get a big pearl.

471
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,520
Although the pearls are very expensive,

472
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,690
Ah Li is young and doesn't understand value.

473
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,610
It's a waste to gift him one.

474
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:35,560
You don't know, but I have one that is half as tall as a human.

475
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,330
It's like the moon.

476
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,520
If you place it in his Qingyun Hall, he will be happy when he looks at it.

477
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,380
- It's the only one in the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses...
- Be careful!

478
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,490
There you are! What happened?

479
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,060
- Thank you, young sir.
- No problem!

480
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,180
- You scared me!
- Are you all right?

481
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,190
I'm fine.

482
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,960
Qian Qian, it's only been a few years since I last saw you.

483
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,080
How did you become like this?

484
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,110
I've never left Green Hill in these 70,000 years.

485
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:16,230
I was never injured, either. Was that a dream just now?

486
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,110
What's wrong?

487
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,950
Customers, here are your dishes.

488
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,240
Customers, here you are.

489
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,010
This Young Sir is stunning.

490
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:44,890
He's cute when he's young but who knows how he'll look when he gets older.

491
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,800
Enjoy.

492
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:51,450
Mother, do you dislike me?

493
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,970
It's pointless for boys to look handsome.

494
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:00,610
A strong fist is better than a pretty face.

495
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:03,340
Even more so, a daughter resembles her father and a son resembles his mother.

496
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:08,150
In my opinion, once you grow up, you will be good looking, too.

497
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,350
That's right! Mother is so beautiful.

498
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:14,690
I'll be good looking that I won't embarrass Mother.

499
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,620
You're right. It doesn't matter what you grow up to look like,

500
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,460
you're still my precious child.

501
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,260
I'll always protect you. You know that, right?

502
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,510
Godfather, you treat me so well.

503
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,780
Hello, customers. I personally warmed up this Laojiao liquor.

504
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,840
It's perfect for drinking now. Try it.

505
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,550
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

506
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,890
This is your favorite. Eat more of this.

507
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,560
You dislike this the most but it's good for your health.

508
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,050
Look at how skinny you are.

509
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:57,580
Even if you don't mind, it breaks my heart to see.

510
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,520
Qian Qian, if you can't stand sweet words,

511
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,790
what will you do from now on?

512
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:21,480
Your Highness. Great Lady. Immortals from all realms are all coming to Heavenly Monarch's birthday banquet.

513
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,370
Not long after Western Sea Second Prince Die Feng arrived at Heavenly Palace, he went to Purple Morning Hall.

514
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,270
He said he had something to report to you personally.

515
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,680
I dare not hold him up and came here to get you.

516
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:36,020
Stay with Ah Li. I'll go back to the Heavenly Palace. I'll be back tonight.

517
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,620
Sure.

518
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,370
Dear customer, take care. Come again.

519
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,230
Okay.

520
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,640
Dear customers, only the two of you?

521
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,880
What happened to the other young sir who was with you?

522
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,910
Is there anything fun around here?

523
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,570
A fun place? There is.

524
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:02,080
Go north from here and there's a tea house.

525
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:07,210
The tea house is rather expensive but the storyteller there is extremely good.

526
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,020
- Storyteller?
- That's right.

527
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,050
- Let's go there, then.
- Sure.

528
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,380
- Thank you.
- No problem.

529
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,460
[Gathering Tea House]

530
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,550
Let's pick up from where we were.

531
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,860
Great.

532
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,710
- It's said that this ten-foot python...
- This way, please.

533
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,770
It had shimmering spots on its body.

534
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:30,450
Zhang Fei suddenly thought that he was bold.

535
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:33,910
It kept looking for food left and right, making people feel frightened.

536
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,160
Excellent!

537
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,510
The snake monster...

538
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,370
If one is eaten up by it,

539
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:44,260
he will surely die.

540
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:50,250
With just the time for your Father Monarch to finish his tea back in the Heavenly Palace, it will be nighttime here.

541
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,870
Let's sit here and wait for him.

542
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:56,290
These two men jumped so high and towards that golden snake,

543
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,600
they swung a punch at it.

544
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,000
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

545
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,360
I have something important to do in the Mortal Realm.

546
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,670
I'll be leaving after this candle goes out.

547
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,700
I will keep the story short then.

548
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:19,530
The immortals who left the first-month banquet of the Eastern Sea met a group of people with unknown identities.

549
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,590
They wanted our lives.

550
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,660
Such a thing happened?

551
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,050
Did you capture any survivors of the attempt?

552
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:29,340
There weren't any. Their lives were taken away by black magic.

553
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,550
My Sixteenth Junior Brother thinks that those were puppets created by black magic.

554
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:37,620
So there's a high possibility their master is from the Winged Realm.

555
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,490
Winged Realm?

556
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:09,730
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

557
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,850
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

558
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:14,460
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

559
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,710
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

560
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:29,030
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

561
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,110
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

562
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:38,470
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

563
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:45,710
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

564
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,780
♫ All are just illusions ♫

565
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:57,410
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

566
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:02,610
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

567
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:07,090
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

568
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:13,270
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

569
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:18,800
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

570
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,810
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

571
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,780
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

572
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:35,870
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

573
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:47,890
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden as a dream ♫

574
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:53,340
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

575
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,660
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

576
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:03,970
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

577
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:09,260
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

578
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:14,670
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

579
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,370
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

580
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:26,550
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

581
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:39,270
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
