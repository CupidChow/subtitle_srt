”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,580
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,080
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,590
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,010
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,400
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,220
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,880
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,280
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,990
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,090
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,910
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,300
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,060
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,410
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,190
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,550
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,030
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,030
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,820
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,190
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,770
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,990
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,980
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,550
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,990
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,100
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,820
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,240
[Episode 57]

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,710
Could you please let us take him back and bury him at the Sea of Innocence in the Thirty-Six Heaven?

32
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,060
Please grant our wish, High Goddess.

33
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,550
Our Great Lady isn't using His Highness the Crown Prince's body for something.

34
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,250
Since His Highness the Crown Prince loved our Great Lady that much while living,

35
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,280
so what if we keep his body here?

36
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,760
You relied on so many people and even invited Emperor Dong Hua here.

37
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,750
Mi Gu,

38
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,750
don't say anymore.

39
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,050
Yes.

40
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,000
Great Lady.

41
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:55,160
I heard everything from every one of you.

42
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,760
I understand, too.

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,010
It's just that when I was Su Su,

44
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,370
I was once Ye Hua's wife.

45
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,530
Now,

46
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,350
Ye Hua and I are engaged.

47
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,220
As his wife, I still want to do one last thing for him.

48
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:26,200
Let me prepare his clothes for him and wipe his face.

49
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,550
Let him leave Green Hill in a clean condition.

50
00:03:52,690 --> 00:04:00,860
This bow is what I'm supposed to give to the both of you as Ye Hua's wife

51
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,800
Stand up. We'll wait.

52
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,440
Thank you.

53
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,000
Eldest Sister-in-Lw, don't cry anymore.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,980
The ending today

55
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,150
is what Ye Hua, as the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe, did for everyone and the universe.

56
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,510
Stop blaming High Goddess Bai Qian.

57
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,210
On the contrary, it will incite feelings of animosity between the Heavenly Tribe and Green Hill.

58
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,300
I'm Ye Hua's mother.

59
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,490
He died twice for a woman.

60
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,060
Do you still want me to care about the friendship between the Heavenly Tribe and Green Hill?

61
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,760
Do you think my heart is not in pain?

62
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,550
Is Bai Qian the only one whose heart is breaking?

63
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,930
Don't be agitated, Eldest Sister-in-Law.

64
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,340
This is not what I meant.

65
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,290
Since High Goddess Bai Qian has agreed to return Ye Hua's body to us,

66
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,990
let's be patient and wait.

67
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,340
Dear distinguished guests, please have tea first.

68
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,030
I heard you are going to be the monarchess of Green Hill, Young Highness.

69
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,680
You are so young and you are going to be the monarchess of Five Wildernesses.

70
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,980
It's remarkable.

71
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,410
Originally, Aunt was going to marry into Nine Heavens.

72
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,030
There's no need for now.

73
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,650
Ye Hua, do you remember

74
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:38,300
I'd told you that I would lock you up in Green Hill

75
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,350
and you'll only see me every day?

76
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,520
But from the looks of it now,

77
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,870
I may not be able to do it.

78
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,370
It's because you are the Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

79
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,520
I'm the monarchess of Green Hill.

80
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,590
If I insist on keeping you here,

81
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:15,310
I'll let Green Hill and the Heavenly Tribe be embarrassed.

82
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,740
I remember you told me at that time,

83
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:36,520
you said the person you envy the most is your Second Uncle.

84
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,160
I didn't understand at the time.

85
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:50,160
Tell me. What is there to envy about the Water Monarch of the Northern Sea?

86
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,820
But I understand now.

87
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,980
If you weren't the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe,

88
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,480
I could keep you here in Green Hill.

89
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,390
We could be together forever.

90
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,010
Tell me. Isn't my status really awkward?

91
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,770
When I was a mortal,

92
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,840
I wasn't up to par with you.

93
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,490
But now I'm a monarchess,

94
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,010
yet I can't keep you.

95
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,680
Tell me. Am I really that useless?

96
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,680
But that's all right.

97
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,010
I'll always remember the days we spent together.

98
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,380
I'll keep them in my heart.

99
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,610
I won't ever forget them.

100
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,690
All right. Let's not talk about this.

101
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,460
I'll tell you a secret.

102
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,140
Do you know?

103
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:41,070
Actually, when you were outside the Fox Den and waited for me for seven days and nights,

104
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,050
I was already touched.

105
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,610
But you also know that I can't let this go.

106
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,050
Ye Hua,

107
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,210
the truth is I'd forgiven you a long time ago.

108
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,640
For these past few hundreds of years,

109
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,030
It's been hard on you.

110
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,990
Ye Hua is sleeping deeply.

111
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,720
Please be gentle when you take him away.

112
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,560
First Highness.

113
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,070
High Goddess Bai Qian, what other instructions do you have?

114
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,190
May I go with you to the Sea of Innocence?

115
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,010
I apologize, High Goddess.

116
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,100
The Sea of Innocence is the sacred place of the Heavenly Tribe.

117
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,950
Only people from the Heavenly Tribe can go there.

118
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,750
High Goddess is the monarchess of Green Hill after all.

119
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,810
Based on etiquette, it's still best that you don't go.

120
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:41,270
After all, you two were only engaged, not married.

121
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,270
Aunt might not have been married to His Highness the Crown Prince, but they were deeply in love.

122
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,490
Why can't she go?

123
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,000
Forget it, Fengjiu.

124
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,880
It's the Heavenly Tribe's rules after all.

125
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,910

126
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,490

- Aunt!
- Ye Hua!

128

- Aunt!
- Great Lady!
- Ye Hua!

129
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,120
Great Lady. Come.

130
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,090
Fourth Uncle, take good care of Aunt.

131
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,020
Sure.

132
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,320
Young Fifth, don't cry.

[South Heavenly Gate]

Welcome His Highness the Crown Prince back to the palace!

135
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:26,760
Just now, because there were elders around, I felt bad to ask.

136
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,190
Moreover, all of you were giving my aunt a hard time.

137
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,000
It's not good for me to ask.

138
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,390
What do you want to ask?

139
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,760
Are your injures...

140
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,150
They're almost completely healed.

141
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,040
That's good. That's good.

142
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,370
-Then I—
- I thought you'd be asking that question.

143
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,970
What?

144
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,130
The question you asked before the battle with Qing Cang.

145
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,430
If...

146
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:07,440
I'm saying if, you didn't wipe off your name from the Three Lives Stone back then,

147
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,540
would you like me?

148

I would.

149
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,650
What did you say, Emperor?

150
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,560
If I didn't wipe off my name from the Three Lives Stone back then,

151

I would like you.

152

I went to the Mortal Realm for a tribulation was to give you a chance.

153
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,070
And even more so, to give myself a chance.

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,840
♫ My yearnings will still coat the moonlight and merge into the warmth of my tears ♫

161
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,490
♫ Perhaps the moment I fell in love with you is destined to no result ♫

162
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,660
♫ Even if I am like a moth chasing fire ♫

163
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:43,250
♫ Even so, I will persevere in my love for you
without complaints ♫

164
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,560
You came.

165
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,030
You came!

166
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,770
I've been thinking these days

167
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:57,240
would I be able to find you if my soul also dispersed?

168
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:10,860
But I am also afraid... that I'd forget you if I'm also gone.

169
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,980
So it'd be better for me not having my soul dispersed.

170
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:34,170
This way, I can at least see you standing in front of me... and smiling at me.

171
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,860
This is really nice.

172
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,040
This is really nice.

173
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,740
Ye Hua.

174
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,900
Ye Hua!

175
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,540
Ye Hua!

176
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,900
Ye Hua!

177
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,940
Ye Hua!

178
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,300
Where are you, Ye Hua?

179
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,200
Ye Hua!

180
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,940
Ye Hua!

181
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,190
- Ye Hua!
- Get up!

182
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,070
Are you not able to live because Ye Hua is dead?

183
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,420
You've lived for so long.

184
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,740
Are you still not able to bear to be separated in life and death?

185
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,370
It's not that I can't bear it.

186
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,080
It's that I don't know how to bear it.

187
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,350
Do you know, Fourth Older Brother?

188
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:03,580
When I got drunk and broke the Soul-Gathering Lamp that day,

189
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,840
I suddenly remembered everything that happened 300 years ago.

190
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,540
At that time, I only remembered bad things about Ye Hua.

191
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,730
I completely forgot about how well he treated me.

192
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,250
Now that Ye Hua is gone,

193
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,980
all I can think of every day...

194
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,480
is everything he's done for me.

195
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,740
Then don't think.

196
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,720
Do you know, Fourth Older Brother?

197
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:02,270
When Li Jing came to find me in Green Hill that day,

198
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,780
I scolded him and argued with him with strong convictions.

199
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:16,830
I said that, "You keep pursuing something which you couldn't obtain all your life".

200
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,850
"Once you obtained it, you didn't know to treasure it."

201
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,450
I'm the same as him!

202
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,450
I only realized it now that Ye Hua is gone.

203
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,320
Without him,

204
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,330
I really can't live.

205
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,550
Forget it.

206
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,820
Go rest up first.

207
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,970
Ye Hua.

208
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,050
Ye Hua.

209
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,800
♫ My countenance when I met you ♫

210
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:48,890
♫ Was as cool breeze and bright moon in this seemingly familiar mundane world ♫

211
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,780
♫ I look around for your lingering to like the stranded time ♫

212
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,340
Come here, Qian Qian.

213
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,020
Tell me about the script you read yesterday.

214
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,750
♫ It’s a reunion but also as we first met ♫

215
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,940
Ye Hua.

216
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,830
♫ Counting years and months only to see your face when the flower blossoms ♫

217
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:14,760
♫ Even if we miss out on each other over and over again ♫

218
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,160
♫ I foresaw all of your joy and sadness ♫

219
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,340
What's wrong?

220
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,940
It's nice. It's nice.

221
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:31,430
Qian Qian, nothing happened between that puppet and me in the Mortal Realm.

222
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,600
I just let her take care of my sick mother.

223
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,570
Su Jin made the puppet.

224
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,750
I know.

225
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,640
I know.

226
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,360
Qian Qian,

227
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,980
although I grew up with Su Jin,

228
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,690
I only saw her as a drying rack for my brush on my table.

229
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,810
I've never even properly looked at her face before.

230
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,150
I don't care who she wants to marry.

231
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,010
Don't even mention that because I was romantically hurt by her, I turned to love you.

232
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,680
I know.

233
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,750
I know.

234
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,370
I believe everything that you say.

235
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,320
♫ I whirl between sleeping and waking with the image of you ♫

236
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,780
The second day of September is an auspicious day.

237
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:34,390
♫ The warmth is still spreading at the bottom of my heart ♫

238
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,020
It's a shame that we missed it.

239
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:41,330
♫ In the fleeting and chaotic time, who forgot the promise? ♫

240
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,210
It's fine.

241
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,140
It's fine.

242
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,750
♫ Half in agony, half in deep love ♫

243
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,450
I'm fine as long as you're here.

244
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,410
Any day is fine as long as I'm with you.

245
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,600
Are you locking me up in Green Hill?

246
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,650
Can I?

247
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,800
♫ I foresaw all of your joy and sadness ♫

248
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:13,130
♫ Three thousand flowers just to remember you ♫

249
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,310
Ye Hua,

250
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,740
your parents said that we were not married.

251
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,100
Hence, your corpse can't be left with me.

252
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,090
I don't know if this cenotaph will be of any use.

253
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,120
Whether it could let you hear what I say to you.

254
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,230
I dreamed of you tonight.

255
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,390
It was no different from when you were alive and with me.

256
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:05,290
You could still talk to me.

257
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,220
I feel that this is really good.

258
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:16,290
If you are free, come into my dreams often then.

259
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,780
Talk to me.

260
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,880
Play chess with me.

261
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,870
[Three Years Later]

262
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:29,520
Brat, you are the youngest monarchess in Green Hill.

263
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,220
When your aunt was the same age as you now, she was still studying skills in Kunlun Void.

264
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,390
Grandmother,

265
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,210
you said that Aunt doesn't want to marry anymore.

266
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,930
Why are you still transferring the post of the monarchess to me?

267
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:50,200
- Your aunt...
- Grandmother, no need to say anything. I understand.

268
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,710
What do you understand? You have never been married.

269
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:04,560
Grandmother, Aunt has been traveling all over the place with Fourth Uncle.

270
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,670
It's been 3 years.

271
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,270
Will they come back today?

272
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,920
I don't know.

273
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,270
I'm leading you to receive the homage from the people of Green Hill.

274
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:44,570
Dad, people might think you're taking me to get married.

275
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,610
You are going to be a monarchess soon and you are still not serious.

276
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,340
Look at you. You look as if you're our seniors.

277
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:58,290
I know you want to say Bai Yi resembles me in my youth the most.

278
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,680
Watch what you say. I gave birth to five children.

279
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,290
There is only one with such a temperament.

280
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,690
He was exactly like you when you were young.

281
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,730
What? You were that stubborn?

282
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,530
I wasn't.

283
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,580
All right. Let's get going.

284
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:38,190
Emperor, Si Ming secretly sent me a message the other day.

285
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,030
You have been representing the Heavenly Tribe in governing matters for the past three years and working very hard.

286
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,670
You have had insomnia for more than a month.

287
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,480
The Heavenly Monarch has many sons,

288
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,560
so why must he make you work so hard?

289
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,150
It's a shame.

290
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:59,060
I can only be heartbroken, but I can't help you.

291
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,260
Emperor,

292
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,650
from today on, I will be the monarchess of Green Hill.

293
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,620
Both Aunt and Dad had taught me.

294
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:50,790
As the monarchess of Green Hill, I can't do as I wish again.

295
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:55,700
I no longer can visit Early Dawn Palace without considering my social status.

296
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,900
Pour you some tea.

297
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,570
Spend the night with you.

298
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,240
Congratulations on your conferment as the monarchess of Green Hill!

299
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,430
Everyone from everywhere will serve and commit!

300
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,500
I, Star Monarch Si Ming, the subordinate of Monarch Shaoyang from Dong Hua's Purple Palace,

301
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:17,550
am instructed by Emperor to congratulate the monarchess of Green Hill for being crowned.

302
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,600
This is Emperor's congratulations gift.

303
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:34,330
It's the map used by the Emperor in the battle to unite Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

304
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,950
The Emperor personally drew this.

305
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,130
The Emperor is very generous.

306
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:53,940
The crusade map when Monarch Shaoyang from Dong Hua's Purple Palace crusaded with Father God before.

307
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,730
I have only heard of it.

308
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:00,050
Even the incumbent Heavenly Monarch has never seen it, either.

309
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,160
I thought it was just a legend.

310
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,420
Star Monarch, thank you for your trouble.

311
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:13,230
Did Emperor have you to relay any message along with the gift?

312
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:18,470
Emperor said you will understand when you open this map.

313
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,270
Tens of thousands of years ago, time brought many changes.

314
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:24,720
Everything on this map doesn't exist anymore.

315
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,080
Even Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses have been transformed.

316
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,120
Everything in the world has become insignificant.

317
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,990
There's nothing worth to be thought of.

318
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,020
These are my words for the emperor.

319
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,630
Bai Fengjiu of Green Hill thanks Emperor Dong Hua's gifts.

320
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:59,460
I hope Green Hill can continue to be friends with the Heavenly Tribe for many generations and be a blessing to the people.

321
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:32,770
Nice! Nice! Nice.

322
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,630
Let's go out for a walk.

323
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,260
Immortals, are you two here to have a good time in the Mortal Realm as well?

324
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,400
How do you know who we are?

325
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,270
Immortals have an aura.

326
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,800
It's normal that mortals can't see it,

327
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,200
but if I can't, it'd be a big mistake.

328
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,570
Let's go.

329
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,540
Immortals, could I borrow some money?

330
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,490
I saw that musical performance was great.

331
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:19,140
If I don't give them some money, I would feel bad.

332
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,750
It's not hard to lend you some money. You are a small immortal.

333
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,990
You should learn how to create things.

334
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,500
It's not that difficult to create some money.

335
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,690
Why do you want to borrow from me?

336
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:33,140
My parents were afraid I'd cause trouble so they sealed my powers.

337
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,220
Could I ask who you are?

338
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,140
This is the son of the Fox Emperor and the best looker in Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

339
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,980
How do I return this pearl to you?

340
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,250
No need to return it.

341
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,550
Look at this flying current underneath the river.

342
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:06,700
It flows day and night and never flows backward.

343
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,710
I think life is also like that.

344
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:12,570
We can't turn back. We can only go forward.

345
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,780
You're right, Fourth Older Brother.

346
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,200
Look at these mortals.

347
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,310
Being able to walk in the world only for a few decades.

348
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:25,930
They are trapped by the fate that Si Ming has arranged for them.

349
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,760
Some of them may be impoverished for life.

350
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,760
Some of them may aspire but can't spread out.

351
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,090
A good daughter that was raised at home may not marry someone with the same values.

352
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,250
But they're all living happily.

353
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:46,350
Don't you think you have it much better after seeing them?

354
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:50,510
You've gotten chatty these past 3 years.

355
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:00,110
It's to cheer you up.

356
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:04,390
But speaking of which, your complexion has gotten better.

357
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,820
I've been able to dream about him for the past few months.

358
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,120
So, of course, I'd look better.

359
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:15,850
Young Fifth, can you still distinguish reality from your dreams?

360
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:22,180
Fourth Older Brother, have you heard the story about Zhuang Zhou dreaming of becoming a butterfly?

361
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:26,450
A person named Zhuang Zhou dreamed about becoming a butterfly.

362
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,910
He happily flew and danced throughout the skies.

363
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:33,570
But he realized he was still a mortal when he woke up.

364
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:37,110
In the end, we don't know if he became a butterfly in his dreams

365
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:40,460
or if a butterfly dreamed about being Zhuang Zhou.

366
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,620
Ever since I dreamed about him for the first time three years ago,

367
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,200
I've thought it through.

368
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,320
Pretending reality as a dream

369
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,070
and pretending my dreams as reality

370
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:57,340
is the same either way, just a different method of living.

371
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:01,050
Husband! Husband! Don't leave me!

372
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,740
Husband! Husband!

373
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:09,150
I've been dedicated to you and treated your two sons like my own sons.

374
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,150
You can't toss me away, husband.

375
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm begging you. You can't

376
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,360
- Husband.
- You are a widow. When you first started pestering me,

377
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,970
you caused me to fall out with my wife.

378
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,400
I thought if I married you, I'd live a happy life!

379
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,090
But who knew you went back on your words and seduced scum on the streets!

380
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,790
I've given you the letter of divorce. Stop pestering me!

381
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,430
Husband, don't do this! Husband!

382
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,630
Husband!

383
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,990
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

384
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:07,160
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

385
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,670
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

386
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:15,050
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

387
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:24,560
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

388
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,360
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

389
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:33,610
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

390
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:39,570
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

391
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:45,800
♫ All are just illusions ♫

392
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:52,670
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

393
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:57,850
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

394
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:02,360
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

395
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:08,580
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

396
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:13,910
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

397
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:19,150
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

398
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,990
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

399
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:31,660
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

400
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:43,070
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

401
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:48,560
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

402
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,000
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

403
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,190
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

404
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:04,540
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

405
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:09,810
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

406
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,620
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

407
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:22,150
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

408
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:34,060
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
