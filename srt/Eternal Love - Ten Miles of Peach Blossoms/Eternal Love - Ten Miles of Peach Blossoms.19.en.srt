”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,470
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,050
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,540
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,050
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,390
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,170
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,670
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,240
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,830
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,310
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,950
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,360
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,000
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,480
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,000
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,590
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,990
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,970
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,730
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,130
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,720
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,020
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,770
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,430
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,830
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,040
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,600
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Episode 19]

31
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,930
Ye Hua, you plotted to kill my youngest son.

32
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,970
Today, I'm going to kill you with my Soul Severing Blade!

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,990
Attack!

34
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,630
- Attack!
- Attack! Attack!

35
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,870
Why do I feel so nervous tonight?

36
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,210
Ye Hua.

37
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,720
Ye Hua.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,300
Is he asleep?

39
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,170
Ye Hua!

40
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,630
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

41
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,730
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

42
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,630
Ye Hua. Ye Hua, wake up! Ye Hua.

43
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,700
- Ye Hua, hang on. Hang on! 
- Ye Hua.

44
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,370
- Ye Hua, wake up. Wake up! 
- Ye Hua!

45
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,630
What's wrong, Ye Hua?

46
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,000
Ye Hua!

47
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,390
Ye Hua, wait for me!

48
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,680
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

49
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,700
Ye Hua!

50
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,760
Ye Hua! Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

51
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,440
Ye Hua!

52
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,070
Ye Hua!

53
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,740
Ye Hua!

54
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,920
Ye Hua!

55
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,470
Ye Hua!

56
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,270
Ye Hua!

57
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,100
Ye Hua!

58
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,510
Ye Hua!

59
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,310
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

60
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,100
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

61
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,930
Ye Hua.

62
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,960
Who are you?

63
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,430
Where is Ye Hua? Where is Ye Hua?

64
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,970
How do you know the Crown Prince?

65
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,630
Speak!

66
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,960
I don't know the Crown Prince.

67
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,290
I just want to find Ye Hua.

68
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,510
Where is Ye Hua?

69
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,640
Impertinent!

70
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,490
The Crown Prince's name is not for you to call upon.

71
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,090
Father Monarch, please don't be angry.

72
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,860
Heavenly Monarch, please don't be angry.

73
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,510
Stop!

74
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,410
I didn't ask you to rise and you dare to rise?!

75
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,500
Do you know what place this is?

76
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,660
This is the Heavenly Palace.

77
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,160
Heavenly Palace?

78
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,200
Who are you?

79
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,170
How dare you behave so rudely in the Heavenly Palace?

80
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,780
No one can save you.

81
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:43,330
Even Ye Hua would not dare to save you.

82
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,000
- Guards.
-  Present. 
-  Present.

83
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,570
- Throw this mortal into the Demon Tower.
- Yes.
- Yes!

84
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,350
- Don't! Don't!
- Go!
- Go!

85
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,500
Please save me! Please save me!

86
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,180
You? You are Ye Hua's woman?

87
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,500
Ye Hua and I have bowed to Heaven and Earth as husband and wife.

88
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,750
And I'm pregnant with his child.

89
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,480
Can you take me to look for him?

90
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,600
Take me to find him, okay?

91
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,670
What did you say?

92
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,500
Get up.

93
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,470
Come with me.

94
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,650
Kneel.

95
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,400
Your Highness, she's really bearing the child of Ye Hua.

96
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,130
You're sure? Can you be wrong?

97
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:53,450
Your Highness, you know very well that in this Heavenly Palace, other than P,

98
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,390
I'm the second best when it comes to checking pulses.

99
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:06,080
Father Monarch, she's really pregnant with Ye Hua's child.

100
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,380
We don't know if Ye Hua is alive or dead right now.

101
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,110
I beg you to preserve his only descendant in her womb.

102
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:23,190
Le Xu, Ye Hua and she have broken the rules of Heaven.

103
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,410
If you ask me to forgive her, isn't that asking me to break the law for selfish reasons?

104
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,070
She really has Ye Hua's child in her womb.

105
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,590
Why not just punish her after she has given birth?

106
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,550
Or I'm willing to be punished in her place.

107
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,010
Father Monarch, I didn't discipline my son well enough.

108
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,350
I'm willing to suffer punishment on behalf of this mortal.

109
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,000
I ask you, Father Monarch, to preserve the child of Ye Hua.

110
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:12,690
Lock this mortal in the deserted Zhaohua Palace. Guard her tightly.

111
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,550
Thank you, Father Monarch.

112
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,290
Thank you, Father Monarch.

113
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,310
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

114
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,770
Ye Hua!

115
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,650
Let me out! Let me out!

116
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,270
I want to be with Ye Hua!

117
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,070
I want to be with him!

118
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,340
Let me out.

119
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,390
Ye Hua, don't die.

120
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,910
Ye Hua.

121
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,230
Ye Hua.

122
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,050
Ye Hua!

123
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,290
Ye Hua!

124
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Medicine King, hurry. The crown prince is awake.

125
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,850
Your Highness, you've survived this disaster.

126
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,870
Medicine King, you go out first. I have something to say to him.

127
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,940
- This...
- Quickly go out.

128
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,210
Yes.

129
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,010
Third Uncle...

130
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,300
What went wrong? Where's Su Su?

131
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,440
Ye Hua, listen to me.

132
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,050
After you got hacked by the Merpeople Chieftain three days ago,

133
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,400
that mortal wife of yours went beyond the barrier you set up.

134
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,450
What did you say? Why?

135
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,540
She stepped out of your barrier and was discovered by Father Monarch.

136
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,050
Heavenly Monarch...

137
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,830
Ye Hua!

138
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:44,500
- Let go of me! Let go...
- Ye Hua, listen to me!

139
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,380
If you want to save her, then continue living.

140
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,070
If you die, she can only die, too!

141
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,650
Is she still alive?

142
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,390
She is. She is. She is alive.

143
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,590
She's pregnant with your child.

144
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,080
You don't need to worry about her safety.

145
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,550
The Merpeople Tribe have been exterminated.

146
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:34,150
After you recuperate for a few days, we'll return to the Heavenly Palace.

147
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,530
No.

148
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,800
We mustn't rush to return.

149
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,230
Don't you want to see her immediately?

150
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,120
From the moment Heavenly Monarch found out about her,

151
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,010
she and I can never be together anymore.

152
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:04,430
The only way to preserve her life now is to let Heavenly Monarch think that she's not worth anything to me.

153
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,120
What did you say?!

154
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,790
On the first day of the battle, His Highness the Crown Prince was injured by the Soul Severing Blade of the Merpeople Chieftain.

155
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,600
He almost died.

156
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,950
His Third Highness was afraid that this matter might affect the battle, so he suppressed it first.

157
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,970
How is the Crown Prince now?

158
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:40,800
Based on the assessment of Medicine King, His Highness the Crown Prince was able to preserve his spirit.

159
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,350
That's good.

160
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,240
You've always followed the Crown Prince,

161
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,330
yet you let him be in such danger and he almost died because of it.

162
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,610
Once the main army returns, go to Lord of Puhua to seek punishment.

163
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,990
Yes.

164
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,470
Wait!

165
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,940
Heavenly Monarch.

166
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,600
The invitation for the religious assembly of Lord of Lingbao has been distributed.

167
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,890
Immortals from all over the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses will be coming here.

168
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,070
I can only go to Long Sea after that.

169
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,700
Tell His Highness the Third Prince to take good care of him.

170
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,970
Yes.

171
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,670
Your Highness, we really have to see His Mighty Monarch.

172
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,600
Even if the sky falls down now, His Mighty Monarch won't be coming here.

173
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,080
Your Highness, the Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe almost died in the hands of the Merpeople Tribe.

174
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,550
The Merpeople Tribe are, after all, a sub-branch of ours.

175
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,700
If the Heavenly Tribe blames us, our Winged Tribe will be in trouble again.

176
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:04,120
Even when Qing Cang was sealed, our Winged Tribe didn't get in trouble. It will also be the same now.

177
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,060
Unruly! How dare you directly mention the name of the Winged Monarch?!

178
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,910
You're the bold one.

179
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:16,870
Could it be that after 70,000 years, you only obey Qing Cang, and not His Mighty Monarch?

180
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,560
Winged Monarch? Who's the real ruler of this Grand Purple Palace?!

181
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,510
Your Highness, please forgive us.

182
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,440
I can't be bothered to lower myself to your level.

183
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,800
Your Highness, this is an invitation from the Heavenly Palace.

184
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,150
Invitation?

185
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,240
They said that Lord of Lingbao from the High Clear Plane wants to hold a religious assembly.

186
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,210
This is the invitation for His Mighty Monarch.

187
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,480
You could have just sent someone to deliver it.

188
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,000
You don't need to personally come here to the mortal world.

189
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,650
Since the Merpeople Tribe was annihilated, there is disorder in the palace.

190
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:23,250
Those old subjects are afraid that the Heavenly Tribe will vent their anger on us since the Merpeople Tribe were our sub-tribe.

191
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,190
Since they can't find you, they will pester me all day.

192
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,180
I had no choice, either.

193
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:34,690
So I use delivering the invitation as a pretext to ask you when you plan to return to the Winged Realm.

194
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,810
I will go directly to the Heavenly Palace.

195
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:49,000
Your Mighty Monarch, are you going to the religious assembly to lecture and discuss religious laws?

196
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,150
Since when have I known how to lecture?

197
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,450
What will I know how to discuss?

198
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,260
I'm merely admitting my mistake and offering a humble apology to the Heavenly Tribe.

199
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:13,100
Regardless of whatever reasons you give, privately taking my commander's seal is a major sin.

200
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,500
Since we are a married couple, I won't punish you for your sin.

201
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,090
Return to the palace and reflect upon yourself.

202
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:32,090
Your Mighty Monarch, you can't do this to me.

203
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,030
My womb is pregnant with your child.

204
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,770
What did you say?

205
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:48,610
After that night, I became pregnant with your child.

206
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,760
It can't be.

207
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,830
How could it not be?

208
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,440
Do you not want a child?

209
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,340
You are going to be a father.

210
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,720
Aren't you happy?

211
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,850
I have been anticipating this day for 70,000 years.

212
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,720
Forget it.

213
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,240
I will go back to the palace with you.

214
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,210
Medicine King, quick!

215
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,480
- This... What's going on?
- Save him now.

216
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,790
Your Highness, Your Highness.

217
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,150
Get out!

218
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,760
You are just a mere consort of my father,

219
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,560
and you dare to trespass into the bedchamber of the Crown Prince!

220
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,840
Get out now!

221
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,770
Please release me. I must see Ye Hua.

222
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,870
Tell me, is Ye Hua is still alive?

223
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,070
Is he still al—

224
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,480
Ye Hua.

225
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,200
Don't die.

226
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,860
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

227
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,610
I'm begging you, Ye Hua. Say something, okay?

228
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,680
Ye Hua, say something.

229
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,990
Ye Hua, say something.

230
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,600
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

231
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,550
Ye Hua!

232
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,320
What? The Crown Prince has a woman in the mortal realm?

233
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,400
This shouldn't be made widely known.

234
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,400
But he's already engaged to marry my aunt, why is he courting another woman?

235
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,600
Young Highness, even the mortal Emperor has three thousand women in the harem.

236
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,110
Even more so, for the future Heavenly Monarch.

237
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,970
Even if Crown Prince doesn't want to look for one,

238
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,950
he needs many heavenly consorts to provide male offspring for the succession of the Heavenly Monarch.

239
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,940
Nonsense. What providing male offspring for the succession?

240
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,860
In Green Hill, husbands have always had one wife.

241
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,140
We've never had any problems with having descendants.

242
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,480
No. I must find him and clarify this with him.

243
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,020
It's locked?

244
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,590
Are you still alive?

245
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,730
I'm Bai Fengjiu from Green Hill.

246
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,280
Are you the woman whom Ye Hua is courting in the mortal realm?

247
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,800
Did you just mention Ye Hua?

248
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,910
Of course, he's His Highness the Crown Prince.

249
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:36,080
Who doesn't know him in Nine Heavens?

250
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,480
Is he still alive?

251
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,880
I don't know.

252
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,200
What happened to him?

253
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,250
You don't know, either.

254
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,850
Ye Hua.

255
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,260
Hey, wait. I still have something to ask you.

256
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,410
Don't cry yet.

257
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,360
Wait! Wait!

258
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,510
Heavenly Monarch doesn't want us to talk to the mortal, nor let anyone know about this.

259
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,820
Could it be that while His Highness the Crown Prince, isn't around, this mortal will be—

260
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,960
It's unspeakable. It's unspeakable.

261
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,790
Did you forget about the incident regarding the Water Monarch of Northern Sea?

262
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:45,800
I should feel angry on behalf of my aunt, but why do I feel a bit sad?

263
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,070
Frankly, this mortal is rather pitiful.

264
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,300
I'm not eating. I'm not eating.

265
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,610
I want to look for Ye Hua.

266
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,660
Your Mighty Monarch, do you really want to go to Heavenly Palace?

267
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,670
The Merpeople Tribe is a sub-tribe of the Winged Tribe.

268
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,240
Although they broke away from us for 70,000 years,

269
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,190
they injured the Crown Prince of the Heavenly Tribe this time.

270
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,210
I can't be absolved from the blame.

271
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:33,580
I'm taking advantage of the religious ceremony of Lord of Lingbao to go to Heavenly Palace and apologize.

272
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,030
Lest the Winged Tribe is implicated.

273
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,590
I understand.

274
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,060
You are doing this for the Winged Tribe,

275
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:46,560
but for this 70,000 years, these three days are the happiest I've been.

276
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,040
I can't bear to see you leave.

277
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,950
Take care of your health.

278
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:59,220
Shaman, why is the Monarchess feeling uncomfortable right after becoming pregnant?

279
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,990
The Winged Monarchess is an immortal carrying a child from the Winged Tribe,

280
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,430
so it's unavoidable their qi would contradict each other.

281
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:17,200
I think she should lie in bed more often.

282
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,960
When it's a few months older, she will naturally feel better.

283
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,120
That's good then.

284
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,040
Let the shaman stay here and keep you company then.

285
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,670
No. Ever since you took over the throne, you have never gone to Heavenly Palace.

286
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:39,300
Since you are going to the religious ceremony, as the monarchess of the Winged Tribe, I should be with you.

287
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,270
You are pregnant with a Winged Tribe child.

288
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,460
That's contradictory to your immortal qi to begin with.

289
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,560
If you go to Heavenly Palace, your health won't be able to take it.

290
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,630
It's not a problem for me.

291
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:53,770
When mortal women are pregnant, they sometimes will feel uncomfortable, too.

292
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:57,620
I'm the monarchess of the Winged Tribe. How could I be so delicate?

293
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,000
Okay.

294
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,200
During the 49 days of the ceremony, Winged Monarch, you will be staying here.

295
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,000
If you need anything, please tell me.

296
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,700
Thank you, Immortal.

297
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,300
Then, I'll take my leave.

298
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,400
May I ask?

299
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,800
Do you know where the Cold Moon Lotus gifted from the Winged Realm 70,000 years ago is kept?

300
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,000
Cold Moon Lotus? It's in the lotus pond next to Zhaohua Palace.

301
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,200
Can you take me there and see?

302
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,800
Yes.

303
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,280
I'll be back soon.

304
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,400
I'm feeling a bit...

305
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,400
I don't feel too well, so I won't accompany you there.

306
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,550
- Stay here and keep her company.
- Yes.

307
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Didn't you say you would surely help me to keep this child?

308
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
Why am I always in pain?

309
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,000
It could be that for the past few years, since you are an immortal,

310
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,500
living in the Winged Realm for too long has ruined your health.

311
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,000
You're not quite suitable for having a child anymore.

312
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,800
Not suitable?

313
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,400
Then, what am I carrying right now?

314
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,300
Your Highness, I...

315
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,800
I already cannot feel the little prince's pulse.

316
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
What did you say?!

317
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,650
Your Highness, calm down.

318
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,800
Everything I've said is true.

319
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,200
The little prince does not have any signs of life.

320
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,600
In my opinion, you should go back to the Winged Realm.

321
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,800
I will prescribe some medicine to make the little prince...

322
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,400
Your Highness, it's already at this stage.

323
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,000
Your body is more important.

324
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,400
No, I need to keep this child.

325
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,600
Don't you see?

326
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,600
For 70,000 years, His Mighty Monarch has never been this patient with me.

327
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,780
I need to keep this child.

328
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,600
I need to!

329
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,100
Don't tell anyone. Do you hear me?

330
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,400
Or else I will kill you!

331
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,800
I will take the lives of your entire clan!

332
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,200
I will keep my mouth shut.

333
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,210
Where's the peach blossom scent coming from?

334
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,000
It's so familiar.

335
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
[Zhaohua Palace]

336
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,500
Winged Monarch.

337
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,900
Lord of Lingbao.

338
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,800
We haven't seen each other for many thousand years.

339
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,300
I almost couldn't recognize you from the back.

340
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,200
Yes, it's been 70,000 years.

341
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,900
I remember that the first time we met was at Kunlun Void.

342
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,400
I heard from the divine maids that you just arrived here.

343
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,100
How did you find the mood and leisure to enjoy the lotuses here?

344
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,700
I came to see the Cold Moon Lotus.

345
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,600
I fear that since they lived in the Winged Realm for too long, they'd not be used to the lotus pond in the Heavenly Palace.

346
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,800
I didn't know you were so sensitive and caring.

347
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,400
You care a lot about these lotus flowers.

348
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,800
- There's a fire! Extinguish the fire!
- Extinguish the fire!

349
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,600
- Someone help! 
- Zhaohua Palace?

350
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,400
Get them to put out the fire! There's someone locked up in there!

351
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,500
How come there's a fire?

352
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:29,660
It was my mount who set the fire.

353
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,170
Please forgive me.

354
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,910
Winged Monarch, don't blame yourself.

355
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,600
- Does she have any serious injuries?
- I'm not too sure.

356
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,400
I'll take her back to High Clear Plane for my shaman to take a look at her.

357
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,400
Ah Yin.

358
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,500
Ah Yin.

359
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,600
How come she's here?

360
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,600
No, it can't be.

361
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,400
Your Mighty Monarch, she must be an illusion from the Heavenly Tribe. This must be it.

362
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,000
They knew you have a personal friendship with High Immortal Si Yin,

363
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,600
and they created an illusion of Si Yin to trick you.

364
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,400
Shaman!

365
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,800
- Your Mighty Monarch.
- Quick.

366
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Treat her injury now. She was hurt by the Red Lotus Fire. Hurry up.

367
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,500
Yes.

368
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,700
How is she?

369
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,600
Although she's an immortal, it's still problematic to be hit by the Red Lotus Fire.

370
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,600
Check if...

371
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,380
Your Mighty Monarch, she's just a mortal.

372
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,800
What? Mortal?

373
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,400
Mortal?

374
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,210
Yes, Your Mighty Monarch. She's not a high immortal.

375
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,800
She's just a mortal woman.

376
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,000
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

377
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,210
She doesn't have a divine aura.

378
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,500
She's definitely a mortal.

379
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,600
I was confused.

380
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,900
I couldn't even differentiate between an immortal and mortal.

381
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,680
- Treat her injury.
- Yes.

382
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:27,250
If we were to say that this face resembles Si Yin, why not say that she looks more like Bai Qian?

383
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,800
Fortunately, she's neither.

384
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,630
Come in.

385
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,740
Your Mighty Monarch, I was wrong.

386
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,410
You should know that this is not Grand Purple Palace in Winged Realm.

387
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,510
This is Nine Heavens.

388
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,250
Why did you use the Red Lotus Fire here?

389
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:04,880
When I passed by the door of the deserted palace, I detected a familiar scent and went to find it.

390
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,020
Then, I saw this woman locked up in there and she was crying.

391
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,470
Hence... I wanted to rescue her,

392
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,370
but the lock on the door was made of millennium iron.

393
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,770
I couldn't use magic to break it.

394
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,400
Hence, you used fire to burn it?

395
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,490
Your Mighty Monarch, didn't you say that my Red Lotus Fire can burn anything?

396
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:32,660
That's right. It can burn anything.

397
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,850
That's why you can't control the power of the fire.

398
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,700
You wanted to use fire to burn the lock.

399
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,700
Naturally, you would burn the bedroom.

400
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,180
Forget it.

401
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,050
I just hope Heavenly Monarch will not pursue this.

402
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,200
Where's Ye Hua?

403
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,460
- Where am I?
- Miss, do you feel better?

404
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,360
Who are you?

405
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,050
I'm the Winged Monarch, Li Jing.

406
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:09,390
My mount made a mistake to set a fire just now.

407
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,960
I'm very sorry.

408
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,490
So, the fire was from you.

409
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:16,980
I thought they wanted to kill me.

410
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,850
They?

411
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,120
How old are you?

412
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,640
70,300 years old.

413
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,800
70,300 years?

414
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:43,250
Older Sister, the scent of peach blossom on your body smells very nice.

415
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:52,340
You are a mortal. Why are you living in Heavenly Palace?

416
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,450
I was captured by them.

417
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,280
Have you seen Ye Hua?

418
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,090
Where is he now? How is he now?

419
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,730
Ye Hua?

420
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,950
Who are you to the Crown Prince?

421
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:22,980
I'm the Crown Prince's, Ye Hua's, mother, Princess Consort Le Xu.

422
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,960
Greetings, Your Highness Le Xu.

423
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,830
Winged Monarch, no need to stand on ceremony.

424
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:32,240
I heard you saved someone who belongs to me.

425
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,090
I specially came here to thank you and also, to take her back from you.

426
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,680
She's from your palace?

427
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,290
That's right.

428
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,580
This woman broke the rules of Heaven.

429
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,930
I originally locked her up in Zhaohua Palace to reflect.

430
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:54,060
I didn't expect her to encounter a fire and was rescued by you.

431
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,680
Go now and take her away.

432
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,330
Yes.

433
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,830
I will take my leave.

434
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,580
Your Highness, take care.

435
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,750
Your Majesty, that woman is pregnant. I fear...

436
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,340
Pregnant?

437
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,560
Your Mighty Monarch, the Heavenly Tribe has always placed great importance in law.

438
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,030
For them to lock up a pregnant mortal in the Heavenly Palace,

439
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:55,420
this situation is definitely not that simple.

440
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:01,600
I'm here in the Heavenly Palace this time to plead for my sin.

441
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:07,270
I cannot help anybody else.

442
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:46,390
