”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,490
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,060
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,670
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,000
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,300
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,230
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,860
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,240
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,830
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,430
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,940
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,450
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,940
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,600
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,070
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,440
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,040
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,000
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,590
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,940
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,840
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,910
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,870
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,260
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,860
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,060
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,780
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,890
[Episode 38]

31
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,090
I'm guessing you have a question to ask me,

32
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,270
so I didn't dare to sleep.

33
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,770
High God, you have incredible foresight.

34
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,340
Go ahead.

35
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,890
Since you know about Mo Yuan, I don't want to hide anything else from you.

36
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,270
It's the same two questions.

37
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,060
Really?

38
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,060
Two questions?

39
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,560
My memory has gotten worse with age.

40
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,090
Ask me again.

41
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:26,300
Is it true that Qian Qian fell asleep for many years after her battle with Qing Cang 300 years?

42
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,400
Of course, it's false.

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,760
After her fight with Qing Cang, she disappeared for many years.

44
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,240
What?

45
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,850
I did lie to you back then.

46
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,810
Do you have more questions?

47
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,490
What about the second question?

48
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,290
Has she ever forgotten anything?

49
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,340
She has.

50
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,720
But I don't know what she's forgotten.

51
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,700
I only remember that after she disappeared for some years,

52
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,390
she suddenly showed up in the Peach Blossoms Forest with injuries

53
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,220
and was very emotionally hurt.

54
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,840
It was the same day you jumped off the Immortal Execution Platform and I saved you.

55
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,510
Hence, you fed her the Love-Forgetting Medicine.

56
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,360
No. I didn't feed it to her.

57
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,960
She asked me for the Love-Forgetting Medicine.

58
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,470
From seeing her state, I thought it'd be best if she forgot what she wanted to,

59
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,360
so I gave it to her.

60
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:42,250
She didn't tell you what she forgot?

61
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,530
She never told me about this.

62
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:58,190
But I guessed the Su Su I met at the Heavenly Palace was her, right?

63
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,280
That's right.

64
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,970
She's Su Su.

65
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,170
How did you recognize her?

66
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,330
When we reunited at the Eastern Sea,

67
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,240
many of her actions felt very familiar to me.

68
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:26,230
Later when I saw the scars on her wrist, I was absolutely certain it was her.

69
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,930
The marks left behind from the Red Lotus Fire can't be removed.

70
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,330
So, this was how the truth was revealed.

71
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,170
High God,

72
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:48,150
do you really not know or are you hiding from me

73
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,430
the fact that she wanted to forget me

74
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,150
because of Mo Yuan?

75
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,000
Mo Yuan?

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,490
Compared to High God Mo Yuan,

77
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,180
the love that I have with her for the few number of years might just be her tribulation to become a High Goddess,

78
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,960
and it's not worth remembering.

79
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,500
It was a hindrance instead.

80
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,660
Winged Monarch has issued the order that you will be executed tomorrow.

81
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,790
Monarchess, you have always treated us well.

82
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,640
There's nothing I can do for you,

83
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,160
so I prepared some food for you.

84
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,750
Thank you.

85
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,560
Can you bring me my son?

86
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,160
I want to see him.

87
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,380
Are you talking about that sick child?

88
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,000
No! He's not sick.

89
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,920
He'll get better!

90
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,770
He will!

91
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,770
That child has been thrown into the cell next door.

92
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,580
No one is taking care of him.

93
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,080
He will be burned together with your corpse tomorrow.

94
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,140
If you really want to see him, I will carry him here.

95
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,690
Thank... Thank you! Thank you!

96
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Ying'er. Ying'er!

97
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,450
Ying'er!

98
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,530
Ying'er, why are you so cold?

99
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,540
They didn't treat you well?

100
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,790
No matter what, you are still the prince of the monarch.

101
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,280
You are his only child.

102
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,620
Looks like only I love you.

103
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,500
Eat now.

104
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,920
I'm over here.

105
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,200
I'm here.

106
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,030
What should I do now?

107
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,940
I want you to kill me.

108
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,610
Kill you?

109
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,190
That's right.

110
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,930
Yes, kill me.

111
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,060
My father once put a curse on us three siblings.

112
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,210
Every time one of us dies,

113
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,960
his power multiplies three times.

114
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,740
That's why you must kill me.

115
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,610
That way, my father can break out of the bell to reclaim the world!

116
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,440
Qing Cang breaking out of the bell?

117
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,040
Don't you want to kill Bai Qian of Green Hill?

118
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,050
She's become a High Goddess already.

119
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:41,150
Even if you have a chance to get out of here and cultivate for 10,000 years,

120
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,660
you still won't be able to kill her.

121
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,230
The only one who can kill her now is my father.

122
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,150
Li Jing imprisoned me here for 300 years.

123
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,630
He didn't even allow me to die.

124
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,210
Thank heavens that today has come.

125
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,320
Follow the route I told you about yesterday.

126
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,390
Once you're out of here, you can find the forest that connects the Winged Realm and Green Hill.

127
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:21,430
Once you pass that forest, Green Hill is towards the west,

128
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,920
but the Mortal Realm is towards the east.

129
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,250
Don't get lost.

130
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:33,410
Go to the east and find Yan Zhi.

131
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:39,300
Just like how you were able to get the battle formation map from Kunlun Void,

132
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,350
use your trickery to make Yan Zhi pity you.

133
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,550
She's naive and kindhearted so she'll help you.

134
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,460
What you need to do is what you'll do to me today.

135
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,190
Kill her!

136
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,850
There's a piece of jade on me.

137
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,790
It'll guide you to Yan Zhi.

138
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,760
You need to hold onto it.

139
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,960
This jade will start to burn when you get near Yan Zhi.

140
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,650
Even though you're blind,

141
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,950
you'll still be able to recognize her.

142
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,250
You Winged Tribe people are cold-blooded!

143
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,830
It's not that I'm cold-blooded.

144
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:44,390
For what Li Jing has done to me, even if I die, I'll bring him along!

145
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,100
As long as my father comes back

146
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,530
and learns that Li Jing has allied with the Heavenly Tribe,

147
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,990
he'll get revenge for me!

148
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:03,970
Right now, do you have another choice besides killing me?

149
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,490
Come.

150
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,120
Do it.

151
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,820
Kill me. Kill me!

152
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,240
Li Yuan.

153
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,270
So it's you.

154
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,390
I raised a good son indeed.

155
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:35,840
Only you are willing to sacrifice yourself to help me increase my powers.

156
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,120
Once I break out of this bell,

157
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:48,250
I'll take over this world and make this world be buried alive with you!

158
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,760
Didn't the emperor say the Donghuang Bell's seal lasts 70,000 years?

159
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,860
What's going on tonight?

160
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,600
Oh no.

161
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,000
Mother, I don't want to go to the Mortal Realm.

162
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,910
My eyes hurt.

163
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,030
I miss you very much.

164
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,550
I'm coming to find you.

165
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:13,030
Mother, look! I've brought your grandchild, too.

166
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,930
Mother, do you remember me?

167
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,830
It's been 70,000 years.

168
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,090
Every time I sent people to pick you up,

169
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,350
you were never willing to come to the Winged Realm.

170
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,140
Mother.

171
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,170
Xuan Nü's mother, it's so late.

172
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,590
Why are you still walking around?

173
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,030
No. I can't meet my mother like this.

174
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,680
Mother is old.

175
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,690
I'll frighten her if she sees me like this.

176
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,830
I'll get cleaned up and meet her tomorrow.

177
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,620
Aren't you afraid of falling in the middle of the night like what happened last time?

178
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,450
No one found you all night.

179
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,720
Don't call me Xuan Nü's mother! Don't call me that.

180
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,840
I don't have a daughter like her.

181
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,410
But no matter what you say and what she did,

182
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,160
she's still your daughter.

183
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,850
Don't defend her.

184
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,170
She's a traitor.

185
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,490
High God Mo Yuan was a great person.

186
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,980
High Immortal Die Feng and High Immortal Si Yin as well!

187
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,110
They were all willing to take her in.

188
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,450
But her?

189
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,810
She betrayed us.

190
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,590
I regret ever giving birth to her.

191
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,500
I don't have that daughter.

192
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,600
She's not my daughter.

193
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,050
I understand. Let's not talk about it.

194
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,800
Let's not talk about it.

195
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,260
Mother,

196
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,160
I'm still your daughter after all.

197
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,780
Bai Qian, it's all your fault.

198
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,490
You've destroyed me to the point I have no home.

199
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,290
Even my mother doesn't want me.

200
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,330
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

201
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,880
Winged Monarch.

202
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,320
Great Lady doesn't want to see you. Please go back.

203
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,060
I need to see her.

204
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,370
I suffered so many punishments for you,

205
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,820
and tomorrow, you are letting them behead me.

206
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:27,420
While you? You're here waiting for Bai Qian to pity you, to see you just once.

207
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,830
The Mortal Realm is towards the east.

208
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,630
Don't get lost.

209
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,710
Go to the east and find Yan Zhi in the Mortal Realm.

210
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,420
Just like how you were able to get the battle formation map from Kunlun Void,

211
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,340
use your trickery to make Yan Zhi pity you.

212
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,880
She's naive and kindhearted so she'll help you.

213
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,110
What you need to do is what you'll do to me today.

214
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,470
Kill her!

215
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,990
As long as my father comes back and learns that Li Jing has allied with the Heavenly Tribe,

216
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,630
he'll get revenge for me!

217
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,030
[Early Dawn Palace]

218
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,670
The emperor went to the Mortal Realm.

219
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,930
The emperor went... to the Mortal Realm?!

220
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,960
To experience the pain of mortals,

221
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,790
Emperor especially freed up 2 months of his busy time to go through tribulations in the Mortal World.

222
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,690
Forty-plus days have gone by.

223
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,410
Come back next month.

224
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,330
Thank you.

225
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,400
You're welcome.

226
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,910
Weren't you going to the Mortal Realm?

227
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,440
Yeah.

228
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,410
I need to check on Emperor.

229
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,030
Don't tell me I've gotten old and was overthinking?

230
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,140
At most, it's just twenty more days.

231
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,820
Let's wait until the emperor gets back.

232
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,900
- You may leave.
- Your Majesty,

233
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,940
- but...
- Leave your umbrella and leave us.

234
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,790
Yes.

235
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:54,660
You told them to go just like that?

236
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,050
Look at how big the rain has gotten.

237
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:01,400
Even if we have umbrellas, we'll get soaked to our socks and shoes.

238
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,380
Do you blame me?

239
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,750
I don't dare.

240
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,840
I'll carry you back.

241
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,670
What?!

242
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,800
I'll carry you back.

243
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,520
That...

244
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,920
You can't do that. The Empress will scold me.

245
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,040
Didn't you tell me about your parents' story?

246
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,650
You said your father is strict and stoic,

247
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,630
but he treasures your mother so much so

248
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,940
that he doesn't even let your mother's socks and shoes get wet when it rains.

249
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,090
My father does treasure my mother a lot.

250
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,420
Come, I'll carry you back.

251
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,860
Your Majesty, we should just wait here until the rain stops.

252
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,650
Do you really need me to make a royal decree?

253
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,200
I wouldn't dare.

254
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,590
Get on.

255
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,120
♫ And I cannot express my true feelings ♫

256
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:16,390
♫ My yearnings will still coat the moonlight and merge into the warmth of my tears ♫

257
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:34,230
♫ The moment I fell for you, even if I am like a moth
chasing fire ♫

258
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:41,490
♫ I will still courageously endure the pain and deeply love you ♫

259
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:48,790
♫ Even if we do not end up together, and I cannot express my true feelings ♫

260
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:56,110
♫ My yearnings will still coat the moonlight and merge into the warmth of my tears ♫

261
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:02,710
♫ Perhaps the moment I fell in love with you is destined to no result ♫

262
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:17,170
♫ Even so, I will persevere in my love for you without
complaints ♫

263
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,600
Look, you're soaked through.

264
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:48,220
I think that the story you told me about your parents must be lies.

265
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,090
How's that?

266
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:55,210
Look! I carried you all the way back according to what you said,

267
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,880
but not only are your clothes wet,

268
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,430
your socks and shoes are also wet.

269
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,290
I don't think this is a good method.

270
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,470
It must be because the winds are strong,

271
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,050
so an umbrella couldn't cover us.

272
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,170
Besides, my parents have divine powers.

273
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,570
My dad does it purely to make my mom happy.

274
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,280
Did you catch a cold?

275
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,370
I'm fine.

276
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,520
Jiu'er,

277
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,670
I've favored you for so long,

278
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,940
but why hasn't there been any progress?

279
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,840
Progress?

280
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,830
I want a child with you.

281
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,060
That's not something that I can control.

282
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:03,060
Are you saying I haven't spoiled you enough?

283
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,940
Staying over every night isn't enough?

284
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,650
Look at you. You're always so indecent.

285
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,610
Is that so?

286
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,450
I'm only like that to you.

287
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,140
Your Majesty has hundreds of beauties in your harem.

288
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,450
If you're like this, aren't you afraid others might make fun of you?

289
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,220
It's not the same.

290
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,210
You're not the same as them.

291
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,130
Your Majesty Empress, it's been half a year.

292
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:00,030
For the last half year, His Majesty has only favored Virtuous Consort Chen.

293
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,090
He never asked for us.

294
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:07,970
Not only that, yesterday, he even braved through rain to personally carry her back to Lotus Courtyard!

295
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,980
Your Majesty Empress, His Majesty even made a decree today

296
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,870
to build an imperial villa for Virtuous Consort Chen outside the palace!

297
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,110
She once saved His Majesty's life,

298
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:23,210
so there's nothing we can say about His Majesty's special treatment to her.

299
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,830
But...

300
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,700
His Majesty has also once built a temple for crown prince's birth mother.

301
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,990
Just let them be.

302
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,820
Is it bitter?

303
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:18,130
I especially ordered the pharmacists to make your medicine bitter.

304
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,430
Because good medicines are usually bitter?

305
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,620
Not because of that.

306
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:27,700
If you don't suffer a little, you won't remember it.

307
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,690
If you get sick again next time,

308
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,750
I will again have to tire myself in feeding you medicine.

309
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:38,160
Then I'll just do it myself.

310
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,170
As the distinguished emperor,

311
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:44,440
since I've started to feed you, then I must finish my task.

312
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,030
Here.

313
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,860
Take it slowly.

314
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:05,470
Your Majesty, will you always treat me this well?

315
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,200
Of course.

316
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,360
Looks like Emperor is quite romantic.

317
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,450
Did you come to make me...

318
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,870
I think that you've obtained Emperor's heart now.

319
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,250
Next, we'll start to hurt him.

320
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,380
No, he still hasn't truly fallen in love with me.

321
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,430
You've been the only favored consort for several months.

322
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,590
What else do you want?

323
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,260
No way.

324
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,930
I'm just starting to regain a few my feelings for Emperor back in the Heavenly Palace.

325
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,850
How come it's been months already?

326
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,020
Did you and Emperor have a happy life in these past months?

327
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,800
Emperor dotes on me a lot.

328
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,420
He's not like how he was in Nine Heavens at all.

329
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,700
Then that's good.

330
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,510
Although you are here to repay your debt, while looking at this from Heaven,

331
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,960
I am also happy for you.

332
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,060
For so long, you finally have your wish fulfilled.

333
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,370
Just continue walking forward.

334
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:41,740
Follow the method that Emperor wants in completing this life.

335
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,250
I know.

336
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:47,660
It just... pains me to hurt him.

337
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,980
Let's go back.

338
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:14,510
Even if I have to spend my whole life, I'm going the exterminate your Winged Tribe! Let me go!

339
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:18,200
High Immortal, it can't be helped for deaths to occur when two parties are in war.

340
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,410
Moreover, my Father Monarch has been sealed.

341
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:23,530
Please stop involving other people!

342
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,710
Isn't she that Winged Tribe's princess?

343
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,080
Why is she here?

344
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,020
Mister, can I ask you something?

345
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,620
Is that miss working here?

346
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,570
She's the boss of this restaurant.

347
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,430
She can't speak but her cooking is good.

348
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,850
She's a mute.

349
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,330
- A mute?
- Right.

350
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,840
She's pretty, but she can't speak.

351
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,610
What? Do you like her?

352
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,630
I've been searching in the mortal world for quite some time,

353
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,680
but still haven't found any news about Si Yin.

354
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,400
Maybe I can find a lead with this princess of Winged Tribe.

355
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,960
After all, her brother did say he saw Si Yin.

356
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,350
But how do I stay by her side?

357
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:32,640
Every time we go down the mountain, we'd bump into a good lady being harassed by a local tyrant.

358
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,910
As long as she's still unmarried,

359
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:36,190
a chivalrous warrior will surely pass by to help her.

360
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,580
If she's married, her husband would appear out of nowhere, draw his sword, and shout.

361
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,800
- No matter if it's a chivalrous warrior...
- ...or a husband,

362
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,130
he will surely be wearing white clothes.

363
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,610
Young Seventeenth's method is quite useful.

364
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,490
But...

365
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,820
Miss, don't leave.

366
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,160
Miss,

367
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,300
Heaven's really on my side. I just thought of it and it's now happening.

368
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,090
Hey, look at how beautiful you are.

369
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,620
Come back with me.

370
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,000
You work so hard here.

371
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,010
It hurts me to see you like this.

372
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,550
It hurts.

373
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,230
What are you looking at?

374
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,510
I'm always helping your business.

375
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:22,010
Don't you really know my feelings for you? Huh?

376
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,260
If you dare talk nonsense again, I'll use my magic to turn you into a hen.

377
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,480
Miss, come with me.

378
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,340
[Linhe Inn]

379
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,260
You dare harass an ordinary woman?! Quickly leave!

380
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,950
Please spare me!

381
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,730
I'll leave!

382
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,140
How come there's suddenly a noble warrior here?

383
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,990
Miss, are you hurt?

384
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,430
Let me help you clean up.

385
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,220
He's a little silly, but he's cute.

386
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,170
Let me.

387
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,410
Great Lady!

388
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,360
His Highness the Crown Prince said that you'll be leaving for the Nine Heavens today.

389
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,610
Right, I'm going to Nine Heavens.

390
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:19,630
Say, I've been going around the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses since I was little,

391
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,630
but I've never been to the Nine Heavens.

392
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,280
Thanks to Ye Hua this time that I'm able to go look at it .

393
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,960
You can say that I've received good fortune out of misfortune.

394
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,820
His Highness has been waiting for you outside the den.

395
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,240
I'll go out for a bit. You keep an eye on the fox den.

396
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,490
Go out for just a bit?

397
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:39,600
Based on His Highness's personality, I fear that during this trip, you'll enjoy it too much

398
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,980
that you'll forget Green Hill and this fox den.

399
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,660
You're more capable now. You dare and mock me already?

400
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,530
I wouldn't dare.

401
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,220
Go to my room and get me my fan.

402
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,900
The one which Zhe Yan gave me yesterday.

403
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,520
I'll take that fan with me to Heaven, so it can absorb some of their divine aurae.

404
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,070
Okay.

405
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,230
High God Zhe Yan is right.

406
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:26,290
You still have to end what should be ended.

407
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:30,200
It can't be considered truly closed if only you think so.

408
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,520
Seems like you have experience.

409
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,990
I'll wait for you up front.

410
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,660
Ah Yin, I thought...

411
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,400
I thought you never wanted to see me again.

412
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,660
Are your injuries better?

413
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,650
Thank you Winged Monarch for worrying.

414
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,560
I've always had a strong body.

415
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,470
This minor injury won't affect me greatly.

416
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,840
That's good.

417
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,020
What's this supposed to mean, Winged Monarch?

418
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:12,050
It's all because of a moment of wrong decision that I committed such a huge mistake.

419
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,190
Now, take this Jaded Soul and put it inside Mo Yuan's mouth.

420
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,850
Then, you don't have to use your heart's blood again.

421
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,630
Thank you for your kindness,

422
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:33,690
but my teacher's body doesn't need my blood anymore.

423
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:40,220
You can keep this treasure and use it for yourself.

424
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,200
Ah Yin,

425
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,480
is there no way for us to go back to how things used to be?

426
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,700
You're giving me all your attention right now

427
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,950
because you think that

428
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:08,090
after you abandoned me, I didn't find a place to kill myself,

429
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,230
but instead, am living well now.

430
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:16,800
Thus, you must feel that I've never placed my heart on you;

431
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,540
that's why, you keep pestering me.

432
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:25,470
Ah Yin, do you think that I just can't accept the fact that you don't love me?

433
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:33,830
I fear that we will never have a chance to peacefully speak like this again.

434
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:37,110
So let's lay everything on the table today.

435
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,480
70,000 years ago,

436
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,280
I indeed tasted first love because of you.

437
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:50,090
Because it was my first time, I couldn't compare to those experienced women,

438
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,800
hence, my attitude was a bit cold and passive,

439
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,640
but my love towards you was very full.

440
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,250
You know it, too.

441
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,830
Our two tribes back then had some animosity.

442
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:10,570
Hence, that time, I would think every day on how to convince my parents in allowing me to marry you.

443
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,630
Whenever I thought of a good reason,

444
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,740
I then happily wrote it down on a scroll,

445
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,040
for I was afraid that I'd forget it.

446
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,320
Now that I think about it, it's rather ridiculous.

447
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,260
As for you,

448
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:33,610
when my love for you was at its peak, you hit my head with a club.

449
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:36,060
You only know that I let go quickly and confidently,

450
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,390
but you don't know that behind it,

451
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,870
I went through so much heartache.

452
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,810
When Teacher died,

453
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:49,010
I forcefully brought a humble heart

454
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,490
and went to your Grand Purple Palace to borrow the Jaded Soul.

455
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:57,620
You will never understand how much courage I mustered

456
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:03,900
and you won't ever understand how much you disappointed me.

457
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:33,830
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

458

♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

459
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,540
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

460
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:43,870
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

461
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:53,260
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

462
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,170
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

463
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:02,460
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

464
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:08,060
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

465
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:15,110
♫ All are just illusions ♫

466
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:21,560
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

467
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,700
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

468
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,070
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

469
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:37,300
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

470
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:42,720
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

471
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,000
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

472
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,880
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

473
00:43:50,880 --> 00:44:00,100
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

474
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:11,980
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

475
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:17,440
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

476
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,760
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

477
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:27,970
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

478
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:33,320
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

479
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:38,710
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

480
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,410
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

481
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:50,780
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

482
00:44:52,180 --> 00:45:02,920
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
