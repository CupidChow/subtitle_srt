”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,540
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,080
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,620
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,160
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,390
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,210
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,830
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,260
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,840
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,460
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,870
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,450
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,030
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,630
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,090
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,520
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,010
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,050
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,580
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,250
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,830
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,950
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,950
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,450
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,990
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,050
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,910
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,930
[Episode 23]

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,690
Ye Hua.

32
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,930
Ye Hua.

33
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,090
Ye Hua, are you sleeping?

34
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,650
No. Is Nai Nai around?

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,130
Nai Nai is sleeping.

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,560
I heard from Nai Nai that the war at Northern Wilderness is critical.

37
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,200
Are you all right?

38
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,950
I'm doing very well.

39
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,620
It's been six months since we've seen each other.

40
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,470
Ye Hua, let me tell you.

41
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,360
The child is very lively recently.

42
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,280
Sometimes, I can feel his hands and feet.

43
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,230
I don't want him to come out too soon.

44
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,090
I'm afraid you won't be able to see him when he's born.

45
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,110
Ye Hua, can I ask you something?

46
00:03:50,350 --> 00:04:00,190
Does the oath we made at Eastern Wilderness that day... still count?

47
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,050
I was thinking that when our child is born, I want to tell him our story.

48
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,180
I want to know his father's views.

49
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,850
It's still valid.

50
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,630
Okay. I understand.

51
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,840
Take care.

52
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,650
I'll be waiting for you to come back.

53
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:52,520
Little rascal, your father will return to the palace soon.

54
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,750
Take your time growing up.

55
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,300
Let him see your birth.

56
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,510
That would be better. Okay?

57
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,530
- Your Highness, great victory.
- Continue to speak.

58
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,980
Winged Monarch Li Jing took advantage of the cold weather and transported lots of ice upstream,

59
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,540
and then used demonic spells to melt the ice in advance.

60
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,640
He then borrowed our Heavenly Tribe's Thunder and Rain spells to make it rain successively for three days,

61
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,640
causing landslides and flooding in the Northern Wilderness.

62
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,010
The enemies were defeated without a fight.

63
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,510
This... In this case, it's not just limited to the rebels, even the lives of the Winged Realm in Northern Wilderness.

64
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,210
It's no wonder he's the son of Qing Cang.

65
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,730
The Winged Realm is not Heavenly Tribe's sub-tribe.

66
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,170
They are helping us suppress the rebels this time,

67
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,740
but even I find this method unacceptable.

68
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,510
Divide the soldiers into five paths. One to the flooded area to save the people.

69
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,180
The remaining four, do according to the agreement with Winged Monarch.

70
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,560
Defend the four main roads in Northern Wilderness to intercept the dispersed soldiers.

71
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,190
As ordered.

72
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,410
Eldest Brother, we haven't seen each other in many years.

73
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,830
I didn't think that when we would meet again, it would be on another battlefield.

74
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,860
Li Jing, you're totally vicious.

75
00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:01,970
You actually neglected the lives of thousands from Winged Realm and joined forces with the Heavenly Tribe to eliminate them!

76
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,020
You're wrong.

77
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,650
The one who brought calamity upon them was you.

78
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:12,080
If you hadn't incited them to support you, would they have died such a terrible death?

79
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:20,450
Yan Zhi, ever since Father Monarch was sealed, how did I treat you?

80
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,490
Second Older Brother.

81
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,270
Why did you choose to help him?

82
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,440
Second Older Brother, I... I don't want to be your enemy.

83
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,970
I don't want to see either of you die.

84
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:41,500
So... So all these years, I've stayed next to Eldest Brother because I didn't want to see him harm you.

85
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,670
- Take them down!
- Yes!

86
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,910
Li Jing, if you want to kill me, come do it yourself.

87
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,360
Why send these lowly-ranked soldiers?

88
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,570
I don't want your life, Eldest Brother.

89
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,210
Fine. I will take you along to see Father Monarch!

90
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,490
Eldest Brother! You promised me that you wouldn't fight with him!

91
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,560
Scram!

92
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,220
Second Older Brother!

93
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,760
Golden Lion!

94
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,470
Your Highness Princess.

95
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,710
You didn't disappoint me after all.

96
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,430
You have all worked hard.

97
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,720
Heavenly Monarch, you are auspicious and well-blessed by Father God.

98
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,030
Your Highness.

99
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,850
Your Highness, His Highness the Crown Prince has returned victorious.

100
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,790
He's having a discussion with Heavenly Monarch now.

101
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,210
Deliver this invitation immediately to the Courtyard of Moonlight.

102
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,810
Tell her that she's invited to the lotus pond to admire the flowers.

103
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,020
The palace women and their families will be at the banquet.

104
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,960
If the guard at the Courtyard of Moonlight stops you,

105
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,610
tell him that Heavenly Monarch has lifted the confinement for them.

106
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,890
Yes, Your Highness.

107
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:19,830
This is Consort Su Jin's invitation for all women in the palace to admire the flowers at the lotus pond.

108
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,370
Heavenly Monarch has kindly allowed the noble lady at the Courtyard of Moonlight to attend.

109
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,460
This...

110
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,370
If you don't believe me, you can check it yourself.

111
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,870
Divine maid, this way, please.

112
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:53,020
- My Lady, take your time.
- My body is becoming heavier.

113
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,800
I feel tired just after a few steps.

114
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
My Lady, you will give birth soon.

115
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,490
You could have declined this invitation.

116
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,480
Why do you still insist on coming to the lotus pond?

117
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,570
All women in the Heavenly Palace must go.

118
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,250
I'm Ye Hua's wife.

119
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,990
I don't have any excuses for not going. Isn't that so?

120
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,830
You are the only woman in Pure Wutong Palace, and you made an oath with His Highness the Crown Prince in Eastern Wilderness.

121
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,350
They must acknowledge you.

122
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,520
You are His Highness the Crown Prince's wife.

123
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,540
Su Su.

124
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,170
What a coincidence.

125
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,660
I just heard Ye Hua came back.

126
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,580
Heavenly Monarch ordered that the banquet be canceled.

127
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,090
Everyone has gone to welcome Ye Hua.

128
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,200
Ye Hua is back?

129
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,030
That's right.

130
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,020
I was waiting here to bring you there.

131
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,870
All right. Take me to him.

132
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,750
Let's go.

133
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,550
Your Highness.

134
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,310
Let's go.

135
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,520
Let go of me!

136
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,680
Don't forget your status.

137
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,870
A divine maid like you from the lower realm is of the lowest rank here.

138
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,490
How dare you talk with Consort Su Jin?

139
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,950
My Lady is pregnant.

140
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,010
She can't come to a place with strong evil energy like the Immortal Execution Platform.

141
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,390
My Lady! My Lady!

142
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,200
What's going on?

143
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,880
- Let's go.
- But...

144
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,690
Let's go.

145
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,440
Why did Father Monarch suddenly give Su Jin to you?

146
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,100
That's not a reward! That'll only make things worse!

147
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,490
It's not as simple as that.

148
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:38,710
Congratulations, Your Highness. Not only did you have a great victory, but you also gained a beauty, too.

149
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:43,560
In the future, you must treat this descendant of a loyal subject well.

150
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,550
- Your Highness! I—
- Your Highness!

151
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,690
Her Highness had an argument with Lady Su Su at the Immortal Execution Platform.

152
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,720
That's not it! Your Highness!

153
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:10,840
Do you know that Heavenly Monarch is holding a conferment to give me to Ye Hua as his wife?

154
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,040
Ye Hua and I find each other congenial.

155
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,370
Nine Heavens is not the place for a woman like you.

156
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,210
You should jump from this Immortal Execution Platform after giving birth.

157
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,830
Go back to where you belong.

158
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,980
Is Ye Hua the one who wants me to go back?

159
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,700
I'm his wife.

160
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,050
Of course, I need to be with him.

161
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,130
Do you really think that?

162
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,210
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

163
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,260
Don't blame Su Su.

164
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,700
I believe she didn't push me on purpose.

165
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:30,510
She was just impulsive after hearing... hearing about the news that Heavenly Monarch has given me to you as a wife.

166
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:36,060
- Ye Hua, I didn't push her. I didn't push her.
- Ye Hua...

167
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,150
- Please believe me.
- Your Highness the Crown Prince!

168
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,350
Ye Hua, believe me. I didn't push her!

169
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,680
Ye Hua, truly, I didn't push her.

170
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,360
- You... You believe me.
- That's enough!

171
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,250
I can only believe what I saw.

172
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,660
I didn't push her!

173
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,990
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

174
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,880
Ye Hua! I didn't push her.

175
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,330
Take her back to the Courtyard of Moonlight.

176
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,460
Without my consent, she's not allowed to step out from there.

177
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,650
- My Lady.
- I didn't push her.

178
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,870
Ye Hua.

179
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:49,570
Do you know how happy I was after hearing Heavenly Monarch was going to give me to you?

180
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,130
I've summoned the Medicine King here.

181
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,240
Don't say anything for now.

182
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,320
- Su Jin!
- Uncle.

183
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,720
What happened exactly?

184
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,910
When I got there, I saw Su Jin pretending to fight Su Su.

185
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:23,390
She pretended that Su Su pushed her, and then she jumped down to frame her.

186
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,700
Su Jin jumped on purpose?

187
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,780
If I had known earlier, I would have blocked those chieftains.

188
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,610
This woman dared to push the Heavenly Consort down the Immortal Execution Platform?

189
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,770
That's a death penalty!

190
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,790
What are you going to do?

191
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,990
What can I do, Third Uncle?

192
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,360
If I try to absolve Su Su from blame,

193
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,220
Heavenly Monarch will use me protecting her as an excuse to still execute her.

194
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,590
But you—

195
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,570
- Heavenly Monarch.
- Father Monarch.

196
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,940
- Medicine King.
- Yes.

197
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,080
What happened?

198
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,090
How did the Heavenly Consort hurt her eyes?

199
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:26,500
Heavenly Monarch, Her Highness originally wanted to invite the women in the palace to a banquet,

200
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,970
but because His Highness the Crown Prince suddenly returned, she ended the banquet.

201
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:37,110
Who'd know... that woman from the Courtyard of Moonlight brought Her Highness to the Immortal Execution Platform in the end.

202
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:42,770
I don't know what she said, but she suddenly pushed Her Highness down.

203
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,900
Thank goodness His Highness the Crown Prince came just in time,

204
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,530
so Her Highness was able to escape death.

205
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,170
What? This woman dared to harm a Heavenly Consort?!

206
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,600
How audacious! Heavenly Consort Sujin is a descendant of a loyal subject.

207
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,140
Her whole tribe gave up their lives for the Heavenly Tribe.

208
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:07,120
Don't even mention us sub-tribe chieftains, even Heavenly Monarch treats her with extreme respect and care,

209
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,130
yet such a mere woman dare push her down the Immortal Execution Platform?!

210
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,540
Heavenly Monarch. Crown Prince. You cannot spare this mortal!

211
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,360
You must push her down the Immortal Execution Platform to kill her in order to bring justice to Su Jin's eyes!

212
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,500
That's right! You must not forgive this mortal!

213
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,920
Heavenly Monarch, from the way I see, this mortal has His Highness the Crown Prince's child.

214
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,710
What if it was a slip of the hand when she heard about Su Jin's marriage with Ye Hua?

215
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,080
Slip of the hand? That's called a slip of the hand?!

216
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,950
Look at her! Look at her!

217
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,750
She's already blind!

218
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:48,440
Uncles, please... please don't blame that mortal anymore.

219
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,110
After all,

220
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,800
she's pregnant with His Highness the Crown Prince's child.

221
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,330
She didn't do it intentionally.

222
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,480
You don't need to say anything.

223
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,900
I will bring you justice.

224
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,240
Heavenly Monarch!

225
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,770
Ye Hua.

226
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,750
Su Jin is the descendant of heroes, so we, the Heavenly Tribe, should treat her well.

227
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,510
But now, Su Su has injured her to this extent.

228
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,820
If we do not offer a reasonable explanation for this,

229
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,610
our relations with other tribes will suffer.

230
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:42,000
What do you think on how to punish Su Su to pacify the masses and bring about justice to Su Jin?

231
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,080
Nai Nai, you must be my witness.

232
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,180
I didn't push her.

233
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,560
She tried to frame me.

234
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,730
My Lady, when I arrived at the Immortal Execution Platform,

235
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,430
Consort Su Jin was already in His Highness the Crown Prince's arms.

236
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,330
Even you think that I pushed her?

237
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,680
No, I don't believe it!

238
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,960
My Lady, you saw what happened last time.

239
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:22,610
Even if I testify for you, no one is willing to believe me.

240
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,450
You're right.

241
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,890
Even if you can testify for me,

242
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,500
no one will believe me.

243
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,560
Even Ye Hua doesn't believe me,

244
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,170
not to mention the others.

245
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,430
But Ye Hua and Su Jin are childhood sweethearts.

246
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,570
He loves her very much.

247
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,070
Of course, he wouldn't believe me.

248
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,550
What are you saying?

249
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,410
Don't say nonsense.

250
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,150
Su Jin is a Heavenly Consort.

251
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,760
She won't be very soon.

252
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,910
My Lady, what do you mean?

253
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:13,180
She has been granted to Ye Hua as a side consort.

254
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,100
What?!

255
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,090
I didn't push her.

256
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,860
Ye Hua won't just believe her.

257
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,130
There were so many people up there.

258
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,750
So many people were watching.

259
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,190
Someone must've seen that I didn't push her.

260
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,360
It wasn't me.

261
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,150
- I probably wouldn't...
- My Lady!

262
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,010
My Lady! What's wrong?

263
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,460
Help! Help!

264
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,230
My Lady! My Lady, are you okay?

265
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,860
Heavenly Monarch, you are right.

266
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,690
Earlier, I did not see what really happened.

267
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,850
I only heard from Heavenly Consort that Su Su didn't do it intentionally.

268
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,630
Even if it was unintentional,

269
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,970
Heavenly Consort's eyes were harmed.

270
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,750
A mortal pushed a heavenly consort down the Immortal Execution Platform.

271
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,590
Su Su's sin is indeed unforgivable.

272
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,460
I wonder if having Su Su compensate with her eyes

273
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,490
plus enduring three years worth of lightning strikes

274
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:29,360
is satisfactory to Heavenly Consort and everyone else?

275
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,060
The Crown Prince is right. The Crown Prince is right.

276
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,170
Heavenly Consort also said that the mortal didn't do it on purpose.

277
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,650
We shouldn't be too harsh on her.

278
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:45,260
Right... Three years' worth of lightning is already a heavy punishment.

279
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,880
The Crown Prince's punishment is just.

280
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,550
Crown Prince is a saint.

281
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,890
All right.

282
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,150
This is excellent.

283
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,250
Heavenly Monarch, Su Su is my life savior.

284
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:11,230
Heavenly Monarch, you have taught me to repay a kindness.

285
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:14,380
I am also the reason why Su Su was brought up here.

286
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,240
Since something like this has happened, even more so I must take responsibility.

287
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,790
Especially because she's pregnant with my child.

288
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:38,260
Thus, I beg you to let me take her place in enduring three years' worth of lightning.

289
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,470
You want to replace her and receive three years of lightning punishment?

290
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,530
That's right.

291
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:51,720
In order to repay her past kindness and also for my child in her womb.

292
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,380
Sure.

293
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,500
I promise you.

294
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,220
Thank you, Heavenly Monarch.

295
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,050
I will have someone take her eyes today,

296
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:05,090
and have Medicine King put them in Su Jin.

297
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:10,260
You go to the Divine Firmament Jade Manor and carry out your lightning punishment.

298
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,970
Lord of Puhua is upright.

299
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,990
He wouldn't be biased towards you just because you're the crown prince.

300
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,550
Remember, it's for three years.

301
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,630
Not a day less.

302
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,390
I understand.

303
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,320
I still have one more plea for your permission.

304
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,330
Please allow me to personally take Su Su's eyes.

305
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,150
What?!

306
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,870
You want to take her eyes by yourself?!

307
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:59,300
Since you insist, you may do it yourself.

308
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,530
I'll abide.

309
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,070
- Is something wrong with My Lady?
- Nothing is wrong.

310
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:22,430
Fortunately, the young prince is fine, and Her Lady is also not in danger.

311
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,480
That's good.

312
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,980
Ye Hua!

313
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,680
- Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.
- Ye Hua, please believe me.

314
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,570
You may go.

315
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,370
Yes.

316
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:31,880
Ye Hua, you believe me. Right?

317
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,350
You know I didn't push her.

318
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,250
I wouldn't push her.

319
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:41,790
You came to see me because you believe me, right?

320
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,350
I believe you.

321
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,470
You didn't push her down there.

322
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,670
She jumped by herself.

323
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:01,670
But Su Jin is now blind from the burn.

324
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,050
The only way to save your life...

325
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,160
is to give your eyes to her.

326
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:24,520
There's no other way to appease Heavenly Monarch.

327
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,700
Why?

328
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,430
Why?

329
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,150
Why do you have to say that?

330
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,780
Don't you believe me, Ye Hua?

331
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,630
Why? Don't come here.

332
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,100
Su Su, it's all my fault.

333
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,200
- I didn't push her.
- It's all my fault.

334
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,370
I can't protect you. Su Su...

335
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:21,420
- I didn't push her.
- Su Su...

336
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:27,020
I will definitely marry you.

337
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,980
Starting from now, I will be your eyes.

338
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,450
Ye Hua, don't do this.

339
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:38,330
Ye Hua! I don't want to.

340
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,460
Don't!

341
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,380
Don't!

342
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,890
Don't! Ye Hua.

343
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:57,370
[Courtyard of Moonlight]

344
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,350
My eyes!

345
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,180
My eyes!

346
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,170
My eyes!

347
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,020
My eyes! My eyes...

348
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:59,140
My Lady, Medicine King said you can't get too excited.

349
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:05,920
It will be fine if you let it heal.

350
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,560
It'll be fine?

351
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,730
Will it?

352
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,470
Tell me.

353
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,450
How can it be fine?

354
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:18,340
My eyes are gone.

355
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,750
How can it be fine?

356
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,570
My eyes are gone.

357
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,330
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

358
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,610
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

359
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,420
- I came to accept my Punishment of Lightning and Thunder.
- Okay.

360
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:54,170
It's three years for forty-nine times a day, not a strike less.

361
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,500
This Punishment of Lightning and Thunder won't kill you,

362
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,790
but when it falls on your body,

363
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,990
it's like your spirit is being torn for a moment.

364
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:08,490
Many immortals will faint from the pain.

365
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:13,710
Your Highness, do you want other people to leave first?

366
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,210
No need.

367
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,400
All right.

368
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,060
Crown Prince, please ascend the Platform of Punishment.

369
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,140
Your Highness Crown Prince, my apologies.

370
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,250
It wasn't me. She jumped down herself.

371
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,390
I didn't do anything.

372
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:26,130
Why won't you believe me?

373
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:30,900
It wasn't me! So why do I have to give my eyes?

374
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,290
- Leave.
- Yes.

375
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,710
Third Uncle, do you think that after the battle in Northern Wilderness,

376
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,160
I still have the right to be awarded the Crown Prince Seal?

377
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,860
You have the achievements of defeating the Merpeople Tribe and suppressing the rebels in Northern Wilderness.

378
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,570
Your fame has spread throughout the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

379
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:21,950
It's time for Heavenly Monarch to grant you the seal.

380
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,390
But your body is full of injuries.

381
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:30,200
To accept the crown prince seal, you have to endure the great undertaking of thirty-six strikes of uncultivated fire and nine heavenly strikes of lightning.

382
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,860
I fear that you can't withstand it.

383
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,520
In your eyes, am I that vulnerable?

384
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,480
Since I'm the Crown Prince,

385
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,750
if I'm unable to bear that much uncultivated fire and heavenly lightning, how could I let all realms willingly submit to me?

386
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,860
Let me be frank.

387
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,420
You just got heavily injured in Long Seas prior to this.

388
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,620
It's indeed a stretch.

389
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,850
Why are you in such a hurry? Can't you slow down?

390
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:07,090
In the past, I thought that if I didn't frequent the Courtyard of Moonlight and treated her coldly in public,

391
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,320
I could protect her.

392
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,690
That's why I'm scared to marry her.

393
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:18,680
I wanted her to live peacefully in the Mortal Realm after giving birth.

394
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,050
But I realized today...

395
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,040
that I was wrong.

396
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,980
I was extremely wrong.

397
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,770
No matter what I do,

398
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,540
Heavenly Monarch wants to kill her.

399
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,540
That's right.

400
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,580
He's very afraid because of what happened to Second Older Brother.

401
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,850
He's not willing to take this risk.

402
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,330
After all, you're the Crown Prince.

403
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,480
You're more important than Second Older Brother to the Heavenly Tribe.

404
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,720
Hence, if I'm awarded the crown prince seal, I will be the legitimate Crown Prince.

405
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,540
By then, I won't care about what others say, and I can openly make Su Su my consort.

406
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,210
You want to marry her in the Heavenly Palace?

407
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:10,570
Yes. I will announce to the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses and establish her as my side consort.

408
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,470
I'm begging Your Highness! I'm begging Your Highness!

409
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,740
I don't want to leave the Courtyard of Moonlight.

410
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,290
I don't want to.

411
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:27,040
Heavenly Monarch said that any divine maid who witnessed this incident must leave Heavenly Palace.

412
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,940
It's also to cover up this shameless scandal.

413
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,370
Lest the Heavenly Tribe will lose our reputation.

414
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,940
My Lady is going to give birth soon.

415
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,890
She has also lost her eyes.

416
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:42,200
No one in Nine Heavens can take care of her besides me.

417
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,930
I beg Your Highness to let me stay in the Courtyard of Moonlight.

418
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:49,630
Let me take care of Her Lady when she gives birth.

419
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:53,240
I'm begging you, Your Highness.

420
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,340
Who'd know there was such a loyal maid in the Courtyard of Moonlight.

421
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,670
Listen up.

422
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:19,230
When you go down the divine mountain in the lower realm, you must let this matter rot in your heart.

423
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,150
You must not tell anyone.

424
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,570
Do you understand?

425
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,970
I understand.

426
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,830
Why did they drive away so many divine maids?

427
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,010
Did something major happen?

428
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,400
Something big did happen.

429
00:39:52,400 --> 00:40:00,260
I heard His Highness the Crown Prince's mortal Su Su fought with Su Jin and pushed her down the Immortal Execution Platform.

430
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:07,130
Afterward, His Highness the Crown Prince personally took out Su Su's eyes to give to Su Jin.

431
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,600
Why did Crown Prince do that to Su Su?

432
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,070
Heavenly Monarch wants to cover up this incident.

433
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:18,490
Hence, he sent all the divine maids and guards that witnessed the incident down to the lower realm's divine mountain.

434
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,220
The group you just saw should be the last batch.

435
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,960
Then, why does he want to cover this up?

436
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,080
I'm not clear on the details of what happened.

437
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,670
But Emperor once said that,

438
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:33,020
the Courtyard of Moonlight is a place full of troubles and rumors in Nine Heavens now.

439
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,140
Nothing can escape from Emperor's discerning eyes.

440
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,380
Young Highness! Where are you going?

441
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,100
Oh no. Don't tell me she's being nosy and going to the Courtyard of Moonlight.

442
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,510
Who is it?

443
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,000
It's me! Do you not recognize me?

444
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,850
Little Fox.

445
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:28,030
You have been very cautious in the Heavenly Palace.

446
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:34,510
Just for that crown prince, you were so friendly with everyone, so how could you have pushed Su Jin?

447
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:41,160
Did you come to see me because you know I don't have my eyes anymore?

448
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,840
Do you know?

449
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,700
In the Nine Heavens, he was once my one and only.

450
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,350
I always thought after I gave birth,

451
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:58,330
we could hold our child's hands

452
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:03,880
to watch the surging ten miles sea of clouds and flowing rosy clouds above the ten thousand feet high Golden Mang Mountain.

453
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,750
But now, I don't even have my eyes.

454
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:11,480
What can I see?

455
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,830
Little Fox?

456
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:43,250
Your eyesight has never meant anything special to him.

457
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,100
Su Jin?

458
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:17,850

as a dream ♫

476
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:01,500
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

477
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,550
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

478
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:12,100
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

479
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:17,030
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

480
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:22,630
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

481
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:25,380
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

482
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:34,580
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

483
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:46,890
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
