”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,490
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,140
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,660
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,130
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,420
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,160
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,810
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,270
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,970
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,400
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,220
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,350
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,960
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,570
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,050
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,600
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,200
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,990
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,850
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,190
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,790
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,860
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,890
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,500
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,350
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,070
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,650
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,880
[Episode 42]

31
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,010
I've always wanted you to forget what happened 300 years ago;

32
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:24,950
yet, I'm uneasy of the High Goddess you're fond of today.

33
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,680
Ye Hua, tell me.

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,670
Is this Bai Qian of Green Hill really in your heart or did you regard her as that mortal?

35
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,330
Mother Consort, you are worrying too much.

36
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,280
My wife that Heavenly Monarch granted to me is Bai Qian.

37
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,020
I have never regarded her as someone else.

38
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,860
That's good then. That's good then.

39
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,260
As the side consort, whether out of sentiment or reason,

40
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,410
you should pay your respects to the High Goddess.

41
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,730
I went today.

42
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,070
Coincidentally, Great Lady went to Heavenly Spring in High Clear Plane.

43
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,800
I will go again tomorrow morning.

44
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,650
Fine.

45
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,990
- High Goddess.
- High Goddess.

46
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,250
Don't the both of you usually stick close to him?

47
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,210
Why are the both of you guarding outside?

48
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,630
His Mighty Monarch is in the temple with Her Majesty Le Xu.

49
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,560
Her Majesty Le Xu? Ye Hua's mother?

50
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,120
That's right.

51
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,090
Are you looking for His Mighty Monarch for something urgent?

52
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,770
There's nothing urgent.

53
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,270
I merely wanted to see Ah Li.

54
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,210
Then, would you like us to announce you?

55
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,490
No need. I will come again later.

56
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,580
Mother Consort, seriously. You are always laughing at me.

57
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,200
You have married into Pure Wutong Palace for three hundred years and there's still no movements in your belly.

58
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,960
Shouldn't I ask?

59
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,900
Your Majesty, this is not up to me.

60
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,490
- High God Bai Zhen.
- Dispense with the formality.

61
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,570
Is Zhe Yan in there?

62
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,330
Since last night, High God Zhe Yan has been keeping watch by oldest brother's side.

63
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,600
He has never been this frantic before.

64
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,470
I keep feeling that there's something wrong with your brother's illness, but I don't know what the problem is.

65
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,470
High God Bai Zhen, you are right.

66
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:03,100
Both the cause of my oldest brother's illness and High God Zhe Yan's expressions are strange.

67
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,760
Let's not talk any further. Show me in now.

68
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,380
High God, this way, please.

69
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,060
High God.

70
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,650
You haven't taken a rest since you came last night.

71
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,240
Do you need me to instruct them to prepare a room for you to rest?

72
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,740
No need.

73
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,490
I've found a way to save him.

74
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:49,250
I will leave for a few hours and return with an envoy to nurse your older brother back to good health.

75
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,070
Thank you very much, High God. Thank you very much, High God.

76
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,270
My son has been sick for more than six hundred years.

77
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,210
He can finally be saved.

78
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,200
Can I request that you step aside?

79
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,050
- Yes.
- Yes.

80
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,150
I remember your expression and voice the day before you left.

81
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,420
I kept feeling that something's not right.

82
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,010
Just now, you told them to leave.

83
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,790
Is there something urgent that you wanted to tell me?

84
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,310
Tell me.

85
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,600
Zhen Zhen, you have probably guessed it.

86
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,030
The legitimate son of Father God is the only God of War in the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses, Mo Yuan.

87
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,430
But now, he became too weak that he has to depend on the divine aura of another for nurturing.

88
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,360
Mo Yuan?

89
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,980
Are you saying that he's Mo Yuan?

90
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,080
It's him and also not him.

91
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,820
Mo Yuan is right here.

92
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,840
He has been at the Western Sea for six hundred years.

93
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,660
Do you know that Kunlun Void has been deserted for 70,000 years?

94
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,860
Do you know that your sixteen disciples have scattered over the Four Seas to find your whereabouts?

95
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,610
Do you know that your seventeenth disciple, in order to preserve your body,

96
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:28,100
fed you every night with a bowl of blood from her heart to nurse you for 70,000 years?

97
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,400
Mo Yuan, you are finally back.

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,310
Teacher.

99
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,690
Is that you, Teacher?

100
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,040
What's going on?

101
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,840
Ninth Senior Brother!

102
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,160
Wait for me.

103
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,310
Teacher...

104
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,930
Teacher...

105
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,680
It's been so long since I dreamed about the battle at Ruoshui River.

106
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,780
What's wrong with me?

107
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,290
I still can't believe it.

108
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,790
Is Mo Yuan really back?

109
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,920
Zhen Zhen, guard here for now.

110
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,740
I'll bring Young Fifth here.

111
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,850
You're telling her?

112
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,640
This is her teacher.

113
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,930
She used her heart's blood to feed him for 70,000 years.

114
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,640
She waited for him for 70,000 years.

115
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,370
Of course, I must immediately tell her and ask her to come here.

116
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,410
No, you can't just go like this.

117
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,920
- What you mean is... Ye Hua?
- Yes.

118
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,780
I'm afraid that Ye Hua will overthink.

119
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,850
You must remember that he is the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

120
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,540
If he learns that his fiancée is treating another man like this,

121
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:34,070
even if that person is her teacher, it's still inappropriate.

122
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,080
But Ye Hua has long known the existence of Mo Yuan.

123
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,470
During the battle at Grand Purple Palace, he rescued Young Fifth and Mo Yuan. Have you forgotten?

124
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,860
It's different.

125
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,470
Even if he saw the divine body of Mo Yuan, he knew that Mo Yuan's soul had dispersed.

126
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,060
But now, Mo Yuan's spirit is right here.

127
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,510
One day, he will return to Kunlun Void and revive the Heavenly Tribe.

128
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,990
This is different.

129
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:02,740
For him now, Mo Yuan is a living person.

130
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,410
What you said is indeed reasonable.

131
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,740
Looks like before I let Young Fifth know about it,

132
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,730
I must meet up with this crown prince of Heavenly Tribe first.

133
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,990
Mighty Monarch.

134
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,660
Why does Your Mighty Monarch look so pale today?

135
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,900
It's nothing. What is it?

136
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,140
High God Zhe Yan is here.

137
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,260
Zhe Yan?

138
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,560
High God Zhe Yan.

139
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,360
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

140
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,250
May I ask why you have come here?

141
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,070
Mo Yuan is about to wake up.

142
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,990
Really?

143
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,870
Don't you have anything else you want to say?

144
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,560
I do not.

145
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,230
It's just that I don't know when he'll wake up.

146
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:33,530
Currently, he has borrowed the body of the eldest prince of the Western Sea and is slowly regaining his spirit.

147
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:40,070
Based on the current situation, it will take about 7,000 or 8,000 years more before he can return to his original body.

148
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:53,110
Last night, when I visited Mo Yuan's spirit, I suddenly remember that year when Young Fifth became his student.

149
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,720
I was the one who took her to Kunlun Void for the first time.

150
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,450
That time, she heard that Mo Yuan was the God of War, and was quite happy for quite a long time.

151
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:10,610
She thought that Mo Yuan would surely be a High God with remarkable abilities and momentum to conquer everything.

152
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,700
Turns out, after she bowed to him and acknowledged him as her teacher,

153
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,720
she still couldn't believe that Mo Yuan would look like that.

154
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,160
Hey, did you really not swindle me?

155
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,790
Is he really the only God of War Mo Yuan in the whole Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses?

156
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:35,050
What? You have accepted his Kunlun Fan of Yuqing and bowed to him as your teacher. Do you regret it now?

157
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,070
But he doesn't look like a god of war!

158
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,380
How am I not like a god of war?

159
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,520
Teacher, you are such a handsome man.

160
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:04,580
You look similar to those fair-skinned young men from opera stories, who would have secret dates with young mortal ladies in the backyard.

161
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,350
How are you able to lift the Xuanyuan Sword?

162
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,490
You're saying that I look like a fair-skinned young mortal man?

163
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,140
Yes.

164
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,720
Mo Yuan, oh, Mo Yuan.

165
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,360
I really gifted you a good disciple this time.

166
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,250
In the future, prepare to suffer.

167
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,280
I'm just emotionally recalling some things.

168
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,630
I hope Your Highness the Crown Prince won't mind it.

169
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,460
It's all right.

170
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,770
Ye Hua, have you ever suspected that you might be Mo Yuan?

171
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,730
Never.

172
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,160
But I did.

173
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,310
Even until last night, I still had those vague thoughts.

174
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,130
I'm going to look for Young Fifth now!

175
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,280
High God, please wait.

176
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,730
Is there a way to wake High God Mo Yuan earlier?

177
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,300
Does Your Highness the Crown Prince want to wake him up that much?

178
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,750
This has been Qian Qian's wish for 70,000 years.

179
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,430
The earlier he wakes up,

180
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,740
the lesser would Qian Qian need to wait.

181
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,550
Okay.

182
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,960
I'll be honest with you then.

183
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,490
If you want him to wake up earlier, first, I need the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

184
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,490
Soul-Gathering Lamp?

185
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,730
High God, you're awake.

186
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,270
Wash your face first and I'll go prepare your breakfast.

187
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,830
No need. I want to go to Purple Morning Palace and eat breakfast together with Mochi.

188
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,460
He would be happy, right?

189
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,570
That's right. His Young Highness likes you so much.

190
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,350
He will surely be very happy. I'll take you there now.

191
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,590
Forget it.

192
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,640
I better just go to High Clear Plane.

193
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,520
Why are you not going to accompany His Young Highness anymore?

194
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,800
He's not my real born after all.

195
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,880
Someone would criticize me again if I slight him.

196
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,040
It's better to avoid trouble.

197
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,240
I was in the Purple Morning Palace all day yesterday accompanying Her Majesty Le Xu to take care of His Young Highness.

198
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,890
I was finally able to leave this morning and rushed towards here to especially show my respect to you.

199
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,450
Since you are so anxious to pay your respect to me,

200
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:15,400
why didn't you do it at our first meeting yesterday and instead are doing it now?

201
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,320
The Heavenly Palace is a bit different from other places.

202
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,650
If it's a prudent and important bow, you must first dress yourself appropriately,

203
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,440
so you can show more your sincerity.

204
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,720
Based on Heavenly Palace rules, if you come here, I must visit and bow to you in respect.

205
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,560
It's just that His Mighty Monarch never mentioned to me of your arrival.

206
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,400
Hence, when I saw you for the first time yesterday, I didn't recognize you.

207
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,120
Losing my manners in front of you is indeed quite embarrassing.

208
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,760
Since I am doing this late, let me first apologize to you.

209
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:02,590
It's indeed my first time here; hence, I don't know your Heavenly Palace rules.

210
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,250
Listening to what you said, I find it quite interesting.

211
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,720
Follow the rules and bow to me then.

212
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:15,620
Just now, I already paid my respects to you.

213
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,100
You did?

214
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,640
It was too sloppy.

215
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,240
What are you doing now?

216
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:54,720
The bow just now was the bow from a side consort to the main consort.

217
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,240
This bow now is for a benefactor.

218
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,090
You have been taking care of Ah Li for several months.

219
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,720
I'm extremely grateful.

220
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,020
Ah Li lost his mother when he was young.

221
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:12,150
Because of your appearance, he mistook you for his mother.

222
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:17,220
If he was rude by doing this, I hope that you will be tolerant.

223
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,910
There's no need to be tolerant.

224
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,280
I like him very much.

225
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:29,090
His Mighty Monarch loves Ah Li's mother very much.

226
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,880
When Ah Li's mother jumped from the Immortal Execution Platform,

227
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,770
His Mighty Monarch jumped together with her.

228
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:42,210
After he was saved by High God Zhe Yan, he laid unconscious for more than sixty years.

229
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,250
Older Sister, take a look.

230
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,040
The Courtyard of Moonlight is full of peach blossoms.

231
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,970
His Mighty Monarch planted these to remember Ah Li's mother.

232
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,490
For these two hundred years, His Mighty Monarch has never been happy.

233
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,150
Older Sister, since you look exactly like Ah Li's mother,

234
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,950
I feel that this is fate.

235
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:11,550
The bow just now is because I hope your marriage with his Mighty Monarch can be as soon as possible

236
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:16,400
to console His Mighty Monarch's heart that is already half-dead.

237
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,750
This side consort is very smart.

238
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:30,040
She's telling me that I was able to obtain Ye Hue's sincere love because I looked exactly like Ah Li's mother.

239
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,070
Fortunately, when I was wandering in the mortal realm, I watched many of such plays

240
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,630
and can understand her hidden meaning.

241
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,070
Since you bared your heart and soul in telling me so much information,

242
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,800
I should tell you what's in my heart too.

243
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,690
Older Sister, please speak.

244
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,750
Su Jin,

245
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,750
what you want is not what everyone wants.

246
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,440
As an immortal, it's best not to be too smart.

247
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,250
- Older Sister, I don't understand what you said...
- You didn't understand, right?

248
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,160
If you don't understand, go back, close your door and think for a few days.

249
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,230
You will naturally understand.

250
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,280
Yes.

251
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,320
Don't be in a hurry to get up.

252
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,270
I still have something to advise you.

253
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:27,190
I have always been paid homage by the immortals of Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses based on the ritual of Green Hill.

254
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,520
If you are serious in wanting to pay homage to me,

255
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,780
you should bathe and change clothes three days in advance, fast, and light incense.

256
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,640
Three days after, you should bow three times in my direction.

257
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,650
It's a bit of a troublesome ritual, but even if your husband, Ye Hua, were to pay homage to me,

258
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,180
I wouldn't feel burdened by it.

259
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,180
I don't like little immortals paying homage to me this way.

260
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,740
I find it too cumbersome.

261
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,740
If I know their intention, then it's enough.

262
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,040
Hence, the next time you want to earnestly pay homage to me,

263
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,140
you should follow Green Hill's ritual.

264
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,390
Don't talk to me about the rules of Heavenly Palace.

265
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,750
I was too negligent.

266
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:14,420
Furthermore, my mother didn't give me a younger sister.

267
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,170
You are young and called me "Older Sister."

268
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,810
I don't feel good hearing it.

269
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:25,220
Hence, you should follow the rules and address me as High Goddess.

270
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,060
- High Goddess.
- You can leave.

271
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,960
Yes.

272
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,260
I didn't expect Ye Hua to be this loyal to his lover.

273
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,900
He must have loved Mochi's mother very much.

274
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,030
If my deduction is right,

275
00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:00,630
Mochi's mother must have been forced by Su Jin to jump from the Immortal Execution Platform.

276
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,690
With Ye Hua's personality, why didn't he hack her?

277
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,830
High Goddess, your guess is right.

278
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,030
He did it once.

279
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,840
What did you say?

280
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,520
When His Mighty Monarch regained his consciousness,

281
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,190
he was incompetent and extremely disappointed.

282
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,570
He was spiritless and shut himself in the temple.

283
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,410
He even ignored His Young Highness, but in less than two months,

284
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,810
Heavenly Monarch ordered a sedan to carry Her Consort Su Jin into Pure Wutong Palace.

285
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,320
That day,

286
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,560
His Mighty Monarch stabbed her in the chest with a cold sword.

287
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,480
Heavenly Monarch rushed there in time to save her.

288
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,460
Subsequently, with the protection of Heavenly Monarch,

289
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,800
she succeeded in entering Pure Wutong Palace.

290
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,270
His Mighty Monarch only regards her as a jar that carries my mistress' eyes.

291
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,830
Eyes?

292
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:06,100
Her eyes were stolen from my mistress.

293
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,210
Her Majesty Le Xu said that,

294
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,720
His Mighty Monarch thought that if he hid his feelings

295
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,810
and let the people in Nine Heavens think that he didn't care about my mistress,

296
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,940
he could protect her life.

297
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:30,350
But as he hid his heart from the immortals in Heaven,

298
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,170
he also discouraged my mistress

299
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,250
and made her think that His Mighty Monarch had abandoned her.

300
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,100
However, he couldn't hide it from Heavenly Monarch

301
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:47,100
who insisted on killing her.

302
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,190
I talked indiscreetly.

303
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,690
Zhe Yan,

304
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,300
did that side consort see you just now?

305
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,070
That's why she was bowing so much to me.

306
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,890
It has been many years since I have seen you angry over trivial matters.

307
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,110
I came today to eavesdrop.

308
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,590
It was so rewarding.

309
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:25,910
Your Fourth Brother always blamed me for sending you to Kunlun Void and that I made a mistake.

310
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,400
He said that you were just supposed to learn cultivation, but you came back duller.

311
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,380
You had lost your original innocence and vivacity.

312
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,470
I'm already 140,000 years old.

313
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,080
Why do I need innocence and vivacity?

314
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:44,190
But I indeed don't like Ye Hua's side consort.

315
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,720
I have always preferred immortals who are clever and sensitive,

316
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,270
but if they go overboard and try to act smart in front of me, I don't like it.

317
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:00,000
You are here today not just to eavesdrop on me, right?

318
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,290
I will wait for you at High Clear Plane.

319
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,060
Zhe Yan,

320
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,710
three hundred years ago, you gave me this expression

321
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:23,550
and you told me that perhaps he would return, making me hopeful for nothing.

322
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,020
Now...

323
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,170
Now...

324
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:34,070
If I were to tell you that Mo Yuan is really coming back,

325
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,330
would you be anxious?

326
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,890
Are you... really not lying to me?

327
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,780
Little girl, I really mean it this time.

328
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:54,060
A few days ago, Zhen Zhen and I went to the Western Sea for a task.

329
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,430
There, we met the eldest prince of the Western Sea.

330
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:01,430
I discovered that his divine aura was very unusual.

331
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:05,390
Thus, I used my divine power to probe further.

332
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:10,130
Subsequently, I discovered that there were two people in him.

333
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,290
The one who's awake is the eldest prince.

334
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,640
- The one who's sleeping is...
- Who's the other one?

335
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:23,140
The other person is your teacher, Mo Yuan.

336
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,970
How did you know?

337
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,440
When you were young, you learned this spell from me, too.

338
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,660
When I discovered the other person sleeping inside the Western Sea's eldest prince,

339
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:42,480
I followed the source and found out that he is made of pieces of shattered spiritual powers.

340
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,830
In the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses,

341
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,750
who else can rely on a vague-to-almost-absent amount of spiritual energy

342
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,810
and piece together a person who is already shattered into bits?

343
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:56,250
Only Mo Yuan has the ability to do that.

344
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,040
Moreover, he's the direct son of Father God.

345
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,760
I was brought up by Father God.

346
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,710
We were together since we were young.

347
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,260
Naturally, I'm familiar with his divine aura.

348
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,580
In the past, you mentioned to me that,

349
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,380
before Mo Yuan turned into ashes,

350
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,040
he told your disciple brothers to wait for him.

351
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,600
I always thought that it was just a shimmer of hope that he left behind for you.

352
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,890
When I saw him last night, I was truly in awe.

353
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,720
Mo Yuan has never disappointed anyone in this life.

354
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,710
This is the color of a true man.

355
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,380
Teacher.

356
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,170
He took 70,000 years for him to be like this today.

357
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,260
It's still rather scattered now.

358
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,630
He still needs others' divine powers to recuperate.

359
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:57,460
I believe this is also why Mo Yuan is sleeping inside the body of the Western Sea's eldest prince.

360
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,330
- He's borrowing his divine power to recuperate.
- I wonder,

361
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,910
if the body of the eldest prince of the Western Sea can take it.

362
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,290
The body of the eldest prince of the Western Sea is just ordinary.

363
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:17,600
He has to use his divine energy to both maintain his own life, and also nurse Mo Yuan.

364
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,020
After a long period, his body will become weaker.

365
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,570
If Mo Yuan wants to wake up,

366
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,550
I fear he will still need another 7,000 or 8,000 years.

367
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:35,530
It's just that... why did Teacher choose the eldest prince?

368
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,760
Of course, Mo Yuan must have his reasons for choosing the eldest prince of the Western Sea.

369
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,350
I remember that when this eldest prince of the Western Sea was young,

370
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,620
he owed Mo Yuan a debt of gratitude.

371
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,210
He must be repaying his kindness now.

372
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,970
Moreover, the Second Prince of the Western Sea is your first senior brother.

373
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,150
Just regard it as the older brother repaying the debt of education for his younger brother.

374
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,560
Little girl, why are you crying?

375
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,420
Regarding this matter,

376
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,940
I have been thinking about it for 70,000 years.

377
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:31,140
I'm really afraid that it will be happiness that's in vain.

378
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,770
Earlier, you wanted to twirl some clouds on your finger and immediately rush to the Western Sea.

379
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,120
In the blink of an eye, why are you hesitating again?

380
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,230
After hearing what you said,

381
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,390
it's impossible for me to remain in Nine Heavens.

382
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:08,140
Even if Teacher is still not awake, I want to go and see him.

383
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:12,620
I fear that if you leave suddenly, you won't be able to explain to your future husband.

384
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:17,080
After all, I'm indebted to him for bringing me here to recuperate from my injuries.

385
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,410
If I don't bid him farewell, it seems like I'm petty.

386
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,960
But if I were to bid farewell to him...

387
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,370
Never mind.

388
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,310
Monarch Ye Hua, thank you for taking care of me for the past days.

389
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,970
Qian Qian, are you really going to leave me?

390
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,920
High Goddess left this letter and left.

391
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,210
Did she say anything else?

392
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,310
She didn't say anything.

393
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,710
I think there must be some urgent matters at her home.

394
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,280
Her eyes were red and swollen.

395
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,290
She left before even visiting Young Highness.

396
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,920
You can leave.

397
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,240
Didn't she just come?

398
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,070
Why did she suddenly leave again?

399
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,510
She needs to settle some matters at Green Hill.

400
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,970
There's no problem with your mood then?

401
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,150
I have been waiting here for ten minutes for you to help me with a tricky situation.

402
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:40,650
Third Uncle, what happened for you to say this?

403
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,020
It's your cousin.

404
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,350
Princess Zhi Yue is now at Father Monarch's hall making a ruckus.

405
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:50,120
She's crying and shouting that she wants to go to the mortal realm to experience the tribulations with the emperor.

406
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,570
You, Monarch Ye Hua, the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribes, are the only one who can manage her.

407
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,630
I've broken so many things, and you guys still won't punish me to the Mortal Realm?!

408
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,040
I heard this is worth a lot of money.

409
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,690
If I break it, you will punish me. Right?!

410
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,750
Princess! Princess, you must not break this!

411
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,840
If you break this, it will create a major disaster.

412
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,750
Let her break it.

413
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,440
Your Highness the Crown Prince. Third Highness.

414
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,260
Cousin.

415
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,900
Do you really want to see Emperor Dong Hua?

416
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,310
I haven't seen him for more than a month.

417
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,640
I want to see him.

418
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,110
I want to experience the tribulations with him, too.

419
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:49,580
Why can that Bai Fengjiu of Green Hill be with him and I can't?

420
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,960
I'm also a princess.

421
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,900
I'm also your, Crown Prince Ye Hua's, cousin.

422
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:00,250
Must you see him at all costs?

423
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,250
Yes. At all cost.

424
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,950
Break it then.

425
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,970
When you are done, I will punish you to the mortal realm for twenty years of tribulations.

426
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,150
Really?

427
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,770
Yes.

428
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,620
I told you to come here to persuade that brat.

429
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,000
Why did you let her break it?

430
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,290
She clearly knows that this request is impossible and she still wants to try at all costs.

431
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,700
There are only a few such people in Heaven.

432
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,650
Why shouldn't I fulfill her wish?

433
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,880
What's wrong with everyone today? Something's strange with the air.

434
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,630
Third Uncle. Third Uncle, I'm really going to the mortal realm for tribulations!

435
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:46,650
My dear lady, stop delaying.

436
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,910
Go and find your Emperor Dong Hua now.

437
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,750
Okay.

438
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,750
Young Highness, you can't delay any further.

439
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:05,210
Two years have passed, and the emperor treats you like a treasure.

440
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:08,560
He left his heart with you.

441
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,500
For the coming days, you must think of ways to break his heart.

442
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,680
Let his love tribulation go smoothly

443
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,440
so that you can return early to the Heavenly Palace.

444
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,620
Your Highness the Virtuous Consort.

445
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,880
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

446
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,280
Your Highness, why do you look anxious?

447
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,450
You don't seem very happy, either.

448
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:50,630
Ever since Teacher left, I keep thinking about her teachings.

449
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,470
When I took out this fan just now,

450
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,360
I kept thinking of her.

451
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,340
Teacher?

452
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,910
Are you referring to that Daoist nun?

453
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,550
The disciple that Aunt took in is really not bad.

454
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,320
He still thinks of her till now.

455
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,250
Can you let me take a look at your fan?

456
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,140
Okay.

457
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,540
Does Your Highness know the name of this fan?

458
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,640
Before Teacher departed, she only left this fan behind.

459
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,730
She didn't say anything else.

460
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,490
When your teacher was in the palace, she chatted with me, too.

461
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,500
She told me about the history of this fan.

462
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,750
Its name is Cloud-Breaking Fan.

463
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,720
Cloud-Breaking Fan?

464
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,530
Previously, when Shao Xin was a servant in the fox den at Green Hill,

465
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,420
Aunt gave her this fan to defend herself.

466
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,530
Although she has severed her relationship with Shao Xin,

467
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:52,980
Aunt still gave this fan to Shao Xin's biological son.

468
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,380
Seems like Aunt has already forgiven her in her heart.

469
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,600
She's really someone whose bark is worse than her bite.

470
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,040
This fan is a magical weapon.

471
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,710
Please keep this safe.

472
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,820
Magical weapon?

473
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,250
What are you doing?

474
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,690
I... My fan... fan...

475
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,820
- I...
- His Highness the Crown Prince didn't grasp his fan firmly.

476
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Didn't grasp his fan firmly?

477
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,250
How big can a fan be that he can't even grasp it firmly?

478
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,690
Why did you fall onto her?

479
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,310
This fan is a magical weapon.

480
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,870
When I was fanning it, it suddenly became many times bigger.

481
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,250
It scared me and I threw it away.

482
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,700
That's right. His Highness the Crown Prince was flustered and when I pulled him,

483
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,110
we accidentally tripped over this stool.

484
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,490
Shut up! Watch the both of them carefully.

485
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,180
I'm going to see His Majesty!

486
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,530
Shut up!

487
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:26,220
Your Majesty, I was telling the truth.

488
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,760
When some consorts and I were passing the garden just now,

489
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,450
I saw Virtuous Consort Chen and the crown prince embracing.

490
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:36,020
He argued and said the fan was a magical weapon.

491
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,640
When he was fanning the fan, it suddenly became many times bigger.

492
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:44,510
He even said that he didn't stand firmly and threw the fan away.

493
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:49,280
Virtuous Consort Chen then pulled His Highness the Crown Prince and fell down because of the stool.

494
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Your Majesty, you've seen the fan yourself.

495
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,900
What is so unique about it?

496
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,100
I'm telling you for the last time.

497
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:23,900
If anyone from the harem talks about this again, it's a death penalty.

498
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,580
It's the same for you.

499
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:31,630
If Virtuous Consort Chen didn't block that arrow for me, I would have died earlier.

500
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:37,530
Her love for me surpasses women like you in the harem who fights for favors!

501
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,650
Where's Virtuous Consort now?

502
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,200
She's at Sky Prison.

503
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,430
Troublemaker!

504
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,020
Father. Father, you must believe me.

505
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:08,010
I was falsely accused, Father.

506
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,060
I was falsely accused, Father.

507
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,760
I was falsely accused, Father.

508
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,460
As long as you admit adultery with the crown prince,

509
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,270
the blow to the emperor will be conceivable.

510
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:35,490
One is his only son whom he trusted for many years.

511
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:40,450
The other is his beloved and perfect consort. Amazing.

512
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,570
It's more excellent than in a play.

513
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,980
Based on your arrangement,

514
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,710
my aunt came here in vain.

515
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:53,010
The consort still committed adultery with Yuanzhen

516
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,860
and caused the father and son to be at odds with each other.

517
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:01,730
No matter how tormenting it is, it can't be more tormenting than the original fate.

518
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,750
Don't worry about Yuanzhen yet.

519
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,800
It's more important for the emperor to experience a love tribulation.

520
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,140
Greetings, Your Majesty.

521
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,720
Father, I was falsely accused.

522
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,340
I was really falsely accused.

523
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,940
- Open the lock.
- Yes.

524
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:35,760
Young Highness, you must not be softhearted; or else, once you go back to Nine Heavens,

525
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,700
the emperor will blame us.

526
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,100
Jiu'er, I'm taking you back.

527
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,440
I...

528
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,070
Say it. Say that you committed adultery with Yuanzhen.

529
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,820
Tell him now.

530
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:32,700
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

531
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,710
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

532
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:37,300
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

533
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:42,820
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

534
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:51,560
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

535
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,880
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

536
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,330
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

537
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:08,780
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

538
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:13,420
♫ All are just illusions ♫

539
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:20,360
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

540
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,500
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

541
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,070
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

542
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:36,290
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

543
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:41,620
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

544
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:46,770
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

545
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:49,520
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

546
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:58,990
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

547
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,820
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

548
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:16,300
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

549
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,710
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

550
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:26,940
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

551
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:32,230
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

552
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:37,630
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

553
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,340
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

554
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:49,450
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

555
00:44:51,090 --> 00:45:01,760
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
