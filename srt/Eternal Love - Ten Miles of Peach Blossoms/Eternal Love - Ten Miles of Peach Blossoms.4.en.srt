”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,550
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,050
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,680
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,220
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,440
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,300
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,780
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,420
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,920
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,540
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,970
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,530
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,020
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,590
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,080
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,650
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,080
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,980
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,790
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,330
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,780
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,110
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,820
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,630
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,910
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,040
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,740
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,900
[Episode 4]

31
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,250
But listen to me.

32
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,120
Ever since you left Grand Purple Palace,

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,070
and I was imprisoned by my father in the dungeon,

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,190
I've been thinking about you day and night.

35
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,930
That's when I knew my heart could never hold another person.

36
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,050
Although we're close, I don't have any feelings for you.

37
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,680
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,690
Ah Yin, listen to me.

39
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,710
I'm being serious.

40
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,210
I just want to be with you like we were in Grand Purple Palace,

41
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,580
drinking together, having fun, chatting about anything and everything.

42
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,350
But after all, you're the prince of the Winged Tribe.

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,040
Why don't you sleep in the guestroom tonight?

44
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,270
It's getting dark outside.

45
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,560
I'll see you off the mountain first thing tomorrow morning.

46
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,300
I didn't travel thousands of miles here just to hear those words.

47
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm sorry to disappoint Your Second Highness.

48
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,590
How dare you, Winged Tribesman, for coming into Kunlun Void!

49
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,200
Seventeenth, back off.

50
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,020
Are you trying to protect him?

51
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,590
Have you forgotten your identity?

52
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,500
Let's not mention how your father tormented my ninth junior brother.

53
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,550
Even today, you dared to come to Kunlun Void to bother Seventeenth.

54
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,940
I can't spare you!

55
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,710
You're Ah Yin's senior brother, so I won't fight with you.

56
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,460
So what if you do?

57
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,900
That day in Grand Purple Palace, my junior brothers suffered losses because their magic was suppressed.

58
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,330
Today, I'll show you the sword techniques of Kunlun Void!

59
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,810
Don't! Eldest Senior Brother, forget it.

60
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,500
If I don't teach him a lesson, he might come to Kunlun Void to bother you again.

61
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,880
Eldest Senior Brother!

62
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,740
Even you're protecting him?

63
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,060
Just let him go.

64
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,860
Why? Have you forgotten how his father humiliated you?

65
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,780
When we were in Grand Purple Palace, he took great care of us.

66
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,700
Moreover, if not because I need to apologize to Teacher for my sins, I would have committed suicide already.

67
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,190
On the day we left, if he hadn't protected Seventeenth, Seventeenth would have possibly been killed.

68
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,540
- Really?
- Yes.

69
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,180
Even if that's the case, he's the prince of the Winged Tribe.

70
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,130
Don't forget that his father abducted you.

71
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,520
Hurry and leave!

72
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,210
Ah Yin, wait for me. I'll be back.

73
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,640
Hurry and leave!

74
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,870
- Don't run!
- Eldest Senior Brother!
- Eldest Senior Brother!

75
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,430
- Zi Lan!
- Eldest Senior Brother.

76
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,480
- After him!
- Yes!

77
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,280
Eldest Senior Brother, spare him.

78
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,990
I don't care anymore!

79
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,620
Eldest Senior Brother.

80
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,700
I didn't catch him, but it looked like he's gone to that sealed cave.

81
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,900
That cave?

82
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,000
Eldest Senior Brother, should I keep chasing him?

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,420
No need.

84
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,430
Ninth Junior Brother knows right from wrong.

85
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,840
If he spoke up for Li Jing, it means he's not a bad person.

86
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,890
We just needed to chase him off.

87
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,230
Eldest Senior Brother, just from afar, that cave looks threatening.

88
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,040
Even Teacher told us to keep away from it.

89
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,430
What's inside there?

90
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,330
That cave is the place Lord of Lingbao borrowed from Teacher.

91
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,060
People say that a very demonic creature lives there.

92
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,160
If that Winged Prince is lucky, he'll be able to avoid it.

93
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,990
If he's not lucky, then it'll be his inexorable doom.

94
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,860
High Immortal Si Yin, why did you invite me to the foot of the mountain today?

95
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,820
I'm free today, so I wanted to take you for a walk.

96
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,260
I heard that Eldest Senior Brother had a fight today.

97
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,200
Yes.

98
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,400
I heard that that person is a prince.

99
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,290
Since you returned from the Winged Realm, you've been studying magic and Dao philosophy everyday.

100
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,360
Is it because the Winged Realm is really about to rebel?

101
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,230
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

102
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:20,600
In the past, when I lived in Qian Qian's den manor, I occasionally heard her talk about it.

103
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,780
She said that the current Winged Monarch has always wanted to rebel, so a big war is unavoidable.

104
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,830
That's true.

105
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,860
However, they wouldn't be able to win.

106
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,620
My teacher's battle formation can annihilate their entire tribe.

107
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,160
- Battle formation?
- Yes.

108
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,880
Who is that?

109
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,180
- Immortal!
- You little monster, where did you come from?

110
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,660
Don't you know that this is the Kunlun Void?

111
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,990
Immortal, hurry and follow me to save His Second Highness!

112
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,580
- Are you talking about Li Jing?
- Yes.

113
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,720
Let's go. I'll come with you.

114
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,930
High Immortal Si Yin!

115
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,120
Li Jing!

116
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,820
Li Jing! Hurry and get up.

117
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,190
Li Jing!

118
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,340
Your Highness! Your Highness, are you okay?

119
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,690
Have mercy!

120
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,350
Lord of Lingbao.

121
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,320
I'm surprised that you were promoted to a High Immortal this fast.

122
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,800
Your Highness.

123
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,670
It just happened a few days ago.

124
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,850
Are you here to look for Teacher?

125
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,470
Not really.

126
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,210
I've put on a seal on this phoenix.

127
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:26,610
Earlier, I sensed that something abnormal happened; hence, I came here to check.

128
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,650
Is this phoenix your carriage?

129
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,310
Not really.

130
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,650
The demonic character of this phoenix hasn't been eliminated yet.

131
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:39,160
I then tried borrowing the spiritual power under Kunlun Void to remove it.

132
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,770
I never thought that it would hurt you two instead.

133
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,250
High Immortal, can you just let me handle it?

134
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,750
Since this phoenix is yours, of course, you can.

135
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,720
This is the Cloud-Breaking Fan.

136
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,710
Although it can't compare to the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing, it's still quite useful.

137
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,290
Take this as my compensation for your injuries.

138
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,030
I can't accept it.

139
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,450
High Immortal, no need to be courteous. Just accept it.

140
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,480
Thank you, Lord.

141
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:24,090
High Immortal, please remember that the amount of power that this fan can produce is dependent on the power of its user.

142
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:30,100
Lord, don't worry. I surely won't let this fan end up in the hands of a powerful evil person.

143
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,830
I will take my leave then.

144
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,570
Your Highness!

145
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,120
Let's go.

146
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,160
- You're awake.
- Ah Yin.

147
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,440
It's good that you're awake. Recuperate first.

148
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,380
Thank you very much for blocking off that phoenix for me today.

149
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,590
What block?

150
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,010
It was actually useless.

151
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,840
I never thought that I would need your rescues twice today.

152
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,360
This is Kunlun Void.

153
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,350
You are the Second Prince of the Winged Realm.

154
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,250
Your power would surely be suppressed.

155
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,420
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

156
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,510
Ah Yin,

157
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,200
thank you for coming to see me.

158
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:59,720
After getting locked up by my father, although I shamelessly came to look for you,

159
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,280
I then remembered...

160
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,780
Even I myself look down on me.

161
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,780
You are the seventeenth disciple of Kunlun Void,

162
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,870
and also a high immortal respected by many in the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

163
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:17,850
What great fortune or capability do I have to make you see me again?

164
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,430
Stop thinking about these for now.

165
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,800
Anyway, that phoenix has been taken away.

166
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,220
Just recuperate here.

167
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,200
I'll go get you some more warm water.

168
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,290
Ah Yin!

169
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,910
What should I do if I want to see you again?

170
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:46,620
- See me?
- You should at least give me a way to enter Kunlun Void, right?

171
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,250
With this talisman, you can enter and exit Kunlun Void at ease.

172
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,220
Oh, right. No one in Kunlun Void knows that I'm a woman.

173
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,620
Hence, you must be careful not to be found by my senior brothers.

174
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,840
Xuan Nü, you came just in time.

175
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,690
Come with me. Look!

176
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,370
Your mother came to see you.

177
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,920
You unfilial daughter.

178
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,940
You actually came here to Kunlun Void without permission just to escape your marriage.

179
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,970
Come back with me. Don't bring embarrassment to your older sister here.

180
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,110
I won't go back! I won't marry that black bear sprite!

181
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,240
Do you think you're like your older sister?

182
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,950
She was a direct descendant. Of course, she can marry into the Bai Family of Green Hill, while I am just a concubine.

183
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you understand?

184
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,290
With you being this lofty, you will only harm yourself in the future!

185
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,580
Eldest Senior Brother! Please save me!

186
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,220
If I don't find a person that I love, I'd rather not marry!

187
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,180
Auntie, look at how strongly your daughter is opposed to this marriage.

188
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,760
Why not just forget it?

189
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,620
This Daoist Priest, I'm her mother.

190
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,730
Taking her back to get married is just right and reasonable.

191
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,920
Although you are Mo Yuan's disciple, a High Immortal highly revered in all realms,

192
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,140
it's still unreasonable for you to hinder me like this.

193
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,250
I...

194
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,160
If this marriage gets delayed,

195
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,210
- are you able to bear the responsibility?
- I...

196
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,770
May I ask what your identity is before coming up here in Kunlun Void?

197
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,690
- I...
- My Eldest Senior Brother came from a very influential background.

198
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,950
He's the second prince of the Western Sea.

199
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,720
Yes.

200
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,070
Is he engaged?

201
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,220
No.

202
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Then, seeing how you hindered me like that earlier, you must like my daughter.

203
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,750
- That's hard to say.
- Who knows?

204
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,210
You two stop your nonsense! Auntie, listen to me—

205
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,590
Auntie. Auntie, look.

206
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,480
Their relationship just started.

207
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,060
You mustn't directly burst the bubble.

208
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,290
- It's better to just let them figure it out by themselves.
- That's right.

209
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,750
My Eldest Senior Brother is after all a person with fame and reputation.

210
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,260
It's not good to directly ask him. Not good.

211
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,910
Once the two of them have confirmed their feelings,

212
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,110
are you still afraid that my Eldest Senior Brother won't go to your house to propose marriage?

213
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,100
Hence, in my opinion, just let Xuan Nü stay here for a while.

214
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,580
- By then...
- You'll naturally receive some good news.

215
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,780
That's right.

216
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,230
I'm at ease then.

217
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,830
- Auntie, take care.
- Auntie, take care.

218
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,070
Auntie, take care.

219
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,430
- Have you two fooled around enough?
- It was very urgent, Eldest Senior Brother.

220
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,510
That's right.

221
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,160
Xuan Nü, don't give it too much thought.

222
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,770
I have no special feelings towards you.

223
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,960
The two of them are just fooling around.

224
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,510
I didn't really put it to heart.

225
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,310
I'm apologizing on their behalf.

226
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,080
As the eldest disciple of Kunlun Void,

227
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,420
how could I think about marriage when I'm in the middle of cultivation?

228
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,380
Moreover, I would be returning to the Western Seas after my training here.

229
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,680
As the second prince of Western Sea, I, of course, must listen to the arrangements of my parents when it comes to marriage.

230
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,100
How could you two casually toy around with it?

231
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,960
It was just to solve an urgent problem, Eldest Senior Brother.

232
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,450
That's right. Stop being mad.

233
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,620
Of course, we know that you don't have any special desires towards Xuan Nü.

234
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,760
We also know that with your status, your marriage is to be bestowed.

235
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,080
Enough. You all go back for night lessons.

236
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,010
Yes.

237
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,440
"Ah Yin,

238
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,950
I only wish to make you smile.

239
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,240
Before leaving, I gift you this poem.

240
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,880
In this poem, I'm making two promises."

241
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,400
I gave him that talisman so he can say goodbye to me before leaving after his injuries heal.

242
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,770
How come he came up with this cheesy poem?

243
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:47,020
Ah Yin, is that from the second prince of the Winged Realm?

244
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,040
"Don't know when we will be deeply in love.

245
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,910
At this moment, it's hard—"

246
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,880
No fun.

247
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,660
Qian Qian, I'm so envious of you.

248
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,570
You were born with good looks.

249
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,250
If I had your face,

250
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,960
I'd be willing to only live a few hundred years.

251
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,750
You've been saying those words for a few hundred years.

252
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,710
I'm really envious of you!

253
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,340
I like your facial features and your face.

254
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,020
However, my parents gave me such an ugly face.

255
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,440
How are you ugly? I don't think so.

256
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,550
However, since you like my face, I'll give it to you.

257
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,610
- Give it to me?
- Yes.

258
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,570
Hey, Zhe Yan has a good skill that can change your looks.

259
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,180
I'll put in some good words for you to him,

260
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,340
- and ask him to teach it to you.
- Don't go back on your word.

261
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,540
Once I learn it, will I look just like you?

262
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,830
I think you can maintain it for a few hours.

263
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,630
What? I can only change my appearance occasionally?

264
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,400
Why do you want to constantly look like me?

265
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,050
Of all the Fox Tribesmen, you look the most similar to me.

266
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,800
Once you're grown up, you'll look even more like me.

267
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,570
It's just a measly spell. Don't take it too seriously.

268
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,780
Also, you can't use this spell to do bad things.

269
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,610
Karma and retribution. If you do bad, you'll be punished. Come with me!

270
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,180
How could I do bad?

271
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,110
Why?

272
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,240
We are the same,

273
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,120
but why do I have to marry a lowly bear sprite?

274
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,230
Ah Yin, my words today might be a bit dreary.

275
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,750
Can you understand me trying to completely indulge and get myself totally drunk?

276
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,170
Singing while drinking, still not enjoying despite forcing myself to be happy.

277
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,220
My clothes started to get loose, but I don't regret it.

278
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,150
Just for my love, I've gotten thin and haggard.

279
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,950
How is it dreary?

280
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,290
It clearly is very sad.

281
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,760
I'm going to my night class. Don't stop me.

282
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,360
Okay, I'll take it. Can you leave now?

283
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,610
Ah Yin, I'll see you in our next life.

284
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,180
He's going to commit suicide?

285
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,810
Li Jing!

286
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,540
Li Jing! Li Jing!

287
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,260
That weapon will only hurt him externally.

288
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,260
High Immortal, why don't you try to stimulate His Highness' heart?

289
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,700
Maybe then, he'll wake up.

290
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:03,100
Li Jing, if you can wake up, I'll agree to your request.

291
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,790
Once you've agreed, you can't go back on your word.

292
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,730
You liar!

293
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,480
What if I do break my word?

294
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,750
Then, I'll really die.

295
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,340
- Go, then. I'm leaving.
- Hey!

296
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:29,370
Ah Yin, I've been living for half a month in Kunlun Void,

297
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,730
and I've only seen you once.

298
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,060
I miss you so much my heart hurts.

299
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,590
Cut it out.

300
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,820
Let's not even talk about us.

301
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,610
How will you deal with those ladies in your inner palace?

302
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,480
Immediately remove them!

303
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,370
Really?

304
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:55,130
I, Li Jing, will only be with Ah Yin this lifetime.

305
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,160
If I break this promise, may I live my life alone, without any descendants.

306
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,380
Don't say that. Hurry and sit down.

307
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,090
Ah Yin, then... can you massage me?

308
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,970
It really hurts.

309
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,270
In the past, your fire qilin never spoke.
(Qilin is a specific type of the lin mythological family of one-horned beasts.)

310
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,980
Why did he suddenly start talking today?

311
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,310
He talked too much when he was younger,

312
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:25,720
so I told him to stop talking and pretend to be a mute.

313
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Oh. I noticed that he knows you very well.

314
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,860
I'm sure he helped you win over a lot of women in the past.

315
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,360
My bone! Oh, my bone!

316
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,920
Don't move.

317
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,800
Please don't move.

318
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,670
Why are you looking at me that way?

319
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,650
I really want to be with you.

320
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,510
You... What nonsense do you think about all day?

321
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,770
You're avoiding me again!

322
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,050
I won't talk with you anymore.

323
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,570
I'm a noble disciple of Kunlun Void.

324
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,990
How could I stand your constant sappiness?

325
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,160
- But...
- I won't talk with you anymore. I'm leaving now.

326
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,030
You can stay here alone.

327
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,040
Don't let my senior brothers see you.

328
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,630
Kunlun Void doesn't allow cloud-riding.

329
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,000
Don't come again in the future.

330
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,630
Nobody is willing to speak in detail about Teacher and the Donghuang Bell weapon.

331
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:23,560
Forget it. I'll wait until Teacher returns from his retreat.

332
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,300
Ah Yin, you're always disappearing after your morning classes. I can never find you.

333
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,630
Did you find a good place to spend your time?

334
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,470
There's no such thing.

335
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:40,190
I just go help Eldest Senior Brother feed those cranes.

336
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:45,370
I know. Just like Eldest Senior Brother, you've been avoiding me.

337
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,080
That's not what I... I'm trying to do.

338
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,570
If it's not, why are you lying to me?

339
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,690
Sixteenth Senior Brother has always been the one to feed the cranes.

340
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,040
He said that you were once bullied by those cranes, so you're scared of them.

341
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,300
Why would you voluntarily feed them, then?

342
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,410
I...

343
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,450
Forget it. I don't want to hear it.

344
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,040
Fine, then.

345
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,450
I just go to see a friend of mine.

346
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,410
Friend?

347
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,090
Is it the one who sent you the love letter?

348
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,630
That's not a love letter!

349
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,260
It's not a love letter.

350
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,550
Then, can you take me with you?

351
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,120
Take you with me?

352
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,840
Your friend is also my friend.

353
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,200
Of course, I also want to meet him.

354
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,670
He has a special identity.

355
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:45,740
I know that you don't trust me and you think that my lowly status would embarrass you.

356
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,780
Hey, fine. Let's not talk about it anymore.

357
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,960
Come with me then.

358
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,150
Ah Yin! Look.

359
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,630
This is a bamboo flute I made for you.

360
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,830
You're always making these little toys to flatter me.

361
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,510
In the past, you made those little animals.

362
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,360
Thank you.

363
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,680
Oh, right. She has a rather complicated relationship with me.

364
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,520
You can say that she's a distant cousin of mine.

365
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,400
She's from the Fox Tribe. Her name is Xuan Nü.

366
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,890
This is the second prince of the Winged Tribe, Li Jing.

367
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,130
Where did this young Si Yin come from?

368
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,820
I can't compare to Si Yin.

369
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,940
But you look and feel too similar to Si Yin!

370
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,260
If you don't have time in the future, you can have her come over so that I'm not bored.

371
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,810
You!

372
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,790
You just want someone to keep you company. You just don't want to be bored.

373
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,900
Of course not.

374
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,060
Will you be free these days?

375
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,620
That's not it. I just wanted to tell you that Teacher is about to leave his retreat,

376
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,350
so it'll be inconvenient for me to come down the mountain.

377
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,830
Will you go back to Grand Purple Palace to find amusement?

378
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,050
I definitely won't go back!

379
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,060
All the beauties in the palace have left.

380
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:18,820
In the future, I'll only wait for you at Kunlun Void.

381
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,350
You should take this back.

382
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,760
There are too many new things in my room.

383
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,490
My eldest senior brother is getting suspicious.

384
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,470
Okay then.

385
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,060
Did you know?

386
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,450
A while ago, my teacher blocked my heavenly tribulation for me.

387
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,650
He was severely injured.

388
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,590
I'm very worried about him.

389
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:50,120
Ah Yin, why nine out of ten sentences you say are about Mo Yuan when you are with me?

390
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,510
Really? Isn't it normal for us, teacher and disciple, to be close?

391
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,630
Ah Yin,

392
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,890
it's rare for you to come off the mountain,

393
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,670
but you bring someone with you

394
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,870
so that I can't properly talk to you.

395
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,150
Xuan Nü is watching.

396
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,390
Xuan Nü, are the cranes at the back of the mountain calling?

397
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,330
Yes, I think so.

398
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,230
I have an emergency. I have to go.

399
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,040
- You just got here. You're leaving already?
- Yes.

400
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,310
My senior brothers are very cautious nowadays.

401
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,410
If you're bored, you can walk around.

402
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,260
Walk around?

403
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,970
I'm afraid that if I see your senior brother, he'll beat me up again.

404
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,740
If you're scared, then walk carefully.

405
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,470
I can't talk anymore. I'll leave now.

406
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,470
Let's go, Xuan Nü.

407
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,310
- Eldest Senior Brother.
- Eldest Senior Brother.

408
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,290
You're being quite obedient today. You came back so early.

409
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,600
I heard the cranes calling, so I thought Teacher had returned from retreat.

410
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,670
It turns out Senior Brother Zi Lan was just playing with them out of boredom.

411
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:26,440
Don't worry. I'll be sure to relay your filial piety to Teacher.

412
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,460
That's not what I'm after.

413
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,650
I sincerely hope that Teacher can return from his retreat soon.

414
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,620
After all, if not for me, Teacher wouldn't be so injured.

415
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,630
Then, let's return to the main palace now.

416
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,370
It turns out that you abandoned me because you thought Mo Yuan was about to return.

417
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:52,500
Ah Yin, are you so impatient that you wait day and night to see him?

418
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,370
Xuan Nü?

419
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,660
Yes.

420
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,730
Why are you dressed like a man?

421
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,200
It's more convenient for me to leave the mountain like this.

422
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,050
Oh, that's true. The teacher and disciples at Kunlun Void are all men.

423
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,710
It's indeed inconvenient for a girl like you.

424
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:48,120
Earlier, I almost mistook you for Ah Yin.

425
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,230
Although Ah Yin and I look similar,

426
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,570
there is great difference in our social standings.

427
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,750
He's High God Mo Yuan's favorite disciple,

428
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:04,100
while I am the most insignificant immortal of Green Hill.

429
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,100
I'm sure you have your own charm.

430
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,200
Did Ah Yin ask you to come here?

431
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,150
No, I came specifically to come find Your Highness.

432
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:20,620
I wanted to ask you some questions face-to-face,

433
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,860
but I was afraid to make it awkward for Your Highness.

434
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,470
Just say it.

435
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,110
Are Your Highness and Si Yin in a relationship?

436
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,820
Although I have a hunch, I'm afraid to think too much about it.

437
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,420
But why is Your Highness waiting in Kunlun Void everyday?

438
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,130
Aren't you afraid the Winged Tribesmen will find out?

439
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:44,520
A relationship between the Heavenly and Winged Tribes is impossible.

440
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,430
Did Ah Yin tell you to say those words?

441
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:52,800
No! Don't misunderstand, Your Highness.

442
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:59,650
I have considered the questions you raised.

443
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,920
If Ah Yin wasn't from the Heavenly Tribe,

444
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,530
I would marry her and bring her into Grand Purple Palace no matter the cost.

445
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,080
However, as of today, I can only take it one step at a time.

446
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,830
I'm afraid to think too much.

447
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:19,090
If there's someone in his heart, I'm afraid it's High God Mo Yuan.

448
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,310
Stop talking.

449
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,860
Your Highness.

450
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,610
You're Si Yin?

451
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,440
Seventeenth, stop hiding.

452
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,990
Eldest Senior Brother.

453
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,640
Xuan Nü?

454
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,410
Why are you wearing Si Yin's clothes?

455
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,690
Earlier, I went for a walk at the foot of the mountain to clear my head.

456
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:55,880
I was afraid female clothes would attract too much attention and make people criticize Kunlun Void,

457
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,990
so I stole Si Yin's clothes.

458
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,960
You and Seventeenth look alike from the back.

459
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:10,750
Eldest Senior Brother, if you don't need anything, I'll leave now.

460
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,360
Go ahead.

461
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,520
[Good Tea]

462
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,570
[Gathering Teahouse]

463
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,140
Customer, here's your tea.

464
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,620
Does Your Highness come to the Mortal Realm often?

465
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,340
I frequently came in the past.

466
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:21,460
Your Highness said that you once dismissed many beauties in Grand Purple Palace for Ah Yin.

467
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:32,480
If my weight in Your Highness's heart can be half of Ah Yin's,

468
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,050
I would be satisified.

469
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,360
Xuan Nü, that night...

470
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,070
That night, I was just confused momentarily.

471
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:50,360
Doing such a thing is irresponsible to both her and you.

472
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:56,210
If Your Highness wants me to forget about it, then I will.

473
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,610
I'll pretend like it never happened.

474
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,230
Your Highness, stop blaming yourself.

475
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,330
I did it willingly.

476
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,960
Good.

477
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,640
Customer, upstairs please.

478
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,370
- Ah Yin!
- Young sir, who are you waiting for?

479
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,880
For you.

480
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
So frivolous.

481
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,560
You must have waited for 4 hours.

482
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,450
Earlier, my eldest senior brother held me back for something.

483
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,370
That's why I asked Xuan Nü sneak out first to keep you company.

484
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,460
Four hours are nothing.

485
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,290
We haven't seen each other in 10 days.

486
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,170
Has it been ten days already?

487
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,040
Exactly ten days.

488
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:45,640
Ah Yin, when will you finish your studies?

489
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:50,610
For a dabbler like me, at least 70,000 to 80,000 years.

490
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,650
Then...

491
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,130
It's because you want to stay by Mo Yuan's side, right?

492
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,870
Li Jing, what nonsense are you saying?

493
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,900
Did you hear someone gossiping?

494
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,180
Is it really just nonsense?

495
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,900
Who told you what exactly?

496
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,630
I'll head back first.

497
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,090
I just got here. Why are you leaving?

498
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,960
What's wrong with everyone?

499
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,590
Did you bully her?

500
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,730
I wouldn't dare to bully your friend.

501
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,300
For you.

502
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,140
You made this?

503
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,710
Thank you.

504
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,460
Have you been to the Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness before?

505
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,320
- Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness?
- Yes.

506
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,930
Whenever my senior brothers and I get a chance to play in the Mortal Realm, we'll go there.

507
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,720
That place is sparsely populated and has lots of animals. It's really interesting.

508
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,690
- Let's go together next time.
- Okay.

509
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,770
Let's go together next time.

510
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:23,300
What did you say? A great battle is near at hand, yet Li Jing is missing?

511
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,300
That's right.

512
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:31,930
I'm guessing he's probably... probably...

513
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,550
Say it.

514
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,430
I think he went to Kunlun Void.

515
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,320
- Kunlun Void?
- When Li Jing was in Grand Purple Palace,

516
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,960
he would have private meetings with that immortal called Si Yin.

517
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,070
With my understanding of him, I think he has left with that Heavenly Tribesman.

518
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:58,450
If that's true,

519
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:02,360
then he's no longer my son.

520
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,460
Your Highness, I don't understand.

521
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,770
You are of noble status.

522
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:17,770
Why would you spend your days in Kunlun Void, wasting your time away?

523
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,140
I don't understand, either.

524
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:30,500
Your Highness clearly knows that Ah Yin's favorite person is High God Mo Yuan.

525
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,400
Why would you keep tormenting yourself?

526
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,790
I know that you're still bothered by the fact that she's from the Heavenly Tribe.

527
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:02,400
I'm not from the Heavenly Tribe. I'm willing to follow Your Highness to the Winged Tribe.

528
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,140
Right.

529
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,440
You're right.

530
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:15,860
In the end, the Heavenly and Winged Tribes cannot be together.

531
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,050
Teacher has been in retreat for so long.

532
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,730
I wonder when he'll come back.

533
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,970
Fourth Brother, I've thought about it for a long time, and I decided that I need to tell you about something.

534
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:43,780
The second prince of Winged Tribe and I met as a coincidence, and we like each other.

535
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,500
Although it is prohibited for us to be together,

536
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,380
I have already set my heart on him.

537
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,900
But, as of today, our two tribes are at great odds with each other.

538
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,560
I'm afraid that the Winged Monarch will eventually declare war on the Heavenly Tribe.

539
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,750
He and I...

540
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,930
- Seventeenth.
- Eldest Senior Brother.

541
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:04,000
When I attacked Li Jing previously, you blamed me for going too hard.

542
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,090
I really regret not killing him.

543
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:10,130
Before he had a chance to abduct you, he first abducted Xuan Nü.

544
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,450
What did you just say?

545
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,790
Earlier, when I went off the mountain, I saw them strolling hand in hand.

546
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,690
They were acting so intimately.

547
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,340
It's quite strange, if I think about it.

548
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,590
Xuan Nü is an immortal, and Li Jing is a good-for-nothing.

549
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:24,910
How did they end up together?

550
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,770
Seventeenth!

551
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,540
High Immortal!

552
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,760
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

553
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,720
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

554
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,500
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

555
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,730
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

556
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:34,880
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

557
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,070
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

558
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:44,470
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

559
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:49,340
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

560
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:56,400
♫ All are just illusions ♫

561
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,430
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

562
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:08,660
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

563
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,090
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

564
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:19,330
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

565
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:24,750
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

566
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:30,000
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

567
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,800
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

568
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:40,770
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

569
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,880
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are
as sudden as a dream ♫

570
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:59,430
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

571
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:03,690
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories, ♫

572
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:10,070
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

573
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:15,260
♫ When will the cold ten miles
of peach blossoms bloom again? ♫

574
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:20,710
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

575
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,500
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

576
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:32,150
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

577
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:44,850
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
