”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,520
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,150
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,600
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,900
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,420
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,170
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,760
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,220
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,760
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,360
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,960
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,550
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,110
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,570
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,140
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,550
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,020
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,040
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,820
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,220
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,760
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,880
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,850
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,470
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,860
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,130
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,740
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Episode 17]

31
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,340
Emperor, who are you holding in your arms?

32
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,870
Can you not see what this is?

33
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,100
I've just never seen you so intimate with a woman.

34
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,280
It surprised me.

35
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,370
Isn't she the young empress of Green Hill?

36
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,310
She's a good woman. She's a good woman,

37
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,580
but Green Hill is not to be trifled with.

38
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,360
Emperor, my second brother and Ye Hua have been linked and repeatedly imposed on them.

39
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,140
You must think carefully. Being a son-in-law of Green Hill is difficult.

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,550
Did someone trick her into eating the Soul-Losing Fruit?

41
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,750
Go ask your woman.

42
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,570
Emperor.

43
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,850
Where does Fengjiu sleep?

44
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,920
Over there.

45
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,950
Dong Hua... Dong Hua.

46
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,020
Emperor.

47
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,160
Did you bring me back to my room yesterday?

48
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,710
Indeed.

49
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:37,270
Then, did you pour two bowls of sobering soup into my mouth yesterday?

50
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,640
No. It was three bowls.

51
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,580
Do you have any other questions?

52
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,950
If not, I need to go to my meeting.

53
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,410
Then, how should I pay you back for the sobering soup?

54
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,340
I don't mind you adding it onto the debt of me saving your life.

55
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,660
What?

56
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,860
- Why? You don't want to repay me?
- That's not it.

57
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,350
It's okay.

58
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,580
It's just a few bowls of sobering soup.

59
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,090
It's no big deal.

60
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,340
No, I must pay you back for the sobering soup.

61
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,540
I can't break the rules of Green Hill or embarrass my aunt.

62
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,680
It seems like your aunt taught you well.

63
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,640
Yes. She was always strict.

64
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,150
Even my parents said that I'm similar to my aunt when she was young.

65
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,950
Really?

66
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,830
You resemble your aunt the most?

67
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,950
When your aunt was young, she studied under Kunlun Void.

68
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,080
She's more overbearing than you.

69
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,200
With the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing, she was able to chase away eighteen high immortals.

70
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,540
I have never heard Aunt talking about that happening in Kunlun Void.

71
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:14,740
When you were in Heavenly Palace, did Si Ming tell you what kind of person I, Emperor Dong Hua, am?

72
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,780
You don't meddle with affairs of the secular world.

73
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,080
You only intervene if it involves the peace of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

74
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,360
You don't give anyone face. You don't attend banquets.

75
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,890
You are an immortal who's suitable for hanging on the wall.

76
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,990
Thus, don't worry that I know about your aunt.

77
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,150
I'm an immortal who rarely gossips with others.

78
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,520
Really? You really won't tell anyone that my aunt is High Immortal Si Yin?

79
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,450
Of course not.

80
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,540
That's Green Hill's biggest secret, and I accidentally overheard it.

81
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,830
Even Mo Yuan's...

82
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,720
Actually, Lord of Lingbao and I have some fate with your aunt.

83
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,720
When your aunt marries into Heavenly Place, I will discuss this in detail with her.

84
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,780
Didn't you promise me that you wouldn't tell outsiders?

85
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,230
Is your aunt an outsider?

86
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,780
No.

87
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,220
Then, I'll head to the meeting now.

88
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,670
Yes.

89
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,380
You are back. Go and get some firewood now.

90
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,580
What's wrong? Did the smoke get into your eyes?

91
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,970
Come.

92
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,660
Let me see.

93
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:29,470
Do you know you left for a year and nine months?

94
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,350
I know.

95
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:39,150
Aren't you afraid that I'll be old when you come back?

96
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,060
I was afraid.

97
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,100
Hence, I'm thinking of ways for us to be together for a long time.

98
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,850
Is it because your family dislikes me?

99
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:57,010
Or perhaps, you already have a wife at home?

100
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,820
I have never been married before you.

101
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:10,770
- Don't cry.
- I kept thinking what I should do if you already have a wife at home.

102
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,450
All right. It's all right.

103
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,980
How do you know how to make such a complicated dish?

104
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,330
If not, should I let you eat raw meat every day?

105
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,620
Why do you look disgusted?

106
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,070
As if someone had forced you to eat raw meat before.

107
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,690
That indeed had happened before.

108
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,740
Really? Who would be so boring to force you to eat raw meat?

109
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,360
Okay, let's get ready to eat.

110
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,840
Let's eat while it's hot.

111
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,170
I need to go away again.

112
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,370
You're going away again?

113
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,990
I'm leaving early tomorrow morning.

114
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,260
How long will you be gone this time?

115
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:37,960
One year? Two years? Or ten years?

116
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,060
Su Su.

117
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,220
Take me with you this time, okay?

118
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,250
I can't.

119
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,320
- Why not?
- This trip is extremely dangerous.

120
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,230
I can't take you.

121
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,560
I'm not afraid of danger. I'm not even afraid of mountains of swords or a sea of flames.

122
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,930
I'm just afraid of being away from you.

123
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,450
I never know where you are.

124
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,220
I don't know when you can come back.

125
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,600
I don't want to live like this anymore.

126
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,880
Ye Hua, what am I to you?

127
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,490
Am I your wife?

128
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,260
If I am, then it's natural for us to be together in good fortune and disaster.

129
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,690
Su Su, you don't understand.

130
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,300
I don't wish for you to be in danger.

131
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,960
You don't understand, either.

132
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,870
Even if I have to be in danger, I want to be together with you.

133
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,150
Pack your things tonight.

134
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,800
We'll leave early tomorrow morning.

135
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,110
- Really?
- Why? Are you regretting?

136
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,950
Why would I regret it? Where are you taking me?

137
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,170
You'll know when we get there.

138
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,510
Let's eat.

139
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,230
I have to go on a far away journey. I can't feed you anymore.

140
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,150
If we are fated, let's meet each other again in the future.

141
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,030
Su Su.

142
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,110
This fan is for you.

143
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,870
A fan?

144
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,520
What's wrong? Is something off?

145
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,590
This fan looks a lot like the one that I gave to someone.

146
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,480
Even the picture of the mountains on it is similar.

147
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,030
The Taoist priest said that this is Kunlun Void.

148
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:10,780
Lots of fans are similar and there are only a few pictures of mountains.

149
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,310
You're right but this is too similar.

150
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,050
Su Su, hide behind the tree.

151
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,260
What's wrong?

152
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,210
- Those two young men are rather good-looking.
- Yea!

153
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,060
Capture them and give them to our chieftain.

154
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,370
Hide!

155
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,430
Teacher?!

156
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,220
Ye Hua!

157
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,680
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

158
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,310
What about you?

159
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,350
Seventeenth?

160
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,290
No. She is clearly a woman.

161
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,070
- Are you hurt?
- No.
 - She's also a mortal.

162
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,090
How could I be mistaken?

163
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,870
But if she's not Seventeenth, why does she have Teacher's fan?

164
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,780
And although this man looks like Teacher,

165
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,410
he doesn't have the same divine aura as Teacher.

166
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,450
Who is he exactly?

167
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,290
Who are these two exactly?

168
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,510
Where are you two from?

169
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,670
Wait for me here.

170
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,290
Can I speak to you in private?

171
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,060
Okay.

172
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,240
Are you Die Feng, the second son of the Western Sea Water Monarch?

173
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,750
I am. And you are?

174
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,130
- I am Crown Prince Ye Hua.
- Crown Prince—

175
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,200
I'm under the order of Heavenly Monarch to do an inspection of Long Sea as a civilian.

176
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,220
I don't want anyone to know my identity, including that young sir.

177
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,430
I understand.

178
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,950
I wonder what your reason is for inspecting Long Sea.

179
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,870
- The Merpeople Tribe.
- Is it really about the Merpeople Tribe?

180
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,760
I just knew that it was time for Heavenly Palace to make a move.

181
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,560
I wonder how you knew my identity.

182
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,340
I heard from the chieftains of several branches of Heavenly Tribe that

183
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,960
you have been helping the Water Monarch of Long Sea to ward off the Merpeople Tribe for these few thousands of years.

184
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,690
Also, judging by the way you looked at me, I knew that you had mistaken me for your teacher, High God Mo Yuan.

185
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,330
Your Highness, you are very observant.

186
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,040
I admire you.

187
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:54,140
I wonder whether you know where the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing came from.

188
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,590
This fan dropped into the mortal realm and ended up in Winged Monarch Li Jing's hands.

189
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,520
Seeing that it was the magical weapon of Kunlun Void, I asked him to return it.

190
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,220
Li Jing?

191
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,970
Your Highness, please go back with me to Long Sea to talk about this more in details.

192
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,560
No need to call me "Your Highness."

193
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,740
Just call me "Hua Ye."

194
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,300
Dear guests, this is the Crystal Palace of Long Sea.

195
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:26,070
After we cross this section, we will leave the mortal realm and enter the immortal realm.

196
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,080
Ye Hua,

197
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,930
the both of you had a long and serious conversation.

198
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,120
What did you talk about?

199
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,980
I just asked him if he could see whether this fan was a counterfeit.

200
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,750
Lest I lose face in front of my wife.

201
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,360
I don't believe you.

202
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,400
The both of you were talking for a long time just about this?

203
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,300
What do you think we were talking about then?

204
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:59,040
Look at him. The way he's dressed, he must be a prominent person.

205
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,360
Did he think you were formidable and wanted to recruit you as a general?

206
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,870
In the future, you should watch fewer operas.

207
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,120
Was my guess wrong?

208
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,250
I'm a mortal. How could I be that highly regarded by a High Immortal?

209
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,650
He's a High Immortal?

210
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,970
Young Sir, you should know, a day in the immortal realm is a year in the mortal realm.

211
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:27,110
Once you enter the sea, every day here is a year in the mortal realm.

212
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,270
I saw this in the operas.

213
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,180
Isn't a few months for you, a lifetime for us?

214
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,470
So what if we can live for a long time?

215
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,920
For 70,000 years, I have been looking for someone and still can't find him.

216
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,450
Isn't this a waste of my life?

217
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,860
Are you looking for your family member?

218
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,730
He's not a family member.

219
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,790
He's more than that.

220
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,040
Let's go.

221
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,170
Eldest Brother.

222
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,980
Yan Zhi.

223
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,710
Eldest Brother, I made the arrangement to send you to a secluded place.

224
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,330
Second Older Brother will never be able to find you.

225
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,130
Why do I need to escape from him?!

226
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,050
Second Older Brother has been the winged monarch for 70,000 years. His position is stable.

227
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,020
Moreover, Father's trusted aides are no longer around.

228
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,030
Eldest Brother, find a place to be safe first.

229
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,950
The gems that I saved over the years are enough to allow you to live lavishly for a lifetime.

230
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,770
Go away!

231
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,920
Eldest Brother, you...

232
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,340
Yan Zhi.

233
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,380
Come, Yan Zhi.

234
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,690
Are you all right?

235
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,710
It's all my fault.

236
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:21,020
The past 70,000 years, how I suffered in prison is unimaginable to you.

237
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,020
Thus, now that I'm out, my mood hasn't been stable. I lost control.

238
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,050
I understand.

239
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,090
Yan Zhi, it's good that you understand.

240
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:40,550
Yan Zhi, I will never let Li Jing off.

241
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,020
- Eldest Brother.
- All right.

242
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,200
I won't talk about what you don't want to hear.

243
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,140
Eldest Prince. Your Highness Princess.

244
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,230
Everything has been arranged. We can leave for Long Sea now.

245
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,400
Long Sea?

246
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,600
That's right.

247
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,680
The Merpeople Tribe of Long Sea is my mother's tribe.

248
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,560
From the look of it, they are the only one we can rely on.

249
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,220
- But Eldest Brother...
- Yan Zhi,

250
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,460
I merely want to find a safe place to live.

251
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:25,510
You should know very well that Li Jing and I have a grudge over the killing of our mothers.

252
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,610
He will find out sooner or later that I have escaped.

253
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,270
By then, he will definitely dispatch soldiers to go after and kill me.

254
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:41,420
Looking at it now, only my mother's tribe can protect me. Isn't that right?

255
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,810
You and Second Older Brother are equally important to me.

256
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:50,280
I really don't want to see the both of you fight each other to the death.

257
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,250
Eldest Brother, do you understand?

258
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,740
I do.

259
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,790
I understand.

260
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,100
Golden Lion!

261
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,480
Your Highness.

262
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,400
They are my trusted aids for many years.

263
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,170
Why did you kill them?

264
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,500
Your Highness, our trip is highly secretive.

265
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,280
If anyone of them leaks the information,

266
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,640
you will live,

267
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,410
but Eldest Prince and I will die terrible deaths.

268
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,000
They grew up with me.

269
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,300
How could they possibly betray me?

270
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,100
Yan Zhi,

271
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,230
in this world, there are no trusted aides.

272
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,850
In the past,

273
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,480
my trusted aides caused me to lose my throne at Winged Tribe,

274
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,840
and was locked up in prison for 70,000 years!

275
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,890
Okay.

276
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,680
Let's not talk about this.

277
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,260
Let's leave.

278
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,180
Ye Hua, are we in the Crystal Palace now?

279
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,250
Yes.

280
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,560
Why are you so calm?

281
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,990
How should I act then?

282
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,980
That's true. You are a mortal who's cultivating.

283
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,710
You must have seen this in your dream.

284
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,280
Yes, I have seen this in the past.

285
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,910
- Uncle.
- You have worked hard, Nephew.

286
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,740
You need to dash all over the place because of Long Sea. I'm very sorry about this.

287
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,380
Uncle, no need to be so formal.

288
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,940
Four Seas is a family. Don't be such a stranger.

289
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,690
By the way, these are my friends.

290
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,820
Without informing you, I brought them to Long Sea. Uncle, please do not be angry.

291
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,200
No problem. No problem.

292
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,990
As long as they are your friends, they are important guests to me, too.

293
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,610
Come. Come, let's go in now.

294
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,280
Let's go in.

295
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,620
Su Su, I'm going to talk to Die Feng.

296
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,550
If you're tired, sleep here.

297
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,080
If you want to walk around, remember to bring along your copper mirror.

298
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,780
Why must I bring it along?

299
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm afraid you will lose your way.

300
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,060
All right.

301
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,080
Princess, don't be sad.

302
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,170
This One-Leaf Fan is a precious gift from Water Monarch.

303
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:01,190
If you continue crying, it will defile such a precious item.

304
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:06,200
Even more so, Water Monarch said that he would only send one princess to marry the chieftain of the Merpeople Tribe.

305
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,130
It may not be you.

306
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,070
Isn't there also Eldest Princess?

307
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,210
Eldest Princess is very meticulous.

308
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,870
How can I fight with her?

309
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:19,930
Perhaps, she's talking to Father now to let me have the marriage alliance with them.

310
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,870
The chieftains of the Merpeople Tribe look very ferocious.

311
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,040
If I were to marry into...

312
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,890
Why don't you listen to Water Monarch and marry His First Highness of the Western Sea, then?

313
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,180
But... His First Highness is always sick.

314
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,320
How about marrying His Second Highness then?

315
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,380
Objectively, His Second Highness is not bad.

316
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,600
He was also the first disciple of High God Mo Yuan,

317
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,290
but...

318
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,280
Princess, are you still thinking about marrying into Heavenly Palace?

319
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,590
You haven't even met that Crown Prince before.

320
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,540
How can you be so infatuated?

321
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,040
The Crown Prince's fame and reputation have spread far and wide.

322
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,560
He's the disciple of Spiritual Master Ci Hang, the only one with double cultivation in the whole Four Seas and Eight Wilderness.

323
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,850
He's also the last disciple of Primeval Lord of Heaven in High Clear Plane of the highest Heavenly Realm.

324
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,920
That's right. I even heard that when he was born,

325
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,680
golden lights shined for 36 days,

326
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,500
and 72 colored birds from Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness

327
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,890
flew and danced around Heavenly Palace for 81 days.

328
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,130
I already memorized this.

329
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,050
Who's there?

330
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,520
What? Is it that fun to eavesdrop on others?

331
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,870
What that princess said was very interesting.

332
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,290
Sit down. I will tell you.

333
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,870
She doesn't want to marry the chieftain of the Merpeople Tribe.

334
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,920
She also thought she should marry His Second Highness, Die Feng.

335
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,320
But she couldn't stop thinking about the Crown Prince of Heaven.

336
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,270
Isn't that interesting?

337
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,520
The problem is that the three of them are not interested in her.

338
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,130
Is that so?

339
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:15,000
Especially when she talked about the Crown Prince, she talked a long time about him.

340
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,800
Tell me. Is the Crown Prince of Heavenly Tribe that famous?

341
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,940
There's only one crown prince of the entire Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

342
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,210
Wouldn't he be famous?

343
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,170
That's right, too.

344
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,590
This princess of Long Sea is also a princess.

345
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:33,570
She hasn't even met him and she thinks a lot about him.

346
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:38,480
It means that the Crown Prince of Heavenly Tribe is very likable.

347
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,360
What's wrong?

348
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,710
Are you also interested?

349
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,230
Are you jealous?

350
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,430
Of course not.

351
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,230
It's just that compared to that Crown Prince, I have nothing at all.

352
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,360
I fear you will suffer.

353
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,980
I already told you that I won't turn back on you.

354
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,670
Thank you, Wife, for not turning back on me.

355
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,840
This place is very nice.

356
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,660
It's a pity there's only the odor of the sea.

357
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,960
There are no fragrant flowers.

358
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,760
I really want to smell peach blossoms.

359
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:28,310
I know of a place where there is an abundance of peach blossoms year-round.

360
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,770
Where?

361
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,710
Close your eyes. I'll take you there.

362
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,530
You may open your eyes.

363
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,670
Is this an illusion?

364
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,140
No.

365
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,280
Then, where are we?

366
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,930
Green Hill. Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms.

367
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,180
Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms?

368
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,320
- This forest is ten miles long?
- That's right.

369
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:09,070
Someone took a very long time to plant these peach blossoms trees.

370
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,610
In any case, he had nothing to do, either.

371
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,850
All day long, he would take care of the peach blossoms and concoct peach blossom wine.

372
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,590
He lived that comfortably?

373
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,600
Are you envious?

374
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,900
What is there to envy?

375
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,570
When we were in Junji Mountain, didn't we live this way, too?

376
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,570
I didn't have anything to do daily. I hunted and cooked.

377
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,210
I reared creatures that could walk and fly.

378
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,710
Isn't that so?

379
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,540
That's right. Let's not envy others.

380
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,130
Is the person here your friend?

381
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,250
I have only met him a few times.

382
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,810
I see.

383
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,350
Is he here?

384
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:58,520
It doesn't seem so. I don't sense his divine aura.

385
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,350
I only brought you here because he's not around.

386
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,830
Do you not have a good relationship with him?

387
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,380
It's not that. I admire him very much.

388
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,850
It's just that, for a reason, it's not convenient to see him now.

389
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:35,850
♫ My countenance when I met you ♫

390
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:42,120
♫ Was as cool breeze and bright moon in this seemingly familiar mundane world ♫

391
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,490
♫ I look around for your lingering to like the stranded time ♫

392
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,940
♫ It’s a reunion but also as we first met ♫

393
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,400
This Peach Blossom wine is very tasty.

394
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,240
I seem to have drunk this before.

395
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,020
I didn't think you could drink wines.

396
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,160
I didn't think so, either.

397
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:05,980
But Ye Hua, is it appropriate to take his wine like this?

398
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:11,120
It's not a problem. Anyway, I probably won't see him in the future.

399
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,600
You are not coming here to look for your friend again?

400
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,360
I won't.

401
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:25,020
I won't be able to see this Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms again, either.

402
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,080
Someday, I will plant a plot for you.

403
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,610
I want ten miles, too.

404
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:43,180
♫ Counting years and months only to see your face when the flower blossoms ♫

405
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:49,030
♫ Even if we miss out on each other over and over again ♫

406
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:54,790
♫ I foresaw all of your joy and sadness ♫

407
00:32:54,790 --> 00:33:00,730
♫ Three thousand flowers just to remember you ♫

408
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:06,620
♫ Counting years and months only to see your face when the flower blossoms ♫

409
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:12,440
♫ Even if we miss out on each other over and over again ♫

410
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:18,310
♫ I foresaw all of your joy and sadness ♫

411
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:25,330
♫ Three thousand flowers just to remember you ♫

412
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,480
Your Highness, you must be in a good mood. You didn't come back for the whole night.

413
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,790
She's reluctant to leave.

414
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:49,610
When I saw you hugging her in there, I can tell that she's a woman.

415
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,840
That's right.

416
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,450
Your Highness, don't worry. I'm not a busybody.

417
00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:01,540
I merely want to remind you that war is coming, and especially that lady is a mortal.

418
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,370
It's better that you send her away.

419
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,620
I'm thinking of this, too.

420
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:11,160
For her safety, I don't wish anyone to know of her existence.

421
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:16,660
In order to thank you for personally coming here to help Long Sea out from our difficulties, I will keep my mouth shut.

422
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,430
Thank you.

423
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,230
Talking about the war between Long Sea and Merpeople Tribe,

424
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,930
my uncle really doesn't want to go to war.

425
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,400
He doesn't want to have a complete fall out with the Merpeople Tribe.

426
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,960
You have been here for thousands of years. You know the situation well.

427
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,370
Is there a way to make him decide soon?

428
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,320
There is.

429
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,280
Princess, stop hesitating.

430
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,620
His Second Highness of Western Sea doesn't have any concubines.

431
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,100
If you marry him, you will be the main consort.

432
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:57,580
Moreover, I heard that His First Highness of Western Sea has been sick for a long time.

433
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,990
In the future, the position of Western Sea Water Monarch will belong to His Second Highness, Die Feng.

434
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:05,570
He only knows how to wield a sword and fight with the Merpeople Tribe.

435
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:11,130
To add further, I have known him for thousands of years, but he hasn't fallen for me.

436
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,500
How can it be possible that in a few days...

437
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,640
Princess, look at this. This is the secret formula that I stole from the Eldest Princess for you.

438
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,130
I especially used morning dew to concoct a fresh leaf toner.

439
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,690
Take this and try it for a few days.

440
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,120
Princess, stop hesitating.

441
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,180
As long as a woman invests in her efforts, nothing is impossible.

442
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:39,320
Princess, look. His Second Highness is here.

443
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,110
Older Brother Die Feng.

444
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,670
This is?

445
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,600
This is my friend.

446
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,370
Friend?

447
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,260
He probably has a name, right?

448
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,130
Hua Ye.

449
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,670
What a nice name.

450
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:20,140
It's just like the name of His Highness, the Crown Prince, in Nine Heavens.

451
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:25,660
I believe someone with such a nice name must be wise and outstanding.

452
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,650
Father Monarch is planning to have the wedding on the third of next month.

453
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,650
That urgent?

454
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,740
It's indeed urgent.

455
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,000
Perhaps, he fears there would be an accident with this wedding.

456
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,480
Accident?

457
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,720
Perhaps, Bai Qian of Green Hill fears that her second fiancé is going to get stolen again.

458
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,790
Hence, she's in a hurry to marry.

459
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,930
What a pity.

460
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,090
My aunt is the most beautiful woman in Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

461
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,630
What's there to be afraid of?

462
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,900
Moreover, this marriage is decided by the elders of both families.

463
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,020
She might not even like her fiancé.

464
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,640
Why would she be afraid that he will be snatched by someone else?

465
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,940
Emperor, try this. This nut is very tasty.

466
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,920
Si Ming said that I must attend to you properly.

467
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,120
Your Young Highness, you helped me.

468
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,830
I was close to losing this round, but it's good now.

469
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,030
Emperor.

470
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,550
Has Green Hill responded to having the wedding on the third of next month?

471
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,950
There's still no reply.

472
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,530
I see.

473
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,250
This Heavenly Monarch first informed the Four Seas

474
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:25,040
that Young Fifth had achieved great merit by sealing Qing Cang

475
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,590
and also took this opportunity to mention the marriage again.

476
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,310
But Young Fifth's whereabouts are still unknown.

477
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,330
What should I reply?

478
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,340
We don't know where Qian Qian is now.

479
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,630
Who cares about the marriage?

480
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:43,260
Why don't we just withdraw the marriage?

481
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,360
We can't.

482
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,650
You and I personally set this marriage.

483
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:54,090
If we withdraw the marriage without any reasons,

484
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,690
we will definitely be criticized.

485
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,950
That's right. Young Fifth's marriage was already withdrawn once because of His Second Highness.

486
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:04,590
If we withdraw the marriage with the Crown Prince, no one else will dare to marry her.

487
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:07,590
Even if we have good intentions, we will offend the Heavenly Tribe.

488
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,560
Wouldn't this only hinder Young Fifth?

489
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,640
But they want to complete the marriage by the third of next month.

490
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,230
How are we going to find Young Fifth to complete the marriage?

491
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,950
Why don't we do this?

492
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:21,460
Everyone knows that Young Fifth used her power to seal Qing Cang.

493
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:25,510
Let's say that Young Fifth was injured and is recuperating in seclusion.

494
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,370
We will use this to delay the marriage.

495
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,430
This idea is not bad.

496
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:37,990
We can do that, but we can't keep delaying the marriage.

497
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,120
When I transcended into a High God, I was also in a deep sleep for a thousand years.

498
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:56,200
As long as Young Fifth is still alive, no matter where she is, we will eventually find her.

499
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:09,870
Ye Hua, that princess has kept following us from Crystal Palace to here.

500
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,920
She wouldn't follow us into the bedroom at night, right?

501
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,320
It's finally your turn to be jealous.

502
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,900
There are many wounded soldiers in there. It's not convenient for a woman to go in there.

503
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,650
Stay out here and wait for me.

504
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,660
Young Sir, is Young Sir Hua Ye married?

505
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:45,150
From what I know, he already has a wife.

506
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,260
What kind of person is she then?

507
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,230
She's a mortal.

508
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,570
A mortal?

509
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,640
If I marry him, he won't be a mortal anymore.

510
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,530
Marry him?

511
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,950
That's right. If I transfer my magic to him, he can become an immortal.

512
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,880
This is very possible.

513
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,410
It's just that if I marry him,

514
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:14,350
as a princess, I must be the main consort.

515
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:18,250
He will have to divorce his mortal wife, then.

516
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:24,220
Do all mortals have to be disposed of this way?

517
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,170
No. Young Sir, don't misunderstand.

518
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,370
I'm not looking down on mortals.

519
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,450
It's just that immortals are different.

520
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,240
If he wants to marry me, he must become an immortal.

521
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,720
If he becomes an immortal, he can't be together with a mortal because these are our rules.

522
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:45,820
That will depend on whether he wants to become an immortal.

523
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,000
Why would a mortal not want to become an immortal?

524
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:21,490
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

525
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,490
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

526
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:26,150
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

527
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:31,480
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

528
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:40,690
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

529
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,820
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

530
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:50,240
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

531
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:57,550
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

532
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:02,120
♫ All are just illusions ♫

533
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:09,170
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

534
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:14,340
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

535
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,850
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

536
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:24,990
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

537
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:30,590
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

538
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:35,690
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

539
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,500
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

540
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:46,680
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

541
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,590
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

542
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:05,210
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

543
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:09,430
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

544
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:15,720
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

545
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:21,000
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

546
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,400
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

547
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,200
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

548
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:38,030
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

549
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:50,860
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
