”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,570
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,110
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,660
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,110
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,410
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,240
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,750
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,240
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,920
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,350
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,240
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,480
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,070
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,610
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,060
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,590
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,140
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,030
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,810
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,210
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,820
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,980
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,880
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,480
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,830
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,100
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,650
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:13,030
[Episode 43]

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,190
Say it. Say that you committed adultery with Yuanzhen.

32
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,980
Tell him now.

33
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,180
- I...
- You don't need to say anything else.

34
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,200
I trust you and Yuanzhen.

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,610
Your Majesty... The Crown Prince and I...

36
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,460
His Highness the Crown Prince and I...

37
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,920
Don't blame me.

38
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,260
I know that the battles of the harem have hurt you.

39
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,160
If you want to blame anyone,

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:11,770
blame me for having so many concubines before I met you and bore children.

41
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,570
Otherwise, I would only want to be with you.

42
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,900
I'm the one who's in the wrong.

43
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,100
I know that to the people and ministers in the imperial court,

44
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,390
I'm the evil witch who enchanted you.

45
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,150
I caused Your Majesty to be called a muddleheaded leader.

46
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,880
Leave these words for the later generations.

47
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,020
I'm not afraid, and I have no regrets.

48
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,730
Look at how I draw my eye makeup.

49
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,850
Do I look old?

50
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:27,280
Young Highness, old age, illness, resentment, love, separation and refusal.

51
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,590
The six hardships of life, not one can be lacking.

52
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:35,480
If the emperor finds out that I changed his mortal fate in order to help you,

53
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,500
we will commit a great sin.

54
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,690
But I can't bear to do it.

55
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,220
I can't bear to let him suffer this hardship.

56
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,210
It's not up to you.

57
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,370
Young Highness, this is fate.

58
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,310
Your Majesty, there have long been rumors in the palace that Virtuous Consort Chen is not loyal to you.

59
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,430
I did whatever it took to suppress this rumor.

60
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,830
You can choose not to believe me,

61
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,750
but today, several consorts and concubines saw them lying on the ground in the garden.

62
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,500
They even lied about the fan.

63
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,840
Your Majesty, I'm begging you.

64
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,510
Don't fall for their deception anymore.

65
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:40,070
You've been wearing this copper bell since we were together.

66
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,480
A very important person gifted this to me.

67
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,750
Your Majesty, the crown prince's heart disease suddenly acted up at the Soup Pond.

68
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,650
What?

69
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,470
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

70
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,640
Virtuous... Virtuous Consort?

71
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,150
What a coincident.

72
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:03,020
What do you mean? If my father sees this, we will both be beheaded.

73
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,580
Little Xiangzi! Little Xiangzi!

74
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,420
Fa... Father...

75
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,820
Jiu'er,

76
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,060
do you have anything to say to me?

77
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,650
I have nothing to say.

78
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,620
I order you to go back to the palace now.

79
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,040
What happened tonight, other than the three of us,

80
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,640
no one must know about it.

81
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,550
No one must even mention it.

82
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,250
Father!

83
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,210
- Your Majesty!
- Father!

84
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,400
Your Majesty!

85
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,800
Someone! Take this slut away!

86
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,930
She's not fit... She's not fit to remain here.

87
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,010
Your Majesty,

88
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,530
you have never believed me.

89
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:22,210
Using the excuse that she saved your life twice, this woman has done so many despicable things in the palace.

90
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,670
Your Majesty.

91
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,740
- Let's go.
- Your Majesty.

92
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,260
Your Majesty.

93
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,920
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

94
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,690
Your Majesty, you must believe me!

95
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,610
- I didn't do anything to betray you, Your Majesty!
- Let's go.

96
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,050
- Your Majesty, I was also in a difficult position!
- Let's go!

97
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,690
Your Majesty, I was also in a difficult position!

98
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,150
Your Majesty, you must believe me!

99
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,670
Young Highness.

100
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,620
Young Highness.

101
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,340
You only need to remember that the human emperor is the heavenly emperor.

102
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,910
Once he dies in the mortal realm after eighteen more years,

103
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,670
he will return to his original place and become the emperor again.

104
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,810
Young Highness, why bother?

105
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,410
Si Ming, you don't understand.

106
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,450
The emperor is my husband only in the mortal realm.

107
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,830
Once he returns to Heavenly Palace,

108
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,090
he won't treat me so well again.

109
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,210
Tell me.

110
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,910
Will he still remember what he said to me in the mortal realm?

111
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,650
And the things he did for me?

112
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,990
The emperor came to the mortal realm to experience the six hardships of life.

113
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,240
How could he forget this?

114
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,010
That's right, too.

115
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,960
But even if he remembers,

116
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,720
the relationship between the both of you will never change.

117
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,360
These short twenty years in the mortal realm is just a flick of a finger to the emperor.

118
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,010
Listen to my words.

119
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,660
Treat it as just a tribulation.

120
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,670
All the fate in this mortal world should end in the mortal world.

121
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,380
The fate in the mortal world,

122
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,620
should end in the mortal world.

123
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,470
God, stop joking.

124
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,440
This is the Young Highness of Green Hill.

125
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,760
Don't touch her worldly thoughts.

126
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,210
What's wrong with you?

127
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm fine.

128
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,570
You still haven't given it to me.

129
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,420
I forgot.

130
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,110
Mourning bell for the emperor?

131
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,970
Your Majesty.

132
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,760
This is not right.

133
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,990
Based on the Book of Fate, the emperor doesn't die like this.

134
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:52,420
Could he have been badly hurt by the love tribulation and suffered from extreme heartbreak?

135
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,710
What?

136
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,910
He's dead?

137
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,080
Seems like the emperor's love tribulation in the mortal realm has ended.

138
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,410
I'm going back to Nine Heavens.

139
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,510
Si Ming! Si Ming!

140
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,920
Si Ming, will I be able to see the emperor again?

141
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,760
Si Ming...

142
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,460
Si Ming...

143
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:05,420
You must promise me, no matter what, you must not forget these two years.

144
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,010
This flower is very pretty.

145
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,710
I don't know why, but every time I see this flower on your forehead,

146
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,080
I feel that we have met in the past.

147
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,920
I'll make up this ritual to you.

148
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,270
According to folklore customs, I will marry you again.

♫ We once missed out in regret ♫

150
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,770
♫ Peach blossoms drift down ♫

151
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,320
♫ The light fragrant hiding the bitter anguish ♫

152
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,250
No one will dare to give you a hard time in this palace again.

153
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:47,050
♫ It brings up the loneliness in my eyes ♫

154
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:53,400
♫ My unwillingness to leave you has been drowned by vicissitudes of life ♫

155
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,300
♫ Three thousand years have flown by ♫

156
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,250
♫ My heart is driven to distraction ♫

157
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:07,070
♫ Bleak yearning, my heart has shattered beyond repair ♫

158
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,580
♫ I cannot cut apart our entanglements ♫

159
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,730
♫ The harder I try to forget, the more it is engraved ♫

160
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,060
♫ I’ve forgotten and become drunk  ♫

00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,250
♫ I thought I could let go ♫

162
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:30,820
♫ But after I awake from my dream, I remember you and my tears flow ♫

163
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,300
Your Majesty.

164
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,910
It can't be.

165
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,880
I just came down here.

166
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,290
Greetings, Emperor.

167
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,520
You came really fast.

168
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,810
It is my fault that you returned earlier than planned.

169
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,370
Of course, I need to rush here to seek forgiveness.

170
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,400
It was set at sixty years.

171
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,050
Why did I return eighteen years earlier?

172
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,250
How could there have been a mistake in this?

173
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,860
There usually aren't any big mistakes in the fates of the mortals.

174
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,400
Perhaps, because you are a distinguished immortal, your destiny can't be controlled.

175
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,140
Or perhaps...

176
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,210
Speak.

177
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,590
Or perhaps, the six hardships in the mortal realm are too tough.

178
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:12,800
Are you trying to say that my love tribulation with Bai Fengjiu of Green Hill was too hard?

179
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,290
I wouldn't dare.

180
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:25,630
I just returned to my immortal identity, and everyone in Nine Heavens is rushing here.

181
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,490
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

182
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,480
Emperor Dong Hua.

183
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,950
Your Highness the Crown Prince, this way, please.

184
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,910
No need.

185
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,980
I only have two questions.

186
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,840
Ask them.

187
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,450
To transfer cultivation between immortals, do they need the Mythical Mushroom?

188
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,080
Yes.

189
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,210
Emperor, have you ever fought with the four immortal beasts of Yingzhou in the Eastern Sea?

190
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,220
I have never fought with them.

191
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:04,030
But in order to obtain the Mystical Mushroom to save Bai Qian's life by transferring cultivation,

192
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,720
the Fox Emperor Bai Zhi of Green Hill had fought with the four beasts three hundred years ago.

193
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,730
Although he obtained the Mystical Mushroom, he was also severely wounded.

194
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:17,150
In Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses, very few are on an equal level with the Fox Emperor in cultivation.

195
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,040
I'm one of them.

196
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,510
Perhaps, you can give it a try, too.

197
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,950
Thank you, Emperor. I'm taking my leave.

198
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,920
Are you asking this because of Mo Yuan?

199
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,280
Emperor, how did you know?

200
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,210
Not only do I know that you are asking this because of Mo Yuan,

201
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:47,450
I also know that Bai Qian of Green Hill was the seventeenth disciple at Kulun Void, Si Yin.

202
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,190
Heavenly Tribe has been looking for High God Mo Yuan for 70,000 plus years.

203
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,180
You already knew about this.

204
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,640
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

205
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,900
The battle in Ruoshui was most vicious.

206
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,470
I believe you've heard about it, too.

207
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:14,790
But no matter how vicious a battle was, after 70,000 years, the impact has diminished.

208
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:23,230
The deepest impression it left to me was when High Immortal Si Yin carried Mo Yuan's profusely bleeding body

209
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:29,060
and sat at Ruoshui River, screaming and crying miserably in pain.

210
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,790
At that time, I didn't experience what that emotion was.

211
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,820
Naturally, I couldn't understand the significance of High Immortal Si Yin's actions.

212
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:49,460
I only felt that, as a disciple of Kunlun Void, she didn't cultivate enough and was troublesome.

213
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:55,410
Later, I heard that Si Yin and Mo Yuan's divine body disappeared.

214
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,240
I thought it was a laughing matter.

215
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,300
I thought that this disciple of Kunlun Void was too obsessed with life and death

216
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,410
and didn't act like a cultivating immortal.

217
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:11,180
But today, to my surprise, I am starting to understand.

218
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:17,300
It seems like experiencing tribulations in the mortal realm has its rewards.

219
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,870
Emperor, what did you understand?

220
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:28,060
Mo Yuan is already dead. So what if they prayed to him or not?

221
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,400
His favorite disciple was Si Yin.

222
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,140
After his death, he was buried in Si Yin's hometown and was with Si Yin daily.

223
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,260
It's better than being buried in the Sea of Innocence.

224
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,270
Isn't that so?

225
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,630
I'm not High God Mo Yuan.

226
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,270
Of course, I wouldn't know his thoughts.

227
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,450
I have something else to settle.

228
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,250
I'm taking my leave first.

229
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,220
Father, why did you take out the Soul-Gathering Lamp again?

230
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,410
Didn't you say that if this lamp is burning, Mother would come back?

231
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:45,390
Now that Mother is back, what's the use of this lamp?

232
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,670
I'm going to send this lamp to another place.

233
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,250
Someone is waiting to use this.

234
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,910
Father, hurry and go.

235
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,690
That person who needs this lamp must be waiting anxiously for it.

236
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,090
Father, once you have delivered the lamp, can we go and visit Mother?

237
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,960
Ah Li, your mother is the monarchess of Green Hill.

238
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,290
She has many important tasks to handle.

239
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:13,110
She can't be with you every day in Heaven.

240
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,440
I understand.

241
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,950
It's just that I miss her very much.

242
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,610
Of the four water monarchs of Eastern, Northern, Southern and Western Seas,

243
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,400
I have the least impression of the Water Monarch of the Western Sea.

244
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,810
When I was chatting with eldest senior brother,

245
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,420
he said that since his grandfather,

246
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,480
the two most recent generations of Water Monarchs
have kept very low profiles,

247
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,450
causing the Western Sea tribe to have no sense of existence among the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

248
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:59,700
The low profile Water Monarch of the Western Sea did something very high profile because of his eldest son.

249
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,110
Wasn't his son sick for six hundred years?

250
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,160
When his son is sick, he needs to invite a physician to treat him.

251
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,390
What else can he do?

252
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:14,010
In order to cure his son, the Monarch of the Western Sea posted notices everywhere six hundred years ago.

253
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,430
Water Monarch, we are taking our leave first.

254
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,080
- General Hai.
- Water Monarch.

255
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,450
Send someone immediately to put up notices.

256
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,350
Tell everyone that whoever can cure my son's illness will be rewarded heavily

257
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,300
Tell everyone that whoever can cure my son's illness will be rewarded heavily

258
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,840
Yes.

259
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,810
Eldest Prince!

260
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,220
Your Majesty Monarchess. Your Majesty Monarchess.

261
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,540
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

262
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,590
Quickly post this notice in Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

263
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:36,010
[Notice on Seeking Physician to Cure Eldest Prince]

264
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,180
Why did you get involved?

265
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,950
Some time ago, your fourth older brother accidentally heard your eldest senior brother talk about this.

266
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,440
He naturally thought of me and wanted me to help him.

267
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,970
No wonder. Because of Eldest Senior Brother, Fourth Older Brother asked you for help.

268
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,650
What did you think?

269
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,490
If it weren't for you, would I have come here?

270
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,930
In the midst of it, technically Eldest Senior Brother helped Teacher find you.

271
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:15,680
If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have found Teacher's soul so easily.

272
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,900
In the midst of it, destiny prevailed.

273
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,390
If we want Mo Yuan's body and soul to be restored without any hitches,

274
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:26,740
we need to take good care of Die Yong's body.

275
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,370
In the following days, it will be tough for you.

276
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,940
This is what I should do.

277
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,880
It's not tough.

278
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,280
When you said that you would bring an immortal,

279
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,250
I didn't expect her to arrive so soon.

280
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,820
This immortal specializes in taking care of Eldest Prince's illness.

281
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,150
When I'm not here, she will tend to him.

282
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,590
- I will have to trouble you then.
- It's okay.

283
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,600
This way, please.

284
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,560
Dear High God and High Goddess,

285
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,770
ahead of us is Fuying Hall where my son is staying.

286
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,850
It's not appropriate.

287
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,830
Immortal Envoy, what's not appropriate?

288
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,880
Could it be that my son's illness...

289
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,380
Water Monarch, I just thought of something extremely urgent.

290
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,240
Please tell me.

291
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:54,110
I just thought that recuperation needs peace and quiet.

292
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,430
Can you establish a new rule?

293
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:00,730
Starting from tomorrow, including you, please don't come near this place.

294
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,820
Fine.

295
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,840
Wife, go back to the palace first.

296
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,120
I will bring these two high gods to the hall by myself.

297
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,680
The both of you, this way, please.

298
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,050
- What's wrong?
- I'm afraid to bump into Eldest Senior Brother.

299
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,080
Water Monarch of the Western Sea!

300
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,610
Huh?

301
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:29,320
Where is the second prince right now?

302
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:34,460
There was a letter from Kulun Void yesterday, saying that Die Feng had arrived there.

303
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,450
He won't be back for a few days.

304
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,750
This way, please.

305
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,770
He won't be back.

306
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,670
Even if he returns, Mo Yuan is about to wake up soon,

307
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,710
so you shouldn't be scared of running into your senior.

308
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,640
Let's talk later.

309
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,920
This way, please.

310
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,800
You are anxious to see Mo Yuan but you are afraid to see him, too.

311
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,630
Go now. You have waited for 70,000 years.

312
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:30,550
Immortal, this is my eldest son, Die Yong.

313
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,960
Die Yong,

314
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:47,350
this immortal that's full of propitious vapors standing in front of you is the best disciple of High God Zhe Yan.

315
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:57,130
From today, your grave illness that couldn't be cured for hundreds of years will be taken care of by this Immortal.

316
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,530
Thank you, Immortal.

317
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,980
This pulse is neither real or imaginary.

318
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,570
It's neither sluggish nor strong, light nor deep.

319
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:18,750
Just like what Zhe Yan said, it's a normal pulse.

320
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:24,500
Immortal, my son's illness...

321
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,440
Water Monarch, kindly wait outside for me.

322
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,190
I'm going to use a spell to probe Eldest Prince's illness.

323
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,650
This spell needs quiet.

324
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,740
Yes.

325
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,970
Teacher.

326
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:59,750
Earlier, I heard Zhe Yan say that you were here.

327
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,900
I finally found you.

328
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,220
I came late, Teacher.

329
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,750
Why are you crying?

330
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,370
Could it be that I can't be cured?

331
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,720
Even if I can't be cured, you shouldn't be sad and cry.

332
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,760
Stop crying. I won't blame you if you can't cure me.

333
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,350
I'm merely happy.

334
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,070
I thought it was because you were kindhearted.

335
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,890
It turns out that you're happy to see me suffer.

336
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,700
I'm not that happy, either.

337
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,620
Eldest Prince, you should rest.

338
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,320
Zhe Yan was right.

339
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,440
If we just rely on Die Yong's unhealthy body,

340
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,810
Teacher will need 7,000 or 8,000 years of recuperation before he can wake up.

341
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:44,240
But if I can borrow the Soul-Gathering Lamp from the Heavenly Tribe

342
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,630
and transfer half of my 40,000 years of cultivation to him,

343
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,640
it may help Teacher to wake up sooner.

344
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:56,010
Seems like I still need to return to Nine Heavens and personally meet Heavenly Monarch.

345
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,210
Where is High God Zhe Yan?

346
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,410
High God Zhe Yan said that he had some important tasks to settle.

347
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,910
He would like you to remain at the Western Sea.

348
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,740
He will be back tomorrow.

349
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,560
Where's your Water Monarch?

350
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,060
He has a distinguished guest. He has gone to the Grand Hall to receive him.

351
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,510
If it's a small errand, you can instruct me instead.

352
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,170
Let's go to the Grand Hall. Take me to see Water Monarch.

353
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,580
As for the rest of you, stay here to take care of Eldest Prince.

354
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,040
Yes.

355
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,220
Immortal, please come with me.

356
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,390
Immortal, this way, please.

357
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,920
You didn't raise Ah Li.

358
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,060
That's why you have always regarded him as your stepson.

359
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,190
If he were your biological son,

360
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,030
would you still say this?

361
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:18,490
♫ That teardrop of parting still burns my chest ♫

362
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,000
♫ Our love is circulating between the heavens and the earth ♫

363
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,420
♫ Who is the reason for my heart’s bustle? ♫

364
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,020
♫ Four seas and eight wildernesses, but where do I belong? ♫

365
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,930
Ye Hua.

366
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,510
♫  How should I settle my fleeting years?  ♫

367
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:36,220
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

368
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,560
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫
- Ye—

369
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,460
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

370
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,670
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

371
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,210
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

372
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:55,040
Was this scar... from when you saved Mo Yuan?

373
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:00,690
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

374
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:05,330
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

375
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,780
Bai Qian,

376
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,340
in your heart,

377
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,870
do I have a small place in it?

378
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,540
You waited for him for 70,000 years.

379
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,320
Now that he's back,

380
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:44,870
of course, there's no one else in your heart now.

381
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,970
It was my fantasy.

382
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,430
Are you talking about my teacher?

383
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,760
Whether he's back or not, it has nothing to do with you.

384
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:15,480
Also, regarding Teacher, only I, Fourth Brother and Zhe Yan know about this.

385
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,790
How did you know about this?

386
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,010
It was Zhe Yan who told me.

387
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:29,510
I also know that to help him wake up sooner, you need the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

388
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,580
Tell me.

389
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:38,410
After getting the Soul-Gathering Lamp, what do you plan to do?

390
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:47,680
I will go to Yingzhou to get the Mystical Mushroom

391
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,850
and then refine my cultivation into a pill and give it to Die Yong.

392
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,900
and then refine my cultivation into a pill and give it to Die Yong.

393
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,350
In less than three months, my teacher will be able to wake up.

394
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,080
Are you crazy?

395
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:07,450
Do you think with your power, you can obtain the Mystical Mushroom that easily?

396
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:12,110
No matter what, I must get that Mystical Mushroom.

397
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,870
I know that...

398
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:20,730
the four beasts guarding the Mystical Mushroom are extremely ferocious.

399
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,760
That year, even when my father went there,

400
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,010
he was badly scarred and wounded.

401
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,660
Even so, do you still want to go?

402
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,160
Of course, I must go.

403
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:42,670
Because of him, don't you even want your life?

404
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,420
Ye Hua,

405
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,730
you are here at the right time.

406
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,450
I have something to tell you.

407
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:02,460
Why don't we cancel our engagement?

408
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,520
What did you say?

409
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:20,450
I already heard that the post of the Heavenly Monarch will be passed down to you.

410
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,310
I also know that to take over the Heavenly Monarch and Monarchess positions,

411
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:30,260
we must receive 81 uncultivated fires and nine heavenly strikes of lightning.

412
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,740
Originally, I wanted to receive them together with you,

413
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,300
but I need to pass my cultivation to my teacher,

414
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,840
so I may not be able to withstand this uncultivated fire with you.

415
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:55,130
Frankly, at that time, there wasn't any connection between us.

416
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:01,480
Because Sang Ji committed a mistake and caused Green Hill to lose its reputation,

417
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,740
Heavenly Monarch was afraid that things would turn out awkward for both sides,

418
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:09,190
so he granted this engagement between us.

419
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:14,410
Now, I'm the one who's canceling this engagement.

420
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:19,180
We don't need to clear up what exactly happened in the past.

421
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,010
I understand.

422
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,830
Come to my room tonight.

423
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,610
The Soul-Gathering Lamp is with me, not in the Heavenly Palace.

424
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:46,760
So, this was really just my fantasy.

425
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,080
But...

426
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,140
how much do I owe you?

427
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,620
And how much do you owe me?

428
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,550
I'm afraid it's already become a mess and can't be cleared up.

429
