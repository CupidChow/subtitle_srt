”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,590
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,020
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,680
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,150
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,360
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,160
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,780
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,290
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,870
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,350
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,890
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,450
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,040
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,490
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,120
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,470
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,010
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,980
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,720
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,210
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,850
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,990
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,760
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,450
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,850
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,030
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,810
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,510
[Episode 12]

31
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,900
My ancestors passed this down to me.

32
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,200
It has been passed down to me from many generations.

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,160
The drawing on it is the divine mountain, Kunlun Void.

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,230
This fan is a divine magical weapon, the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing.

35
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,990
Kunlun Fan of Yuqing?

36
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,380
Miss, what else do you have to say?

37
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,820
Come, come, Sir. Take a look.

38
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,950
Check to see if I'm telling the truth.

39
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,710
- It's definitely a precious fan. Taoist Priest, you are telling the truth.
- That's right.

40
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,860
I merely wanted to take back my ancestor's heirloom.

41
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't want to pester you, miss.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,520
You should leave now.

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,430
The fan doesn't belong to you.

44
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,830
There are so many people watching here.

45
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,140
Don't tell me I'm distorting the truth and falsely accusing you?

46
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,670
It's obvious that I picked this up from Junji Mountain.

47
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,730
Jun... Junji Mountain?

48
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,960
Isn't it a barren mountain that no one has gone to for a long time?
- That's right.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,540
Her words are becoming more absurd.

50
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,200
- Return the fan to me.
- Return to you?

51
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,930
You should be glad I didn't take you to the magistrate!

52
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,590
Taoist Priest, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

53
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,140
Who are you?

54
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,900
This fan belongs to a friend of mine.

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,260
It's not your ancestor's treasure.

56
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,860
Hence, I'd rather believe what this lady said.

57
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,000
Nonsense!

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,770
I would like to ask you something.

59
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,800
Do you know how to use this fan?

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,770
Since this... this is a precious fan, how can it be used randomly?

61
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,390
Okay. Taoist Priest, are you afraid now?

62
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,840
You two... You're colluding!

63
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,860
This fan is a magical weapon which can summon the wind and rain.

64
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,000
What's wrong?

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,270
Taoist Priest, do you have anything else to say?

66
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,510
My friend can't tolerate unreasonable and unfair matters.

67
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,250
If he finds out that a lousy Taoist Priest took his weapon,

68
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,420
I fear he will throw you into a godforsaken place,

69
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,660
where you can't see the mortal scenery ever again.

70
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,900
Forgive me for my ignorance! Forgive me for my ignorance!

71
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,650
- Forgive me for my ignorance!
- Fraudster! Rotten Taoist Priest!

72
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,460
- Come, let's have tea.
- It's too disappointing.

73
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,460
Miss, please take care of this fan.

74
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,130
Stop waving this in front of others.

75
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,080
This fan is really a magical weapon.

76
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,480
It might bring lots of troubles.

77
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Really?

78
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,640
When I looked at you just now, I thought I was looking at my friend.

79
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,870
A pity he's a man and you are a woman.

80
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,980
Do I resemble a man?

81
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,460
Merely in spirit.

82
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,110
Miss, farewell.

83
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,670
- Miss?
- Princess, Her Highness.

84
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,270
Since this fan belonged to your friend, why don't you have it?

85
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,380
Give it to me?

86
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,180
Didn't you say this fan is a magical weapon?

87
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,870
I only found this anyway.

88
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,580
If I keep it, I don't know how to use it, either.

89
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,730
Since this fan is meaningful to you, why don't you have it?

90
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,610
Thank you for helping me just now.

91
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,910
When that Taoist Priest wanted to snatch it from you, you were unwilling to let it go.

92
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,580
And now...

93
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,200
He wanted to snatch it from me. Naturally, I wouldn't give it to him.

94
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,410
But I'll give it to you out of my heart.

95
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,060
This... How should I thank you?

96
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,300
No need to thank me. Just accept it.

97
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,630
This is not a good idea.

98
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,220
Miss, no need to be formal with me.

99
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,210
If you're uneasy to accept this, can you give something to me?

100
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,470
Fine, tell me.

101
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,300
Don't you even ask what I want yet you agree so easily?

102
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,660
What if I wanted a priceless treasure?

103
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,700
You don't look like that kind of person.

104
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,560
Even if you wanted it, I would satisfy you.

105
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,070
I don't value those materialistic items.

106
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,550
Miss, then, what you want is...?

107
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,790
What I want is very simple.

108
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,720
Come with me.

109
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,710
Why does Her Highness know this mortal?

110
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,230
Why did you sleep from the mountains until now?

111
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,730
Hey.

112
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,960
It's only the ninth month.

113
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,900
Are you hibernating already?

114
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,250
Crown Prince, Your Highness, I already fixed it for you.

115
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,250
It's just that I discovered

116
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,760
the injury on your hand is not from the Red Lotus Fire,

117
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,410
but because of the flesh-decaying herbs only found in Eastern Wilderness.

118
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,810
It's... I accidentally touched it.

119
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,460
You may leave now.

120
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,460
Yes.

121
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,060
Just now, I mentioned Su Jin's marriage.

122
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,640
Do you have anything to say?

123
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,790
No.

124
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,210
Okay, then let's talk about proper business now.

125
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,410
I've helped you read all the imperial memorials for today.

126
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,150
The merpeople of Long Sea have always been a problem for Father Monarch.

127
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,710
They just mentioned this again.

128
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,810
The Water Monarch of Long Sea is a coward and isn't good in commanding an army.

129
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,470
I fear you will need to personally take troops there to suppress their disorder.

130
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,140
I'd anticipated this.

131
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,190
I'm already prepared to lead the troops.

132
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,180
Not bad. The chieftain of the Merpeople Tribe is a confidante of Qing Cang,

133
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,040
and he's against the governance of the current Winged Monarch Li Jing.

134
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,360
If not removed earlier, he will cause a disaster.

135
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,280
Furthermore, Li Yuan's mother is from this tribe.

136
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,590
Fortunately, Heavenly Monarch listened to Emperor Dong Hua's words of supporting Li Jing to ascend to the throne.

137
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,950
If we had let Li Yuan succeed to the throne, we'd be in a bigger mess right now.

138
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,300
Even if Li Yuan had taken over the throne that year, it will still be the same.

139
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,820
The two sons of Qing Cang are not suited to rule.

140
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,400
Naturally, they can't be compared to you.

141
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,610
You were already the crown prince at birth and you have never disappointed us.

142
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,790
How dare you!

143
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,010
We need the right timing to deal with the Merpeople Tribe.

144
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,960
It's better to let Long Sea's Water Monarch request for some military support from us.

145
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,790
We will then be able to justify sending out our troops.

146
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,280
The Four Seas are fiefdoms.

147
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,100
They all have their own Water Monarchs.

148
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,930
If we send out our troop rashly,

149
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,910
it will make the princes think that we want to take back their fiefs.

150
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,420
We need a good reason.

151
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,960
Third Uncle, your view is similar to mine.

152
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,820
That means, we've come to a consensus on the Merpeople Tribe issue.

153
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,680
I only helped to represent you for a day in court

154
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,050
and this was the only important problem I came across, but it's still so tiring.

155
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,440
Let's talk about personal matters.

156
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,400
It's about your personal matter.

157
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,860
What is it?

158
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,720
Your engagement with Bai Qian of Green Hill.

159
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,260
Heavenly Monarch at the temple just now

160
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,970
ordered Eldest Brother and the divine officials to discuss the etiquette for meeting the family of the bride.

161
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,230
She's the only daughter of the Fox Emperor after all.

162
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,380
We can't be sloppy.

163
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,250
The engagement was only recently discussed.

164
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,240
What's the urgency?

165
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,970
I don't know why Father Monarch is impatient, either.

166
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,620
I fear it's because of the issue regarding your Second Uncle.

167
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,630
He fears if there are changes again, he will offend Green Hill.

168
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,840
- Where are you going?
- To find Star Monarch Si Ming and ask him about something.

169
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,940
Hey, Cousin.

170
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,430
Why is he in such a hurry?

171
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,810
Because Su Jin is going to be a heavenly consort and he's going to snatch her away from Heavenly Monarch?

172
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,400
You dare to say that?

173
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,540
You're becoming more and more outrageous.

174
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,380
Third Highness.

175
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,670
Su Jin.

176
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,260
I heard Heavenly Monarch is in a hurry to confer you as his consort.

177
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,710
I'm afraid in a few days, you won't need to bow to me again.

178
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,800
There are countless consorts in Heavenly Palace.

179
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,610
Even if I get married, I still have to greet you.

180
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,180
Sister Su Jin, why did you come just now?

181
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,620
Cousin just left.

182
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,860
Are you really going to be a heavenly consort?

183
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,900
You're the descendant of a meritorious subject and Heavenly Monarch treats you so well.

184
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,830
As long as you say no, he will definitely not force you.

185
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:07,230
I'm not being forced. I'm willing to do it.

186
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,410
Didn't you always like my cousin?

187
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,760
You cannot say those words again. Do you understand?

188
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,800
Okay, I know.

189
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,130
I came to look at Crown Prince's wound originally.

190
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,440
Since the Crown Prince has left, I'm taking my leave then.

191
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,630
Go then.

192
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,560
Anyway, Emperor is the only one I'm interested in.

193
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,880
In the future, no one can force me to marry someone else.

194
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,820
You, stop thinking about the Emperor.

195
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,360
You can like anyone in Nine Heavens.

196
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,540
Your cousin, Ye Hua, can also help you with it.

197
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,080
Only Emperor Dong Hua is an absolute no.

198
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,600
No is no. Why did you have to add "absolute?" Are you trying to scare me?

199
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,640
You don't understand, and there's no need to understand.

200
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,440
Anyway, you need to remember my words.

201
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,080
Don't even think about Emperor Dong Hua.

202
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:18,080
Even if you have thousands of tender feelings for him, you won't get any response.

203
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,380
He's not a piece of rock.

204
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,800
I'm nice to him.

205
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,480
How could he not know?

206
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,030
He really is a stone.

207
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,350
Have you seen the historical records of Heavenly Tribe?

208
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,830
No one knows where he emerged from.

209
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,410
Even Father God doesn't know where he originated from.

210
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,190
Hence, he could really have crawled out from a rock.

211
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,600
You're just trying to scare me.

212
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,170
I get it now.

213
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,440
You are just afraid that if I really marry Emperor, based on seniority,

214
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,760
you will have to bow to me.

215
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,920
Ye Hua's cousin.

216
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,540
I'm scared of you.

217
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,190
I'm really scared of you.

218
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:09,110
Did you say that High God Mo Yuan and High Immortal Si Yin's bodies disappeared together?

219
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,840
That's right. That year in Kunlun Void, the remaining disciples searched frantically for them.

220
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,110
But there were no results.

221
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,750
So, people are guessing that

222
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,300
High God Mo Yuan and High Immortal Si Yin's relationship was more than that of a teacher and disciple,

223
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,020
but they didn't want to bear the identity of teacher and disciple,

224
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,350
so he used the war with Winged Tribe to feign his death to elope as lovers.

225
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,480
I can't believe such a ridiculous thing could exist.

226
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:39,130
Because it's so ridiculous, Emperor made up the words "the Pair went into seclusion"

227
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:43,740
and asked somebody to write it into the records to stop the masses from talking.

228
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,130
Based on what you said, the Kunlun Fan of Yuqing is High Immortal Si Yin's magical weapon.

229
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,500
How can it be left in the mortal realm?

230
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,390
Si Yin's disappearance has always been a pending question of Heavenly Tribe.

231
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,690
If Your Highness has questions, I fear no one can explain it.

232
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:05,460
Even the High Immortals at Kunlun Void can't make any sense out of this.

233
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,490
Perhaps, during the great war, Si Yin dropped the fan onto the mortal realm.

234
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,400
It might be possible.

235
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,860
Your Highness, is there something suspicious about the person who has that fan?

236
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,800
She's just an ordinary mortal, nothing unique.

237
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,490
You can leave now.

238
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,190
Yes.

239
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,930
Hey.

240
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,700
You have slept for seven to eight days. Won't you wake up?

241
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,950
It's not even winter yet. How come you're hibernating?

242
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,390
You are awake.

243
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,370
I thought you were going to sleep until next spring.

244
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,570
Look at this blanket. Does it look nice?

245
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,490
I was waiting to show it to you when you were awake.

246
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,350
It's too bright colored.

247
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:06,050
Let me tell you. Although it's bright colored, I just like this red color.

248
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,470
You see, I usually wear plain clothes every day. Isn't it good to change it up?

249
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,480
Although you're not beautiful, your taste in clothing isn't too bad.

250
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,040
Compared to other girls wearing bright colors, these plain clothes are really beautiful.

251
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,610
What happened to your silk fan?

252
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,300
When I was not here, what happened?

253
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,170
Do you know? Although it's only September, so it's not very cold yet,

254
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,950
- I heard that snakes hibernate because they are afraid of cold.
- Hey!

255
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,320
Stop taking off your clothes.

256
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,050
- You are an unmarried lady and undressing in front of me.
- Fortunately, there was a nice lady who gave me this bed quilt.

257
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,500
- Where's your decency?
- Fortunately, there was a nice lady who gave me this bed quilt.

258
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,920
Fortunately, there was a nice lady who gave me this bed quilt.

259
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,880
If we cover ourselves, we won't be cold.

260
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,370
Come here.

261
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,800
♫ I whirl between sleeping and waking ♫

262
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,730
It's not cold anymore. Sleep now.

263
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:55,810
♫ The warmth is still spreading at the bottom of my heart ♫

264
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:01,320
♫ In the fleeting and chaotic time, who forgot the promise? ♫

265
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:07,710
♫ Half in agony, half in deep love ♫

266
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:15,990
♫ Counting years and months is only to see your face when the flower blossoms ♫

267
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,560
♫ Even if we miss out on each other over and over again ♫

268
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,960
That Kunlun Fan of Yuqing is a strong magical weapon.

269
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,770
♫ I foresaw all of your joy and sadness ♫

270
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,820
Since you're a mortal, you cannot use it.

271
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,110
It's good you lost it so that you won't attract trouble by owning such a precious treasure.

272
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,450
♫ Three thousand flowers just to remember you ♫

273
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:39,300
♫ Counting years and months only to see your face when the flower blossoms ♫

274
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:45,230
♫ Even if we miss out on each other over and over again ♫

275
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:51,030
♫ I foresaw all of your joy and sadness ♫

276
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:58,600
♫ Three thousand flowers just to remember you ♫

277
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,760
Your Young Highness, what are you trying to find?

278
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,980
Mi Gu, why doesn't Aunt have any personal tokens?

279
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,850
Token?

280
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,960
Things that people know belongs to Bai Qian of Green Hill with just one look.

281
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,700
Or other things that let other people know that I belong to my Aunt

282
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,850
so they will spare me for her sake.

283
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,550
Great Lady has always acted as she pleases.

284
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,860
Other than the piles of luminous pearls in that pond of ours that are a bit luxurious,

285
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,840
there's nothing else here that can prove that she's an empress.

286
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,280
Forget it.

287
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,960
Your Young Highness, why are you acting so weird?

288
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,450
You've been gone for many days.

289
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,750
And you started searching right after your return.

290
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,550
Did you run into trouble?

291
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,130
I didn't get into trouble.

292
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,800
It's just... a debt of gratitude.

293
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,810
What kind of debt of gratitude?

294
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,330
A savior. Someone saved my life.

295
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,070
What? You... How was your life in danger?

296
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,810
- Are you injured?
- No.

297
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,320
I'll tell Great Lady so she'll seek justice for you.

298
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,700
No need. No need. I wasn't treated unjustly.

299
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,640
I just think a life savior must be repaid handsomely.

300
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,000
So, I want to leave Green Hill for a while...

301
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,420
to repay the kindness.

302
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,220
- Repay the kindness?
- Yes.

303
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,150
Repay the kindness

304
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,340
Your Young Highness, you're going to leave like this?

305
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,240
Fox Emperor and Fourth Uncle both came.

306
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,870
Of course, I have to leave now.

307
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,000
If they knew, it would be a mess.

308
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,250
Mi Gu, don't tell them anything.

309
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,200
Just tell them I'm traveling.

310
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,210
- After few years--
- A few years?!

311
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,650
Lower your voice.

312
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,810
Keep this safe.

313
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,640
This is something important that Aunt gave me.

314
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,190
Remember to give it to them.

315
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,640
I'm leaving.

316
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,000
What kind of person is Emperor Dong Hua?

317
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,320
Young Fifth hasn't come back for a few days.

318
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,560
Perhaps, she secluded herself again?

319
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,690
Mother, you really thought she secluded herself to cultivate?

320
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,700
It was all an excuse for hiding from Sang Ji.

321
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,550
Then, this is more strange.

322
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:55,270
Technically speaking, with Mo Yuan's divine body here, she wouldn't go far.

323
00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,720
In her heart, isn't her teacher more important than her father and mother?

324
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,520
You're not being jealous of High God Mo Yuan, are you?

325
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,170
This is not what I meant.

326
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:14,880
It's just I still feel a bit guilty about sending her to Kunlun Void in the first place.

327
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,780
Where is Fengjiu? I haven't seen her, either.

328
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,820
Her Young Highness said she went to travel.

329
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,770
She said, not to worry. She will be back after a few years.

330
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:32,420
She's really like Young Fifth when she was little, always making people worry.

331
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,210
Oh, right. This is a scroll.

332
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,010
Her Young Highness said it belonged to Great Lady.

333
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,850
It's quite urgent even I'm not allowed to peek at it.

334
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,280
This is bad.

335
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,190
What's wrong?

336
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,200
This scroll not only talked about the way to seal the Donghuang Bell,

337
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,690
it is also clearly written here that the Donghuang Bell's seal will disappear every 70,000 years.

338
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:08,420
Simply calculating, it's just after a few days after Young Fifth left the Peach Blossoms.

339
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,880
Zhe Yan, what do you mean?

340
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,160
Make yourself clear.

341
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,070
Which means Young Fifth must have gone to seal the Donghuang Bell.

342
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,830
What?

343
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,600
No wonder.

344
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,740
No wonder before Young Fifth disappeared, she asked me,

345
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,740
"If Qing Cang doesn't get sealed, what would happen to all the realms?"

346
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,650
Do you mean that she knew that the Donghuang Bell would unseal,

347
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,430
so she went there to seal Qing Cang by herself?

348
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,930
So, that's why she disappeared.

349
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,360
We know Young Fifth's character very well.

350
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,730
If there's a grudge, she will take revenge. Even more so when she's Mo Yuan's disciple.

351
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,970
She surely will not let Qing Cang escape from the bell and wreak havoc to the world.

352
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,980
She surely had gone to Ruoshui.

353
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,520
She left behind the scroll because if her spirit scattered,

354
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,750
the technique of sealing the Donghuang Bell can't disappear from this world.

355
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,110
After 70,000 years, another person will go again.

356
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,620
She was preparing to meet her death.

357
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,150
Preparing to meet her death?

358
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,460
Young Fifth.

359
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:20,820
How could she bear to... bear to leave us behind time after time?

360
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,390
No wonder she's a disciple of Kunlun Void.

361
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,260
In her heart, the world takes priority.

362
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,380
I predicted that she would experience a heavenly tribulation to get promoted to High God.

363
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,940
I thought that during these 70,000 years, she'd cultivated a lot, so she should be strong enough.

364
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,390
Who'd knew she went to take revenge for her teacher?

365
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,350
How could a High Immortal like her be able to defeat Qing Cang?

366
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,020
Mother, don't cry.

367
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,060
No matter how lacking Young Fifth is, she has half of your lifetime cultivation in her body.

368
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:58,510
Her spirit would not just scatter no matter what.

369
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,380
Young Fifth is the only daughter of the Bai family.

370
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,570
When she was young, she was so unbridled.

371
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:16,010
But I... I unfortunately sent her to Kunlun Void.

372
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,900
First, she had to go through a great war.

373
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,320
Afterward, she tried to preserve the body of her teacher.

374
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,160
Every day, she stabbed her heart just to get blood.

375
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,060
After 70,000 years, she wanted to avenge her teacher.

376
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,090
It's all my fault! It's all my fault, if...

377
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,540
If I didn't let Zhe Yan send her to Kunlun Void,

378
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,810
she wouldn't be in so much trouble.

379
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,190
It's all my fault.

380
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,460
At that time, I brought Young Fifth to Kunlun Void.

381
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,810
If you say it like that, I fear that I'm to be blamed, too.

382
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,920
Zhe Yan,

383
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,670
she really cares for Young Fifth.

384
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,310
Right now, anxiety is clouding her mind.

385
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,240
Don't put her words to heart.

386
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,790
Why would I argue with you guys?

387
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,180
Right now, the most important thing is to find Young Fifth.

388
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,130
That's right.

389
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,760
Don't cry.

390
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,990
Young Fifth has inherited half of your lifetime cultivation.

391
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:30,320
Our Nine-Tailed Fox, Phoenix, and Dragon Tribes are all part of the divine tribes of ancient times.

392
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,460
If we die, a cosmic phenomenon would appear.

393
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,220
Look, there wasn't any abnormality in the celestial bodies.

394
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,360
That means Young Fifth is still alive for sure.

395
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,180
Yes. Mother, things aren't that bad yet.

396
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,730
Don't think too much.

397
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,030
It's enough that Young Fifth is still alive.

398
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,470
It's our fault for spoiling her when she was young.

399
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,670
She wouldn't even discuss this huge thing with us.

400
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,260
What should we do?

401
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,450
Let's go search for her instead of overthinking.

402
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,120
Little Beauty, why are you pitifully sitting here?

403
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,070
Did someone bully you?

404
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,410
Are you a woman?

405
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,370
How can you tell?

406
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,970
My aunt likes to dress up as a man, too.

407
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,750
I'm used to seeing it.

408
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,640
- Your aunt?
- Yes.

409
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,920
Which imperial consort here in the Heavenly Palace is your aunt?

410
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,800
- Bai Qian of Green Hill.
- What?

411
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,990
Bai Qian of Green Hill?

412
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,870
That's right.

413
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,610
She's that future consort of the Crown Prince?

414
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,750
That's right.

415
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,480
Then, you are...?

416
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,750
Bai Fengjiu of Green Hill.

417
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:49,290
Oh, then Your Young Highness is from Green Hill.

418
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,320
Did you come with your elders?

419
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,270
Are you here to talk about your aunt's engagement?

420
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,880
It's not that. I'm here to repay a debt of kindness.

421
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,240
Repay a debt of kindness?

422
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,940
What kind of debt of kindness?

423
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,960
Who are you repaying it to?

424
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,450
Repaying Emperor Dong Hua for saving my life.

425
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,810
Emperor Dong Hua?

426
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,480
You're really interesting, Your Young Highness.

427
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,410
Every word you said has surprised me.

428
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,890
Come, tell me about it.

429
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,510
How did you encounter Emperor Dong Hua?

430
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,120
How did he save your life?

431
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,160
If you can take me in, I will tell you.

432
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,030
These two bodyguards blocked me for four hours.

433
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,330
So inflexible.

434
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,230
Then, you can come with me.

435
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,040
You can bring me in?

436
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,060
If you've encountered some ordinary immortal, it would indeed be quite hard.

437
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,940
But the one you've encountered today is me, Primary Monarchess Cheng Yu, instead.

438
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,690
I indeed can let you in.

439
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,260
Let's go.

440
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,980
Where are you taking me?

441
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,430
This is not the place to talk.

442
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,180
- Please come with me.
- Oh.

443
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,230
I see.

444
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,030
So, you are here at Heavenly Palace really to repay a debt of kindness?

445
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,620
Of course.

446
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:25,470
Based on the Emperor's status here in the Heavenly Palace, he doesn't lack anything.

447
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,970
How are you going to repay, Your Young Highness?

448
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,160
I... I want... to stay beside the Emperor day and night every day.

449
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,900
There will come a day when he needs me.

450
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,030
I then can, in passing, repay this favor that I owe him.

451
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,530
Yes. It makes sense.

452
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:49,460
But if you want to enter and exit Early Dawn Palace with a justifiable reason, there are only three methods.

453
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,050
What three methods?

454
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:56,070
First method: you must be a person of high status here in the Heavenly Palace.

455
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,500
But you're not, Your Young Highness.

456
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,350
Second: marry into Early Dawn Palace.

457
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,460
What? Marry....?

458
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,200
Am I...?

459
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,790
How about it, Your Young Highness? Do you really want to do it this way?

460
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,950
No! No! No! I didn't mean it that way.

461
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,650
- What I mean is—
- Don't explain.

462
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,030
I know a woman's heart very well.

463
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,070
But even if you want to marry him, it's still too early for you.

464
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,500
So, it leaves us with the third choice.

465
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,740
It's also most suitable for you, but it will be a bit hard.

466
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,280
What is it?

467
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,900
Be his maidservant.

468
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,060
Maidservant?

469
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,270
Your Young Highness, what are you doing here?

470
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,110
Entering the palace.

471
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,660
This is the Early Dawn Palace.

472
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,510
Yes, I know.

473
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:05,540
Don't worry. Although I frequently get lost, I recognize that signboard.

474
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,670
Don't play around like this. The Emperor isn't an easy person to talk to.

475
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:12,220
If he discovers that you trespassed into his Early Dawn Palace, he'll throw you out.

476
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,180
Is the Emperor really like that?

477
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,720
Who in Heavenly Palace doesn't know that?

478
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,160
The Emperor is like that. He's not easy to get along with.

479
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,240
Can't you see me bowing to him every day?

480
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,330
He's really interesting.

481
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,460
You're the one who's interesting.

482
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,000
I can't talk to you anymore.

483
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,250
I've bribed a divine monarchess just to get into Early Dawn Palace.

484
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,890
- I cannot waste it.
- Let me ask you something.

485
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,780
Which divine monarchess here in Heaven is that bold?

486
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,550
If I tell you, you must not tell anyone.

487
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,510
Your Young Highness, don't worry. We can be considered as confidants.

488
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,780
Primary Monarchess Cheng Yu.

489
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,700
You really know how to pick a person.

490
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,480
In this place, only Cheng Yu is willing to help you.

491
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,030
Why do you say it like that?

492
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,680
It's because I find her beautiful; hence, I assumed that she's a good person so I asked her for help.

493
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,600
You're judging a person by their looks.

494
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,580
Primary Monarchess Cheng Yu is an immortal that was accepted from the mortal world.

495
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,940
At the same time, she's the love of His Third Highness.

496
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,880
Lian Song? Heavenly Emperor's third son?

497
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,060
It's indeed true that leaning on a huge tree is very refreshing.

498
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,550
Your Young Highness, you are understanding.

499
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,130
Of course.

500
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,800
I really cannot talk to you right now.

501
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,350
Come visit me often. I still need your help.

502
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,330
Your Young Highness! Your Young Highness!

503
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,690
Hey!

504
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,610
Hey, come here.

505
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,840
That divine maid is new here?

506
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,250
Princess, this group are all new.

507
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,060
Why does the Emperor's palace always have new people?

508
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,710
Cousin is still the best.

509
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:13,100
The ones by his side are always Tian Shu and Jia Yun, and both are males.

510
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,640
These newcomers are all low-leveled who are responsible for miscellaneous stuff.

511
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,000
They cannot get close to the Emperor.

512
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,820
Tell the person choosing these divine maids to not send anyone that's too pretty here.

513
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,890
It will disturb the order here!

514
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,800
Yes.

515
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,950
Go over there.

516
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,330
You will sleep here.

517
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:48,700
That divine maid broke the rules here in Early Dawn Palace and got punished to go down the lower realm.

518
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,900
What?

519
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,410
What's wrong?

520
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,800
Nothing.

521
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,940
How did such a beautiful girl come here all of a sudden?

522
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,450
I heard she came here just now.

523
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:08,930
She must have been dazed by the Emperor and insisted to enter here, so she can be promoted to a high status in one bound.

524
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:13,980
She didn't even ask around first how many from Early Dawn Palace are sent to the lower realm every month.

525
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,550
Little Jiu Jiu, you came here to repay.

526
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:29,010
You must be careful. You really cannot be kicked out.

527
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,680
Stop there.

528
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,130
Where are you going?

529
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,220
To serve tea to the Emperor.

530
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,860
Who told you to go?

531
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,670
Does someone need to tell me to go?

532
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,780
Who do you think the Emperor is?

533
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,920
He was the ruler of Heaven and Earth that's worshiped by all immortals since olden times.

534
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,470
Now, although he yielded his throne to the Heavenly Monarch,

535
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:12,920
the Heavenly Monarch and even Crown Prince Ye Hua, have to show respect to him when they see him.

536
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,790
You're a new divine maid at the Early Dawn Palace and you're thinking of going into the study room and serving tea to him?

537
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,200
Don't you even know the rules?

538
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,680
Where I used to live, there aren't that many rules.

539
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,730
Which valley of the lower realm did you come from?

540
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:36,110
Green Hill... A mountain close to Green Hill.

541
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,960
- Green Hill?
- Yes.

542
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,930
- The border between the Heavenly Tribe and Green Hill?
- Yes.

543
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,120
They all say that Green Hill is barren and barbaric.

544
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,300
They don't know any rules. No wonder.

545
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,230
Green Hill is barren and barbaric?

546
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,490
Isn't that so?

547
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,970
Of course not.

548
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,100
Our Green Hill just has a simpler type of customs.

549
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,140
Unlike your Heavenly Palace where there are so many rules.

550
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,070
We all live a carefree life.

551
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,620
That's the same as not knowing the rules!

552
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:05,520
Why should I tell you, a little divine maid, this?

553
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,810
Come here.

554
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,730
Your Highness the Princess, what instructions do you have?

555
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,910
This person doesn't understand the rules.

556
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,080
Don't let her come here in the future,

557
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,480
so as to avoid offending the Emperor.

558
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,530
In these few days, please tell her about the Heavenly Palace rules.

559
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,530
Don't let her embarrass the Early Dawn Palace and the Emperor.

560
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,870
Yes.

561
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,640
Why should I listen to you?

562
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,920
Because I am a princess and you are a little divine maid.

563
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,940
If you were a princess, too, you wouldn't need to listen to me then.

564
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,930
It's a pity you are not.

565
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,120
- Wait.
- Shut up.

566
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,880
That is the cousin of His Highness the Crown Prince. How could you be so disrespectful with her?

567
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,820
Crown Prince's cousin? Wait a minute.

568
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,870
The Crown Prince is my aunt's future husband.

569
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:04,670
If she's the Crown Prince's cousin, isn't she more senior than me?

570
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:10,100
Father and Aunt taught me before that I must respect my elders.

571
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,860
Although the attitude of that elder is not worthy to be respected,

572
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,770
she is also an elder.

573
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:22,730
Since she already said it, okay then.

574
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,000
I will observe the rules then.

575
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,060
No wonder the Princess said that you don't follow the rules.

576
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,790
I was talking to you, but you were in such a daze for so long.

577
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,130
Yes, Older Sister, you are right.

578
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,120
Are we going to learn about the proprieties now?

579
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,370
Learn about the proprieties?

580
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,930
Does a divine maid like you who handles odd jobs need to learn the proprieties?

581
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,830
Come with me to the laundry room to do some work.

582
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,410
How was it?

583
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,570
Have you gotten to see the Emperor today?

584
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,540
Help massage me a bit.

585
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,960
I'm so sore.

586
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,670
You are that tired?

587
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,360
I'm already this tired and I haven't seen the Emperor.

588
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,280
Instead, I met my aunt's future husband's cousin.

589
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,330
She wanted me to learn more proprieties.

590
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:54,670
And those divine maids used this chance to make me do difficult chores.

591
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:59,430
Your aunt's future husband's cousin?

592
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,390
Isn't that little brat Zhi Yue?

593
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:05,690
She's very bizarre and strange.

594
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,160
What? She tormented you?

595
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,890
What little brat?

596
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,870
She's more senior than me.

597
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,490
If you put it this way,

598
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,260
then based on my past with Third Highness,

599
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,840
aren't I senior to Zhi Yue?

600
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,380
Shouldn't you call me Grandmother then?

601
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,820
So, why take it so seriously?

602
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,770
Think about it. If you go by seniority,

603
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,870
your aunt and His Highness the Crown Prince, aren't of the same generation, either.

604
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:39,520
Immortals. If you live too long, all of these won't matter.

605
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,380
Next time, you don't need to be afraid of her.

606
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,070
Don't forget you are also an empress.

607
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,950
That's right.

608
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,940
Wait.

609
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,150
You mentioned earlier about your past with Third Highness.

610
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,140
What is it about?

611
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,580
Nothing.

612
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,950
Just a past fate.

613
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:11,260
What's a past fate?

614
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:16,890
Nothing. Anyway, we're now both doing well, not meddling with each other.

615
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,050
So, it could be like that.

616
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,860
Why can't it be like that?

617
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:26,810
When our Nine-Tailed White Fox Tribe sets on someone, it's for every lifetime.

618
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:30,380
- What? Really?
- Yes.

619
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,770
Then, didn't your aunt and His Second Highness break off their engagement and afterward she got together with the Crown Prince?

620
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:40,160
That's because my aunt hadn't met His Second Highness.

621
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,990
My fourth uncle mentioned it before.

622
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:45,840
The love lives of the Green Hill Nine-Tailed Fox Tribesmen went too smoothly;

623
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,360
hence, all the love tribulations befell onto my aunt.

624
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,730
But my fourth uncle also said,

625
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,880
since God gave my aunt a great complexion,

626
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,690
it's just right that her love path is a bit bumpy.

627
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:03,030
Or else, it's unfair if she gets all the good things. Right?

628
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,670
Since you said it that way, I want your aunt to marry earlier into the Heavenly Palace,

629
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:14,720
so I can see what the number one beauty in the whole Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses really looks like.

630
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,980
My aunt is very beautiful.

”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

632
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,430
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

633
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:55,100
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

634
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:00,510
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

635
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:09,690
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

636
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,690
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

637
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:18,860
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

638
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:26,400
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

639
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,190
♫ All are just illusions ♫

640
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:38,080
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

641
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:43,360
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

642
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,840
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

643
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,970
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

644
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:59,390
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

645
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:04,570
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

646
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:07,490
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

647
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:16,560
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from my previous life ♫

648
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:28,480
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

649
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,000
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

650
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,330
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

651
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:44,740
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

652
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:50,030
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

653
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:55,360
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

654
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,130
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

655
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:06,960
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

656
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:19,650
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
