”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,600
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,070
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,640
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,090
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,390
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,170
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,750
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,140
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,620
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,320
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,620
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,380
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,860
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,260
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,640
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,430
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,080
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,790
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,270
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,440
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,900
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,900
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,430
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,470
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,060
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,180
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Eternal Love]

30
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,130
[Episode 27]

31
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,740
Emperor, your breathing is a bit unstable.

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,320
These past days, Emperor has successively saved the life of the Young Highness from Green Hill twice.

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,520
And when the Donghuang Bell fluctuated, he used his power to suppress Qing Cang; hence—

34
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,570
No need to say those things.

35
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,970
Save Ye Hua first.

36
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,710
Put that Soul-Gathering Lamp by Ye Hua's side for three days.

37
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,050
Make sure that it is lighted continuously for three days,

38
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,460
then Ye Hua's spirit can be successfully bonded together.

39
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,240
In these three days, the light in the lamp must be meticulously taken care of.

40
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,780
You mustn't use magic to protect it for convenience.

41
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,540
Okay.

42
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,060
I, Ye Hua, in this Great Lake of the Eastern Wilderness,

43
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,230
ask all the gods of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses to be my witness.

44
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,430
Starting today, Su Su and I are going to be a married couple.

45
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,600
For all eternity, we will treat each other wholeheartedly.

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,580
No matter if it's during disaster or good fortune, we will never leave each other.

47
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,970
I, Su Su, in this Great Lake of the Eastern Wilderness today,

48
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,610
ask all the gods of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses to be my witness.

49
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,510
I and Ye Hua are going to be a married couple starting today.

50
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,240
For all eternity, we will treat each other wholeheartedly.

51
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,000
No matter if it's during disaster or good fortune, we will never leave each other.

52
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,530
Ye Hua,

53
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,040
who knew we had such a deep fate?

54
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:28,240
Too bad, it is destined to be an unfortunate fate after all.

55
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,630
From now on, there's no more Su Su of the Junji Mountain of the Eastern Wilderness.

56
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:16,280
After waking up from this dream, whatever happened in this dream will all be forgotten.

57
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,740
Ye Hua.

58
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,170
Ye Hua.

59
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,200
- Ye Hua!
- Ye Hua!

60
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,050
Ye Hua. Ye Hua!

61
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,880
Hurry! Hurry! Medicine King!

62
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,710
Lian Song.

63
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,150
Father Monarch.

64
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,090
I've been thinking these few days.

65
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,750
Have I been too harsh on Ye Hua?

66
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,110
For tens of thousands of years, he lived following my will.

67
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,790
When he just learned to sit, I'd carried him to the study.

68
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,650
He would sit for 14 hours at a time there.

69
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,770
I still remember that back then, he was too young to understand the scriptures.

70
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,030
He then cried in front of his mother that one time.

71
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,960
His mother then rushed to ask for leniency from me.

72
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,450
I was angry because a benevolent mother would destroy a son.

73
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,270
But ever since then,

74
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,560
until he transcended into a High Immortal at the age of 20,000 years,

75
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,060
he never saw his birth mother again.

76
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,190
Since you are asking, I will tell the truth.

77
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,890
Whenever people talk about Crown Prince Ye Hua of the Heavenly Tribes,

78
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,810
they would mention him transcending into a High Immortal at age 20,000,

79
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,230
him getting accepted as a disciple by Spiritual Master Ci Hang and Lord of Yuanshi,

80
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,090
and him surpassing the late High God Mo Yuan.

81
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:29,320
But in my eyes, he's just a pitiful child.

82
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,020
He's been alone since he was young.

83
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,450
He didn't have any playmates.

84
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,440
Honestly, I would usually privately mock him for living an incomplete life.

85
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,030
He's never even experienced love.

86
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:54,600
Yet when he met the person he truly loved, Su Su, who'd know this would be the outcome.

87
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,610
This child puts too much importance on affection and loyalty.

88
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,390
Mo Yuan was just her teacher for 20,000 years.

89
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:20,630
She then used the blood of her heart to nourish his divine body every day.

90
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,670
Is Heaven doing these things deliberately?

91
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:30,100
Why did she have to suffer another love tribulation before transcending into a High Goddess?

92
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,820
When she asked me for the Love-Forgetting Medicine, she was very heartbroken.

93
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,400
I think it's a good thing if she wakes up with no recollection of anything.

94
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,330
Let's pretend we don't know what happened.

95
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,530
It's just that even though I cured her eyes, she can't endure bright lights.

96
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,350
I never lie.

97
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,000
It's up to you how to make her believe it.

98
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,730
Me? Why is it me again?

99
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,450
What? You don't want to?

100
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't dare. I will do it.

101
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,110
Why must we hide it from her?

102
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,480
This is her tribulation to transcend into a High Goddess.

103
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,550
They all have gone through it before.

104
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,100
It's just that she is full of injuries.

105
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,410
It's really heartbreaking to see.

106
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,720
That's enough. What do you know?

107
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,820
If she could endure it, why would she ask Zhe Yan for the Love-Forgetting Medicine?

108
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,720
It's fine, too.

109
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,950
If she wants to forget, let her forget.

110
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:43,830
That's right. Let's just say she was injured in her battle with Qing Cang and fell into a deep sleep.

111
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,300
As for her eyes...

112
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,500
Let's say she was born like this.

113
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,160
It was hidden previously, but after getting hurt, it became obvious.

114
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,770
Okay. We'll put it that way.

115
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,680
Will you remember?

116
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,580
I will.

117
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,470
Go to the netherworld and use the black light to create a white blindfold that can block off lights.

118
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,850
We'll let Young Fifth wear it.

119
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,940
Okay. I'll go now.

120
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,740
My parents are really obedient to you.

121
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,130
They follow your every word.

122
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:47,630
I haven't asked you yet, how did you meet them before I was born?

123
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,500
Before you were born?

124
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,070
That time, I was the first one to like your mother,

125
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,540
but your mother insisted on choosing your corny father.

126
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,050
After I and your father fought for several days,

127
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,830
we realized that we have similar interests, so we decided to become sworn brothers.

128
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,630
There is such a story?

129
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,910
Yes. Hence, you must thank me.

130
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:17,120
If not because I gave up pursuing your mother, how could you all even exist?

131
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,330
So shameless with your words. My mother wouldn't like an old Phoenix like you.

132
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,870
Old phoenix?

133
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,440
Zhen Zhen, do you remember when you were one year old you insisted on climbing onto my lap to kiss me?

134
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,340
Old Phoenix, why are you bringing up something that I did when I was one?

135
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,000
It's fun.

136
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,240
Ye Hua.

137
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,800
Stop looking as if you've abandoned everything to despair.

138
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,080
I can't bear it.

139
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:30,630
From the Medicine King, I asked for a Love-Forgetting Pill.

140
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,250
Take it.

141
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:41,080
If you eat it, you can forget Su Su and continue being the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe.

142
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,150
I don't ask that you make any grand contribution.

143
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:56,360
I only want you... to continue living well.

144
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,090
I don't want to forget her.

145
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,000
You really slept so well.

146
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,560
Fourth Older Brother,

147
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,470
why can't I see well?

148
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,620
The light is too glaring.

149
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,320
Don't worry. Zhe Yan is worried about your eyes, too.

150
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,880
It'll get better soon.

151
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,180
But you can't look at bright things.

152
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,630
What happened?

153
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,270
It's a congenital illness. When Mother was pregnant with you,

154
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:19,130
it coincided with the Heavenly Monarch creating the Great Flood to punish the citizens of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

155
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,440
After the flood, there was no food.

156
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,990
Because Mother couldn't eat anything, her body was weak.

157
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:32,980
Hence, when you were born, you were a little wrinkled fox with this weird eye disease.

158
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,230
Why didn't I have this problem before?

159
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,030
That eye disease hid inside your body for tens of thousands of years.

160
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:46,030
You were all right all this time, but because of your recent injury with the cold, it totally flared-up.

161
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,980
But good thing, our father used the dark light of the netherworld

162
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,630
to create this white blindfold for you that can block the light.

163
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,270
When you go to excessively bright places, it will automatically appear.

164
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,100
Not only can it block the light, but it also won't affect your vision.

165
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,050
Fourth Older Brother, when did I get harmed by the cold?

166
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,040
After you fought Qing Cang, you fell asleep for several years.

167
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,690
You probably don't remember much of what happened in between, my High Goddess Bai Qian?

168
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,930
High Goddess?

169
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,900
Look at your spirit.

170
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,680
Did you notice that you've been promoted a High Goddess?

171
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,880
How come the tribulation to become a High Goddess is that easy?

172
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,350
I just fought Qing Cang and slept for several years,

173
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,360
and then I got promoted into a High Goddess while in my dreams?

174
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,650
You have good luck. This is a favor that Heaven made for you.

175
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,160
Compared to when I got promoted into a High Immortal,

176
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,300
Heaven was more merciful this time.

177
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,000
- I need to go.
- Why?

178
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,020
Teacher... Teacher hasn't had the blood of my heart while I was asleep.

179
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Young Fifth!

180
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,800
- Where's Teacher?
- You woke up?

181
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,870
Look for yourself.

182
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,270
Teacher, I'm here to see you.

183
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,860
Why hasn't his body changed at all while I was asleep for so long?

184
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,600
Did you notice that the body of Mo Yuan is well-preserved, despite the absence of your heart's blood?

185
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,970
From the look of it, I think Mo Yuan will be waking up soon.

186
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,900
Mi Gu.

187
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,780
- Mi Gu.
- Great Lady!

188
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,030
Why do you look so troubled?

189
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,450
Since Her Young Highness returned from the Heavenly Palace, she keeps drinking.

190
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,670
After Second Uncle took her home, they had a disagreement and he beat her up until she was barely conscious.

191
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,730
Earlier, I secretly rescued her.

192
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,590
Her Young Highness wouldn't even cry when she bled from the beating.

193
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,640
Ever since she came back, she hasn't spoken a word.

194
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,000
Please hurry up and go see her, Great Lady!

195
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,620
Young Jiu, why did you drink so much?

196
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,170
Alcohol isn't good for you.

197
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:41,180
But, of course, Zhe Yan's alcohol is the best thing in the world.

198
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:49,300
But isn't drowning your sorrows with alcohol like this all day trampling the creation of Zhe Yan?

199
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,980
You must know that alcohol can help you find release for a moment,

200
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,790
but once you wake up, all your problems will not diminish.

201
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:09,160
Aunt, I'm not doing this to drown my sorrows.

202
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,470
Of course, I know that drinking won't drive away my problems.

203
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:20,100
It's just, I feel like crying if I don't drink.

204
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,940
That's why I keep drinking.

205
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:30,630
I couldn't cry in front of the Emperor, or anyone else.

206
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,340
I can only cry here.

207
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,630
Look at me, Aunt.

208
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,330
I even have to find a safe place to cry.

209
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,540
Am I not pitiful?

210
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,130
Fourth Older Brother, leave this to me.

211
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,320
Let us two have a good chat.

212
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,460
Sure, sure. I'll let you handle it.

213
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,110
I have no idea how you women think.

214
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,830
You tell me, so many things happened to you in these past few years.

215
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,690
Tell me everything between you and Emperor Dong Hua.

216
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,820
I'll logically assess it for you.

217
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:27,060
That day, when you left me in Kunlun Void, Emperor came.

218
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,540
Don't cry. Don't cry.

219
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,740
Don't cry.

220
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,340
I know why you're crying.

221
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:54,370
That woman who caused your mother to lose her eyes and her life will be married to your father tonight.

222
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,050
If she didn't jump off the Immortal Execution Platform,

223
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,610
the one entering the Pure Wutong Palace today will be her

224
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,330
and not that woman who hurt her.

225
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,230
Okay. Okay. Don't cry.

226
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,320
Let's not cry. Good boy.

227
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,960
Aunt, why do I like Emperor Dong Hua?

228
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,110
If you ask me, who am I supposed to ask?

229
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,350
I want to ask you.

230
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,660
You're the only princess in the third generation of Green Hill.

231
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,960
You can like anyone, yet you like the former ruler of Heaven and Earth.

232
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:50,640
Emperor Dong Hua is the past master of Heaven and Earth that is of higher status than the Heavenly Monarch.

233
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,330
You must know that before your father was even born,

234
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,820
Emperor Dong Hua was already the master of this world.

235
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,500
I know.

236
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,980
Si Ming already told me.

237
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,760
Why are you still being stubborn about it?

238
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,350
If logic can make one let go, that would be great.

239
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,510
Aunt, have you ever liked anyone?

240
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,110
Did you also become as embarrassing as me?

241
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,980
I have.

242
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,830
Really? Who in this world could catch your eyes?

243
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,020
Tell me.

244
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,090
Let's not talk about this.

245
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,170
It happened back in Kunlun Void.

246
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,960
It was embarrassing.

247
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:08,960
I once told Your Highness that this Kunlun Fan of Yuqing was a magical weapon of Kunlun Void.

248
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,250
But I'm unable to find out the masters it has passed through and what it has experienced.

249
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,760
Ye Hua, why are you investigating the whereabouts of High God Mo Yuan when you've just woken up?

250
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,550
Father Monarch has been investigating this matter for 70,000 years,

251
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,530
yet he hasn't found any clues.

252
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,240
The Heavenly Tribe has done everything it can.

253
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,380
I'm sure that the disappearance of Si Yin and Mo Yuan isn't that simple.

254
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,750
Si Yin is Mo Yuan's most favored disciple,

255
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,740
but how come he didn't let his Teacher

256
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,370
be buried in the sacred place of the Heavenly Tribe, the Sea of Innocence,

257
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,920
and instead stole his divine body?

258
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:58,020
The most possible reason is that he wants to go against Heaven's will and revive Mo Yuan.

259
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,540
I've thought about this before.

260
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:06,180
But even if they're alive, you shouldn't rush.

261
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,290
You should nurse your injuries first.

262
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:15,170
I want to find Si Yin to ask him how to bring Mo Yuan back to life.

263
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,750
You want to bring Su Su back?

264
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,860
If Your Highness the Crown Prince wants to find Si Yin,

265
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,690
I know someone who might be able to help.

266
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,420
Who?

267
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,010
Bai Fengjiu.

268
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,900
Bai Qian's niece from Green Hill?

269
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,290
That's right.

270
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,960
I always felt like she knows something.

271
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,720
I'll take a trip to Green Hill.

272
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,010
Now? Did you forget today's your wedding with Su Jin?

273
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:52,240
Is it? I did forget.

274
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,820
You are...?

275
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,130
I'm the crown prince of the Heavenly Tribe, Ye Hua.

276
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,090
I request to have an audience with Green Hill's empress Bai Fengjiu.

277
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,270
Crown Prince?

278
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,080
I will go call Her Young Highness out immediately.

279
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,830
Aunt, I brought your Cloud-Breaking Fan back.

280
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,780
Did Mi Gu return it to you?

281
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,400
He already did.

282
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,170
He even told me that to temporarily forget how Emperor broke your heart,

283
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,160
you especially went to the Northern Sea to vent it on them.

284
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,810
Not really.

285
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:51,380
It's just that since I came back from the Heavenly Palace, my heart feels like it's dying;

286
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,920
but I suddenly remembered that I haven't taught Shao Xin a lesson on your behalf,

287
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,840
so I filled up with energy and went to scold her.

288
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,050
I know you treat me the best.

289
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,770
Even though you're already depressed, you didn't forget to vent for me.

290
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,930
Of course!

291
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,220
Great Lady, Crown Prince Ye Hua is here.

292
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,390
I thought I withdrew my engagement with his second uncle.

293
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,810
Why is he here?

294
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,280
Aunt, he's a cruel person.

295
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,740
You shouldn't marry him!

296
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,500
Why would I marry him?

297
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,000
You probably don't know.

298
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,800
When you fought Qing Cang and were nursing your injuries,

299
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,140
Fox Emperor and High God Zhe Yan personally arranged this marriage for you.

300
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,550
What marriage?

301
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:39,040
To withdraw the engagement with the second prince and be engaged to Crown Prince Ye Hua.

302
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,210
Why didn't I know about this?

303
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,850
You just woke up.

304
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:47,230
Maybe Fourth Uncle and High God Zhe Yan didn't get the time to tell you.

305
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,900
Didn't I just cancel my engagement with his second uncle?

306
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,800
How come I'm now engaged to him?

307
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,870
I'm going to talk to them and cancel this engagement.

308
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,650
Great Lady, you must not! This is more prudent than your engagement with the Water Monarch of the Northern Sea.

309
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,380
Before, it was just a private engagement.

310
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:08,010
Now, your wedding with His Highness Crown Prince was announced by Heavenly Monarch and Fox Emperor

311
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,580
in front of every one of the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses.

312
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:17,360
If you really withdraw it again, everyone in Green Hills and Heavenly Tribes will lose face.

313
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,510
What's wrong with my parents?

314
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,310
Forget it.

315
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,550
Tell him to leave. I don't want to see him.

316
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,480
Great Lady, actually His Highness Crown Prince is not here for you.

317
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,940
He's here for Fengjiu.

318
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,050
Fengjiu?

319
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,630
Are you familiar with the Crown Prince?

320
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,450
Definitely not! I hate him.

321
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,960
- Really?
- Yes!

322
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,750
The Heavenly Tribe's crown prince came here personally to find you.

323
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,310
Did you cause any trouble?

324
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,750
I really didn't!

325
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,500
It just... that his cousin also likes Dong Hua.

326
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,380
Could it be that he is here to punish me on his cousin's behalf?

327
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,950
You were competing with the crown prince's cousin for favor?

328
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,990
I didn't!

329
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:10,470
How could I fight with a spoiled little girl like her?

330
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,560
Forget it. I'll go ask.

331
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,960
Go, but don't tell him I'm here.

332
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,980
Your Highness the Crown Prince, although I was in Early Dawn Palace before,

333
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,250
I never had any interaction with you.

334
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:45,450
May I ask why you're here to see me today?

335
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:50,470
I came today to ask you if you have heard of High Immortal Si Yin.

336
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,540
How come both the Emperor and him have both asked me?

337
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,650
That tattletale Si Ming must have said something.

338
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,570
Si Yin?

339
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:01,280
I heard High God Zhe Yan mention before that he once picked up a little fox and took it to Kunlun Void to study martial arts.

340
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,680
Are you talking about him?

341
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,140
That's right.

342
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,660
Do you know where he went after that battle 70,000 years ago?

343
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,380
I don't know.

344
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,120
I understand.

345
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,040
I'll take my leave.

346
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,200
He came to find me to ask about this?

347
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,810
Congratulations, Your Highness.

348
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:23,400
I don't know why but I can't make myself step out of this palace.

349
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,430
Marrying into Pure Wutong Palace has been your wish for so many years.

350
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,750
You should be happy!

351
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,130
What are you afraid of?

352
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:38,960
I fear that he would mind that I was once a woman of Heavenly Monarch.

353
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,060
It's also aggrieving for you.

354
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,200
It was clearly a wedding bestowed by Heavenly Monarch,

355
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,990
but His Highness the Crown Prince refused to bow to the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses with you

356
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,060
and welcome you into his palace.

357
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,830
He asked us to ride a palanquin towards there by ourselves.

358
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,790
All these are unimportant.

359
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:04,390
What's important is starting tonight, I'm a side consort of Pure Wutong Palace.

360
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,060
Ye Hua's side consort.

361
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,670
Your Mighty Monarch, our servant outside has sent news

362
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:36,630
that the palanquin of Consort Su Jin will reach Pure Wutong Palace soon.

363
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,630
Is that so?

364
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,430
Will Your Mighty Monarch not change your clothes?

365
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,570
The red candles in this hall are hurting my eyes.

366
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,720
Replace all of them.

367
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,610
- Yes.
- Yes.

368
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,190
Your Highness, look. His Highness the Crown Prince was afraid that you'd feel aggrieved,

369
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,310
so he personally came out to welcome you in.

370
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,260
Ye Hua, you're back.

371
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,140
How come you still don't like to talk?

372
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,740
It's fine. I have long understood your personality.

373
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,660
Since you don't like talking, I'll talk more.

374
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:54,290
You were my only relative since you were born.

375
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,250
Ye Hua, believe me.

376
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:07,200
No other woman in this whole world will treat you better than I do.

377
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:19,390
[Pure Wutong Palace]

378
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,410
Husband.

379
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,770
Your Highness, please appease your anger! Your Highness!

380
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,470
Why?

381
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,720
[Pure Wutong Palace]

382
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:55,600
Before sealing Qing Cang, I once secretly drank a pot of wine here, Teacher.

383
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,430
Today, I'm returning it.

384
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:10,680
In the past, Ninth Senior Brother loved coming here to look for me.

385
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:17,350
It was also he who had to clean up this place every time even though he doesn't drink.

386
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:26,120
If he were still here,

387
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,860
he would have so much to clean.

388
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,670
Where's my Kunlun Fan of Yuqing?

389
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,040
The Kunlun Fan of Yuqing suddenly disappeared.

390
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,970
Was it called by its master or did it go someplace else?

391
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,230
Where can a magical weapon from Kunlun Void go?

392
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,080
Could it be Si Yin has appeared?

393
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,430
[Kunlun Void]

394
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,890
I was unfilial, Teacher.

395
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,700
I almost lost you.

396
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:43,700
It is indeed as rumored, all the disciples of Kunlun Void have left.

397
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,020
This place has been deserted for 70,000 years.

398
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,270
There are no more signs of life.

399
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,430
I've been waiting for you.

400
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,410
Where have you been?

401
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:16,520
I went to Kunlun Void.

402
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,070
The Kunlun Fan of Yuqing suddenly disappeared earlier.

403
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:24,210
I thought maybe its owner, High Immortal Si Yin, was back.

404
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,280
Mo Yuan is the direct descendant of Father God.

405
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,870
The disappearance of his divine body has also been a knot in my heart for the past years.

406
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:37,680
If you can find Si Yin, you might be able to find Mo Yuan.

407
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,320
It's a shame he's not in Kunlun Void.

408
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,670
It's been 70,000 years.

409
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,050
We don't have to rush.

410
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,740
I waited for your return today mainly for Su Jin.

411
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:05,940
Previously, she offered the Soul-Gathering Lamp in front of everyone.

412
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,270
I then agreed to let her marry into Pure Wutong Palace.

413
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,950
The heavenly decree has been promulgated.

414
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:14,020
She's now your side consort.

415
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,890
Whether you agree with it or not, it's final.

416
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,390
You won't be able to change it.

417
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:28,590
Since you need to give the Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses an explanation,

418
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,480
I can only accept that decree.

419
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,720
There are more than a hundred halls in Pure Wutong Palace.

420
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,990
Other than my Courtyard of Moonlight and Purple Morning Hall,

421
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:44,100
she can live wherever she wants, it's not my business.

422
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,610
Your Mighty Monarch, Her Highness wants to see you!

423
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:12,180
Her Highness said that she has a way to save Su Su!

424
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:42,580
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

426
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:47,290
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

427
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:52,590
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

428

♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

429
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,960
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

430
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,210
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

431
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:16,910
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

432
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:23,410
♫ All are just illusions ♫

♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫
