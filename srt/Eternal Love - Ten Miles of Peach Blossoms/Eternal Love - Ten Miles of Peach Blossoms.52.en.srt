”Three Lives, Three Worlds” by Jason Zhang

00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,540
♫ Listen to the rustling of the wind ♫

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,120
♫ Whose sorrow is it trying to stir up? ♫

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,640
♫ My yearning grows so instantaneously ♫

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,920
♫ That I forget how long the night is ♫

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,350
♫ I hold the tears in my palm until they become burning hot ♫

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,150
♫ I’m only willing to be crazy for you for three lifetimes ♫

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,780
♫ Falling blossoms are everywhere, and I also smell the fragrance of the zither ♫

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,350
♫ With you, I wander the world ♫

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,920
♫  If love is too desolate, I will dream this dream with you ♫

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,400
♫ And redeem all your tears ♫

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,450
♫ No matter how far this journey will be or how long these three lifetimes will be ♫

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,180
♫ We will be hand in hand until eternity ♫

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,930
♫ Despite the miserable wind, vast fog, rolling storm, or overflowing snow ♫

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,550
♫ I will walk with you every step of the way ♫

16
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,070
♫ I will hold your hand, don’t be alarmed, don’t worry about tomorrow ♫

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,570
♫ Even if we are destined to wander the world ♫

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,040
♫ Even if we travel to the remotest corners of Earth ♫

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,070
♫ Never let go of each other’s hands ♫

20
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,820
♫ Never forget our mutual love ♫

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,250
♫ Life does not need to be too brilliant ♫

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,450
♫ Empty glories eventually become nothing, those things you persisted will leave with the wind ♫

23
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,840
♫ Why is love full of ups and downs? ♫

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,870
♫ How many storms do we have to face before our hearts stop wavering? ♫

25
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,300
♫ Let’s run through our past together ♫

26
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,390
♫ I’ll wait with you for the wind to stop, fog to clear, rain to end, and snow to melt ♫

27
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,030
♫ Before seeing the absolute beautiful moon again ♫

28
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,560
♫ I will still be by your side ♫

[Diligence in Studies is Good for Your Age]

32
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,550
It's agreed between us then.

33
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,100
You cannot marry someone else.

34
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,310
When I have the time, I will visit you.

35
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,610
I will marry you when you have grown up.

36
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,660
Ye Hua, you used to like reading books when you were young.

37
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,470
Who knew that even when you're in the Mortal Realm, you haven't changed.

38
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,170
Young Master.

39
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,490
Did you call me?

40
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,360
Young Master.

41
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,650
Who are you?

42
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,280
Do you... not recognize me?

43
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,460
Your Highness, Heavenly Monarch made him drink the Water of Forgetfulness.

44
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,370
So, he naturally wouldn't remember you.

45
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,650
Please don't be upset.

46
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,950
No, I know he wouldn't remember me.

47
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,050
When I saw that he looks the same as when he was at this age,

48
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,520
I recalled the days when we were in Heavenly Palace.

49
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,740
That mortal woman Su Su didn't exist at the time.

50
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,770
Bai Qian of Green Hill wasn't around, either.

51
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,810
The only one who was by his side in Nine Heavens was just me.

52
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,380
That's right.

53
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,880
I started serving you around that time.

54
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:26,790
I remember that His Eldest Highness wanted you to accompany His Mighty Monarch and be his playmate.

55
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,830
Back then, you loved to tease him.

56
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,880
You used to tease him until he furrowed his eyebrows.

57
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,410
It was adorable.

58
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,190
That's right.

59
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,180
When Ye Hua was young, he was extremely good looking.

60
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,940
He didn't like to talk and wasn't very lively.

61
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,230
Every day, I would tease him for a long time before I could get him to say something.

62
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,450
From the day Ye Hua was born, I have always been with him.

63
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,310
He's my only family member.

64
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,250
I am sincere to him and value him over my life.

65
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,720
How can those women be compared to me?

66
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,370
Young Master, you have studied for a long time. You must be tired.

67
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,430
You should read tomorrow.

68
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,900
Old Master.

69
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,600
Father.

70
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,410
Are you working hard again?

71
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,160
I wonder what good deeds I did in the past to have such a motivated child like you.

72
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,740
Our Liu family will depend on you to bring honor to us in the future.

73
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,930
Come, this is your older cousin.

74
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,320
Her name is Su Jin.

75
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,420
She'll be living with us for a while.

76
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,270
She can be your playmate.

77
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,870
Hey. Aren't you going to greet me?

78
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,440
Are you a mute?

79
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,680
There are books behind me that you can read by yourself.

80
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,550
Don't bother me.

81
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,680
All right.

82
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,860
Why are you late today?

83
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,270
The school just started. Do you have a lot of homework already?

84
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,210
Look at you, you are drenched.

85
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,620
It'll be bad if you get sick.

86
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,760
Sixteenth Senior Brother, seriously.

87
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,020
He said he'll take care of Kunlun Void,

88
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,750
but he hasn't cleaned the winery.

89
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,180
These men are so lazy.

90
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,050
Who knew the lazy Seventeenth has changed so much over these 70,000 years?

91
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,820
Teacher, you are here.

92
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,190
Does this place look clean after being tidied up?

93
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,710
It's clean.

94
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,880
Teacher, do you remember

95
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,400
when I was heartbroken because of Li Jing and created a fuss?

96
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,220
You were forced to leave early from seclusion.

97
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,360
You were with me here to get drunk.

98
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,610
Did you know I was a girl around that time?

99
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,970
I knew since the moment you came to the main hall of Kunlun Void that you were the daughter of Fox Emperor Bai Zhi.

100
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,320
Then, why did you accept me as your disciple?

101
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,510
Doesn't the Kunlun Void have rules about taking in women?

102
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,880
Why do you think I took you in?

103
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,640
It must be because of Zhe Yan. Right?

104
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,130
You are such a laid-back person.

105
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,280
You must have been afraid that old phoenix would keep bothering you.

106
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:47,320
But you definitely didn't know that accepting a female disciple like me would bring you even more problems.

107
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:53,150
You even helped me when I went through high immortal tribulations.

108
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:58,110
Speaking of transcending, at that time, all I did was cry.

109
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,950
I haven't properly thanked you yet.

110
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:10,420
Zhe Yan told me that you cut your heart to obtain blood for me for a full 70,000 years.

111
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,850
Is this true?

112
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,550
Your kindness towards me is deep like a mountain.

113
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,410
Even if I used my life in exchange for yours, I wouldn't complain.

114
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:27,090
Using the mere blood in my heart to preserve your body, I feel that it was worth it.

115
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:40,300
If I didn't use my soul as a sacrifice for the Donghuang Bell,

116
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,760
would you still have remained in Kunlun Void until now?

117
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,490
Of course.

118
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,920
I originally wanted to stay in Kunlun Void for a long time.

119
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,750
Stay in Kunlun Void for a long time?

120
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,480
I'll be honest with you.

121
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,220
When that farce between Li Jing and me caused me to be heartbroken,

122
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,940
I wanted to remain for a long time in Kunlun Void.

123
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,800
I could have the freedom to accompany you to study the Way of Tao.

124
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,100
That would have been good.

125
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,140
As a woman, you would marry sooner or later.

126
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,950
Even if you wanted to stay, your parents would have objected.

127
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,110
At that time, I didn't know Ye Hua.

128
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,620
I didn't have any thoughts of wanting to be with someone forever.

129
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,870
That's right.

130
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,630
Ye Hua wasn't around then.

131
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,330
Seventeenth,

132
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:49,320
do you know why, for 70,000 years, I have been restoring my spirit without taking any breaks?

133
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,960
I know.

134
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,560
Zhe Yan said that you never disappoint those who are close to you.

135
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,000
On the bank of Ruoshui, you told us that you would return.

136
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,190
Then, we knew you would definitely be back.

137
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,500
You have suffered on our behalf.

138
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,810
I have never let down those who are close to me.

139
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,280
That's right.

140
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,720
I definitely did it for the one closest to me.

141
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,130
I know that you value each and every single one of us.

142
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:51,300
I remember we were also like this when you saved me from the Grand Purple Palace.

143
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,230
It's so nice.

144
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,990
You're finally back.

145
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,320
Yes.

146
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,960
I'm back.

147
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,710
Seventeenth, there's a guest for you. Hurry!

148
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,620
- Guest?
- Yes.

149
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,250
Teacher, you should come, too.

150
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,040
Let's go together.

151
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,940
This kid is so cute.

152
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,600
This little kid looks handsome.

153
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,200
Who's the guest?

154
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,300
- Teacher.
- Teacher.

155
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,740
Mother!

156
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,040
Why are you here?

157
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,370
Come, greet my teacher, High God Mo Yuan.

158
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,900
Greetings, High God Mo Yuan.

159
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,270
You may stand.

160
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,890
Thank you, High God.

161
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:17,700
On behalf of my father, I was supposed come with Emperor Dong Hua to pay homage to High God Mo Yuan,

162
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,900
but Emperor Dong Hua ran into a situation and temporarily lost his divine power.

163
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,960
Thus, I could only come alone.

164
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,270
Your father is?

165
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,000
Crown Prince Ye Hua of Nine Heavens.

166
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,840
He's... He's my future husband.

167
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:45,690
Ah Li, your father is my teacher's twin younger brother, Father God's son.

168
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,170
Because of a big battle, his spirit went into a deep sleep.

169
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,190
Then, he transformed into a golden lotus and had always been in the lotus pond here.

170
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,970
Subsequently, by coincidence, he became the Crown Prince Ye Hua.

171
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,870
Father is your teacher's younger brother?

172
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:07,500
Then, do I call High God Mo Yuan my uncle or my great grandmaster?

173
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,060
He seems much older than you.

174
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,920
Why not ask your father when he comes back?

175
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,770
Okay.

176
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,360
Who knew you have such a big child when you're not even married yet.

177
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,760
Seventeenth, you really make me see you in a new light.

178
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,740
Good. Good. Seventeenth is really ahead of us.

179
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,140
She's definitely the first among us to have a direct descendant.

180
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,470
- Yes. Yes.
- Look at Eldest Senior Brother, he's still alone.

181
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,640
Don't you feel embarrassed?

182
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,890
Teacher is unmarried, too. Why are you mentioning me?

183
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,660
Don't scare our Mochi.

184
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,600
- Go play.
- Interesting. Cute.

185
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,190
Come, come!

186
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,690
You're so cute!

187
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,170
Look at this face.

188
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,030
It's snowing. Don't you want to see?

189
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,170
Little Bookworm, I will tell you a secret.

190
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,680
My mother told me that your father proposed marriage to my family.

191
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,320
How dare you! I'll go reject the marriage right now.

192
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,160
You can't! I want to marry you!

193
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,430
You have this with you every day. Who gave you this?!

194
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,420
- Give it back! Give it back!
- No! No!

195
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,340
- Give it back!
- No!

196
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,700
- Give it back!
- No!

197
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,740
- Give it!
- Young Master, what's wrong?

198
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,560
Give it back!

199
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,600
Ye Hua, come back right now!

200
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,090
Miss, why are you like this?

201
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,540
Who is Ye Hua?

202
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,190
How could you talk to Young Master like this?

203
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,270
With Young Master's temper, even Old Master and Madam cede to him.

204
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,330
How could you take his beads?

205
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,040
That's the last thing you should touch!

206
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,630
It's his life!

207
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,730
Who gave it to him? Tell me!

208
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,880
I don't know, either.

209
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,290
I just know it has to do with Green Hill.

210
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,910
Green Hill?

211
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,700
Young Master has been flipping through countless ancient books and can't find that place.

212
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,630
If you know, you must tell him.

213
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,090
He will definitely be overjoyed.

214
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,400
I know. Of course, I know.

215
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,550
Really? Then you should tell him.

216
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,200
He'll be grateful to you.

217
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,600
No, I won't! I'll never tell him what Green Hill is!

218
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,860
Your Highness, does it hurt?

219
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,990
Your Highness, take a break.

220
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,400
You have been carving this for two days.

221
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,460
If you keep carving this, I fear you will go blind.

222
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,660
No.

223
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:04,030
If I don't finish this on time, it will be too late.

224
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,990
Xin Nu, look at this.

225
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:23,270
Does this wooden figure look like that mortal Su Su?

226
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,500
Your Highness.

227
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,820
I'm asking you.

228
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,770
Does it look like her or not?

229
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,540
It's...

230
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,440
It's about seventy percent in resemblance.

231
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,360
It must be at least ninety percent in resemblance so that it can be hidden from Mighty Monarch.

232
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,270
Young Highness, ever since you've come back, you haven't eaten or slept.

233
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,280
You've just been crying. You will be the death of me.

234
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,310
What are you talking about?

235
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,580
Aunt doesn't even care for me anymore.

236
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,610
Young Highness, I watched you grow up, too.

237
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,450
If you want me to say, whoever you like or dislike, isn't it up to you?

238
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,950
So, what if you take over as the monarchess?

239
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,570
What does it have to do with your liking Emperor Dong Hua?

240
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,560
You don't understand. If I became the monarchess of Green Hill, I can only stay here.

241
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,150
- Who said so?
- Is it not true?!

242
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,790
If Aunt marries Crown Prince Ye Hua, she can't be the monarchess anymore.

243
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,240
She must marry into Nine Heavens.

244
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,870
Of course not.

245
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,410
You are clueless.

246
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,540
You are the clueless one instead. I say, Young Highness.

247
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,660
Why does Great Lady want to marry into the Heavenly Tribe?

248
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,270
It's because Ye Hua is the future Heavenly Monarch, the future ruler.

249
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,230
So she has to leave Green Hill and marry into the tribe

250
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,730
because she'll become the Heavenly Consort, right?

251
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,200
Yes.

252
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,310
But who is Emperor Dong Hua?

253
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,360
He is the past ruler.

254
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,290
He's already retired.

255
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:27,780
If he goes somewhere or stays in Heaven, who cares where he goes? What do you say?

256
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,130
Yeah.

257
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:34,940
So... what if you become the monarchess of Green Hill?

258
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,560
This is not the same thing at all.

259
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,980
In my opinion, it's better if you become the monarchess.

260
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,660
As the monarchess of Green Hill, there'll be more chances to meet him at the tribe meetings in Nine Heavens.

261
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:54,650
By then, you will be standing at the west and emperor will be sitting at the east.

262
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:59,860
Getting along every day, and after a while... you'll have it all!

263
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,580
You're right.

264
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:07,320
In my eyes, you two just need time.

265
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,730
How long have you two known each other for?

266
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,810
He fell in love with you in the Mortal Realm, right?

267
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:19,360
If more time passes, how can the emperor not fall in love with you?

268
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,560
That's right!

269
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,140
Quick, Mi Gu. Stop delaying.

270
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,830
Bring the classics on the ceremony for the monarchess of Green Hill.

271
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,410
I want to look at it now.

272
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,280
This is my Young Highness. Wait here.

273
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,810
I'm going to the cellar to get them for you.

274
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,120
Young Highness, you have been reading the whole night.

275
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,940
Why don't you take a break?

276
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,290
Aunt will be marrying the crown prince soon.

277
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,670
I can't delay any further.

278
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,560
The earlier I look at this, the earlier I can ascend the throne.

279
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,440
So, I can go to Nine Heavens for the meetings earlier.

280
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,170
Why so little?

281
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,040
These are only a small part.

282
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,590
These are the past guides of Green Hill.

283
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,040
Take a look at these first. As for the rest, they have been thrown into the cellar by Aunt.

284
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,210
Some are damp. I'm going to dry them.

285
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,110
Si Ming.

286
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,560
I heard you are going to take over the post of the monarchess
of Green Hill.

287
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,140
I'm here to offer a humble gift.

288
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,430
What gift?

289
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:56,140
I flipped through the historical records of the Heavenly Tribe and found something interesting.

290
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,320
Thus, I rushed here to present this to you.

291
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,000
More historical records again?

292
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,630
This historical record is not just a historical record.

293
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:11,460
It holds the records of when the emperor was the co-owner of Heaven.

294
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:18,310
It might be of use to you.

295
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,560
A record of Dong Hua?

296
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:46,010
Is everything that's written in this historical record true?

297
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,320
Of course, it's true.

298
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,410
No wonder...

299
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,070
No wonder Aunt advised me to give him up, too.

300
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:01,330
Are you letting me read this... to advise me, too?

301
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,720
I feel that you should know the truth.

302
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,930
The emperor isn't being cruel to you on purpose.

303
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:20,620
It's just that he made such a decision long before he met you.

304
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:30,170
Emperor is not without any feelings for you.

305
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:35,310
The tribulation he did was not to experience the life of mortals,

306
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,740
but it was to repay you with a period of marriage.

307
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,690
In the Heavenly Palace, his life is destined.

308
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,100
He can't be with you.

309
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:49,940
But he can use the tribulation as an excuse to be with you in the Mortal Realm and be against the heavens.

310
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,560
Although it was for a brief time,

311
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,760
what he felt for you was real.

312
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,150
This is the truth I want you to know.

313
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:06,310
The emperor went to the Mortal Realm for me?

314
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,750
That's right.

315
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,860
So, before His Highness the Crown Prince went to the Mortal Realm for tribulation,

316
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,110
he already sent you to guard Ruoshui and the Winged Realm?

317
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,810
That's right.

318
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,870
Mo Yuan just woke up and the Winged Realm is having movements.

319
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,420
Something might be happening soon.

320
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,500
Emperor.

321
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,530
I don't want to see you again.

322
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,760
Emperor! Emperor! What's wrong, Emperor?

323
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,450
With one fling, you used thirty percent of your divine power.

324
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,550
It was too quick and forceful.

325
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,170
Don't tell me what Si Ming said is true?

326
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:06,450
You lost your powers after going to the Mortal Realm?

327
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,600
Yes.

328
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,460
Why didn't you tell me?

329
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,630
It's not a big deal.

330
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,270
Why can't I make a big deal out of it?

331
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,550
For someone as powerful as you, if you lose your powers

332
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,740
and if you're in danger someday—

333
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,500
What kind of dangers can I face here?

334
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,360
Because I fixed the sixty years of life and death tribulation,

335
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,290
I returned to Heaven earlier and temporarily lost my divine power.

336
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:48,030
Do you know that even I can't go against the will of Heaven?

337
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,810
But I will be fine in two years or so.

338
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,350
I have clarified.

339
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,320
You can go back now.

340
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:09,370
Emperor, are you ignoring me because your name is not on the Three Lives Stone?

341
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:12,500
How did you know about this?

342
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,600
Did Zhe Yan or Mo Yuan tell you? Or perhaps, your father?

343
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,560
But he promised me that he would never tell you.

344
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,470
None of them.

345
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,150
It was Si Ming who found the historical records of the Heavenly Tribe.

346
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,790
Your data is recorded in there.

347
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:37,490
Is it true that you destroyed your predestined marriage in the Three Lives Stone?

348
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,940
Is there no room for maneuvering?

349
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,520
I don't believe it.

350
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,360
It useless even if you don't believe.

351
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,590
The Three Lives Stone is to determine all predestined marriages under the sun.

352
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,350
My name will never appear there.

353
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:04,640
Not only you, no one will have a predestined marriage with me.

354
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,150
I don't believe it.

355
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,800
Don't cause a bigger ruckus.

356
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,890
I don't believe your name is not on the Three Lives Stone.

357
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:35,130
Every one of my tails can be turned into a magical weapon according to our will.

358
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,280
I'm going to Three Lives Stone to carve your name on it.

359
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,720
At that time, Four Seas and Eight Wildernesses wars were constantly waged.

360
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,950
As the co-owner of Heaven,

361
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,900
Emperor established the laws of the immortals, and controlled the life and death of the six realms.

362
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,590
In order to make himself invulnerable,

363
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:41,390
he personally destroyed his name on the Three Lives Stone.

364
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:45,550
The Three Lives Stone is to set predestined marriages.

365
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,500
Without his name on that,

366
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,670
his predestined marriage will never appear in his lifetime.

367
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,230
Hence, no matter how long he lives,

368
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,980
he will always be single and alone.

369
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,000
It's not that he really doesn't have the seven emotions and six desires.

370
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,210
It's just that his name is not in the Three Lives Stone.

371
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:09,220
No matter what happens,

372
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,390
he will always have an ill-fated relationship.

373
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,650
Young Highness, do you know what an ill-fated relationship is?

374
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:21,590
It's just like what the both of you went through in the Mortal Realm.

375
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:26,640
The love between you and the emperor will never have a good ending.

Emperor Dong Hua.

379
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,110
Emperor Dong Hua, where is your name?

380
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,160
Where?

381
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,350
Bai Fengjiu.

382
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,720
It can't be.

383
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,320
It can't be.

384
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,330
How can this be?

385
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,840
It can't be.

386
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,840
How can this be?

387
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,230
I love Emperor Dong Hua.

388
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,190
Young Highness, listen to my advice.

389
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:54,570
If you are still obsessed with this and going against Heaven's will,

390
00:32:54,570 --> 00:33:00,310
it won't benefit you and the Emperor, either.

391
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:05,750
Your number of years of being together in the Mortal Realm is only just a few days of fate in Heaven.

392
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,880
This has caused him to lose his divine power.

393
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,520
Since it's only temporary,

394
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,000
in two years or so, he will recover his divine power.

395
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,520
But this is a warning.

396
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:30,920
If you are bent on being by his side, I wonder what kind of bad karma you and the emperor will have.

397
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,670

It's all because of Emperor Dong Hua.

Hurry and stop the pain!

The pain from cutting off the tail is extremely painful till the point of death.

468

I have already stopped the pain.

So what about the Three Lives Stone?

476
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,920
Emperor, you distinctly knew that you couldn't incur any love debt,

477
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,170
so you should've rejected her sooner.

478
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:58,240
Our tribe is the type to never give up.

479
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Whoever we identify with, we will never change our minds.

480
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,540
You made her fall for you,

481
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,740
then you tell her you can't be with her.

482
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,900
Are you trying to act out a show?

483
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,470
- I apologize.
- What's the point of apologizing now?!

484
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,190
Will you be able to bear her extreme pain of cutting off her tail?

485
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:23,980
Seventeenth, the emperor has his predicament, too.

486
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,550
Fine.

487
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,660
I'm done talking.

488
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,900
Enough, she is awake.

489
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,830
It's just that she's still in a state of confusion.

490
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,100
Go and see her now.

491
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,920
Aunt.

492
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,920
Guess who I'm seeing?

493
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,160
Emperor Dong Hua who's in your heart.

494
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,830
”Cold” by Aska Yang & Diamond Zhang

495
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,900
♫ The temperature gradually drops as night falls ♫

496
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,570
♫ Fallen blossoms become frost ♫

497
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:15,930
♫ In the distance, you are gazing out afar and exhausting the twilight hours ♫

498
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:25,120
♫ Without considering the difficulty of forgetting each other ♫

499
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,290
♫ Tender peach blossoms are cold ♫

500
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:34,700
♫ How could you bear to let go of so many uncertain hearts in the previous lifetime ♫

501
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:41,900
♫ And still show no pain, no yearning, and no signs that you were forced? ♫

502
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:48,020
♫ All are just illusions ♫

503
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:53,530
♫ During the cold night, my yearning for you runs as a river ♫

504
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:58,760
♫ And transforming into spring soil to nourish me ♫

505
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,190
♫ The fleeting years fill up my lover’s sleeve ♫

506
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:09,400
♫ Pieces of flowers and plants flow into the waters ♫

507
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,800
♫ The cold will of heaven dresses in glittering colors of flowers ♫

508
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,040
♫ And fall into the mortal realm to hurt my feelings ♫

509
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,890
♫ Calamities are easy to overcome, but trials of love are difficult to overcome ♫

510
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:32,100
♫ My depreciating heart still holds some hatred from
my previous life ♫

511
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,020
♫ The cold three lives and three worlds are as sudden
as a dream ♫

512
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:49,470
♫ The wind dries my tears in those instantaneous years ♫

513
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:53,830
♫ If we can no longer recognize our memories ♫

514
00:44:53,830 --> 00:45:00,080
♫ Then allow our love to rest deep within the dust ♫

515
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:05,420
♫ When will the cold ten miles of peach blossoms
bloom again? ♫

516
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,770
♫ I see a gust of wind under the tree again ♫

517
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:13,560
♫ Fallen blossoms are of love, flowing waters are of heartlessness ♫

518
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:22,270
♫ Don’t allow our past grudges, love, and hate to chill the innocence of the flower ♫

519
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:34,860
♫ My hope in this lifetime is to be with you ♫
